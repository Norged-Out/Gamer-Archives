[[Does anyone dislike reina at all]]


I find her gameplay fun, but I dislike her personality and design (mainly personality).


She's Heihachi but slightly less hot so i don't mind her one bit.
    If she had his hair then she would be hotter
        Well, >!her Devil form kind of does...!<
            Like barely. Its like saying kazumi and jun got the same hair. No mishima bald spot that lars is slowly getting.
                The bald spot is a later addition. Young Heihachi is canon.

Her hair isn't an exact match, though. It's like the Jin vs. Kazuya sweptback ducktail.
                    Lars is in his late 20's by T6 and he felt the wind breeze too much in TT2. Heihachi just is him. But reina and lars are not.
                        That same cutscene is prefaced with the notion that Devil powers prevent hairloss.
                        Lars catching strays for no reason
                            Couldn't even get the andrussy either.
                                Just L after L
                                Well his and alisa character episodes are shown to have a thing.

Besides reina is female so no bald spots
                    No, Heihachi WITHOUT a balls pot didn't exist until Tag 2. T1 and T2 had Young Heihachi with old Heihachi hair with black hair, this also includes flashbacks to the day Kaz got yeeted as a kid. #knowyourlore
            I'm glad you spoiler tagged that in a post that already reveals it.
    Doesn’t even have a giant white thong, tsk tsk
    All hail heihachi !
    BASED, Old man was just goated.
    Based
    People like you give me hope
    I get the funny joke but she plays absolutely nothing like heihachi. If anything Lidia would be the closest to her. Still not too similar though.
        They really could have both. Only the story mode need to care whether he's dead
        She does have a good few of the old man's moves so that's enough
            No, she has a good few moves that LOOK like heihachi moves but have entirely different properties and still have slightly different animations.
I like her design but I don’t like her devil form design. Evelynn from LoL lookin MF
    Lmao, old Eve. I remember now.
        lol even Riot knew that design should be changed
            I guess Riot got inspiration from Unknown with current Evelynn then
    Yeah it's not the slightest bit intimidating. At least it was just a post-credit so they can still work on it before she sees action
        Looks like a Sonic Villain or some shi
    Her devil form looks like a 90s hentai sex villain
        Yes, and?
            It’s an awesome combination, hentai, 90s, sex, villain, in that specific order.
            It’s funny and cool at the same time
        And Kaz looks like a 90s power ranger villain in his devil form. And not a good one either lmao
    devil may cry lookin mf
    They would probably change it up in the next game like they always do.
        I hope so, this looks underwhelming
    Sorry, but why does she has devil form again?
Thought she doesn’t have the devil gene?

Apologize if this is a dumb question but not sure where’s that’s explained.
        Officially, no one knows. It was left on a cliffhanger. But logically you can deduce that maybe she’s the only successful specimen Heihachi had experimenting on the Devil Gene. Second possibility is Heihachi having the luck with women as Taylor Swift’s luck with men, banged another woman with the devil gene. Azazel says he has a lot of “servants”. There are other clans/people with the devil gene. The Hachijous are one of many.

I find it interesting that Heihachi treated her really well that she actually misses him and wants to avenge him. Heihachi treats daughters better than sons. Heihachi also unofficially adopted Xiaoyu. He sent her to school, fed her, housed her gave her Panda as a pet and bodyguard. Xiaoyu affectionately calls Heihachi “grandpa”.
            Heihachi lied his ass off to look good, which everyone who didn't start with 7 has been saying all along. Remember, Heihachi, Scumbag supreme, told the Kazumi thing as a STORY to a reporter to make himself look goid. Basically, Heihachi being dishonest like he's been since T1.
                He can lie but Xiaoyu and Reina clearly loved him like a father. He really did treat them well .
                I dunno, Heihachi doing horrible things & becoming corrupt himself in order to destroy a great evil is fitting with the tragedy of the Mishima family.

   Both Kazuya & Jin were morally superior protagonists before their relentless desire for revenge pushed them to do horrible things.
                    Except he was horrible long before the Kazumi thing, dude buried hus dad alive under his house. Dude starved yo death. Also it's clearly that Heihachi WANTS the devil gene, that's literally why he did everything he did. He was jelly it skipped him.
                        I’m confused, I thought the Devil gene came through Kazumis blood & not through him? Goddamn retcons, hard to get the lore straight.

  I even forgot about Jinpachi.
                            Yeah, the Kazumi thing wasn't until 7. And even then, it was a story Heihachi told a reporter to look like a hero. Not a retcon, just Heihachi being his deceitful self. Heihachi is like Shang Tsung, don't buy the bs he spouts, he'll manipulate you.
                        The Devil Gene didn't skip him though. Jinpachi looks the way he does because he's literally a vengeful spirit back from the dead.
            Hrm, thanks for the explanation.
Guess we won’t know until later.
    The only thing I can see looking at her hair is Ludwig of the Koopa Kids from Mario.
    Looks more like claymore design to me 😂
    you like her design? it just screams cringe
        Why are you on a 2 month old post that screams cringe
I want her jacket
    I want her
        Bro will regret it once he realizes he put himself into the Mishima family drama
            Become the neutral butler and remain friendly with Jin
                T9 ending you probably are gonna be crawling out of a dormant volcano
                    Do I get my own EWGF?
                        The monkey paw side effect your children all have the heihachi hairline

*ALL of them*
                            So I can clown my kids if they start talking shit? Bet
                He could be Wang 2 and be chill
                    He will Wang for sure
            Bro wants to be the male equivalent of Jun 😭
            100% worth
        Do you want a kid who tries to kill you his entire life? Because that's how you get a kid that tries to kill you his entire life.
            Nah I’d sugarcoat it. Also I have made it one of my goals to break generational trauma.
                Bro unintentionally makes a small slip up and you get a brat version of Kaz because you didn't let him eat his favorite food on his favorite day
        To jacket off
    Same , it looks really good. Though I probably want Jin's jacket more
    I want to wear her like a jacket. No wait, that was Silence of the Lambs.
        Why? You wanna join in on the Mishima family drama. Its too much of a headache even for Lars.
    yeah, real talk, is there any place I can get it that's not a total bootleg or scam? I found so many listing via Google but they're all sketchy
    [I’ve been so tempted…](https://www.jacketsjunction.com/product/tekken-8-reina-mishima-jacket/)
        Literally no photo of the real thing they’re sending you so you have no way to know if it’s shitty looking or not, it’s just all in game shots
            Yeah that looks dodgy. 

Seems to be a mix of very angry and positive (fake?) reviews.
https://au.trustpilot.com/review/www.jacketsjunction.com
            Well good thing I didn’t pull the trigger on that 😅
        Fake u can prob find the real thing somewhere though.
        The voices are getting louder each day 😂😂”MUST GET THE JACKET” 
It would also be so cool because my hair is dyed purple
Funnily enough I'm the opposite to you, I really like her personality and design but her gameplay is really not for me.
    Same, would rather play Devil Jin or Kaz if I wanna take a break from Hwoarang and do some EWGF’s
    What do you dislike about her gameplay?
        I don't enjoy characters with a load of stances that much, I think Hwoarang is the only very stance heavy character I actually liked trying out. For everyone else, anything more than a crouch dash + a single mixup stance is just not fun to keep track of.
            She only has one other stance and all the buttons correspond the same(mid high low, etc) her stance stuff is not that complex and one of them is used rarely
                Think she has at least three stances. More if you count electrics
        Her strings are longer than my combos.
    I thought she played like a clone of Hei?
        Nope she may be his daughter but no she is not a clone of his in any kind
            Unless she is but without y dna
        All the characters are just inheritors of old ones. Reina inherited a lot from Lidia, Victor from Noctis, and Azucena from a couple of others, including Josie and Katarina etc.
        Obviously not when she has tons of stances.
        LOL noooooo
The only thing I don’t like is that she has the Devil Gene. I feel like the fight between Angel Jin and Devil Kazuya up in space would have been way more impactful if she just didn’t have it at all.
    Unlikely azazel gave other people the devil gene
        That begets the question where the hell were/are the rest of them during the events of the Tekken story?!
Her moves are cool but i dont particularly like her "devil form" look & i dunno theres something about her attitude that annoys me alittle. Other than that shes really cool like her normal design is cool and her jacket etc.
    Same
    I find her attitude annoying as well
        Would you rather she be like every other tekken girl thats just calm and nice? With the occasional arrogance
            calm and nice? most of tekken women are sociopaths.
    Same, she annoys me by screeming and behaving like 15 y.o. overconfident edgy meme lord... -ish
        >Same, she annoys me by screeming and behaving like 15 y.o. overconfident edgy meme lord... -ish

Overconfident edgy meme lord AKA mishima
I actually think her personality is the best thing about her.
    It's nice to finally have a bad girl in Tekken
        Nina? Anna? Kunimitsu 1 & 2? They literally kill people for money for a living.
            Tbh kunimitsu 2 is more on the cute side even if she kills for money
            Not Nina or Anna are aggresive.

And Kuni? This addorable little girl?
                2 out of 8089 characters bravo lol
    Know ur place and the throne is the reason I play her

Also voice actor is god tier
I was iffy on her until her trailer dropped and I saw that rage art victory pose. I understand the hype
She herself is cool but the concept is lame. I was half expecting her to be revealed as a Bosconovich-made vessel for Heihachis soul or something. I cringed at her being yet another mishima with a devil gene. It undermines the 'jin killing all the devils' theme of Tekken 8.
    I'm kind of confused about how she got the gene. Like kazumi died ages ago and reina is younger than jin. Idk hoping we get a dlc story
        My bet is on her being the result of Hei experimenting with the devil gene.

If there was something Hei loved other than martial arts was making kids and conducting insane human/animal experiments.
            But he hated the devil gene.
                He hated it because he didn't have it and he couldn't control it. Behind the scenes he was messing with Ogre's blood in an attempt to understand it better.
                    damn...ogre reina would've been a cool twist on the idea
                        Actually , yeah , it would been really cool, considering that jun is back , having to deal with the threat from a Reina Ogre would be interesting
        It probably wont be explained in detail. Im sure shes not Kazumis kid though.
            She might be kazumi kid she has the resemblance
                Timeline doesn't work. Reina is in her early 20s at the oldest. She would have to be in her 40s to be Kazumi's daughter.
                    she wouldn't be the first lady heihachi put on ice for a while
                    probably shoved into cryogenics like the Williams sisters to stop the Devil gene manifesting or something if they wanna justify her being Kazumi's daughter. Or old man Heihachi had the sex somewhen after Tekken 2.
        Inb4 Heihachi is the actual progenitor of the devil gene. Only Devil Lars can stop Devil Reina now.
            Didn't you know? When Nina was frozen they made a second Steve but infused with the super secret Angel gene sauce as a research experiment in a bunker 1500 meters below Borneo. It was Heihachi's real trump card!
                Oh the 2nd Steve, I sure hope he turns out less disappointing that the 1st Steve, that was sidelined to join the newly comedic DUO of Law and Paul.
        Reina doesn't seem to be Kazumi's daughter cause of the age difference with her looking younger than Jin, thou we will find out more in future games cause she has the Devil now which is weird. She idolizes Heihachi but gains the very power he wanted to destroy lol
            He wanted to have the power to destroy it, and the power of it. His intentions weren't noble. He wanted what Kazuya obtained.
        It has nothing to do with kazumi. She noticed in the story in the fight with jin that you need a near death experience to activate the devil powers. They also confirmed that azazel is the origin of all the devil gene. So when kazuya hit her with the big laser beam she experienced  a near death experience and got a good chunk of azazels demon powers. So no kazumi or experiences involved.
        weren't anna and nina in cryosleep for a while

could be the same deal here
        Azazel gave the gene to its servants. So there might be another clan with the gene aside from the Hachijos.

Either Heihachi got lucky with another woman belonging to a family with the devil gene, or Reina is a lab baby as the other have previously said.
        Maybe she's not Heihachi's kid, despite her believing so. Maybe it's Kasumi's sibling or something and Heihachi just made her believe she was his.
        He lied, simple, the whole T7 flashback contradicted literally every game story before 7. He lied, not the first time either.
    Tbh, Heihachi having a secret daughter is in-line with the Tekken story line. This happened before with Lars too. Tekken in the forefront is all about the Mishima feud.
        Harada confirmed he has at least 26 mystery kids
            You only find out he's your dad once the male pattern baldness reveals it
                It's probably worse if you notice lightning when you punch someone
    > It undermines the 'jin killing all the devils' theme of Tekken 8.

He can't kill devils. Azzazel will resurect again, sooner or latter. Or create another servants. Devils are fundamental part of Tekken world.
Yes. I like her fighting style, but I don't like her personality. And Devil Form is dog shit.
She’s cool, fun to play, and hot what more can you ask for ?????
    Hipsters want her to be lame, not fun to play, and not hot, because being cool, fun, and hot is too mainstream.
    To not be a randy who comes out of nowhere to undermine the story.
        They needed to set up T9 somehow, now that Kaz is possibly dead
            No he's not lol
                It was left open-ended. He didn't twitch or even move a finger, so they are free to take the story wherever they want when t9 comes out (in 7 to 10 years)
                    There is literally no dialogue indicating that he's dead, the entire point was to remove the Devil's blood, Jin didn't want to kill him by the end of the game
            You can set it up without making a character that blueballs me lol
I like her but it feels like she doesn’t have much of an identity beyond “heihachi’s daughter”. I also don’t like that she has a devil form. Jin’s whole goal was to get rid of that and I feel like she undermines the plot with that. It sounded cool at first but the more I thought about it, the less I agreed with the idea

Beyond that she’s cool. I feel the best way for her to be a spiritual successor to Heihachi would be to become this extremely powerful force entirely on her own without devil stuff. I’d also appreciate if they just had Heihachi playable even if he’s not canonically alive like they did with Kazumi
Absolutely. Since minute 1 of her reveal. It's giving generic edgy anime character bs.  A one-dimensional type character that is basically popular due to her relationship to Mishimas. 


>!Reina having the devil gene was going too far. It makes no sense.!<
I love everything about the character, the gameplay, the personality, the intros and outros, her combos, her grabs, you can tell they put a lot of love into creating her
Technique: awesome.

Personality: not a fan at all
I don’y think she looks cool like alot of people say, i think she looks generic anime emo girl. Gameplat wise looks neat
If you speak japanese, you'll hate her because she is so cringe lmao

I hate her everytime she win, not because i lose, because her line and demeanor is so bad.
    I like her demeanor. She gives of Tsundere vibes.
I don't. Love her to bits.
    Same she awesome
I see her and think of a stupid edgy kid trying to kill herself for her story arc.

Leroy says it best, “You’re dumb.”
    She wasn't trying to kill herself. She was trying to awaken her devil gene after she learned that Jin's awakens when his life is in danger. She was getting annoyed because Heihachi's genes made her super tough so the stupid gene kept being like "Nope! You're alright. You're not in danger." and refusing to awaken.
        Still dumb
    lol was that in story mode or where was that at?
        He says that in his Tekken 7 rage art (although I’m pretty sure he says “You’re done” and not “You’re dumb”)
            Yeh, the subtitles says "You're done," but I hear "you're dumb," all the time. Same with his T8 rage art, I hear "black steel" instead of "like steel"😅
    I took it more as maybe she had not activated her full devil gene and didn’t know how. 

Pretty sure when Jin is under threat from her and his starts showing again she says something like “ah that’s how it works” then she proceeds to be a bit suicidal in order to activate her devil. I could be wrong and forgot something else.
    I was hoping she'd believe she was strong enough to beat Kazuya because of how much she worships her Mishima blood and gets killed after going all out defending her father's honor. But instead she just pulls a stupid Vegeta, "shoot me and I'll somehow get stronger", plan.
        >I was hoping she'd believe she was strong enough to beat Kazuya because of how much she worships her Mishima blood and gets killed after going all out defending her father's honor. 

Why introduce a Mishima just to kill them? You played yourself brother/sister.
            Not dead, dead. Presumed dead like how the story had it. Then the twist ending thing happens anyway.
    Agreed.
I hate her personality and design why they gotta replace the goat with some valorant streamer with 20 views
    Damn, keep spittin' chief
Her smirk has more personality than 10 games of Nina Williams
    That's why we prefer anna😂
        Sadly Anna has been low tier in every game she's been in. Nina has been top tier in many games.
I don't dislike her, but I don't really care about her either.
Devil form’s gotta go bruh I was with her all the way til that scene
She's whatever tbh
Man a spoiler tag would have been REALLY nice
    what's your excuse for not seeing the story already? If you don't own t8 just watch it on youtube
        It hasnt even been a month with the game wth? I haven't even touched the story yet because ive been in between practicing and ranked matches
            in what universe does it take you a month to get around to watching a 3 hour movie if you care about spoilers? That's like a single lord of the rings film
        some people have jobs, NEET spotted
            damn straight fuck capitalism
                mommy cant pay for all of us can she
        >what's your excuse for not seeing the story already?

Time.
        Life has a habit of getting in the way. What's the excuse for not clicking a spoiler check box for a week old game?
She's fucking annoying
Where is that active volcano when you need it...
I enjoy her play style, I like her design (not the devil form, we get it she’s a girl so she has to be a sexy devil, groundbreaking…) and I like the sort of outwardly bubbly but sinister personality she has. 

My main complaint is that her role in the story felt random and unnecessary. Also her magically becoming a devil as a sequel setup lessens the impact of the ending. Jin destroying the devil was interesting because it provided an opportunity to bring the stakes of the franchise back down to a more human level. But instead, we have the same devil problem we had before, just with a character we aren’t as invested in.
To me she's like a chuunibyou character but with none of the awareness that makes those types of characters fun, she's meant to be taken completely seriously while spouting the usual edgelord stuff that archetype is known for.
I do... She's too cringey to me with all that bow down to me obsession and trying to act like a weeb imitating an anime character
    I think she just seems like an inexperienced wannabe Kazuya. Like Kazuya's been thrown off cliffs and done some throwing himself, the arrogance is acceptable and even makes him cool. But this bitch has nothing to back it, it's just cringy wannabe Kazuya.
        Lmao yes that’s the best description of this character. 

“Dollar store Kazuya”
        Nothing to back it? Shows up out of nowhere and full on fucking headbutts and beats up TRUE DEVIL KAZUYA
            She didn't beat him up what are you on about? She caused some mild inconvenience at best. Her "beat him up" has the same energy as Jin "beat him up" in the first chapter, if Kazuya really wanted to he could finished the fight in a second.
                Yeah you’re probably right I only remembered it that way because as the player you’re supposed to win the fight I forgot about after lol, but still to say she has nothing to back it up I think is wrong.

What mug downvoted me your dad is 44 and still ringing man for a draw
            Sure, Lars fought TDK as well but he's still some random Swedish twink
            She beat him up?
    how i felt since watching the trailer, can’t put my finger on why she just makes me cringe
    I don't get the weeb/anime thing. I mean, she's just being Japanese.
        Most Japan people don't act like that
            Yeah so make her bland as fuck and hear people complain that she has no personality, so it fits most human being's personnality
    Like every other Tekken character?
        Not really... For example remember in the Hwoarang/ Steve into everyone says Hwoarang sounds like a normal person and Steve sounds very weird like a toddler wrote the script... Everyone has personality but reina feels like she just tries to imitate a cool anime character... She is especially cringy in her win pose where she looks back over her shoulder in a weird way
            The entire story mode is weeb af
I hate her personality, she thinks she's the shit and she hasn't done anything noteworthy. She hasn't earned the right to he as cocky as she is. Also her being shoehorned in as another devil is fucking annoying. We really didn't need that unnecessary detail added to her.
    Unlikely she is here to stay
I was kinda ok until I saw her devil form, then I started disliking her
yes typical anime girl character
Yeah I never got the appeal for her character. 

Mid as fuck design and the only thing that carries her is the voice actor. Even she comes across as this edgy, wannabe tough-girl brat rather than the “dommy mommy” a lot of people say. 

The best description of her is she is basically dollar-store Kazuya. Talks all the smack but seemingly has nothing to back it up (apart from being a Mishima). They couldn’t have given her a better design at least to match the voice? 
I know some people are into this, where the characters look cute but she’s super strong, but I would rather she at least looked like Lidia. A bit tall, buff and… you know… physically strong rather than a 15-year-old. 

Also, the fact that she is ANOTHER one of Heihachi’s child with the devil gene is so contrived and bs. I mean, I know Tekken “writers” lacked creativity but really? This is the best thing they could come up with? It feels like her sole purpose was to simply act as a plot device to continue the devil gene story.
    well said. one look at the artwork/screenshot section on steam (T8) pretty much tells the story. I am still mad that now i lost the only electric character i had fun playing with.
    She is 19-20 bro
        I know. My point still stands. She LOOKS like a kid.
            Nah she doesn’t bro get use to how she looks and set her up for future games. Jin and kazuya’s roles are done so she is gonna be a focal character going foward
                What are you on about? OP asked if anyone else dislikes Reina and I’m simply responding to that. You can get “used to” something but still think something look like shit. Yeah, I will care less and less about Reina’s design and personality as time goes on, doesn’t mean I’m gonna think it’s not shit. 

This conversation isn’t even about Jin and Kazuya so idk why you dragged them into this. 

Maybe stop getting touchy cos a bunch of people dislike your “waifu” and go enjoy maining her instead?
                    I already played tekken 8 bro
        She's actually a highschooler
            19 is still in high school
    > Mid as fuck design and the only thing that carries her is the voice actor. Even she comes across as this edgy, wannabe tough-girl brat rather than the “dommy mommy” a lot of people say.

Harada said they made her 'mid as fuck' intentionally. But well he is too old and out of loop to know fetishes of modern anime community.
        Yeah I’m aware of this. I’m not saying make her dress like a slut, but something that actually looks authoritative and badass. I already mentioned Lidia was a design I actually liked.
Big dislike here.

Just a terribly conceived, over-the-top, evil mustache-twirling major character randomly plugged into the main story (we've already done the "a powerful Heihachi kid outta nowhere" gimmick in Tekken 6 with Lars, so she's not even the first to do it) and she greatly appeals to the lowest common denominator.

It's hard to see the "sex appeal" everyone is talking apart when she looks like a twig-limbed little girl doing bruiser moves while yelling. Also, nice dog collar.
    she looks like a joke character tbh
I don't like her visual design but I think her gameplay design is great. She would have been cooler if she was more rugged and badass IMO.
    Just some muscle would already help but she has nothing. Twig arms. Also where my abs at. Heihachi's kid gotta be a gym rat. Failing her father big time.
    Agree. I would've wished for a distinguished middle aged, weathered, badass woman - who is built like someone worthy to be Heihachi's successor, Kazuya's sister, Jin's aunt - >!and host/conqueror of the devil gene!<

A female that actually looks like what she personifies: strenght and domination. A true Mishima, experienced and with an iron body, and not... well, *yet* another cliche cutesy schoolgirl: in apperance, in behaviour (faking her personality even instead of embracing it and becoming a true heiress of Heihachi's way), as well as in age. 

Still hoping they some day get the courage to make a female character that actually looks like a trained fighter (and then even exaggerate it like they do with the male cast). Someone who can not only behave like they stand eye to eye to the male cast in strenght and experience, but also look the part.

Her moveset is extremely cool and convincing, an evolution of Heihachi's rushdown legacy with even more depth and freedom of expression without becoming another allround-character - kudos to the gameplay design department. Her voice actress is doing an oustanding job as well, I just wish the lines were a little different.
        >Agree. I would've wished for a distinguished middle aged, weathered, badass woman - who is built like someone worthy to be Heihachi's successor, Kazuya's sister, Jin's aunt - and host/conqueror of the devil gene

This so much.  I totally forgot that technically Reina is Jin's aunt and it's like are you freaking serious with how young they made her look? I agree, would've been a tad better sell if they had her be an older, badass woman. I'm getting so tired of Tekken's blatant sexism of having all these old male characters but won't give us an older female character (who actually looks it).
        They already made Lidia, who is not in 8 unfortunately
        Unlikely 
        They explicitly said her theme is duality, so I think the decision to make her cutesy-looking was deliberate. Even then, I think they could do a lot better than "generic anime girl". The least they could do was give her a Mishima hair...
    Or if she needed to have the "cutesy anime girl" look. Make her come off as a dweeb instead.
I don't like the design of her too much. She could've looked way cooler than just another gamer
    Yeh, she really looked like just some cosplayer or gamer. Doesn't really scream "mishima" to me
        Exactly, she looks like a generic npc, bamco doesnt have creativity anymore
            Heihachi was literally just an old man in a gi. Kazuya was the same but shirtless. You think those were creative?
                They are badass characters with simple designs unlike her, shes whatever
                    You can just say you dont like women
                        You wish, I like Zafina Jun and Julia so stop with the bs
                        Aahh yaa im biggest mf misogynist in the world for criticizing Kardashians
    Her design is to appeal gen z mofos, I dont like it at all
    She look like Fortnite gamer being a fortnight character. Hate design
yes i hate her
I hate her demon underwear and boots. jin and kazuya either had clothing or were full nude
Her Devil design is wack as hell but other than that I fw her
Love her moveset but it looks like she came out of a mobile game and it's strange to see so many people saying she has top character design.
















Still way better than Azucena tho.
    Fr, the most 5/10 I've seen!
Only her personality is where she tries to be as antagonistic towards Jin for no reason.
    She has a reason. She's trying to figure out how he awakens his devil gene so that she can awaken hers.
        In a hostile manner, as if she had a blood feud with him like she did with Kazuya.
    >for no reason 

???? The whole point was to find out how to tap into the Devil Gene. She stops being antagonistic as soon as she doesn’t need to fight him. 
As i said a couple times, i hate her, her personality annoys me, her story felt cheap at best, and people are down bad for her(why, just go to a therapist over your mommy issues)
    How about you?
        Nigga shut up and stop defending this character
            Don’t tell me what to do bro
                I do as I please, not as I'm told, scum.
                    Your scum bro telling me what to do in a rude way
Nerds love her
A lot of people dislike her... but the amount that really like her greatly outnumber them, so they get boo'd out of town.
    I see more people disliking her
I just wish Tekken wasn't afraid of designing female characters with some muscle. She's a Mishima and has that "bow down to me" personality but can't even have some defined deltoids 😭
    They made Lidia. She was strong but realistic. She lasted like 20% of one tekken game.
        she's barely muscular lol. I also frankly don't care about "realistic" muscles in a game where Feng Wei exists
            From body type alone almost all characters would be on steroids, so it would make sense if the women were as well.
    We need a marisa like character in tekken🙏
Her counter hit stomach kick thing is the most annoying thing ever and it seems every reina player is spamming it so I really hate her atm lol
I'm not "wowed" by her presence or design but I do think out the three newcomers of Tekken 8, she's the most interesting (and I say "interesting" loosely). Victor's design does nothing for me and the sword is just overkill and Azucena, while she does have a slightly more interesting design, I can't stand her one-note "coffee" shtick so that's why I have to go with Reina though it's not with enthusiasm.

I think the reason why Reina doens't do much for me aside from simply not being into heavy "anime" designs, it's also because she just feels like Asuka but "evil" and in a coat of purple with an apathetic personality. I also didn't like how they practically shoehorned her into the center of the story so quickly. I really think we needed more time to let her unravel on the side and she should've met Claudio and Xiaoyu first, letting us get a feel of her character before they had her fight Jin and then carry on as is. 

Her fighting style is somewhat okay but overall, I can't say I'm a "fan" of hers and I feel like this time around, the new characters introduced didn't really "hit" for me personally but tbf, I felt that way about Tekken 7's newcomers as well and it wasn't until they released Leroy who was a newer character hwo I thought looked cool and felt like a "Tekken" character. So there's that lol.
She doesn't have the same oomph as heihachi and his moveset doesn't suit her. Not helped by the fact that she's so skinny the moment the wind blows shes gone
    She is fine bro heihachi is gone forever
No but she might be overrated
I think she's bland as fuck. As someone have pointed, she's "Juri at home".
I really like her design and personnality. I don’t like her gameplay tho, which is kinda weird as Heihachi was the only Mishima I thought about trying (I’m really not a fan of Mishimas gameplay and gameplan) and I especially hate to fight her. But I’ll add a hot take : as a replacement for Heihachi, it’s a huge downgrade
She comes across as cool at first but after hearing the same few intro's and supers repeatedly the anime trope of her voice getting deeper when she gets serious starts to get annoying quickly.
Oh unbelievably so. 

She comes out of nowhere with zero build up and suddenly I'm supposed to be invested. 

We know next to nothing about why she cares about Heihachi.

She for no good reason does her fake persona when Jin clearly sees through her nonsense. Which in retrospect makes her dumb. Why on earth did she think that would trick Jin?

She blue balls the climax from truly finishing the devil gene saga and once more perpetuates the Mishma bloodline as a major threat. 

It's so annoying and lame and I hate her. Easily one of the worst characters in the series who robs me from truly enjoying the story from beginning to end. I really hope when TK9 comes out she dies immediately.

Also her fans are predictably annoying with the whole dommy mommy thing.
I don't like her. She's a different type of cringe. Her little head tilt and her I'm better than you attitude is obnoxious.

Then again I find Azucena ok. Mainly because it's more self aware and humorous.
I don't really care for her. I played heihachi in 7 but won't play her in 8 for sure. I dislike her personality and overall design and probably won't bother with trying her out any time soon.
She's basically just an edgy teen, I saw too many people with the same exact personality as her, and they are cringe.
shes a fanfiction character with main character syndrome. the only thing giving her any validity for acting as such is the fact that she has devil blood, if not for that then shed just be an entitled chuuni
Her fake "UwU baka senpai" shit was so unnessary and pairing it with the "im the omega edge lord" has to be one of the worse combination
Her animations are sick, but personality wise people think that she is dommy-mommy, some kind of badass, mean bitch etc. But what she really is is a brat. And a Mary Sue at that tbh. She gets too much in too little amount of time. Her rise to power should be portrayed better because right now it's too convenient.
Yeah, I fcking hate her.
Not a fan of her design, in story mode she doesn't add anything, her moveset is the old reused assets meta from Tekken and that last scene from story mode is just cringe and forced (really bamco shes Jin aunt lmao she looks like Jin sister instead) pathetic tbh.
    I think her saying she's gonna avenge heihachi and turn into a devil kinda bothers me cos it seems like she doesn't know that much about him at all. Like if he was alive and saw that she has the devil gene, he would've killed her. Hoping we get a dlc story.
    Totally didn't realize that she really is supposed to be Jin's autn but he looks like his younger sister more than anything. It's absolutely ridiculous and they were better off just making her a different character that was not related to the Mishima.
If they didn't reveal her Devil form, I'd say she is perfect, but it kinda ruined for me
Hi my name is Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that's how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don't know who she is get da hell out of here!). I'm not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie. I'm a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I'm in the seventh year (I'm seventeen). I'm a goth (in case you couldn't tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.
    Tee hee
I think her visual design is highly overrated. A spunky Japanese girl with dyed hair is incredibly played out.

Gameplay wise, its pretty ambitious for a new character to have so much going on
She's trash and not fun to fight against
    And your not trying harder
Nah cuz I really love her gameplay but her personality is ass. Nothing is more embarrassing than Reina going "submit to me" and completely missing her rage art likeee 💀💀 also her yelling lowkey gives me a headache but still, as a former and mourning Kazumi main, I have fun with her.
NOPE. I am in love with her she’s awesome.
I dig the dommy mommy vibes. She can join the hot girls who can and will kill you squad.
Reina is fun to play but I find her whole personality so bland, generic, typical anime its almot too cringey. Her design (along with eddy’s killmonger redesign) is also proof that theyre creatively bankrupt by reinforcing that asian hair streak meme design which is again like eddy’s, been overdone in media.
Overall, reina just makes me wish we still had heihachi and/or lidia instead.  But gotta love with what you have..
I dislike the horny fans that's it. She's cool. Just wish she had a bit more muscle.
    Like Steve's ending muscular👀?
She’s a breath of fresh air in regard to female characters’ personalities in Tekken and I appreciate that. Her design looks cool, simple but effective. Her gameplay looks easy to pick up but endlessly difficult to master, so she seems fun for all skill levels which I think is good game design, especially for a new character they’re trying to push on the marketing side of things (I unfortunately don’t have the game yet), etc.

By far my least favourite part about her is her devil form. Devil Reina has extremely limited screen time cause it’s meant to be a shocking reveal, but looking at her model like this, without it being shrouded in shadow? 

It looks fucking ridiculous. 

Like with a lot of the modern devil designs, it’s overly detailed for no reason, but I can forgive that given that’s becoming the new normal. What’s worse is the crystal undies and titty fire, which look really silly. Overall, it screams googling “tekken female devil fanart” and clicking on the first result: making something generically ‘feminine’ instead of giving the design any actual personality. The only personality I can see is her hair being Heihachi-like and her having a lot of purple since that’s one of her colours, positives that are few and far between. Both Kazuya and Jin wear clothes with their devil forms regularly, why not design a similar devil form for her so she can keep her widely appreciated modern streetwear design? Having a devil in next-gen techwear sounds awesome and new but noOoOooOoOOooo, we want the titty fire.

It’s also responsible for her lacklustre contribution to T8’s story mode: she’s basically a set up character for T9 instead of actually being relevant to this story, which is a pretty big gamble to take. They’re betting T9 can explain Reina’s backstory, keep her in character, AND keep the devil interesting on the third go-around, after Kaz and Jin have already had their arcs with it (Tekken’s story has been historically hit or miss, let’s not forget that, even though T8 was largely a hit). It feels like they’re setting her up to be the new main villain when she isn’t ready yet: she’s a mystery character in this game, we don’t know enough about her to be that invested in her and yet they’re trying to make her fill KAZUYA’s shoes. If the devs really wanted Reina to have an evil form to be the next big boss, Jinpachi’s yet-to-be-explained dark power from T5 is sitting right there, complete with an ancestry link to Reina since Jinpachi is her grandfather. Making her yet another devil instead feels like a missed opportunity, less interesting in comparison.

Overall, very cool and had lots of potential, but story-wise I’m afraid I’m not hopeful. Seems like she’s being set up for failure and people will think it’s the character’s fault rather than the writers’ and how they handled her.
    It is fine bro that was the point jin and kazuya’s arcs are done her’s is beginning
I have a hard time believing her as a fighter. Her jacket and hair just looks like punk rock girl.

Her alternative costume is better.

Don't get me wrong. Her design isn't bad. There are other characters I dislike more (cough - Lars's hair) but hers is just meh for me.
I don't like that she's just another generic female character, they had a chance to make their own muscle mommy and they fumbled it. Gameplay seems fun though.
Why would anyone dislike her? She's the best new fighting game character in years.
    Best new fighting game character? Not really
Her devil transformation is over the top
Thanks for the spoiler
    Bro, you're in the Tekken sub. The game's been out for a week. Go finish the story mode or go watch it on YouTube.
        We don't all use our time in the same way, could've just put a spoiler tag.
            You can't change the world, fam. People will talk about the game in a group dedicated to the game. You can ask the entire world to change and hope for the best, or you can finish the story mode and/or watch it on YouTube.

Even in groups where mods have strict rules against spoilers for like a month after a TV episode people still post spoilers.

You know people will do it, so it's prudent to act in a way that accounts for it.
    Yea annoying
    The game has been out for over a week, and story mode takes less than 4 hours to complete. If you haven't finished the story by now while browsing hangouts dedicated to talking about the game, then that's on you.
She's the most likable Mishima.
    Lars bro
I want a story expansion around her.
You brave, brave soul. Her personality is pretty comical even by Tekken standards, but its fine. I just think the congruence of all 3 factors, which is her physical design, her voice and her personality don't mesh well *for me*. Pick a tougher sounding voice actress than a cute one trying to sound tough, and make her look a bit more rugged and tough. Or do the opposite and tweak her personality instead.

She didn't exactly get big competition in terms of 'new' characters, so naturally she's the most interesting of the bunch simply due to the Mishima connection. Overall, I'm not feeling it.
I feel exactly the same: her gameplay is not that bad but her design is really meh. Her personality is horrendous though ! She made me like Asuka somehow 😂
Wait......  is devil Reina gonna be a dlc?
    I don't think she will. I think she's gonna be what they did with jin in the story where it's only playable in story mode. I'm hoping for a dlc story instead of a sequel
She's seriously making me cosider her as the first Mishima I ever learn. Beside having her Electric, wavedash and so on, those stances and mix-ups look really fun to use. As for design and personality, hell, they know their audience and it shows.
Damn bro, spoilers
Shes coomer bait
No, she's my main so obviously I dont dislike her. I've been playing Mishimas since T6 but my main was always Steve, but now I would probably say im officially a Mishima main.

Main reasons I like her is the design #1. I always like the black/purple combination. My main in the other FG I play (SF) is Juri.

\#2 The personality and attitude. Personally, I think she's very charismatic. She got the trait from Heihachi. If you dislike the personality, I would probably say that you just dont like the edgy personality that the Mishimas always had. I always liked the IDGAF personality that Kazuya had. Reina sorta has that too.

\#3 Gameplay. Its no secret that my T7 main alongside Steve is Lidia. She got the general traits of Lidia + added Mishima style with the electrics etc. Its literally a char that was made for me that hit all my check marks I was looking for in a char.
Why did I spoil myself AAAAAHHHHH!!!!

Anyways, I initially liked her but now I just go , “She’s cool, I guess,” and hope that I at least like her in the story cuz T7 didn’t turn out that great.

Spoiled myself down more and read the disappointment. “Well, gang, looks like we have 20 more mainline games, 34 spin-offs, and one cash grabby Project X Zone gacha maker rhythm game to go!” 🥹🥹🥹

>!Also, her devil design reminds me of plastic. Monster High G2 doll looking ahh (I think some dolls are fine).!<

Wait wait wait…

Kumatora at home:
    What a stupid take
I want to be crushed between her tights while she insults me
Really, i kinda like her personality. But it think its mostly about my taste in women.
You would still bang her, right?
    Look. There were times when I was like "She still a bad bitch tho" but her personality I dislike it too much.
        Hate-fucking, I get it.
            Can't go wrong
I don't know how she somehow is just Heihachi with Devil form and how it canoningly could make sense...

 because Kazuya was the cursed child because of his mother whereas it would need a second mother that was in the cursed clan... Like I said IDK
    I was asking myself the same question at the end of the game. I asked myself she must not know much about heihachi. She's avenging a dead man who would kill her if he saw that she has the devil gene. Idk, hopefully they release a dlc story instead of a sequel
Eh she fought on the good side with secret intentions to unlock her devil gene. She’s hot tho 😂.
what do need to unlock Devil Reina?
I only dislike her because everyone and their Mother is playing her. Ranked is full of Reina. It feels like only Reina exist to fight against. Kinda annoying
I think in a game full of arrogant characters she fits in. Shes feels like an extroverted Jin attitude wise. Gameplay wise she seems gimicky, but havent trief her out.
Hi, i do. She looks cool but her playstyle and moveset is just not it. She is a *waifu* mishima.
Yeah me
I’m just mad we change transform into her devil form, I think either her heat mode or her rage mode should transform her with a new move set like an install character or at least an optional low health transformation.

Would’ve been cool
She's kinda boring to fight against but otherwise I'm cool with her.
Nah she's dope I don't play her but she cool
Can't relate. Love her personality, her design, and play style.
edgy in an annoying way, dvj was already peak “so edgy it’s almost cool”
shes like quicker and faster move execution heihachi with few upgrades. whats to hate? the fact you cant read her moves and defend? come on man. git gud
I dunno about her gameplay as a beginner player, seems pretty complex to me. 

I LOVE the design, voice actor and personality though, they absolutely hit it out of the park with her and I'm not surprised she's the most popular character in online play right now. Simple but striking, not overdesigned and of my god THAT SMUG SMILE! <3
I like her play style and design, but I also wish she had more muscle or at least sum cake
We need more yandere. Tired of cute girls.

If people want more generic cute girls they can go play DOA6.
Yea her moves are fucking crazy , but she’s too much of a walking stereotype, even for a Tekken character lol
    Naa azucena takes that crown. She's so fucking corny
        Azucena is an amalgamation of all the toxic new T7 female characters that got left behind yuck.
        Yea you’re right lmao. Her design is super clean though
I do. Just to go against this post
She reminds me of Azula from Last Airbender - so yeah love her as a character. I’ve also had some of my fav battles against her so far.
Reina is literally heihachi she's broken
She’s an icon, she’s a legend, and she is the moment.
I think she shouldve had a different body type, the same copy paster waifu body doesn't fit her, she's a mishima, where's the muscle?

But aside from that, she's cool
love playing her, hate her character and her devil form.
Same. Idk, she felt like the usual antagonist with the arrogant and prideful attitude but would fail every single time.
Man I just don't like her tbh.
Her devil form is really stupid. Otherwise she's my main and I love her.
Oldman is better.
Spoiler tag?
I don't mind her but there's something about her Devil form I don't really like.
Where did you get those devil shots? Also should probably add a spoiler
She’s just boring tbh literally thrown in there just so they have a story for tekken 9
The one thing I dislike about her is the hairstyle.
I'm a Reina hater as a Heihachi player. Would rather just have my grumpy old man back.
I actually find her face very smug and punchable for some reason
I wished she had more presence in the story but it seems like they made her after they were done writing the script and edited her in as some half-baked concept.
She is super basic, boring, absolutely not special. On of my least favorite characters.
Her design is one of the worst.
I dislike the way the script use her just to create a tekken9, as character she is pretty normal
The devil form would have looked better if she had the black/red skin armor (?) all over. This just looks like a 2005 sexy demon world of warcraft design or some shit.
I like her a lot more in her other costume. Or a bunch of customized ones I've seen from people with different hair and stuff.
It helps that she's hot
I don’t like her. Her fighting style nor personality. Edgy, loud, purple, and does too much hand waving similar to Lidia. But Lidia was likeable
Eh...worse thng I can say about her?

She seems a bit unoriginal....in that she is kind of another Asuka only "EDGIER"!

With her behaviour I'd swear she was some reincarnation of Heihachi and not merely his daughter.
Not super cool to include that second pic without warning. I already finished the story but I’m sure manyyy haven’t by now.
I dislike that we didn't get to see a 10 hour seggs scene with her.
Well you’re free to dislike Reina’s personality and design all you want. But that doesn’t mean that other folks like myself are going to straight out agree. 

I have my own reasons for liking Reina since she completely won me over. And I’m perfectly fine with her being as a Mishima. This was the route Harada chose to go with, and I’m all for it. 
uncultured swine not appreciating peak female personality

prob scared she would bend u over
Kugisaki Nobura is peak character personality and all other opinions are haters
I would have liked her more if she looked older.
Dislike Mommy? No way.
    “Mommy” looks and acts like she is 15
        It’s a joke cause almost everyone is obsessed with her and I actually enjoy playing as her as well.

Chill.
Imo she could have a little more muscle. The personality is kinda odd, she seems like an inexperienced wannabe Kazuya while still... wanting to kill Kazuya?
I think she shouldve had a different body type, the same copy paster waifu body doesn't fit her, she's a mishima, where's the muscle?

But aside from that, she's cool
I wish hei was still in the game even though he demolishes me way harder
anothar boreing butten mashing scrub mishima 😩
    .-.
        .-.
Only one I've seen is LTG.

Have to admit I hate the coomers who can't actually play her, though. Made it to Garyu and seen a total of 2 who could electric on demand, with only one consistently doing them and the other was like doing them maybe half the time
    So not being good at eletrics makes you a coomer? Are new players supposed to just do them with perfect consistency instantly?
        I've literally read about people buying the game for her, learning she can't be played mindlessly and putting the game down to never touch again. You can't tell me these people don't exist.   


Also, let me be more specific. 2 could Electric. The rest were drooling invalids who didn't even try. Clear waifu-trashlords who saw pretty girl and thought "Me mash controller n win", and these embodiments of cringe are detestable no matter which character they pick, not just Reina, and not just this game either. It's always hilarious seeing these simps try to play an actually hard character and give up when it's not easy enough. See Angel in KOF, Baiken in Pre-Strive and Juri in SF4.
    >with only one consistently doing them and the other was like doing them maybe half the time

And something is wrong with that?
[deleted]
    Right, this would have been a much better story. 

Maybe she's possessed by the old man, and he has drove her to the devil gene to get close to his old power? (nah prolly overthinking it)
Huh, that scar on her chest kind of looks like a 9. Probably isn’t but it jumped out at me for a second.
She spins too much and it makes my head hurt
I like her design and how mobile she feels. I dislike her mirror matches so I’m just waiting for the community to stop playing her before I pick her up again.
I'm not too fond of her Devil form design, but I liked her character. Eager to see how she'll grow in the future
That first pic of Reina was rendered pretty well
Love her, amazing design. Gameplaywise she is a bit tricky for me since this is my first tekken game so alot of her stuff its kinda difficult to do, but im really enjoying playing her.
I want to like her, she's the closest thing about heihachi, maybe with time(aka future games) we'll see more personality, but for now, through her intros and interactions from the storymode, she's sort of basic.
she's kool.... its victor that  annoyed me .. his throw is hard to break.. his downward sword is faster than noctis giant sword
I like Reina, but she is annoying to fight against
Not as cute as the others but still a cutie , devil form is a little rough but I'd still tab water that.
I’m not a fan of her alternative form
Hold up where did this devil design come from? That wasn't in the story iirc...?
Her devil form sucks but otherwise is really good
Wait so what is she to Jin?
    The aunty
Not really, I believe she fits in really well

And I mean for OBVIOUS reasons... 

I know there's people who hasn't played it so I'm not going to spoil the (OBVIOUS Reasons part)
I don't trust her
I'm the opposite, I like her personality but dislike her play style. It's about time they had a brooding, evil female character in tekken.
Na. I dont even use her but I think she's great.
She is snobbish and self entitlement is off key
I don't like her personality, but all the other characters are fine so I just don't mind.
Not bad. Overrated waifu bait yes, but not bad.
i loke her normal state but devil skin can use a bit of work but then again the amount of redesign Kazuya and Jin devil state took till did it right im sure they will do the same with her
I like her a lot. Her character design and personality is freaking cool!
I'm neutral on her, I think I would prefer it if she was a bit older, not another high schooler.. maybe in her 30s or so
Nope, shes cute and savage
How could you hate perfection?
where is the devil model from?
It feels off with the whole story ending the demon side of things especially the ending only for her to come in and still have a devil form. Does that mean we have to get rid of it from her in the next game now? Angel is gone so who's purifying her?
Im going to if they don't change her devil hairstyle
I like her Devil design (I like all the Devil forms, I'm a lame ass edgelord like that) but her gameplay isn't for me. The first time I lost a fight in story mode was her vs Nina. I just can't gel with fast stance characters.
i like her even if she isn’t a protagonist. somebody has to carry heihachi’s legacy lol. her gameplay and design is also cool imo
I was pissed when the story mode didn't tell me where she's from and who she's related to
I dislike that she is another Mishima sibling with the devil gene but she’s cool
I think everyone loves Reina but everyone also equally dislikes her devil form lmao
I like her evil voice and mean streak. Plus her fit is cool and overall design is nice
I'd rather just have Heihachi. Both would be good! Nothing wrong with fresh blood in the cast, but Heihachi is the man
generic
Why tiny wings tho?
I'm only now playing story mode, but I like what I've seen of her character so far. As for her moves, I'm still learning. I'm going to get Kazuya & Devil Jin up to max rank & then figure out how she works
wtf, no
SMASHH!!!!!
Her devil form doesn't make sense based on how they tried to establish how the Devil Gene works. At first it was overwhelming desire for revenge, then it was hereditary, then it was a curse/family leniege having ties to an ancient Egyptian God/Demon.

By the end of TK8 they establish the Devil Gene was Kazumi's(?) family but also Jinpachi so how it's inherited is still up in the air aside from being Mashima (not Heihachi). Then Azazel was absorbed by Kaz for the perfect Devil Form then purified by Jin making it so that it should of been removed all together.

I wouldn't say I dislike her (though just let her say submission and let the bottoms enjoy being called out in public), her development doesn't make sense.
I love her design. (her devil form is trying too hard though)  

I hate playing against her.
I don't like this character because she is fxxken up to something no good.
Devil design ducks
love everything about her.
Best character on game
I dislike her personality, love her design, hate playing against her but man she is fun to play, the Devil form is a bit whack tho
Everybody is purple
Finally something slutty! 🙄🔥🥵
Nah... she is god
She is so random, lore-wise.
Even as someone who likes her I was actually surprised her reception was so positive. I thought I was gonna be one of her few fans lol.
She’s just like Heihachi so I love her. Just a little less badass
Would, next.
Love her character, design, personality and moveset

But I am dead fucking tired of fighting her every other match online
I think it comes down to it contrasting with her story role. She is not an antagonist and she is not given a big focus
I hate it when Reina mains customise their characters with short skirt underwear combo. It's distracting to play against
She's no Heihachi but she's aight ig
Her actual playstyle is cool but I hate her personality.
Shes edgy but I dont find it annoying cause a lot of Tekken characters are and its just sort of funny actually.
Devil form is an L but she's my wife so...
Hell no she a badass and we all simp for her
Wait how did you get the devil form? Is it in the game? Wher?
Nah hate king tho
Obviously I do like her 💜💯💜
Discount Kazuya in everything
She’s like 90% of my ranked matches lol
There is something wrong with her mouth, but I couldn’t explain what it is.
i'm indifferent
I like her
I hate her
Is that an actual render of her devil design? looks way better than i thought it would.

Also, if the answer is yes and it is an actual render, I guess that would essentially confirm there is a story expansion.
I find her gameplay really fun but I think she's a nightmare to fight with & that she's a bitch. Looks cool though & her personality is in character, >!being another Mishima asshole.!<
Her devil design sucks but everything else is fine
She's my favorite newcomer but her story made me roll my eyes. She's shoehorned into it and raises more questions by the end.
She's got a lot of headbutts, which is all I really need.
Truly, I think Reina's lore as being Heihachi's daughter is kind of mid. Her being a vessel for Heihachi or some G corp/zaibatsu experiment is also kind of trash, but the thought of her actually being a Heihachi fangirl who copied Mishima shit online is the kind of Tekken comedy I'm all about. 

  
That or Heihachi's pupil post Tekken 3. Like if Mishima Polytech had a martial arts tournament and the winner got to train with Heihachi in Mishima style.
I think Reina needed more characterization. She's barely relevant to anything outside of her connection to the devil gene. She's fun in gameplay, though.
I do, her fighting style is cool, but I think her personality is kinda lame, and seeing it in a bright area makes me realize that her devil form is super lame, like what were they going for with that, also how the hell did she even get it?
She’s been getting a Cena push. All over the story mode and opening video
I'm often doubtful of today's take on many franchises I've been into since childhood; but I have to say, Tekken 8 fixed the one character that I've previously took issue with since Tekken 4, and that was Jin.

Jin isn't a 'reformed' character - but he is now a character fully aware of his previous actions being wrong, and that things can't go back the way they were before he started the global war. In turn, the people he was previously cruel and dismissive of; Xiaoyu and Lars notably, he makes it up to them in the best way possible, making their trust in (Jin) plausible and earned.

Tekken in 2024 has created simply outstanding new characters in Azucena, Victor and Reina. All three are memorable, iconic, scene stealing.

Reina has the most ambitious position of the entire roster, and she owns it. Having a character seemingly small, harmless, casual attire, putting on  a disarming personality, yet having secret powers and hidden classic Mishima arrogance within herself - I can't imagine a better character to fill in for Heihachi - it was a total risk not to simply copy or duplicate Heihachi - yet the result is, exactly what I think Tekken needs; a curveball leaving you wanting more.
Love her design and energy. I don't like her devil form though. I would have preferred a more simple design with just wings and horns like Devil Jin had.
I love her voice acting, personality and her animations, the only thing I wish they changed is that the area under her jaw doesn't deform as it should making her look fatter than she's supposed to be judging from the concept art and rest of her body proportions, it's very visible on the win pose where she's looking back and facing upwards.
Nah I love Reina, I can’t wait to learn her and play ranked.
 She’s a spam queen
I actually like her. I mean, for tekken standards and designs, it’s actually ok.
She’s cool, her design is fun, and watching high level players pilot her is a treat for the eyes. But her sheer popularity on ranked is genuinely off-putting. I bought T8 yesterday and saw at least 8 Reina’s, four of which were in a row. I’m sure horny fuckheads in the low ranks just play her cuz she’s hot, but in a game with 30+ characters, having this much saturation makes the game far less fun in my opinion. Not even SF6 Ken or JP are played this much, and I’m in Diamond 2, where these top tiers thrive in this high stakes environment. Somebody please tell me if she’s nearly this popular in Red Ranks and beyond, because I’m genuinely sick of her, and I’ve had the game for a day
I like her personality overall but there's not enough depth in it. I loved the trailers but in the story she's just annoying. She's almost the opposite of Claudio, I hate him taken out of story context but within the story he's aite. I love her outside the context of the story but with it she's dogshit.
Nope. Love this lady. Gimme cool villain all day everyday.
She was kinda annoying to me personally but I'm interested to see more of her devil form.
The only thing I don't like about her, applies to every other tekken girl, she doesn't have ANY visible muscle
Everything but her devilform is good
She's cool but I'm getting tired everyone and their cousin playing her online
I dislike her role in the game. Keeps stealing the show, and not in an interesting way.

I am fine with her design and even with her "Lying bitch, hidden threat" personality, even if her ego is even worse than Kazuya's and Heihachi's combined.
Honestly, I find her design to be a bit boring. Her personality doesn't bother me, though. My main thing is that I am tired of fighting against her in ranked. 90% of my matches are Reina. The other 10%, Jun.
Dislike is astrong word, but I find her underwhelming as a character, design and story wise. For all they could have done with "teenage girl Heihachi", they played it kind of safe. Doesn't help that not very much gets explained about her, so there's nothing too interesting to latch onto. 

I don't even feel too bad for saying that as some of the creators are surprised she's so popular, as if they thought they didn't anything too special.
The only reason I dislike her is because she is my main and everyone is playing her!

Nah, but seriously. Probably a few? She clicked real fast with me. I feel she is probably the most approachable Mishima in that you don't necessarily have to play her as a Mishima, but for someone like my friend. I know he grew frustrated with her more chessier moves pre-labbing. It doesn't help either that she is extremely evasive, so I can see someone not enjoying fighting her.

I honestly like her personality the most. She feels really different from most of the fighters. She's not as goofy or fun as Heihachi could be from what I've seen of him, but she is pretty cool, and that's enough for me.
Not a huge fan. I feel like she lacks emotion in her facial expressions. It's more like a puppet heihachi with devi power decoration.
lol nope. I like her. >! She’s like a feisty, dominstrix version of Heihachi !<
I highly despise her whole cutesy demeanor in the atory mode.
Good gameplay but she is too much of a girlboss coomer character for me to like her .

Also the simpler design is a good thing .

But personality wise just like Juri I don't like those kind of characters
Baehachi
i think shes cool, but they mary-sued her just a little in the story which made her unlikeable to some (by that i mean she pulled a captain marvel and just showed up out of nowhere cocky as hell and started throwing hands with the big dogs actint like it was no sweat) but finding out she was heihachis daughter took that dislike away for me, i see her now as a continuation of heihachis legacy, so as a long time heihachi fan, she has my approval
Bryan players
Design and personality of her normal form: Cool

Role in the story: Hard to say, feels like her story in Tekken 8 is just setup for her to be a major character (main villain?) of Tekken 9 (or a DLC story if we get one).  Too early to judge.

I do find it funny that the image of her sitting on the throne is used so heavily, even though I don't think she has actually canonically sat in that chair a single time.  Unless I missed something, the only actual cutscene of her sitting in that chair is the daydream sequence in her character episode.

Design of Devil Form: Really not sold, especially on the hair, but we've only seen it for a few frames so maybe it'll improve.  I feel like it doesn't really look like Reina, though.  All the other devil characters (Jin, Kazuya, Kazumi) look like their normal version but with wings, horns, and maybe a different skin color and/or a third eye, but then Devil Reina looks like a completely different character, and overall I think the design of Devil Jin, Kazuya, and Kazumi works way better and would much rather see the same style of Reina.  Maybe it'll be better once we actually get to see her in action but tentatively kind of hoping they abandon that design.  That might work for some sort of super devil Reina like how we got True Devil Kazuya in Tekken 8's story, but I don't like it as a base design.

Gameplay: Sometimes I get tired of fighting against her just because she's so popular, but otherwise no issue.  Her animations are cool, she's not too frustrating to play against, seems like she might be fun to try playing at some point but so far I've only played her in the story and her special episode.
If she had his hair then she would be hotter
    Well, >!her Devil form kind of does...!<
        Like barely. Its like saying kazumi and jun got the same hair. No mishima bald spot that lars is slowly getting.
            The bald spot is a later addition. Young Heihachi is canon.

Her hair isn't an exact match, though. It's like the Jin vs. Kazuya sweptback ducktail.
                Lars is in his late 20's by T6 and he felt the wind breeze too much in TT2. Heihachi just is him. But reina and lars are not.
                    That same cutscene is prefaced with the notion that Devil powers prevent hairloss.
                    Lars catching strays for no reason
                        Couldn't even get the andrussy either.
                            Just L after L
                            Well his and alisa character episodes are shown to have a thing.

Besides reina is female so no bald spots
                No, Heihachi WITHOUT a balls pot didn't exist until Tag 2. T1 and T2 had Young Heihachi with old Heihachi hair with black hair, this also includes flashbacks to the day Kaz got yeeted as a kid. #knowyourlore
        I'm glad you spoiler tagged that in a post that already reveals it.
Doesn’t even have a giant white thong, tsk tsk
All hail heihachi !
BASED, Old man was just goated.
Based
People like you give me hope
I get the funny joke but she plays absolutely nothing like heihachi. If anything Lidia would be the closest to her. Still not too similar though.
    They really could have both. Only the story mode need to care whether he's dead
    She does have a good few of the old man's moves so that's enough
        No, she has a good few moves that LOOK like heihachi moves but have entirely different properties and still have slightly different animations.
Lmao, old Eve. I remember now.
    lol even Riot knew that design should be changed
        I guess Riot got inspiration from Unknown with current Evelynn then
Yeah it's not the slightest bit intimidating. At least it was just a post-credit so they can still work on it before she sees action
    Looks like a Sonic Villain or some shi
Her devil form looks like a 90s hentai sex villain
    Yes, and?
        It’s an awesome combination, hentai, 90s, sex, villain, in that specific order.
        It’s funny and cool at the same time
    And Kaz looks like a 90s power ranger villain in his devil form. And not a good one either lmao
devil may cry lookin mf
They would probably change it up in the next game like they always do.
    I hope so, this looks underwhelming
Sorry, but why does she has devil form again?
Thought she doesn’t have the devil gene?

Apologize if this is a dumb question but not sure where’s that’s explained.
    Officially, no one knows. It was left on a cliffhanger. But logically you can deduce that maybe she’s the only successful specimen Heihachi had experimenting on the Devil Gene. Second possibility is Heihachi having the luck with women as Taylor Swift’s luck with men, banged another woman with the devil gene. Azazel says he has a lot of “servants”. There are other clans/people with the devil gene. The Hachijous are one of many.

I find it interesting that Heihachi treated her really well that she actually misses him and wants to avenge him. Heihachi treats daughters better than sons. Heihachi also unofficially adopted Xiaoyu. He sent her to school, fed her, housed her gave her Panda as a pet and bodyguard. Xiaoyu affectionately calls Heihachi “grandpa”.
        Heihachi lied his ass off to look good, which everyone who didn't start with 7 has been saying all along. Remember, Heihachi, Scumbag supreme, told the Kazumi thing as a STORY to a reporter to make himself look goid. Basically, Heihachi being dishonest like he's been since T1.
            He can lie but Xiaoyu and Reina clearly loved him like a father. He really did treat them well .
            I dunno, Heihachi doing horrible things & becoming corrupt himself in order to destroy a great evil is fitting with the tragedy of the Mishima family.

   Both Kazuya & Jin were morally superior protagonists before their relentless desire for revenge pushed them to do horrible things.
                Except he was horrible long before the Kazumi thing, dude buried hus dad alive under his house. Dude starved yo death. Also it's clearly that Heihachi WANTS the devil gene, that's literally why he did everything he did. He was jelly it skipped him.
                    I’m confused, I thought the Devil gene came through Kazumis blood & not through him? Goddamn retcons, hard to get the lore straight.

  I even forgot about Jinpachi.
                        Yeah, the Kazumi thing wasn't until 7. And even then, it was a story Heihachi told a reporter to look like a hero. Not a retcon, just Heihachi being his deceitful self. Heihachi is like Shang Tsung, don't buy the bs he spouts, he'll manipulate you.
                    The Devil Gene didn't skip him though. Jinpachi looks the way he does because he's literally a vengeful spirit back from the dead.
        Hrm, thanks for the explanation.
Guess we won’t know until later.
The only thing I can see looking at her hair is Ludwig of the Koopa Kids from Mario.
Looks more like claymore design to me 😂
you like her design? it just screams cringe
    Why are you on a 2 month old post that screams cringe
I want her
    Bro will regret it once he realizes he put himself into the Mishima family drama
        Become the neutral butler and remain friendly with Jin
            T9 ending you probably are gonna be crawling out of a dormant volcano
                Do I get my own EWGF?
                    The monkey paw side effect your children all have the heihachi hairline

*ALL of them*
                        So I can clown my kids if they start talking shit? Bet
            He could be Wang 2 and be chill
                He will Wang for sure
        Bro wants to be the male equivalent of Jun 😭
        100% worth
    Do you want a kid who tries to kill you his entire life? Because that's how you get a kid that tries to kill you his entire life.
        Nah I’d sugarcoat it. Also I have made it one of my goals to break generational trauma.
            Bro unintentionally makes a small slip up and you get a brat version of Kaz because you didn't let him eat his favorite food on his favorite day
    To jacket off
Same , it looks really good. Though I probably want Jin's jacket more
I want to wear her like a jacket. No wait, that was Silence of the Lambs.
    Why? You wanna join in on the Mishima family drama. Its too much of a headache even for Lars.
yeah, real talk, is there any place I can get it that's not a total bootleg or scam? I found so many listing via Google but they're all sketchy
[I’ve been so tempted…](https://www.jacketsjunction.com/product/tekken-8-reina-mishima-jacket/)
    Literally no photo of the real thing they’re sending you so you have no way to know if it’s shitty looking or not, it’s just all in game shots
        Yeah that looks dodgy. 

Seems to be a mix of very angry and positive (fake?) reviews.
https://au.trustpilot.com/review/www.jacketsjunction.com
        Well good thing I didn’t pull the trigger on that 😅
    Fake u can prob find the real thing somewhere though.
    The voices are getting louder each day 😂😂”MUST GET THE JACKET” 
It would also be so cool because my hair is dyed purple
Same, would rather play Devil Jin or Kaz if I wanna take a break from Hwoarang and do some EWGF’s
What do you dislike about her gameplay?
    I don't enjoy characters with a load of stances that much, I think Hwoarang is the only very stance heavy character I actually liked trying out. For everyone else, anything more than a crouch dash + a single mixup stance is just not fun to keep track of.
        She only has one other stance and all the buttons correspond the same(mid high low, etc) her stance stuff is not that complex and one of them is used rarely
            Think she has at least three stances. More if you count electrics
    Her strings are longer than my combos.
I thought she played like a clone of Hei?
    Nope she may be his daughter but no she is not a clone of his in any kind
        Unless she is but without y dna
    All the characters are just inheritors of old ones. Reina inherited a lot from Lidia, Victor from Noctis, and Azucena from a couple of others, including Josie and Katarina etc.
    Obviously not when she has tons of stances.
    LOL noooooo
Unlikely azazel gave other people the devil gene
    That begets the question where the hell were/are the rest of them during the events of the Tekken story?!
Same
I find her attitude annoying as well
    Would you rather she be like every other tekken girl thats just calm and nice? With the occasional arrogance
        calm and nice? most of tekken women are sociopaths.
Same, she annoys me by screeming and behaving like 15 y.o. overconfident edgy meme lord... -ish
    >Same, she annoys me by screeming and behaving like 15 y.o. overconfident edgy meme lord... -ish

Overconfident edgy meme lord AKA mishima
It's nice to finally have a bad girl in Tekken
    Nina? Anna? Kunimitsu 1 & 2? They literally kill people for money for a living.
        Tbh kunimitsu 2 is more on the cute side even if she kills for money
        Not Nina or Anna are aggresive.

And Kuni? This addorable little girl?
            2 out of 8089 characters bravo lol
Know ur place and the throne is the reason I play her

Also voice actor is god tier
I'm kind of confused about how she got the gene. Like kazumi died ages ago and reina is younger than jin. Idk hoping we get a dlc story
    My bet is on her being the result of Hei experimenting with the devil gene.

If there was something Hei loved other than martial arts was making kids and conducting insane human/animal experiments.
        But he hated the devil gene.
            He hated it because he didn't have it and he couldn't control it. Behind the scenes he was messing with Ogre's blood in an attempt to understand it better.
                damn...ogre reina would've been a cool twist on the idea
                    Actually , yeah , it would been really cool, considering that jun is back , having to deal with the threat from a Reina Ogre would be interesting
    It probably wont be explained in detail. Im sure shes not Kazumis kid though.
        She might be kazumi kid she has the resemblance
            Timeline doesn't work. Reina is in her early 20s at the oldest. She would have to be in her 40s to be Kazumi's daughter.
                she wouldn't be the first lady heihachi put on ice for a while
                probably shoved into cryogenics like the Williams sisters to stop the Devil gene manifesting or something if they wanna justify her being Kazumi's daughter. Or old man Heihachi had the sex somewhen after Tekken 2.
    Inb4 Heihachi is the actual progenitor of the devil gene. Only Devil Lars can stop Devil Reina now.
        Didn't you know? When Nina was frozen they made a second Steve but infused with the super secret Angel gene sauce as a research experiment in a bunker 1500 meters below Borneo. It was Heihachi's real trump card!
            Oh the 2nd Steve, I sure hope he turns out less disappointing that the 1st Steve, that was sidelined to join the newly comedic DUO of Law and Paul.
    Reina doesn't seem to be Kazumi's daughter cause of the age difference with her looking younger than Jin, thou we will find out more in future games cause she has the Devil now which is weird. She idolizes Heihachi but gains the very power he wanted to destroy lol
        He wanted to have the power to destroy it, and the power of it. His intentions weren't noble. He wanted what Kazuya obtained.
    It has nothing to do with kazumi. She noticed in the story in the fight with jin that you need a near death experience to activate the devil powers. They also confirmed that azazel is the origin of all the devil gene. So when kazuya hit her with the big laser beam she experienced  a near death experience and got a good chunk of azazels demon powers. So no kazumi or experiences involved.
    weren't anna and nina in cryosleep for a while

could be the same deal here
    Azazel gave the gene to its servants. So there might be another clan with the gene aside from the Hachijos.

Either Heihachi got lucky with another woman belonging to a family with the devil gene, or Reina is a lab baby as the other have previously said.
    Maybe she's not Heihachi's kid, despite her believing so. Maybe it's Kasumi's sibling or something and Heihachi just made her believe she was his.
    He lied, simple, the whole T7 flashback contradicted literally every game story before 7. He lied, not the first time either.
Tbh, Heihachi having a secret daughter is in-line with the Tekken story line. This happened before with Lars too. Tekken in the forefront is all about the Mishima feud.
    Harada confirmed he has at least 26 mystery kids
        You only find out he's your dad once the male pattern baldness reveals it
            It's probably worse if you notice lightning when you punch someone
> It undermines the 'jin killing all the devils' theme of Tekken 8.

He can't kill devils. Azzazel will resurect again, sooner or latter. Or create another servants. Devils are fundamental part of Tekken world.
Hipsters want her to be lame, not fun to play, and not hot, because being cool, fun, and hot is too mainstream.
To not be a randy who comes out of nowhere to undermine the story.
    They needed to set up T9 somehow, now that Kaz is possibly dead
        No he's not lol
            It was left open-ended. He didn't twitch or even move a finger, so they are free to take the story wherever they want when t9 comes out (in 7 to 10 years)
                There is literally no dialogue indicating that he's dead, the entire point was to remove the Devil's blood, Jin didn't want to kill him by the end of the game
        You can set it up without making a character that blueballs me lol
I like her demeanor. She gives of Tsundere vibes.
Same she awesome
She wasn't trying to kill herself. She was trying to awaken her devil gene after she learned that Jin's awakens when his life is in danger. She was getting annoyed because Heihachi's genes made her super tough so the stupid gene kept being like "Nope! You're alright. You're not in danger." and refusing to awaken.
    Still dumb
lol was that in story mode or where was that at?
    He says that in his Tekken 7 rage art (although I’m pretty sure he says “You’re done” and not “You’re dumb”)
        Yeh, the subtitles says "You're done," but I hear "you're dumb," all the time. Same with his T8 rage art, I hear "black steel" instead of "like steel"😅
I took it more as maybe she had not activated her full devil gene and didn’t know how. 

Pretty sure when Jin is under threat from her and his starts showing again she says something like “ah that’s how it works” then she proceeds to be a bit suicidal in order to activate her devil. I could be wrong and forgot something else.
I was hoping she'd believe she was strong enough to beat Kazuya because of how much she worships her Mishima blood and gets killed after going all out defending her father's honor. But instead she just pulls a stupid Vegeta, "shoot me and I'll somehow get stronger", plan.
    >I was hoping she'd believe she was strong enough to beat Kazuya because of how much she worships her Mishima blood and gets killed after going all out defending her father's honor. 

Why introduce a Mishima just to kill them? You played yourself brother/sister.
        Not dead, dead. Presumed dead like how the story had it. Then the twist ending thing happens anyway.
Agreed.
Damn, keep spittin' chief
That's why we prefer anna😂
    Sadly Anna has been low tier in every game she's been in. Nina has been top tier in many games.
what's your excuse for not seeing the story already? If you don't own t8 just watch it on youtube
    It hasnt even been a month with the game wth? I haven't even touched the story yet because ive been in between practicing and ranked matches
        in what universe does it take you a month to get around to watching a 3 hour movie if you care about spoilers? That's like a single lord of the rings film
    some people have jobs, NEET spotted
        damn straight fuck capitalism
            mommy cant pay for all of us can she
    >what's your excuse for not seeing the story already?

Time.
    Life has a habit of getting in the way. What's the excuse for not clicking a spoiler check box for a week old game?
I think she just seems like an inexperienced wannabe Kazuya. Like Kazuya's been thrown off cliffs and done some throwing himself, the arrogance is acceptable and even makes him cool. But this bitch has nothing to back it, it's just cringy wannabe Kazuya.
    Lmao yes that’s the best description of this character. 

“Dollar store Kazuya”
    Nothing to back it? Shows up out of nowhere and full on fucking headbutts and beats up TRUE DEVIL KAZUYA
        She didn't beat him up what are you on about? She caused some mild inconvenience at best. Her "beat him up" has the same energy as Jin "beat him up" in the first chapter, if Kazuya really wanted to he could finished the fight in a second.
            Yeah you’re probably right I only remembered it that way because as the player you’re supposed to win the fight I forgot about after lol, but still to say she has nothing to back it up I think is wrong.

What mug downvoted me your dad is 44 and still ringing man for a draw
        Sure, Lars fought TDK as well but he's still some random Swedish twink
        She beat him up?
how i felt since watching the trailer, can’t put my finger on why she just makes me cringe
I don't get the weeb/anime thing. I mean, she's just being Japanese.
    Most Japan people don't act like that
        Yeah so make her bland as fuck and hear people complain that she has no personality, so it fits most human being's personnality
Like every other Tekken character?
    Not really... For example remember in the Hwoarang/ Steve into everyone says Hwoarang sounds like a normal person and Steve sounds very weird like a toddler wrote the script... Everyone has personality but reina feels like she just tries to imitate a cool anime character... She is especially cringy in her win pose where she looks back over her shoulder in a weird way
        The entire story mode is weeb af
Unlikely she is here to stay
well said. one look at the artwork/screenshot section on steam (T8) pretty much tells the story. I am still mad that now i lost the only electric character i had fun playing with.
She is 19-20 bro
    I know. My point still stands. She LOOKS like a kid.
        Nah she doesn’t bro get use to how she looks and set her up for future games. Jin and kazuya’s roles are done so she is gonna be a focal character going foward
            What are you on about? OP asked if anyone else dislikes Reina and I’m simply responding to that. You can get “used to” something but still think something look like shit. Yeah, I will care less and less about Reina’s design and personality as time goes on, doesn’t mean I’m gonna think it’s not shit. 

This conversation isn’t even about Jin and Kazuya so idk why you dragged them into this. 

Maybe stop getting touchy cos a bunch of people dislike your “waifu” and go enjoy maining her instead?
                I already played tekken 8 bro
    She's actually a highschooler
        19 is still in high school
> Mid as fuck design and the only thing that carries her is the voice actor. Even she comes across as this edgy, wannabe tough-girl brat rather than the “dommy mommy” a lot of people say.

Harada said they made her 'mid as fuck' intentionally. But well he is too old and out of loop to know fetishes of modern anime community.
    Yeah I’m aware of this. I’m not saying make her dress like a slut, but something that actually looks authoritative and badass. I already mentioned Lidia was a design I actually liked.
she looks like a joke character tbh
Just some muscle would already help but she has nothing. Twig arms. Also where my abs at. Heihachi's kid gotta be a gym rat. Failing her father big time.
Agree. I would've wished for a distinguished middle aged, weathered, badass woman - who is built like someone worthy to be Heihachi's successor, Kazuya's sister, Jin's aunt - >!and host/conqueror of the devil gene!<

A female that actually looks like what she personifies: strenght and domination. A true Mishima, experienced and with an iron body, and not... well, *yet* another cliche cutesy schoolgirl: in apperance, in behaviour (faking her personality even instead of embracing it and becoming a true heiress of Heihachi's way), as well as in age. 

Still hoping they some day get the courage to make a female character that actually looks like a trained fighter (and then even exaggerate it like they do with the male cast). Someone who can not only behave like they stand eye to eye to the male cast in strenght and experience, but also look the part.

Her moveset is extremely cool and convincing, an evolution of Heihachi's rushdown legacy with even more depth and freedom of expression without becoming another allround-character - kudos to the gameplay design department. Her voice actress is doing an oustanding job as well, I just wish the lines were a little different.
    >Agree. I would've wished for a distinguished middle aged, weathered, badass woman - who is built like someone worthy to be Heihachi's successor, Kazuya's sister, Jin's aunt - and host/conqueror of the devil gene

This so much.  I totally forgot that technically Reina is Jin's aunt and it's like are you freaking serious with how young they made her look? I agree, would've been a tad better sell if they had her be an older, badass woman. I'm getting so tired of Tekken's blatant sexism of having all these old male characters but won't give us an older female character (who actually looks it).
    They already made Lidia, who is not in 8 unfortunately
    Unlikely 
    They explicitly said her theme is duality, so I think the decision to make her cutesy-looking was deliberate. Even then, I think they could do a lot better than "generic anime girl". The least they could do was give her a Mishima hair...
Or if she needed to have the "cutesy anime girl" look. Make her come off as a dweeb instead.
Yeh, she really looked like just some cosplayer or gamer. Doesn't really scream "mishima" to me
    Exactly, she looks like a generic npc, bamco doesnt have creativity anymore
        Heihachi was literally just an old man in a gi. Kazuya was the same but shirtless. You think those were creative?
            They are badass characters with simple designs unlike her, shes whatever
                You can just say you dont like women
                    You wish, I like Zafina Jun and Julia so stop with the bs
                    Aahh yaa im biggest mf misogynist in the world for criticizing Kardashians
Her design is to appeal gen z mofos, I dont like it at all
She look like Fortnite gamer being a fortnight character. Hate design
Fr, the most 5/10 I've seen!
She has a reason. She's trying to figure out how he awakens his devil gene so that she can awaken hers.
    In a hostile manner, as if she had a blood feud with him like she did with Kazuya.
>for no reason 

???? The whole point was to find out how to tap into the Devil Gene. She stops being antagonistic as soon as she doesn’t need to fight him. 
How about you?
    Nigga shut up and stop defending this character
        Don’t tell me what to do bro
            I do as I please, not as I'm told, scum.
                Your scum bro telling me what to do in a rude way
I see more people disliking her
They made Lidia. She was strong but realistic. She lasted like 20% of one tekken game.
    she's barely muscular lol. I also frankly don't care about "realistic" muscles in a game where Feng Wei exists
        From body type alone almost all characters would be on steroids, so it would make sense if the women were as well.
We need a marisa like character in tekken🙏
She is fine bro heihachi is gone forever
I think her saying she's gonna avenge heihachi and turn into a devil kinda bothers me cos it seems like she doesn't know that much about him at all. Like if he was alive and saw that she has the devil gene, he would've killed her. Hoping we get a dlc story.
Totally didn't realize that she really is supposed to be Jin's autn but he looks like his younger sister more than anything. It's absolutely ridiculous and they were better off just making her a different character that was not related to the Mishima.
Tee hee
And your not trying harder
Like Steve's ending muscular👀?
It is fine bro that was the point jin and kazuya’s arcs are done her’s is beginning
Best new fighting game character? Not really
Bro, you're in the Tekken sub. The game's been out for a week. Go finish the story mode or go watch it on YouTube.
    We don't all use our time in the same way, could've just put a spoiler tag.
        You can't change the world, fam. People will talk about the game in a group dedicated to the game. You can ask the entire world to change and hope for the best, or you can finish the story mode and/or watch it on YouTube.

Even in groups where mods have strict rules against spoilers for like a month after a TV episode people still post spoilers.

You know people will do it, so it's prudent to act in a way that accounts for it.
Yea annoying
The game has been out for over a week, and story mode takes less than 4 hours to complete. If you haven't finished the story by now while browsing hangouts dedicated to talking about the game, then that's on you.
Lars bro
I don't think she will. I think she's gonna be what they did with jin in the story where it's only playable in story mode. I'm hoping for a dlc story instead of a sequel
What a stupid take
Look. There were times when I was like "She still a bad bitch tho" but her personality I dislike it too much.
    Hate-fucking, I get it.
        Can't go wrong
I was asking myself the same question at the end of the game. I asked myself she must not know much about heihachi. She's avenging a dead man who would kill her if he saw that she has the devil gene. Idk, hopefully they release a dlc story instead of a sequel
Naa azucena takes that crown. She's so fucking corny
    Azucena is an amalgamation of all the toxic new T7 female characters that got left behind yuck.
    Yea you’re right lmao. Her design is super clean though
“Mommy” looks and acts like she is 15
    It’s a joke cause almost everyone is obsessed with her and I actually enjoy playing as her as well.

Chill.
.-.
    .-.
So not being good at eletrics makes you a coomer? Are new players supposed to just do them with perfect consistency instantly?
    I've literally read about people buying the game for her, learning she can't be played mindlessly and putting the game down to never touch again. You can't tell me these people don't exist.   


Also, let me be more specific. 2 could Electric. The rest were drooling invalids who didn't even try. Clear waifu-trashlords who saw pretty girl and thought "Me mash controller n win", and these embodiments of cringe are detestable no matter which character they pick, not just Reina, and not just this game either. It's always hilarious seeing these simps try to play an actually hard character and give up when it's not easy enough. See Angel in KOF, Baiken in Pre-Strive and Juri in SF4.
>with only one consistently doing them and the other was like doing them maybe half the time

And something is wrong with that?
Right, this would have been a much better story. 

Maybe she's possessed by the old man, and he has drove her to the devil gene to get close to his old power? (nah prolly overthinking it)
The aunty
Well, >!her Devil form kind of does...!<
    Like barely. Its like saying kazumi and jun got the same hair. No mishima bald spot that lars is slowly getting.
        The bald spot is a later addition. Young Heihachi is canon.

Her hair isn't an exact match, though. It's like the Jin vs. Kazuya sweptback ducktail.
            Lars is in his late 20's by T6 and he felt the wind breeze too much in TT2. Heihachi just is him. But reina and lars are not.
                That same cutscene is prefaced with the notion that Devil powers prevent hairloss.
                Lars catching strays for no reason
                    Couldn't even get the andrussy either.
                        Just L after L
                        Well his and alisa character episodes are shown to have a thing.

Besides reina is female so no bald spots
            No, Heihachi WITHOUT a balls pot didn't exist until Tag 2. T1 and T2 had Young Heihachi with old Heihachi hair with black hair, this also includes flashbacks to the day Kaz got yeeted as a kid. #knowyourlore
    I'm glad you spoiler tagged that in a post that already reveals it.
They really could have both. Only the story mode need to care whether he's dead
She does have a good few of the old man's moves so that's enough
    No, she has a good few moves that LOOK like heihachi moves but have entirely different properties and still have slightly different animations.
lol even Riot knew that design should be changed
    I guess Riot got inspiration from Unknown with current Evelynn then
Looks like a Sonic Villain or some shi
Yes, and?
    It’s an awesome combination, hentai, 90s, sex, villain, in that specific order.
    It’s funny and cool at the same time
And Kaz looks like a 90s power ranger villain in his devil form. And not a good one either lmao
I hope so, this looks underwhelming
Officially, no one knows. It was left on a cliffhanger. But logically you can deduce that maybe she’s the only successful specimen Heihachi had experimenting on the Devil Gene. Second possibility is Heihachi having the luck with women as Taylor Swift’s luck with men, banged another woman with the devil gene. Azazel says he has a lot of “servants”. There are other clans/people with the devil gene. The Hachijous are one of many.

I find it interesting that Heihachi treated her really well that she actually misses him and wants to avenge him. Heihachi treats daughters better than sons. Heihachi also unofficially adopted Xiaoyu. He sent her to school, fed her, housed her gave her Panda as a pet and bodyguard. Xiaoyu affectionately calls Heihachi “grandpa”.
    Heihachi lied his ass off to look good, which everyone who didn't start with 7 has been saying all along. Remember, Heihachi, Scumbag supreme, told the Kazumi thing as a STORY to a reporter to make himself look goid. Basically, Heihachi being dishonest like he's been since T1.
        He can lie but Xiaoyu and Reina clearly loved him like a father. He really did treat them well .
        I dunno, Heihachi doing horrible things & becoming corrupt himself in order to destroy a great evil is fitting with the tragedy of the Mishima family.

   Both Kazuya & Jin were morally superior protagonists before their relentless desire for revenge pushed them to do horrible things.
            Except he was horrible long before the Kazumi thing, dude buried hus dad alive under his house. Dude starved yo death. Also it's clearly that Heihachi WANTS the devil gene, that's literally why he did everything he did. He was jelly it skipped him.
                I’m confused, I thought the Devil gene came through Kazumis blood & not through him? Goddamn retcons, hard to get the lore straight.

  I even forgot about Jinpachi.
                    Yeah, the Kazumi thing wasn't until 7. And even then, it was a story Heihachi told a reporter to look like a hero. Not a retcon, just Heihachi being his deceitful self. Heihachi is like Shang Tsung, don't buy the bs he spouts, he'll manipulate you.
                The Devil Gene didn't skip him though. Jinpachi looks the way he does because he's literally a vengeful spirit back from the dead.
    Hrm, thanks for the explanation.
Guess we won’t know until later.
Why are you on a 2 month old post that screams cringe
Bro will regret it once he realizes he put himself into the Mishima family drama
    Become the neutral butler and remain friendly with Jin
        T9 ending you probably are gonna be crawling out of a dormant volcano
            Do I get my own EWGF?
                The monkey paw side effect your children all have the heihachi hairline

*ALL of them*
                    So I can clown my kids if they start talking shit? Bet
        He could be Wang 2 and be chill
            He will Wang for sure
    Bro wants to be the male equivalent of Jun 😭
    100% worth
Do you want a kid who tries to kill you his entire life? Because that's how you get a kid that tries to kill you his entire life.
    Nah I’d sugarcoat it. Also I have made it one of my goals to break generational trauma.
        Bro unintentionally makes a small slip up and you get a brat version of Kaz because you didn't let him eat his favorite food on his favorite day
To jacket off
Why? You wanna join in on the Mishima family drama. Its too much of a headache even for Lars.
Literally no photo of the real thing they’re sending you so you have no way to know if it’s shitty looking or not, it’s just all in game shots
    Yeah that looks dodgy. 

Seems to be a mix of very angry and positive (fake?) reviews.
https://au.trustpilot.com/review/www.jacketsjunction.com
    Well good thing I didn’t pull the trigger on that 😅
Fake u can prob find the real thing somewhere though.
The voices are getting louder each day 😂😂”MUST GET THE JACKET” 
It would also be so cool because my hair is dyed purple
I don't enjoy characters with a load of stances that much, I think Hwoarang is the only very stance heavy character I actually liked trying out. For everyone else, anything more than a crouch dash + a single mixup stance is just not fun to keep track of.
    She only has one other stance and all the buttons correspond the same(mid high low, etc) her stance stuff is not that complex and one of them is used rarely
        Think she has at least three stances. More if you count electrics
Her strings are longer than my combos.
Nope she may be his daughter but no she is not a clone of his in any kind
    Unless she is but without y dna
All the characters are just inheritors of old ones. Reina inherited a lot from Lidia, Victor from Noctis, and Azucena from a couple of others, including Josie and Katarina etc.
Obviously not when she has tons of stances.
LOL noooooo
That begets the question where the hell were/are the rest of them during the events of the Tekken story?!
Would you rather she be like every other tekken girl thats just calm and nice? With the occasional arrogance
    calm and nice? most of tekken women are sociopaths.
>Same, she annoys me by screeming and behaving like 15 y.o. overconfident edgy meme lord... -ish

Overconfident edgy meme lord AKA mishima
Nina? Anna? Kunimitsu 1 & 2? They literally kill people for money for a living.
    Tbh kunimitsu 2 is more on the cute side even if she kills for money
    Not Nina or Anna are aggresive.

And Kuni? This addorable little girl?
        2 out of 8089 characters bravo lol
My bet is on her being the result of Hei experimenting with the devil gene.

If there was something Hei loved other than martial arts was making kids and conducting insane human/animal experiments.
    But he hated the devil gene.
        He hated it because he didn't have it and he couldn't control it. Behind the scenes he was messing with Ogre's blood in an attempt to understand it better.
            damn...ogre reina would've been a cool twist on the idea
                Actually , yeah , it would been really cool, considering that jun is back , having to deal with the threat from a Reina Ogre would be interesting
It probably wont be explained in detail. Im sure shes not Kazumis kid though.
    She might be kazumi kid she has the resemblance
        Timeline doesn't work. Reina is in her early 20s at the oldest. She would have to be in her 40s to be Kazumi's daughter.
            she wouldn't be the first lady heihachi put on ice for a while
            probably shoved into cryogenics like the Williams sisters to stop the Devil gene manifesting or something if they wanna justify her being Kazumi's daughter. Or old man Heihachi had the sex somewhen after Tekken 2.
Inb4 Heihachi is the actual progenitor of the devil gene. Only Devil Lars can stop Devil Reina now.
    Didn't you know? When Nina was frozen they made a second Steve but infused with the super secret Angel gene sauce as a research experiment in a bunker 1500 meters below Borneo. It was Heihachi's real trump card!
        Oh the 2nd Steve, I sure hope he turns out less disappointing that the 1st Steve, that was sidelined to join the newly comedic DUO of Law and Paul.
Reina doesn't seem to be Kazumi's daughter cause of the age difference with her looking younger than Jin, thou we will find out more in future games cause she has the Devil now which is weird. She idolizes Heihachi but gains the very power he wanted to destroy lol
    He wanted to have the power to destroy it, and the power of it. His intentions weren't noble. He wanted what Kazuya obtained.
It has nothing to do with kazumi. She noticed in the story in the fight with jin that you need a near death experience to activate the devil powers. They also confirmed that azazel is the origin of all the devil gene. So when kazuya hit her with the big laser beam she experienced  a near death experience and got a good chunk of azazels demon powers. So no kazumi or experiences involved.
weren't anna and nina in cryosleep for a while

could be the same deal here
Azazel gave the gene to its servants. So there might be another clan with the gene aside from the Hachijos.

Either Heihachi got lucky with another woman belonging to a family with the devil gene, or Reina is a lab baby as the other have previously said.
Maybe she's not Heihachi's kid, despite her believing so. Maybe it's Kasumi's sibling or something and Heihachi just made her believe she was his.
He lied, simple, the whole T7 flashback contradicted literally every game story before 7. He lied, not the first time either.
Harada confirmed he has at least 26 mystery kids
    You only find out he's your dad once the male pattern baldness reveals it
        It's probably worse if you notice lightning when you punch someone
They needed to set up T9 somehow, now that Kaz is possibly dead
    No he's not lol
        It was left open-ended. He didn't twitch or even move a finger, so they are free to take the story wherever they want when t9 comes out (in 7 to 10 years)
            There is literally no dialogue indicating that he's dead, the entire point was to remove the Devil's blood, Jin didn't want to kill him by the end of the game
    You can set it up without making a character that blueballs me lol
Still dumb
He says that in his Tekken 7 rage art (although I’m pretty sure he says “You’re done” and not “You’re dumb”)
    Yeh, the subtitles says "You're done," but I hear "you're dumb," all the time. Same with his T8 rage art, I hear "black steel" instead of "like steel"😅
>I was hoping she'd believe she was strong enough to beat Kazuya because of how much she worships her Mishima blood and gets killed after going all out defending her father's honor. 

Why introduce a Mishima just to kill them? You played yourself brother/sister.
    Not dead, dead. Presumed dead like how the story had it. Then the twist ending thing happens anyway.
Sadly Anna has been low tier in every game she's been in. Nina has been top tier in many games.
It hasnt even been a month with the game wth? I haven't even touched the story yet because ive been in between practicing and ranked matches
    in what universe does it take you a month to get around to watching a 3 hour movie if you care about spoilers? That's like a single lord of the rings film
some people have jobs, NEET spotted
    damn straight fuck capitalism
        mommy cant pay for all of us can she
>what's your excuse for not seeing the story already?

Time.
Life has a habit of getting in the way. What's the excuse for not clicking a spoiler check box for a week old game?
Lmao yes that’s the best description of this character. 

“Dollar store Kazuya”
Nothing to back it? Shows up out of nowhere and full on fucking headbutts and beats up TRUE DEVIL KAZUYA
    She didn't beat him up what are you on about? She caused some mild inconvenience at best. Her "beat him up" has the same energy as Jin "beat him up" in the first chapter, if Kazuya really wanted to he could finished the fight in a second.
        Yeah you’re probably right I only remembered it that way because as the player you’re supposed to win the fight I forgot about after lol, but still to say she has nothing to back it up I think is wrong.

What mug downvoted me your dad is 44 and still ringing man for a draw
    Sure, Lars fought TDK as well but he's still some random Swedish twink
    She beat him up?
Most Japan people don't act like that
    Yeah so make her bland as fuck and hear people complain that she has no personality, so it fits most human being's personnality
Not really... For example remember in the Hwoarang/ Steve into everyone says Hwoarang sounds like a normal person and Steve sounds very weird like a toddler wrote the script...

I've literally read about people buying the game for her, learning she can't be played mindlessly and putting the game down to never touch again. You can't tell me these people don't exist.   


Also, let me be more specific. 2 could Electric. The rest were drooling invalids who didn't even try. Clear waifu-trashlords who saw pretty girl and thought "Me mash controller n win", and these embodiments of cringe are detestable no matter which character they pick, not just Reina, and not just this game either. It's always hilarious seeing these simps try to play an actually hard character and give up when it's not easy enough. See Angel in KOF, Baiken in Pre-Strive and Juri in SF4.
Like barely. Its like saying kazumi and jun got the same hair. No mishima bald spot that lars is slowly getting.
    The bald spot is a later addition. Young Heihachi is canon.

Her hair isn't an exact match, though. It's like the Jin vs. Kazuya sweptback ducktail.
        Lars is in his late 20's by T6 and he felt the wind breeze too much in TT2. Heihachi just is him. But reina and lars are not.
            That same cutscene is prefaced with the notion that Devil powers prevent hairloss.
            Lars catching strays for no reason
                Couldn't even get the andrussy either.
                    Just L after L
                    Well his and alisa character episodes are shown to have a thing.

Besides reina is female so no bald spots
        No, Heihachi WITHOUT a balls pot didn't exist until Tag 2. T1 and T2 had Young Heihachi with old Heihachi hair with black hair, this also includes flashbacks to the day Kaz got yeeted as a kid. #knowyourlore
I'm glad you spoiler tagged that in a post that already reveals it.
No, she has a good few moves that LOOK like heihachi moves but have entirely different properties and still have slightly different animations.
I guess Riot got inspiration from Unknown with current Evelynn then
It’s an awesome combination, hentai, 90s, sex, villain, in that specific order.
It’s funny and cool at the same time
Heihachi lied his ass off to look good, which everyone who didn't start with 7 has been saying all along. Remember, Heihachi, Scumbag supreme, told the Kazumi thing as a STORY to a reporter to make himself look goid. Basically, Heihachi being dishonest like he's been since T1.
    He can lie but Xiaoyu and Reina clearly loved him like a father. He really did treat them well .
    I dunno, Heihachi doing horrible things & becoming corrupt himself in order to destroy a great evil is fitting with the tragedy of the Mishima family.

   Both Kazuya & Jin were morally superior protagonists before their relentless desire for revenge pushed them to do horrible things.
        Except he was horrible long before the Kazumi thing, dude buried hus dad alive under his house. Dude starved yo death. Also it's clearly that Heihachi WANTS the devil gene, that's literally why he did everything he did. He was jelly it skipped him.
            I’m confused, I thought the Devil gene came through Kazumis blood & not through him? Goddamn retcons, hard to get the lore straight.

  I even forgot about Jinpachi.
                Yeah, the Kazumi thing wasn't until 7. And even then, it was a story Heihachi told a reporter to look like a hero. Not a retcon, just Heihachi being his deceitful self. Heihachi is like Shang Tsung, don't buy the bs he spouts, he'll manipulate you.
            The Devil Gene didn't skip him though. Jinpachi looks the way he does because he's literally a vengeful spirit back from the dead.
Hrm, thanks for the explanation.
Guess we won’t know until later.
Become the neutral butler and remain friendly with Jin
    T9 ending you probably are gonna be crawling out of a dormant volcano
        Do I get my own EWGF?
            The monkey paw side effect your children all have the heihachi hairline

*ALL of them*
                So I can clown my kids if they start talking shit? Bet
    He could be Wang 2 and be chill
        He will Wang for sure
Bro wants to be the male equivalent of Jun 😭
100% worth
Nah I’d sugarcoat it. Also I have made it one of my goals to break generational trauma.
    Bro unintentionally makes a small slip up and you get a brat version of Kaz because you didn't let him eat his favorite food on his favorite day
Yeah that looks dodgy. 

Seems to be a mix of very angry and positive (fake?) reviews.
https://au.trustpilot.com/review/www.jacketsjunction.com
Well good thing I didn’t pull the trigger on that 😅
She only has one other stance and all the buttons correspond the same(mid high low, etc) her stance stuff is not that complex and one of them is used rarely
    Think she has at least three stances. More if you count electrics
Unless she is but without y dna
calm and nice? most of tekken women are sociopaths.
Tbh kunimitsu 2 is more on the cute side even if she kills for money
Not Nina or Anna are aggresive.

And Kuni? This addorable little girl?
    2 out of 8089 characters bravo lol
But he hated the devil gene.
    He hated it because he didn't have it and he couldn't control it. Behind the scenes he was messing with Ogre's blood in an attempt to understand it better.
        damn...ogre reina would've been a cool twist on the idea
            Actually , yeah , it would been really cool, considering that jun is back , having to deal with the threat from a Reina Ogre would be interesting
She might be kazumi kid she has the resemblance
    Timeline doesn't work. Reina is in her early 20s at the oldest. She would have to be in her 40s to be Kazumi's daughter.
        she wouldn't be the first lady heihachi put on ice for a while
        probably shoved into cryogenics like the Williams sisters to stop the Devil gene manifesting or something if they wanna justify her being Kazumi's daughter. Or old man Heihachi had the sex somewhen after Tekken 2.
Didn't you know? When Nina was frozen they made a second Steve but infused with the super secret Angel gene sauce as a research experiment in a bunker 1500 meters below Borneo. It was Heihachi's real trump card!
    Oh the 2nd Steve, I sure hope he turns out less disappointing that the 1st Steve, that was sidelined to join the newly comedic DUO of Law and Paul.
He wanted to have the power to destroy it, and the power of it. His intentions weren't noble. He wanted what Kazuya obtained.
You only find out he's your dad once the male pattern baldness reveals it
    It's probably worse if you notice lightning when you punch someone
No he's not lol
    It was left open-ended. He didn't twitch or even move a finger, so they are free to take the story wherever they want when t9 comes out (in 7 to 10 years)
        There is literally no dialogue indicating that he's dead, the entire point was to remove the Devil's blood, Jin didn't want to kill him by the end of the game
You can set it up without making a character that blueballs me lol
Yeh, the subtitles says "You're done," but I hear "you're dumb," all the time. Same with his T8 rage art, I hear "black steel" instead of "like steel"😅
Not dead, dead. Presumed dead like how the story had it. Then the twist ending thing happens anyway.
in what universe does it take you a month to get around to watching a 3 hour movie if you care about spoilers? That's like a single lord of the rings film
damn straight fuck capitalism
    mommy cant pay for all of us can she
She didn't beat him up what are you on about? She caused some mild inconvenience at best. Her "beat him up" has the same energy as Jin "beat him up" in the first chapter, if Kazuya really wanted to he could finished the fight in a second.
    Yeah you’re probably right I only remembered it that way because as the player you’re supposed to win the fight I forgot about after lol, but still to say she has nothing to back it up I think is wrong.

What mug downvoted me your dad is 44 and still ringing man for a draw
Sure, Lars fought TDK as well but he's still some random Swedish twink
She beat him up?
Yeah so make her bland as fuck and hear people complain that she has no personality, so it fits most human being's personnality
The entire story mode is weeb af
Nah she doesn’t bro get use to how she looks and set her up for future games. Jin and kazuya’s roles are done so she is gonna be a focal character going foward
    What are you on about? OP asked if anyone else dislikes Reina and I’m simply responding to that. You can get “used to” something but still think something look like shit. Yeah, I will care less and less about Reina’s design and personality as time goes on, doesn’t mean I’m gonna think it’s not shit. 

This conversation isn’t even about Jin and Kazuya so idk why you dragged them into this. 

Maybe stop getting touchy cos a bunch of people dislike your “waifu” and go enjoy maining her instead?
        I already played tekken 8 bro
19 is still in high school
Heihachi was literally just an old man in a gi. Kazuya was the same but shirtless. You think those were creative?
    They are badass characters with simple designs unlike her, shes whatever
        You can just say you dont like women
            You wish, I like Zafina Jun and Julia so stop with the bs
            Aahh yaa im biggest mf misogynist in the world for criticizing Kardashians
Don’t tell me what to do bro
    I do as I please, not as I'm told, scum.
        Your scum bro telling me what to do in a rude way
From body type alone almost all characters would be on steroids, so it would make sense if the women were as well.
You can't change the world, fam. People will talk about the game in a group dedicated to the game. You can ask the entire world to change and hope for the best, or you can finish the story mode and/or watch it on YouTube.

Even in groups where mods have strict rules against spoilers for like a month after a TV episode people still post spoilers.

You know people will do it, so it's prudent to act in a way that accounts for it.
Can't go wrong
