[[Better late than never never, tips for yakuza 0 and the franchise as a whole]]


Just began my first ever playthrough of yakuza 0 and honestly I'm really excited, I know next to nothing of how to optimize my gameplay as I'm a newbie, what should I know?


For yakuza 0 I think in chapter 6 and 8 you’ll unlock a business minigame and a cabaret club minigame. Upon complete both their stories you’ll unlock 2 secret fighting styles, one for each.
    This, it's a game changer (pardon the pun). 

Also means you're not absolutely broke, and can actually afford and combat upgrades - most of which locked behind completing through the phases of thosr mingames. 

It almost felt like a whole different game. Too bad I didn't get to them until well after completing the story chapters.
Just be aware that Y0 is a game that was made after the first 5 came out, there's gonna be various roller coaster in quality of story and gameplay throughout the serie, so that you don't suddenly ask on Yk1 why something feels so sudden (it's cause they didn't really invest on remaking the story from the original Y1). And that the shift in gameplay is gonna be somewhat jarring.

Also, avoid this subreddit if you want to avoid spoilers, don't look up music video of Yakuza games either.
For Zero specifically:

1. You will be alternating between 2 protagonists every 2 chapters, so take care of what you want before you proceed. 

2. Do not blitz through the story. I know it can get really good and gripping, but take your time and complete side content. Do substories, definitely train with some of the masters you come across for new moves, and complete the major side content for the characters (Cabaret Club Czar and Real Estate Royale). 
These will unlock the locked up sections of your skill trees. Playing main game without some of these extra abilities can make it harder or less enjoyable as there is moves you won’t know about. 

3. Be prepared to cry. 


For the Yakuza franchise as a whole; 

1. Your first three games, Zero, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2, are all much more recently made than 3, 4 and 5. Zero is a prequel that was made after 5. Kiwami 1 was made after Zero as a remake of the first game from 2005, and Kiwami 2 was made after 6, as a remake of the second game. 
I’m saying all this because a big hurdle for some fans is the drop in production value from Kiwami 2 to Yakuza 3. Kiwami 2 was a game released in 2017 (JP) while Yakuza 3 is a game released in 2009. So just be aware that there will be a difference between K2 and 3. 

2. Style switching is a thing only in Zero and Kiwami, and is not seen in any other games. Y4 and Y5 have multiple protagonists that all have their own fighting styles, but it’s not the same as Zero. 

3. Tiger Drop is your best friend. 

4. Kiwami 1 has some pretty cruel boss fights, so stock up on healing items and make sure to be leveled up. 

5. Have fun.

Edit: also, premium adventure is available, it’s a post game mode to explore the world and complete any leftover side content you didn’t get to before finishing the game.
Don't just focus on main story. Take some time in between chapters to play minigames and side stories. They are really enjoyable and side stories in Yakuza games have really good stories.
    Am I at some forced to keep playing the main story? Like a time based thing where you can only do so much between some plot events
        It happens sometime when you are in a specific location for a chapter or some roads are blocked due to story purposes like in the start but these type of restrictions are not that long. It's like when you complete a level, you are free to do anything after. But these cases are rare in the game.
        No, you can take all the time you want with the story stuff.
            Siiiiick
L2 lets you press triangle without triggering a heat action
At some point a certain someone will ask you to choose between 2 boxes. Choose the black one, both times.
    Okay, Waltuh. I will keep that in mind
Prepare yourself for the big jump back to 2008 going from Kiwami 2 to 3, seriously it will take time to adjust
It might be obvious, but still. Whenever a character wants you to confirm proceeding with a story mission (e.g. "This looks dangerous, if I'm going there I'd better be prepared") it usually means a long fighting segment is ahead, so don't be shy about taking a step back, stocking up on healing items and saving your game.
For Y0 specifically:

1. Always try to carry healing items(staminan or toughness) with you, but if you need healing while walking around the city go to restaurants and eat instead.

2. Take your time with the main story. There is no rush, so walk around Kamurocho and Sotenbori and look for substories. Substories are fun little side quests that give decent rewards and unlock new content, you should always seek them out and do as many as possible. 

3. Discover your combat style trainers and do their training as soon as you can. Doing the training unlocks new abilities, rewards you with consumables and make you stronger in general. 

4. At one point you will unlock the Real estate and the Cabaret Club mini games. Do those as early as possible. These mini games are the main way to generate a lot of money which will allow you to level up your combat styles making you stronger and combat more fun.

Other than that, just enjoy the game and play it however you like. There is a lot to do in these games, it will take hundreds of hours to play through the series.
Most of what I mention above apllies to all of the games, you will discover the differences if you play through the series.
If at any time you need advice or are stuck there is only one thing online you need to check.  CyricZ. 
He's got walkthroughs and advice for all the yakuza games from 0 to 8, judgement and even first of the north star.
Y0 was my first game with this style of combat, and the biggest thing I learned was to always prioritize positioning over getting another hit in. Getting surrounded can quickly lead to you being juggled.

Other than that, have fun! Don't get too hung up on 100%ing it, everything except one achievement can be done after you've finished the main plot.
You’ll have a blast with it. I usually play turned based strategy and role playing games, and yakuza was a very different experience for me but I’m hooked. Played straight through 0, kiwami 1 and 2. Have one more achievement to get the platinum on 2, and already have 3-6 and like a dragon bought and ready to go. All that to say, you’re in a great spot - enjoy!
For Yakuza 0, make sure to buy plenty of healing and mp items (can’t remember what the stat is, but it’s basically your mp), the regular convenience store ones are fine. Don’t be afraid to use them either, it’s very easy to make money in this game so there’s no point in being shy about buying recovery items.

Don’t give up if you lose a few times; the game hits you with a lot of really tough boss fights - but all that trial and error really comes through as you continue in the game. It’s really that arcade style reflex based fighting.

Also, do the side stories if you can - they reeeeally showcase the type of humor the studio can bring to the game.

Edit: Why the downvote? Lol

Oh, also - focus in on your favorite style; the game never forces you into one or the other outside the tutorials. Scope out the upgrades that benefit them all too, no point in missing out on net bonuses, because they all have them.
Have fun and you cant miss anything
