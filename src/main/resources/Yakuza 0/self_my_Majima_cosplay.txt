[[[self] my Majima cosplay]]





Now the real question. Where did you get the shoes?
    I‚Äôve bought snake pattern shoes on AliExpress and my costume crafter made all furniture on them
        Ah epic. Thanks my man.
    [deleted]
        Definitely boot and definitely not snakeskin. Guess im stuck with the sketchy ones from china on ebay.
        Yes, can see either of those or Tom Ford.
    I also need to know this
        Happy cake day bro
            Happy cake day, too!
Hahaha nice try using an image from the game

*...wait a sec..*
WHAT? I THOUGHT THIS WAS A BLOODY DRAWING YOU LOOK JUST LIKE GORO-CHAN
    I thought it was a screenshot before i read the title
        my god, same! it's insane lol
        I'm not convinced it's not.
THIS IS PERFECT YOU LOOK EXACTLY LIKE MAJIMA
    he IS Majima now
        It's only a matter of time until Kiryu is real, and then OP can initiate the Majima Everywhere System.
You sure you‚Äôre not just majima transported to real life? That looks so good oml
Cosplay? That‚Äôs a lie. You‚Äôre him.
This is brilliant and all, but now we wanna see Goromi!
    I also made Goromi so will post her photos soon, now they are on my Instagram everybery_art
        the goromi pics look amazing! i‚Äôm kinda convinced u just are majima lol
    He did a v day set as well!
GORO MAJIMA IRL??!!? WHERE!!111!1
That's rad.

Now where's your Demonfire Dagger!?
Dedication tattoos and everything great job you look just like him
The odds of being attacked by real life majima are low. But never zero.
Yep
I'm gay
    Dudes are pretty cute huh
        Yeah
        Yeah, and girls too ngl
            This person is an absolute blessing to the earth we call mother
Fake! that's real majima smh
10/10 kyodai
God is real, and he is in that image!
This is actually perfect! You nailed everything! Did you make the shoes yourself or did you buy them? I want to do a Majima cosplay and I can't find shoes like that.
    Thank you! My costume crafter made them
THAT LOOKS AMAZING DUDE!  Great cosplay!
Umm sorry but please, if they ever make a US Movie adaptation, please play the role of Majima-chan
Damn you must have handmade that shit for it to look that good
[deleted]
    You just found out today?
        [deleted]
            Don't worry, everyone discovers their Majimasexuality at different points in life.
WE FOUND REAL LIFE MAJIMA
JESUS, THIS IS UNCANNY. IT‚ÄôS LIKE YOU‚ÄôRE ACTUALLY HIM
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna need a link to that jacket unless you made it yourself
    My costume crafter made it :3
i thought this was a render or something lol
this is definitely something majima would do... swap realities and pretend to be himself ?
Holy shit!
Shameless self promotion. Can we please, please have more? Please?
I regret clicking on your profile
Yoooo your cosplay is so good!!
Lookin good!
HOLY KIRYU chan...I had to zoom in, clear my eyes, use a magnifying glass do about 6 takes...cause you sir became majima Goro!!! I've never seen cosplay this level.
    Check the profile thoroughly if you want your mind blown a second time. Simply amazing stuff
Ah yes, Majima cosplaying as Majima
"Oi! Who've I gotta fuck to get a damn refill in this joint!?"

Awesome cosplay, all the little details make it feel so genuine
Should‚Äôve replaced Goro Kishitani with you in the movie bruh. Lowkey jealous üòÇ
Wtf this is perfect I def thought this would be a bit cringe
Where'd you get the shoes? Also nice cosplay
When they said Majima Everywhere they meant it
Holy fuck, I‚Äôm stunned. Like everyone else, you could have convinced me this was from the game. Fantastic job
Rtx on
Looks wise at least you could be him in a live action adaptation. That cosplay is spot on
this will be yakuza graphics in 2014
Your post history makes it even better, no harm meant
    Big Majima energy
    This makes this way more impressive considering the starting point
This sub is insanely good at cosplay
My god you should ask Sega for a job as a model.
I am looking üëÄ respectfully.

Still not certain this isn't a very, very good render. Too perfect for reality.
Holy shit Majima is real!

This photo makes me bi-curious
Wooooooow üò≥üò≥üò≥

joking aside, that level of detail is insane! i don't think anyone is gonna top this anytime soon! i'm impressed!
Well, guess I'm gay now
I'm calling bullshit
    Did bullshit answer?
        Yes    bullshit said this pic is so realistic it cant tell if it's real or fake

Jesus man I didn't think this was real. Impeccable job
When will we see Everyone‚Äôs Idol Goro?
    I was thinking about this outfit and even bought shoes and feather but... I don‚Äôt think now I will do it cause I‚Äôve started it before quarantine a year ago but had no chance to finish it so much time passed
        Hope we see it someday! You look really accurate to majima when you cosplay him!
            Thank you! Maybe, who knows, now I‚Äôm in the process of making zero and kenzan versions
Yeah wait can you send me a link to 100% of those items retail?

Oh wow, take me now
Some thirsty ass fuckers in this sub. Not without reason like, you're pretty fit.
Holy hell you‚Äôre real life Majima-san
Incredible
This is one of the most accurate and best cosplay I have seen
If I may ask, where would a guy or gal get such a snazzy lookin' garb, such as yourself?
Oh wow i thought it was a screenshot from the game. Well done sir

Where's the cosplay?

Btw those Ps5 graphics are looking realistic!
I didn't read the caption and thought this is from the game.Holy fuck.
Awesome cosplay!
If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, where did you buy the shoes and the blazer? I was planning on cosplaying as Majima at this convention later this year.
    It‚Äôs all made by my costume crafter, I didn‚Äôt buy it so it‚Äôs hand made
Holy shit this is actually one of the most spot on cosplays I‚Äôve seen, looks just like him
Just think of the construction song loool great cos play BTW üòé

Are you sure Majima wasn't just cosplaying you? Holy shit.
He‚Äôs in his secret base after running away from Kamuroch≈ç
Holy shit I thought this was a good ass drawing or a pic for the movie but it was you Majima no niisan
Kiryu: WHY THE FUCK ARE IN MY HOUSE!

Majima: to fight ya...duh.

Damn! 11/10üëå
Not usually a fan of cosplay but damn.
"Holy shit!"
Holy shit this is amazing you look just like majima
That is crazy. I want to get some tats inspired by the game but dont know anyone who I would trust to do it justice.
This is some freaking quality cosplay!
Holy shitballs. I know I‚Äôm basically echoing at this point, but if someone told me this was an in-game screenshot I wouldn‚Äôt have questioned it for an instant. Stellar work dude.
This is PERFECT! Can I get a hug?
Badass, very well done man üôåüèΩ
Chest tattoo.

Nice game screensho...

Wait a minute ....

You even nailed the attitude!!! So awesomeeee!<3
So, you wanna go to the batting range sometime üëâ üëà ?
How long did it take to make this? And how much did it cost?
Damn, this is really nice cosplay in general. You really pulled it off.
I‚Äôve never felt inclined to stalk someone before, but...damn..haha. 

Seriously, this is an incredible cosplay. I‚Äôm blown away by this. Great job!
Holy FUCK this is perfect.
Yo holy shit your a fucking body double for Majima
Pretty cool man

Ano...Can I, um, interest you in a date Goro-kun ü•∫üòç I'm a cute shawty who loves Yakuza, whiskey, hookah and deep, intellectual convos ü§©
Love it
Nice
I hope your still answer questions on this bv I want to know if you just got the tattoo drawn so it was just visible or if you got the tattoo Majima has because you're that big of a fan
I thought this was a CG render lol, amazing
Please tell me you have more photos to post because this is SO GOOD.
He's fucking real. I'm done.
Omfgggg!! We need more pictures of your cosplay üò≠üò≠üò≠

You're a god of cosplay. I thought it was a scene from the games, then I thought it was from a high budget film, then I read the title. This is so well and the best I've ever seen. I aren't even being sarcastic either.
