[[Upcoming Balance Changes for Support Heroes]]





Sometimes I use Nano just to save my main tank with the def+, now this will work even better!
    Nanoing a hooked target is a good start to not losing a team fight.
        Also makes for great comedy as the Hog’s team realizes he just yanked a superpowered angry German man into the middle of their formation.
            I always feel bad when I displace a Rein only for him to get nano'd and kill our team. :C
            I FEEEEEEL UNSTOPPABLE! AHAHAHAH!!

Not quite the middle of their formation but I did basically kill my own Hanzo with what you described. :<

            "Guten tag!" - superpowered, angry, German man
        oh snap!

now you can actually start the fight that way if they hook your genji.

        I've had so many times where my tanks are playing so passively that I just Nano my Rein (cross my fingers) and we break the choke and cap the point. 
            I wish. I will nano my rein, fire shots into him, nade him, and say "I gotcha, Rein" and he will protect himself with his shield.
                As a tank main, sometimes I don't have a choice. 

Nothing worse than getting nano'd on a long kill zone when the enemy rein has shatter.
                aww.. people just don't play a lot with ana anymore these days, i am sure it will change before long.

for example: way back in the day a rein would not swing his hammer when i (zen) was trancing all around him but these days they almost all do that.
        Offensive Rein is best Rein!  

Edit: *You're powered up, get in there!*
            I AM UNSTOPPABLE!
        Eeeeh... If you want them to stop nanoing you for almost no reason, just don't play the way they want you to. Keep doing what you do if you really want them to stop :P
            I want to play with the team, but whenever I get a good Ana they just keep me alive no matter how stupid a thing I do!
                So YOU'RE one of those kinds of Reinhardts that enables the Anas to give nano boosts randomly! Please stop, you need to play more cautious.
        I refuse to stop enabling my tanks to ruin the other team's day. >:(
        nah, you just need to know when you have an ana with nano behind you and when you have a mercy/zen instead :P
        I almost always boost rein, as I play a lot of rein myself.  It's just a satisfying feeling.

 "Swing the hammer buddy.  Swing that hammer".
        I would like to state for the record the situations you put me in drastically lower my life expectancy.
            In all fairness they drastically lower mine in game.
        There is nothing I love more than wrecking face as Reinhardt.

Bonus if someone says "I have no idea how you did that rein"
    I can tell you play ana well. She is one support I love to play. I also know I'm always outhealing because of that nade burst haha. Gold healing for days.
**For those of you at work :**

_______

*In the next patch we’re reviewing the current state of support heroes and are making some changes to nearly all of them to keep them competitive with each other. I’ll start by just listing the changes below:*

**Ana**

- Nano Boost additionally heals the target instantly for 300 HP.

**Brigitte** 

- Shield Bash cooldown increased from 6 to 7 seconds.

**Lúcio**

- Sound Barrier effect increased 50% from 500 to 750 shields.
- Crossfade aura radius increased 20% from 10m to 12m.

**Mercy**

- Primary fire healing beam reduced 17% from 60 HP/s to 50 HP/s.

**Moira**

- Healing resource base regen rate increased 20%.

__________________________________

*Now that all the changes are listed, I’ll go through each hero and talk a bit about the goals of these changes and our current views on each support hero in general.*

**Ana**

*Ana has a very strong and unique toolbox, with the potential to dish out more healing than any other hero in the game. That said, she has a couple disadvantages that can be difficult to overcome, such the potential to miss your targets, not having any mobility options, and having a more difficult time keeping herself healed up. Her ultimate can be very powerful but often feels like it can be difficult to use effectively unless it is used in combination with other allied ultimates such as Genji’s Dragonblade. This new change allows Ana to use her ultimate as a clutch save on a dying teammate, or even use it in combination with her Biotic Grenade for a huge instant heal on even the biggest of tank health pools.*

**Brigitte**

*Shield Bash is Brigitte’s strongest ability, and its short cooldown makes it very difficult to play around. We’d like to keep her Shield Bash and subsequent melee combos powerful and effective, while just allowing a little more counter-play against it. We’ve talked about possibly reducing her defense somewhere, such as reducing her barrier health. However, her tank-hybrid nature is a core part of her kit and we want to make sure she maintains that feeling of being a difficult target to take down. Overall Brigitte’s win rate is still the highest of any support, despite dishing out the lowest amount of raw healing per second. This speaks volumes to how powerful her kit can be outside of her direct healing numbers.*

**Lúcio**

*Lucio’s Crossfade aura can be an invaluable addition for any team, but it can sometimes be difficult to keep your whole team boosted. We’re increasing the radius of Lucio’s Crossfade aura to allow more flexibility in how he moves while still maintaining his powerful support songs to help out his team. His ultimate is also being increased to help counter large spikes of damage. For example, Junkrat’s ultimate can deal a maximum of 600 damage, which Sound Barrier can now potentially negate completely. It is worth noting that even though the initial shield he provides is larger, it still takes the same amount of time to destroy itself.*

**Mercy**

*Mercy is intended to be able to consistently pump out more healing than any other healer over the course of a match. While this is currently true, the difference in healing is so significant that it makes it very difficult for other healers to compete with her for a spot on a team. Reducing her healing output will close this gap a little, but she will still maintain her status as the go-to pick for raw healing power. We’ll keep an eye on her to make sure she is still a strong pick.*

**Moira**

*Moira is a strong hero that doesn’t need a ton of changes. The resource change her is mostly to help her out in the situations where you’re just not able to get close enough the enemy to drain them for resources. Now if you’re team is sparring with the enemy team at super long ranges, you’ll have a bit more resources to work with to keep your team topped off.*

**Zenyatta**

*We aren’t making any changes to Zen right now, as we feel he is in a pretty good spot. He is doing his job well as a hybrid damage/healer and being able to provide discord orb for your team will always be welcome.*

_________

*These changes are coming to the PTR very soon. We’re always looking at our stats, gathering feedback 6 and playing the game to make sure we keep all the heroes viable. We will have time to watch and iterate on these changes throughout this PTR cycle, so please play and give feedback!*
    Thanks for posting this!
        No prob - glad I was finally in a situation where I could make it and pay it forward for once
    No reloading for transcendance yet... Keep fighting, my omnic brothers.

>Channeled and transformation ultimate abilities now restore ammunition after completion for some heroes

>Channeled abilities affected: Junkrat’s RIP-Tire, Pharah’s Barrage, Roadhog’s Whole Hog, and **Zenyatta’s Transcendence**

            [deleted]
                Is it? I mean, I see no reason not to do this, but Roadhog ults usually go one of two ways: Hog dies. Hog kills his enemy(ies).

Don't usually see a scenario where Hog needs to keep fighting, but doesn't have ammo. 

But I'm sure this will help with that fringe case. :)
                    It’s usually against a dva that manages to eat the last bit of your ult. If she’s already in your face when you finish, and you got no ammo, she can do a lotta damage while youre reloading and healing
            Was just about to post this link. Glad to see they are changing that!
        The new PTR update has reload for Trans now. Hog, Winston, Genji, Pharah, Junkrat, and Zen now have full ammo after ult. https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/overwatch-ptr-patch-notes-july-18-2018/163715
            Glad they made it consistent across all of them. They added it to reaper a while ago
        As a zen main I hope he never gets buffed, the last thing I want is them to buff him, make him op, then give him a rework and ruin him.
            As a D.Va main I can relate a lot.

My primary support hero is Angela, so again: I can relate A LOT.
        Ehh Zen's good enough. Plan your reload imo
            Can't always plan your reload when you have to trans before dying/getting earthshattered.
                Neither does/can Hog when he hooks.....

I main Zen... It doesn't bother me that I don't get a free reload on trans.
                    20 balls is a lotta balls. I rarely run out before either I or my enemies die
                    But hog isn’t meant to protect a team from an ultimate with his trans. Hog SHOULD have a shot ready when hooking, if not it’s not a valuable hook unless your team is with you to follow up 
        It's been added in this week's PTR patch.
    Not all heroes wear capes.
        Do they ever die though?

            #NO CAPES!
            Capes never die!
                For a price.  Consult your tailor for details.

    Thank you!
    Exactly what Overwatch needed. Tone down Brigitte and Mercy while bringing up the rest
    Unemployed here. Why wouldn’t they have access to the website?

Somebody hold me.
    "...So please play and give feeback!"

Not if you're on console though, fuck your consoles.
    I feel like there's a joke or pun somwhere about zenyatta being the that they consider balanced. But I'm too tired to figure it out.
    FFS, yet another mercy nerf and worse, while everyone else got a buff... 
    WTF is wrong with Blizzard...

Originally Mercy had 50 hps, they buffed her healing to 60 hps because she was weak and now they nerf her again?

Do they even know what they are doing? Moira is better than Mercy anyway...

I think it is time for me to find new game...
That Ana change is quite interesting, as a support main i'm very interested in how this plays out.
    It's probably one of, if not the most, recommended change I've seen to Ana, at least around this sub. It will be interesting to see if Rein's start charging in *before* getting Nano'd so that they get the full advantage of the heal.
        Hitting the Rein towards the end of his charge with nano has always been a great way to get value out of it.  This buff seems to now make it *the best* way to get said value.
        > It will be interesting to see if Rein's start charging in before getting Nano'd so that they get the full advantage of the heal.

It would be a waste not to. You charge in, you draw attention of their entire team and maybe even a couple CD's, then you get healed back to full health and have damage boost and damage resistance. You can have a heyday while the enemy team needs to back off and/or shift target priority, and the rest of your team is cleaning up. You're trading your 300HP (which you know you'll get back soon) to force investment of resources from the enemy, so there's an opportunity cost of *not* taking advantage of that free 300HP in that you've allowed the enemy to be in a stronger position than they could have been.
            I like to charge in and land a shatter before the boost but im normally low health.  This fixes that.
        That and it works through barriers. She finally has a way to do an emergency barrier bypassing heal. Not sure if this will be enough but it should help her out at the very least.
        yup it's one of the 2 things I wanted,

The other is the nade going through full health allies.
            >I curse when my nade blows up on full health allies at least once every other game.
                At least.

And don't come and tell me I need to "position better" it happens to everyone at every level. Often time your nade blows up on someone clipping through you from behind.
                    Im not crazy then! I knew someone one hit my arm from behind and made me drop that nade on my self! 
            Or just through allies in general. When are you gonna need to bodyshot an ally with a nade that you can't hit the floor for instead?
                while it might makes sense, there's still a lot of case where directly hitting your allies is faster/easier/the only solution.

Also, the nade is realllllllllllllllly powerfull and if you could easily toss it in the middle of a front line , hit everyone allies and foes it might be too powerfull for a single ability and will need to be tone down somewhere else.

I'd rather have this ability to be more reliable (not being wasted on a flying mercy or a hugging torbjorn) without making it even more powerfull than it already is.
            I feel like a good option for this is to use E to throw the nade and then push E or RMB to detonate. That way you could throw it through crowds and choose when to detonate to maximize allies/enemies hit. 
            It'd be great if the hitbox was at least fixed. Trying to throw a nade around an Orisa or Rein at a choke is basically impossible.
        The reason she is off meta is her total lack of self-sustain and mobility.  Not that her nano target dies.
            Buffing her ultimate makes her better at her job though. She doesn’t have the self-sustain of other supports, which is a weakness, but now she is getting a buff to her strength which is enabling her teammates. That’s the Overwatch philosophy: makes strengths strong and weaknesses hard to overcome without teamwork or hero-switching. 
            Yeah, but I haven't actually seen frequent and consistent suggestions on how to fix those two. Nano Boost had more obvious buffs. I do agree this probably won't make her meta alone.
                I think making her reload heal her would be an interesting and unique way to give her a self heal, yet keep it limited.   She is all about being able to do many things, but not simultaneously.   I don't think a life steal or symbiosis self heal fits her design.   She is all about making conscious decisions with deliberate outcomes. 
    I edited my original comments/post and moved to Lemmy, not because of Reddit API changes, but because spez does not care about the reddit community; only profits. I encourage others to move to something else.
        Yea especially during those panic ults.
        Now they just need to let you reverse a D.va Meka death by healing it before she jumps out (it is seriously so annoying to think you healed her just in time only to see her jump out of a Meka that is now sitting at 30% HP). lol
        Playing on the edge. Spicy.
    I'm excited for it. This will let you pump up your dying tank to turn a fight around in a lot of scenarios where you simply couldn't before. 
        I’ve been playing a fair amount of rein lately and let me tell you, this makes me really happy. 
    [deleted]
        Remember that Ana didn't have any extra mobility or self-sustain back when the was the core of the triple tank meta, though. I think the devs consider those weaknesses to be a core part of her character.
            Yeah, it seems that if her ult is useful enough, people will play around her weaknesses (Sombra has encountered this before too). Without that, other heroes are more appealing. This could be exactly the change she needs.
                If they'd made it a smaller heal and also a speed boost they probably wouldn't have felt the need to nerf Brigitte's shield. 
            She did have a helluva lot more healing output, more damage output, and nano gave a speed boost as well. Nades did 60 damage and added 100% healing bonus.

She was a huge pick because her downsides didn't overwhelm her upsides, like they do now.
            She was the core of triple tank because her healing was extremely high and she could easily kill divers by herself.
            Also remember that Lucio and Roadhog were much stronger back then as well and could easily peel for Ana.

Then, they were nerfed and Winston buffed, resulting in the rise of dive, which really screwed Ana over. 
            Also keep in mind that the Ana that ruled the roost back in the day also dealt more damage per shot, her nade dealt more damage, and her healing boost was stronger. Game has changed a lot, yes, but old Ana was also stronger. She was a 1v1 powerhouse.
        [deleted]
            But her counterpart Mercy got nerfed so we'll see.
        No, but at least the gap between her and mercys heal is smaller 
        Good, she should keep her unique weaknesses while buffing her strengths. 
            Agreed, heal denial and sleep are already super powerful in skilled hands. Increasing her mobility would be a pretty terrible idea. All heroes have their strengths and weaknesses, increasing her mobility/giving her a self heal would swing her into too OP 
    it fills a similar function to rez, if you think about it - you bring back squishies to full health and a substantial amount of healing on tanks - and then they get 50% DR to boot

wonderful!
        I had the exact same thought! Instant full health for a squishy that was about to die is basically a res. Quite a bit better than res in many circumstances, actually. Nano builds fast enough that you can use it very disposably, as well. 
    I feel like it won't make new people play Ana, but those that did will want to play her more... if that makes sense.

Ana has a hard time staying alive especially when targeted by multiple enemies. The change isn't going to do anything for that, but as fast as she generates ult, it will make her a better healer.

I think she's always going to be overly vulnerable; that's clearly her design. However, she needed a little something to encourage people to play her over other supports. This might push a few Ana lovers to keep picking her at the very least.
        I love playing Ana, but she doesn't need self heal.
    It's a nice change but Ana still needs a self heal other than the nade. Make her heal herself for a small amount each time she shoots an ally. 
        Ana’s largest issue is that she cannot devote all of her uptime to healing while every other healer can. 

First, Ana has to reload her heal effect. No other healer has to do this with the same totality as Ana. While she is healing, Ana is still forced to interrupt her output for a solid two seconds to reload her gun. If she does not have her Granada available, no healing at all. If she is forced to engage an enemy, she cannot heal her team. Every other support can provide some healing output at all times, even when their abilities are down or they’re engaging an enemy. The only exception to this rule is Mercy, however she still passively heals herself, and her high mobility easily remedies weakness. 

Second, too much of Anas utility is tied to her grenade. While having a grenade that does 4 things is useful, it’s caused balance issues, and reinforces Anas issue with healing uptime. She relies on the grenade to heal herself, yet she needs to have it available to address any flankers or team pushes. If Ana had two grenades, one yellow, one purple, that each performed one half of her current grenade but on two separate cooldowns, players would be able to preserve one that might be needed soon but where both halves aren’t necessary. 

Lastly, Ana is requires line of sight but lacks the mobility to maintain it, decreasing uptime and mitigating her advantage at range. With barriers, body blocks, altitude changes, and just lots of stuff, Ana can not afford to be low to the ground. She needs to keep an eye on the entire battlefield, which requires her to reposition frequently. While she can certainly shoot on the move, she needs to hobble her old body to the high ground for the angle, which requires several seconds. 
        Let her stab one of her darts into her thigh. She would have to channel it so she can't do it in the middle of a fire fight, but she can duck around corners to heal
            Just steal some hogdrogen
Hype! Finally after all the times I nano-boosted that Genji and had him die right away because I couldn't heal him before-hand!
    Now all Ana has to do is give the heads up she's nano-ing because one problem I have is I always seem to have to reload right as she nano's me, lol
        I can see it potentially playing out similar to Winston’s ult. Get in there, do some damage. Lose some health and then get hit with a nano to bring you back up. 
            And continue on a rampage.  Could work well with dive tanks.  Think about it, they jump in, take damage, you nade and nano them, now they're up 550 health AND have effectively double health and extra damage.
                and take less damage too
                    ** effectively double health.  My mistake in my post.
            The Nano/Winston combo has the potential to be so broken.  
Winston dives enemy team.  
Winston's health gets low, Primal Rages.  
Ana farms Ult off Primal Winston.  
Primal Ends.  
Winston starts charging Ult again.  
Ana Nano's Winston when he gets low.  
Winston can now sustain longer and deals so much more cleave damage that he could potentially charge a second Ultimate.


                Doesn't sound easier or more effective than grav dragon combo already is
                    It's not meant to. Ults have more usage than just pure damage.
            Or chain it with his ult to do it twice in a row. Scientist jumps in, takes damage, ults, knocks people around, takes damage, gets boosted, melts face.
        Just buff Ana again to make it so the person she boosts instantly reloads lol
            I always wanted an ability to give a reset a teamates cool downs.  It could also counter sombras hack or ult.
        I don't always get nano'd but when I do I always need to reload and miss out on half of the ult
            When you get nano’d as Orisa and you have to reload is just painful.
    Looks like it’s time to put my stereo down and dust off my gun :)
        Now is the time to pick the stereo up and play a little game called "get down Mr. President".
    Don't worry. With the Lucio buff he is gonna get played more and will just jump in front of nano anyway.

BOOSTIO!!!!
    Or if you’re playing Genji/ Rein and trying to dance around the insane focus which makes it harder to get healed and hoping you get a kill or two and don’t disappoint your Ana. :/
Ahhhhhh finllay a buff to lucios ult. Its always been outclassrd by trance but maybe it'll see more use!
    It's still outclassed by trans. It's instant, you can trans before an EMP without it getting canceled, block an unboosted dragonstrike, a boosted dragonblade, rocket barrage from not close up and many more. Soundbarrier is only good for small damage on allies that are far apart. Also beat into a push and then can everyone go their way.
        I find Sound Barrier is at its best when it's used as a shield against massive, predictable damage -- mainly RIP Tire and Self-Destruct. It'll also dampen (but not negate) Dragonblade and Tactical Visor -- that second one at least until everyone has a chance to find cover.
        Dragon strike can't be damaged boosted anymore, so it's once again a perfect counter to it too. Still needs a charge time buff and to not lose his ult when casted.
            > Dragon strike can't be damaged boosted anymore, 

What? I read all the patchnotes but might have missed this one. Is this on live servers too?
                It's not live IIRC, but it is on PTR.
This is huge
    IKR!!!! I love this!! I hope this leads to more diverse support meta. Also, as a casual player and Mercy main, I love that this is the kind of nerf they did - just a straight numbers tweak, without changing how she feels to play.
        Uh wait bro, that heal rate nerf is basically a dive comp Buff. [Seagull quote: Winston can now outdmg her heal]
Im really hoping it too though. Need Ana back!
            While -technically- winston can outdamage her healing, once you consider reload time, he doesn't. 300 damage vs 325 healing over 6.5 seconds.
                I think he quoted it on a Zen when the zen is allready low iirc. So basically a classic dive comp scenario.
                    But at 10dp/s it'll take 20 seconds to kill a zen. Altho counteracting mercy healing is a big deal
                Those scenarios make no sense though. Dive means a winston, a d.va, a genji and potentially a tracer all jump the same target at the same time. Healing does not matter in that instance because the burst is too much. This is why brigitte is so strong against dive, she doesn't just heal, she increases the health threshold above a point where the target just gets instagibbed. And her stun also helps because a stunned target does 0 dps.
                bruh if winston is shooting you for 6 seconds without dying or having to run you've lost the group fight
            Lucio now counters deathball's grav combo AND synergies even better with dive as well. Dive is definitely coming back. 
            More diverse support meta... hes not wrong.
            Except... a dive comp isn't going to make Ana come back. If anything, it puts her in an even worse position than she's at now.
        Note that this is also a nerf to her ult's healing, and its charge rate, as well
    yeah, saw people asking for nanobost buff like hour ago. It's not a speed buff but I think instaheal is actually very well designed buff.
    i have no idea why nobody posted this

edit* Credit to /u/ImaMew for adding Moira!
    Not sure, people are already saying that Winston, D.Va and Wrecking Ball are a very strong combo and it can easily shutdown an Ana. I hope I’m wrong.
        Seagull foreshadowed this on his stream when he was talking to the developers. For those unaware, he basically broke down the possibility of a triple tank dive comp.

* Winston jumping on you with jump pack and isolating you in a bubble with tesla cannon
* Dva shoving matrix and missiles in your face
* Hammond landing on you and knocking you up

Those 3 tanks landing on a single person will be so much burst damage. Like how do you even peel for that? 

-

Lucio Ana was pretty much the ideal support pairing back in the day, but a single boop will not stop all those tanks from just completely murdering your backline. 

You could play Brigitte, but then you lack tank killing tools like discord.

If you play Zen Ana, fucking good luck trying to survive with the two most least mobile heros in the game.

If you play Mercy Ana, then you have no defensive ultimate for team wipe combos.

If you play triple support, then how do you kill the tanks? It'll be like a fucking mosh pit if both teams run triple tank.

-

That said, we don't know how it will play out when Hammond reaches live. He could be like release day-Orisa and he might need changes to be usable in ladder.

I'm excited though. Healer changes and a new tank has to shake the meta at least a little bit.


            > Hammond landing on you and knocking you up

OwO

                    And occasionally, they'll eat them.
            Clearly, you amp speed boost Ana to safety around a corner and engage full boostio mode.

 **CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?!?**
            Yeah, but if you have like a Rein/Zarya/Brigitte, would that lose straight up?  No idea because I haven't touched Hammond on PTR, but a mix of bubbles, CC, and hammer-swinging seems to be capable of punishing such a dedicated dive.  Might need to have a Mercy on hand for an instant revive dedicated against those dives.
                If we'll coordinated dva boost melee + pile-driver +jump punch does 215 burst damage.
            TBH we were already seeing 3tank/3heal comps, i guess seeing it spread wouldn't be too surprising.
                Goats comp is not really dive just hold “w” type of thing. 
            Would Orisa help out against this comp with fortify and halt?
                Probably? Dva can eat the halt though.

However compared to when dive took over against the old triple tank with old soldier, we have a lot more tools to deal with dive now.

New Junkrat, New Hanzo, and Brigitte could pose major problems for triple tank dive and might stop the idea altogether. It definitely sounds insane on paper though.


            The thing is that even Doomfist will be strong in the 3x tank dive. Even Blizzard buffed Moira for the tanks. You can swap dps or any other healer to adjust for maps or counter comps. 
            Buff Roadhog for balance against dive ez.
            That’s actually scary, but since Hammond is a high skill hero maybe support players can have some time to figure out to play against him before people start getting really good with him. 

It’s funny how people complain about symmetra but she alone could actually negate all this heavy dive with her teleport. 

            I think you'd counter flying goats (Ham/Win/DVa) with ground goats. Matrix wont block Zarya/Rein left click, Winston is too squishy to survive without Matrix, theres a ton of healing and no good dive target because everyone plays super close together. It'll definitely be the moshpit meta.
    Moira should probably be added to this pic since Ana+Moira is a surprisingly good combo.

(Edited a second time to make Moira more transparent)
        IIRC this picture is from Moira was in game, when the Triple tank+Ana was the meta.

                Holy shit that is incredible!
                    Thank you! Also thanks for the edit in your post! I just edited both my links because I made Moira more transparent. Feel free to update yours as well! <3
                        Updated!
Something that should be noted is that right now on the ptr Mercy can no longer damage-boost certain projectile ultimates (Hanzo's Dragons). That's another nerf that hasn't gone live yet.
    Does dragon strike ignore all damage boosts (super charger/nano)? 
        I think there was a comment in another thread that said yes, blizzard made you unable to damage boost it in any way
            Then while this is definitely a shot at mercy I'm glad it does apply to everyone.  It would have been ***super*** dick to just stop mercy from damage boosting.  Though I'm assuming since Zen applies a "Debuff" that damage will still be added to dragon strike since It's not affecting the base ability. 
            theyre giving it the Riptire treatment being that its an entity separate from Hanzo -- tbh it was an inconsistency in ults that can be dmg boosted that always irked me
                It's not an inconsistency, the only things you can't damage boost are torb turret and rip tire, separate entities in that they have their own health bars. Hanzo ultimate should be damage boost- able as long as things like D.va's self destruct is.
        I'm not sure
        Yes
    Wasnt this already added previously though? It was at least announced last week
        Yea it's been on the ptr for a week or so. I just wanted to point out that Mercy has a nerf, aside from the ones listed here, that hasn't gone live yet.
    I don't play Mercy often, but when I do, I'm never really familiar with how damage boost works. Does it still apply if the projectile has already been fired once you boost? Which ultimates apply?
        > Does it still apply if the projectile has already been fired once you boost? 

The game checks for the boost effect at the moment damage is dealt. For projectiles with travel time, this means you must be boosting them as it hits.

> Which ultimates apply? 

Currently on live, you cannot damage boost Torbjorn or Symmetra's turrets or Junkrat's tire. On PTR, you also cannot boost Hanzo's dragons.

You can boost D.Va's bomb on live if you apply it to baby D.Va but I'm not sure if that was changed on PTR or not.

Everything else should be boostable, in theory.
            There are reports that damage boosting baby dva no longer boosts her ult damage on PTR
            > you also cannot boost Hanzo's dragons.

wtf this used to be so fun and it made dragons that much more dangerous
                I think they thought it was too powerful since it could outdamage trans.
        There isn't a consistent rule anymore
            This drives me up the wall about so many things within Overwatch; There isn't consistent rules for a lot of abilities and how they interact. 
                Hack Ulting Hog? Ult stops.

Hack Ulting S76? Ult continues.

Hack Turret Mode Bastion? Removed from mode.

Hack Tank Mode Bastion? Nah, still a tank.

Hack Mercy? Damage boost, heal beam and pistol all work.

Hack Moira? Both damage and heal beams work.

Hack Lucio? Primary shot works, but alt fire (boop) and passive heal are stopped.

CONSISTENCY AT ITS FINEST!
                    Hack Lucio? Useless.
                        I assume you mean lucio becomes useless.
                            Yes.
                        Apagando las useless.
                    It is a bit more consistent than you make it out to be, you just have to know the distinction between channeled ults and transformation ults. The channeled ults like whole hog and coalescence are stopped, but transformation ults like valkeryie, tank mode bastion, and tactical visor are not pretty much ever. They also a few months ago made pretty much all passives disabled by hacks... So a liiiitle bit more consistent than it used to be :)
                        Pretty much all passives... except ongoing ones, and mercy's regen.

Meanwhile certain ongoing things can be interrupted (d.va boost) whereas most others can't.

Meanwhile Bastion's turret transformation is removed, but every other transformation ability in the game is unnaffected.

Meanwhile Moira's left click has a resource bar, but remains unaffected, whereas Bastion's heal has a resource bar and is.

Meanwhile Lucio's ongoing song is shut off, but Zen's ongoing orbs aren't.
                        Also weapons vs abilities. Mercy and moira's left and right clicks aren't abilities, so they don't get stopped by hack, while Lucio's boop *is* an ability and therefore *does* get stopped by it. The fact that it's on right click doesn't matter.
                    It's really just ults that are inconsistent. Weapons never get disabled, abilities and passives always get disabled, and ults either do or don't depending on their type.
                        Not all passives though.  Only passives that require a button press get disabled, like Mercy's Angelic Descent and Pharahs jetpack.  Others still work, like Bastion's Ironclad in tank form and Brigitte's Inspire.
                            That's a fair point, but worth noting it's still consistent. Passives that provide additional actions don't do so if you're hacked.
                    The only inconsistent one is Lucio since other passives don't get hacked. S76 and Bastion are transformation ult while Hog is a channeled ult. All channeled ults get hacked such as McCree, Pharah, and Hog. Transformations like Bastion, Genji, S76 and Winston do not get hacked. Mercy and Moira left and right click don't get hacked because they are not abilities while Lucio boop is an ability with a cool down etc.
        Mercy's damage boost applies for when the projectile is hit. AKA, you can damage boost after a projectile is fired and still boost its damage.

As for ultimates, you can damage boost most of them: Dva, Roadhog, Bastion, Genji, Hanzo, McCree, Pharah, Reaper, Soldier, Torb (not his turret). 

You cannot damage boost the following ults: Doomfist, Junkrat, Torb's Turret

I am not sure about Tracer or Mei, but I think the damage boost applies for their ults as well.
            Damage boost does work on pulse bomb and blizzard
        The damage boost applies when the damage lands not when it is released 
    Dang I hadn't heard that. That's kind of a big deal
    I never heard of that. Thanks for pointing out. This is huge and will hopefully kill this damn grav dragon meta.
    Mercy hasn’t been fun for me since last fall when she was reworked. It just keeps getting worse. I regret giving her my golden gun back in the day because she just sits on the bench now 
    It's a nerf to all damage boosts
    So can Lucios new barrier counter Grav Dragons?
750 shield Lucio... a well-timed drop can counter just about anything.... "It's not high noon, it's midnight!"
    I'm pretty sure Deadeye could still out-damage Lucio's shielding, but it would give his team a few seconds to find cover. 

Deadeye builds something around ~250 damage per second for 6 seconds. It should theoretically be capable of murder-killing anything with 1,500HP if McCree can pop it at the very last frame. 
        Technically, a rally + a sound barrier at the right moment will save Reinhardt and Hog, then...
            Don’t forget about torb and symm 

Edit: oh yeah, rip shield gen
        Though by those 6 seconds, everyone probably already hid somewhere... unless they're somehow immobilized by a Shatter / Grav / Blizzard.
            Or just put an arrow through mcree's face.
    *casually sends a d.va bomb into the enemy 
    INB4 a Sombra ult comes into play immediately afterward.

*Laughs in Spanish.
        I outplay Sombras quite easily. Just hide before they do it (usually along with another Ult) then do it after. 
    Current very well timed Sound barrier can also save teammates from RIP Tires, but still.. Junkrats usually wait for the barrier to decay a bit when move into enemies.
YES! Ana buff!!
Does this not also mean that Mercy will get her ultimate slower?


    As well as heal quite a bit less while in ult, yes. 
[deleted]
    I mean, his old radius aoe was MASSIVE

the bonus shield is negated slightly by the fact that it decays in the same amount of time as the old one so it's not like the shield lasts longer in any way
        Yea but now you can survive burst-damage ults, like riptire and death blossom.  It'll also be a lot better against ults like tactical visor and whole hog.    Remember, despite decaying at the same speed, at any given point during the decay the players will have more HP than they did previously.
            Riptire can still wait out your shield to decay.
                the point remains.  also, more time spent fucking around with riptire is more time we can shoot at it
                This was my thought. Lucio ult doesnt do much for one shots because 99% of the time you're gonna get caught in the animation anyway and lose your ult and still die 
    the change to the radius results in something like 44% more area covered... it is huge!
    But does Moira REALLY need a buff? I feel like she slays already.
        It wouldn't be bad to tweak her a little bit. The ones who really needed the buff was Ana and Lucio for sure though.


    The radius increase will also make it easier to get as many people as possible in on the Sound Barrier. A lot of times it's hard to get more than 2 or 3 with it, but the extra area should make a pretty big difference!
"Oh.....       okay."  -Zenyatta mains
    Oh, yes.

- a Zen/Lucio/Ana player

I don't want them touching Zen, he's already strong as it is and if they looked at him for changes he'd get a nerf, probably to discord orb.
    Perfect Harmony.
>Healing resource base regen rate increased 20%.


Yaaaaassss. This has been my only issue with Moira. Drives me nuts when I can't get off any drain when I'm out of heals.
    Team - "Stop doing damage, you aren't DPS!!!" 

You - "but...I have to rec-"

Team - *Dead* "No heals, Moira is trash!"

You - "..... :( "


    Always makes her so weak against double sniper and Pharah comps. Lots of constant, long distance damage and you're nearly empty by the time the enemy tanks roll up. Then you have to get through all the shielding in the current meta to get any juice back and in the meantime your team is still taking long distance damage but they're behind you where you can't see them while you're trying to farm resources. Gah!

No wonder all the successful comps just run Mercy, flying back and forth with infinite heals.
        I've had plenty of success with Moira. I usually take gold healing, even with a Mercy on the team.
    Yep. Since I've gotten back into overwatch I've been maining Moira and I die a little inside when a teammate is asking for healing but I have no heal juice left and there's no enemies to recharge with close enough to me
        Yeah. I've learned to be a little more conservative with my orb due to that exact situation. This will help a ton.
Fix the Lucio ult cast time, ya filthy animals 
    Shit I'd settle for a 15% ult charge buff like they did with orisa.. but yes that cast time has got to go  
        To be fair a 15% charge buff would be fucking massive considering how much charge Lucio ult needs. 
            It's the slowest charging is the game isnt it? I mean fuck I could get a 4k+ with a boop and only get like 30% 
                I think Zarya's requires the most ult charge but Lucio might be slower because Zarya can get fully charged and dish out the DPS
                    Zarya's Ult charge just got buffed too with the slower energy decay.
                Larger aura should mean faster ult technically. I hope so anyways.
        His ult will already charge faster with the aura buff. He will be able to heal more people with it, allowing him to build more ult charge. It's a similar situation with Mercy. She'll heal slower, so her ult will build slower.
            This is true. I've been playing PTR since it was live and I do gain ult faster. Not a huge amount but its definitely noticeable 
    F'ing this. I never lose my ultimates except on Lucio. It hurts. It hurts me deep
        Clearly you aren't playing much Reinhardt these days.

Brig stun EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
    VAMOS ESCULACH-
    That or have it not deplete until it actually hits the ground.
        Or instead of having the ult charge go from 100% to 0% upon pressing Q have it "drain" from 100% to 0%
            1. I don't think that's a good idea. Although as a Lucio player it doesn't feel good to get stunned/killed while casting and lose ultimate, it also doesn't feel fun for the enemy, who used their cooldown ability reflexively to counter the Lucio ult. Skill imo, should be rewarded.

2. Almost all ults used to work on this drain system, but they changed the game for consistency (and the reason I mentioned) to have all ults go 100-0 the instant you press Q/whatever your ult key is.
        This is how it used to be and people didn't like it. It didn't feel good when you canceled Lucio ult just for him to use it again as soon as he was un-CC'd. There should be counter play. Maybe reduce the cast time on it, but don't straight up remove the only viable counterplay to it (with Sombra being not that viable).
            It’s how it used to be and I was fine with it... it might feel better to play against now but it feels like absolute shit to play. They need to either have some sort of refund system where it slowly depletes throughout the animation or speed up the animation. Something should change.
    What If the cast time was zero during his "amp it up"  boost? It would feel a bit more like you're dropping a beat imo.
    But how? That slam is iconic to his kit.
 Faster animation I guess.
        Just don't deplete ult charge until it hits. It's fast enough that it's only ever negated by chip damage. It is 100% of the time frustrating. 
Can someone post the changes for those behind a firewall :)

Corresponding tweet from @PlayOverwatch:  https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1019692185552162818
"We’ll keep an eye on her to make sure she is still a strong pick."

Where have I heard that sorry line of an excuse before?
    [removed]
        Pros hate Mercy way more than they hate Sombra, what are you talking about?
        No pro support player likes to play mercy. They just don't say it cause they had to accept it.
            That’s actually not true. I’ll have to dig for it but there is an interview with an OWL support player who says that Mercy is one of the most rewarding heroes to play well. 

Edit: I found it

https://overwatchwire.usatoday.com/2018/05/23/neptuno-mercy-is-one-of-the-most-complex-heroes-to-play-at-the-maximum-level/
                I get off on mercy jukes. That’s right boys, follow this tail. You know you want it. Oops I flew 60 meters behind you, don’t turn around I’m damage boosting someone.
                    I dunno why people say this is boring to be fairly honest. The biggest fun part of playing Mercy is playing the game of cat and mouse, baiting people and generally being a nuisance. 

It's fun. It's not what most people come on OW for which is fine but when someone asks 'Why is Mercy boring?'' She isn't. You're just playing a different type of game. Part of the fun as to why I play both her and Symmetra is being a crafty little bitch.

                        Too many folks have a way too DPS-centric approach to OW.

OW is NOT a classic shooter game. Play/watch something else if you want that or deal with the fact that OW is about a lot more than crispy flicks. I know it's hard to tell with how Blizzard is (re)designing heroes these days, but that has been the original promise at least.
                        Playing mercy is a great break from playing dps. It really is an entirely different play style requiring an entirely different skill set 
                        God this so much. The idea that playing them "Is just a different type of game" is exactly what I say to friends, it's just *so* accurate
Ayy Ana and Frogboi getting some love :3
    I wish I was getting some love. :(
        But we all love you.
            😭 Thanks everybody.
F U Riptire, this Lucio main is ALIVE
    Unless you cast it to soon or too late, in which case you just lose your ult.
The Lucio buffs aren't as big as they seem to be. In the fine print it states that his ult will drain in the same time his old ult did, meaning you get a bigger burst, but it drains exponentially faster. He's still not going to be picked more than or as often as Zen as a second healer.

^^Source: ^^Lifetime ^^GM ^^Lucio ^^main
    He still needs atleast a 15% ult charge buff like they gave Orisa and they need to cut the cast time of the ult in half. I also don't like that they gave him 250 extra shields but kept the same time for them to go away it should be atleast 1 second longer.
    Plus trans still charges faster, lasts longer, is uninterruptable and  all of this attached to a much better character than Lucio.
        Sombra can't EMP trans once it is casted either!
            Yes, but your ultimate gets nullified by an ability that's on a 10 second cooldown 
        You raise a good point. Why is his ult cost the highest in the game still? 
            Because he had access to a broken amount of healing charge back with his massive heal-aura that covered the entire battlefield.

They ought to adjust it to his new range's output probably, but I think their thought-process is that they buffed the healing amount when they made it smaller, and his potential for overall healing charge is still the highest in a best case scenario. Zenyatta requires more enemy interaction to get his charge therefore it's seen as less of an issue.
        Trans is better because the meta combos involve CC and putting your team in a meat grinder.   You get a hammond/doomfist/tracer/mccree/junk ult throwing at the grav or shatter and suddenly Zen ult is the bad one.   Stuff like Nano blade or even just Mccree/Mei shots will kill your team even with a HoT on them.

They are 2 different ults (sustain vs burst) that counter 2 different types of danger.   The dps/tank meta is what defines the better support ult.
        One thing to think about is that Ana may come into play with her anti heal to cancel out zen more often now that she's seen a buff.
    which means that it's still just as easy to wait it out with a tire or deadeye or such.
    The ult buff might not be as significant, but his aura is now 44% larger, which I’d say is pretty significant.
    I think the two extra meters will help more than most think it will.
Winstons will now actually be able to kill Mercy pockets :)
    is he? Mercy doesn't have reload time on her beam.
        Considering Winston will only deal 10 dps on a mercy pocket, that's 50 dmg after 5 seconds before reloading for 1.5 seconds, during which mercy would have healed for 75 dmg.

So yeah, still nothing. lol
            But now if a target is at like 40 health before Mercy comes to heal them Winston can actually still get the kill.
            But he'll at least be able to do something. Before, it was fruitless. He'd have to attack Mercy and risk being killed by her pocket. Now he can at least provide pressure
                Winston shouldn't dive someone getting pocketed by himself anyway. Nerfing her so he negates her healing and gets a tickle in is pretty significant.
                But why should Winston be able to kill someone being healed by Mercy (or any healer for that matter) then be able to move on and kill the Mercy or just leave? It's a bad move to dive someone getting healed, and it shouldn't be made easier for that bad choice.
                    the problem was when you were fighting someone and mercy would start healing them when they were at like 30/40 hp and well gg you can't kill him anymore.
            Punch in between to get pretty much the same dps, but you don’t have to reload as quickly
    Also Pharmercy is less of an issue. Easier to kill her. This is huge for console players as Pharah is the most oppressive hero to fight.
        Don't forget the buffs to damage falloff for Soldier, McCree, Bastion and Mei. Playing Pharah is gonna be pretty rough in general.
            Jesus christ...glad i dont play much anymore. All they do is fuck over the champs i like to play lol

Though most of the time its for a good reason admittantly lol


            She'll have more reason to play ground level and use the air as an "I'm in the clear to attack" instead of being her default. I hope it means people will stop getting angry when I'm not in the air constantly as Pharah. People know she's gonna be in the air, they aren't looking for her to boop herself out of a building to flank
                I think ground-pharah (aka TF2 soldier) will be actually a pretty good idea, with the rise of hitscans (ana counts and will be more prevalent) and the fall of mercy healing.
        Really?! That's very surprising to hear! I mean I probably play with people at my skill-level (pretty fucking bad), but Pharah's only an issue when our team comp completely skips hitscan. Am I missing a technique?

For me on console, I find Tracer and Genji to be the bigger pains in the ass. Blink and double-jump when they're really close makes for a much bigger arc to swing with console reticle tracking. That's their kit so I'm not crying about it - I just find them much more of a challenge than Pharah (since she moves about as fast as a derigible).

Is there something Pharahs are doing that I don't know about?
    I wonder how long it'd take to kill a roadhog with a mercy pocket as winston.
        He still can't because of reload time.
    Original Mercy had lower healing output. Her healing got buffed shortly after Ana was released to match her healing better. Since then Ana's output was cleaved via the grenade boost but for some reason mercy wasn't reverted till now.
    I'm just imagining like a 20 second duel between a Winston left clicking and a frantic DPS + Mercy.
    It will only work on targets below 50 health (80 if you count in a melee) since with weapon reloading she will still outheal him.
    Only very slowly. It gives him an effective 10DPS which means he'd take more than 20 seconds to kill one hero.

        She is literally the only character that applies to for some reason. Hanzo's weakness was unreliable damage and no horizontal mobility. GUESS WHAT WAS FIXED AND MADE HIM OP AS BALLS?
        Lol another slap in the face for the Roadhog nerfs.

Note I think Roadhog is mostly balanced, but the Blizzard's balancing philosophy for Roadhog was so different from every other balance.
            Yeah.  I suppose he was just too frustrating though.    or they wanted to move him in a slightly different direction.  New hog is a lot of fun to me though.  Well, "new".  The one after the breather buffs.
        Yeah, but they went about it the wrong way. Ana's strengths were burst healing and ult generation, and nano's strength came from the speed boost. So they nerfed her burst healing and ult generation, and removed nano's speed boost. Then they buffed nano a little.

Personally, I think Ana should have inverse damage and healing falloff. Her point blank damage and healing should be similar to what it is now, but at long ranges she should deal more damage and have more healing, rewarding skill rather than standing inside a tank and holding M1.
    They specifically want that to be hear weakness though consideirng her overall potential for healing is higher than anyone elses.
    Balancing the game isn’t about making xyz hero completely kitted to the teeth, it’s about promoting their niche to provide total game balance. The ana and lucio buffs are nice, but put both on the same team and now it’s deadly. Lucio can help ana escape a bit more easily, ana is arguably (apart from brig) the best support at defending themselves in an active sense of the word, but slow as a rock by herself. Brig + insert any other hero is slightly less OP which is nice. I guess regarding the ana changes, they’ve chosen to go down the route of buffing her niche rather than lessening her weaknesses in order to promote her clutch potential, which among supports is definitely up there with lucio and zens ults. A big rein nano towards the end of a team fight can now seriously swing the game even if ana dies.
This Ana buff is huge. This instantly makes Nano such a better ult because there isn't a bad time to use it at all. 

As someone who loves Brig and plays a ton of her, this nerf sucks, but as a fan of the game, she needs a nerf to shield bash. It is still really good, and almost always available. Honestly, I think her Repair Pack needs a tracking buff or a travel speed buff or something. It's often hard to get it on the right person, like Nano. 

Lucio, oh my god. That Sound Barrier buff makes his ult super useful, and the Crossfade buff feels fair. 

Mercy nerf is interesting. That feels like its really going to make Mercy a bit less of a must pick, at least as far as healer goes. 

Moira buff is big. That may make Moira the main healer pick. She already dishes out more burst healing anyway. 
    They've nerfed almost everything about Mercy and it hasn't been able to balance her, so it was healing outputs turn. CD Rez is the problem though and they're not willing to acknowledge it.
    Watching your repair pack track back and forth across the sky trying to reach a panicked Genji in time, only to finally reach his dead corpse on the ground is mildly entertaining, though. 
I like the increased regen on Moira's healing gauge the most imo. Cool changes overall.

I wonder if these changes will head out with the Hammond patch next week?
    As much as I wish I could stop playing Mercy in my comp games, it will probably be in the next PTR cycle. This current PTR is already jam packed: hit scans brought back from the grave, Hanzo flicked on the nose and an entire new hero. Tossing the support meta into a blender too? That'd just make it hard to analyze how effective the changes were.


&nbsp;


I mean just imagine Blizzard's statistic department the week after a patch like that drops, "So right now we're in a triple dps meta where Hammond is played as an effectual fourth dps... Is this because the new healers allow such weirdness or are the hit scans just too powerful now?" Obviously it's an extreme example, but if you release too many balancing changes at once we see what in statistics is called "confounding." When there are just too many variables to separate it becomes increasingly hard to determine the real causes of certain things, which may lead to poor balancing choices and knee jerk reactions down the road. So we'll likely see the Hammond patch drop, the new healer ptr go live, and while the healers are in ptr Blizzard can assess how the hitscans are doing so that when the healers go live it'll be easier to read the statistics and evaluate their next balancing move. 
Holy fuck a Lucio boost. His sound wave only giving 500 shield has felt really weak for a long time now. Preeettty excited for dis. 
**YES YES YES YES**

#YES
    Are ... are you gonna hit me with 3 support buffs at the same time?

So with the mercy healing nerf and the hitscan fall off dmg buff. Will 1 mccree or s76 be enough to deal with pharmercy? 
    Probably not still.  Two people vs one.  But it does help a fair amount.
    I don’t think it would mean they counter Pharmercy directly. Rather, with the increased damage and lower healing, it means that Mercy is going to need to babysit Pharah for a longer period of time. And as powerful as Pharah is, if Mercy is always playing catch up with the healing her rockets are not getting boosted and her team is not getting Main healing unless they are foregoing Trans or Sound Barrier and using Ana/Moira instead. That makes them really vulnerable to combos like Shatter or Graviton, so it’s definitely a trade off. Running Pharmercy isn’t going to be as easy as it once was...and I love that. Super annoying to play against in solo queue or quick play because the lack of coordination means it usually dominates. 
    I'd hope not. One player by themselves should not counter two players working together. That would just be plain flat-out bad design in a game which is supposed to be built on teamwork.
Mercy is back to her release healing values? interesting.

i'm curious if they'll actually keep the change, though, because, iirc, she got her healing increased because she was the "worst" healer. however, with how much the other characters have changed since then, it might be fine.
    well, release mercy had SOMETHING going on for her with her ult... 

after the patch every other support will have more to offer than just healing. 
I really wish Lucios Sound Barrier would “freeze” itself for the first maybe 1-2 seconds before decaying. His Ult compared to the other Support Characters feels so much more underwhelming just because the timing NEEDS to be perfect, and  it becomes situational to be used at 100% efficiency.

If the Decay didn’t start for a good second or 2 I feel like that would help a lot.
    I agree with this.  I've lost track of the amount of times I've just wasted his ult misjudging that knife's edge of timing of survive-ability vs effectiveness.  Too soon and rip tire still kills everyone, too late you end up dropping before the "beat". 
        I think the extra Barrier Health is going to help, but that only means it’s going to drain even faster. Lucios ultimate always feels weird because it lasts maybe 3 seconds and it’s gone, not really making much of a difference unless you can tune it during an Enemy Ult/Firefight pretty well, and good luck keeping him alive during whatever is happening.

Having it be a solid number for a few seconds would help, because at the moment it’s only good for tanking burst-damage like Junkrats Ult, or if you’re quick, maybe a McCree or DVA bomb. The fact that it shaves away so quickly along with Enemies damaging you, it just doesn’t feel like much. It’s gone so quickly.
>Ana has a very strong and unique toolbox, with the potential to dish out more healing than any other hero in the game. 

>Mercy is intended to be able to consistently pump out more healing than any other healer over the course of a match. 

Hmm.. interesting.. what is supposed to be healing the most in the game? Ana or Mercy?
    Ana in a short time, mercy over long time
    The key word is “consistently”.

Ana struggles with a lot in order for her to heal, like shields, enemies and aim. Mercy simply ignores it.
    Single target burst = Ana

AoE burst = Moira

Sustained = Mercy

Is how it should be at least.
    Dont forget Moira, a good one can outheal a Mercy thanks to the aoe even now already.
Broken Hanzo and Junkrat live for another day.
    Pardon my flair, but I think Junkrat is actually pretty average right now save for his ult. I would take a tire nerf (maybe a 7-8 second duration instead of 10) if it meant the grenade size nerf got reverted. That one just came out of the blue for no reason considering his grenade launcher was exactly the same as it was at launch when he was a troll pick...

That and he has one of the lowest pickrates once you get past gold
        Since his riptire nerf, he's been pretty good imo. 
    Nah, Junkrat is fine. Hanzo is still annoying though.
Interesting that they went after Mercy's HPS instead of Rez or GA. Still think it's a good change.
    If GA gets nerfed you’re better off just reverting her to 1.0 where you have to hide like a mole for most of the game.
I'm sure this has already been mentioned, but it's weird they listed all of Ana's weaknesses and then addressed something entirely different about her kit. 

Kind of like going into your kids conference and having you tell the teacher your kid's math is not up to par, and then having the teacher say "Well, I think he does well when it comes to English, so lets improve that so he's even better in that subject!"
    The point is everyone needs to have weaknesses, but the strengths should balance the weakness out.
The real buff to nanaboost is a quick pep talk and a smack on the butt to take the choke.
As someone who loves Mercy and Brigitte I'm sad. I totally understand the changes and agree with them, but nerfs never feel good on your favorites.

Zen is perfect just the way he is 
Worth noting that the 20% boost in the radius of crossfade is actually a 44% increase in its area.
REIN FIX WHEN
Definitely dig the Ana changes.

There's been a lot of times where I want to ult our Rein, but he's too low to justify me ulting him.

I don't want to waste it if he dies 1 seconds into it.

So then I attempt to spam healing on him, but he dies anyways without the damage reduction.
    This means you should start nanoing him in these situations, despite you not thinking you should. 
I like all of these changes as a support main. Awesome.
Ana’s nade need to pierce full health target. 
It’s current state contradicts with primary fire’s behavior and it’s very inconsistent.
I try to reserve big opinions on announced changes for when they're on the PTR and we actually get a taste of how they'll play out, but I've gotta say, I *love* the sound of every single one of these changes.

It's just so pleasant to see multiple issues people have been complaining about being dealt with all at once: that is, Ana being underpowered, Brig still being so powerful, Lucio needing some love and Mercy still overshadowing the other supports. I think most people felt Moira was already well balanced, but even that change is a welcome one, really. 
The overreactions on the overwatch forums are hilarious. "Goodbye Mercy." "Extremely concerned about Ana." Etc.

It's like they know nothing about the game... these are all small number tweaks that people have been begging for months now.
    It's coming from the same people who thought Mercy would disappear after her rework.
These are interesting changes.

Ana: It's nice, but a "nice" change on a hero who's generally considered not viable is kind of pointless.

Brigitte: It's weird that Blizzard thinks she will still be a difficult target to take down. She is only durable from the front, and the only thing stopping people from getting behind her is the threat of her stun. Her stun is basically the only good thing about her. So I suspect this is going to hurt her a lot more than they think.

Lucio: These are actually good, meaningful changes. Lucio is going to benefit a lot here.

Mercy: This one is interesting. Seeing as Ana's buff was not in the area she really needed, it looks like they're trying to indirectly buff Ana by making her the only healer who actually does high consistent healing. Mercy's healing per second is barely more than half of Ana's now, so even if she misses a pretty big portion of her shots, she can still outheal Mercy.
    A lot of it is not missing shots but being denied by barriers. Enemy D.va matrixed your dps? mercy dgaf, Ana does, etc.

    The snail pace they release changes is due to their clinging to the PTR.  They need to give up on that, its a waste of time, they are supposed to be a game development company, test and go live and if you need to change things do it but the PTR is not catching bugs TONS of stuff goes broken from PTR straight to live so why waste weeks/months of time with it.... Sombra is a great example with the last 6 months AND last year with the infinite health pack hack.
Very clever Blizzard, bundling the Mercy nerf with the other support changes is a good way to balance Mercy without feeling like you’re bullying the Mercy mains again. All these changes are within reason and seem respectable fair changes that many have considered and wanted. I feel like we’re pretty close to making OW the most balanced it has ever been. Hopefully we’re not blindsided by a hero we all underestimated for so long that dominates the ladder meta. 
    > Very clever Blizzard, bundling the Mercy nerf with the other support changes is a good way to balance Mercy without feeling like you’re bullying the Mercy mains again.

Nerfing Mercy in the same patch as buffing other supports is a good way to not make people feel like Mercy got bulled? Lol.
        Buffing 3 Supports and nerfing 2 at least allows Blizzard to dodge the shouts of "MOAR PROOF BLIZZARD HATES SUPPORTS" that seems to accompany every Mercy nerf.
        I use to main Mercy but haven't played her in months, or however long it's been since the rework. I still feel like I'm getting bullied by these changes.
            I stopped playing Overwatch because of the lag and the bullying on Mercy... never played a game with so much anger towards supports.
                Yeah, I agree with you there. I never thought someone who is suppose to keep you alive could get so much hate. Oh well, I still play occasionally, but I don't play support like I use to.
                    I've moved towards Paladins, actually. It's got a lot of love for its supports and theres no lag. I'm enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would... still going to play OW though... just no Mercy, despite being a Mercy Main.
            That’s the only good things about her changes to me. I used to basically one trick her. Now I main support but play Moira, Mercy, brigette, hog, mccree mostly so it’s made me branch out. I’ve gotten better at least (made diamond for first time ever). But I still hate to see my favorite character nerfed yet again.
                Same here. I truly enjoyed playing with her old rez, before being able to move, before the invincibility, before all that. I just can't wnjoy the game playing as her now, but I still try to get all her items.
        Def feels like she got bullied. "You all get these great changes. "You get nothing." "You get punished."
            It's better than heavily nerfing Mercy to bring her down to the same level as the other supports, like they have been doing. Instead they are bringing them all up. Plus, Brigitte is getting a nerf as well, though it's not as big I think.
                if they keep this up that shield bash CD is going to be as long as rein's charge C
                    Nah, this is probably the last time they'll change it. 5 was overpowered, 6 was overtuned, 7 will be in line with how strong she's designed to be in close range. At worst it'll go to 8, which is the same CD as flashbang.
                        5 sec cooldown on shield bash was so annoying and really overpowered but it felt so nice to murder all the genjis, tracers and winstons, especially after months of dive comps. Never as a support main I had a job that required dealing with flankers and dive, it felt so good.

But 7sec is a fair cooldown for such a powerful ability which is also fairly easy to pull off consistently. 
    [deleted]
        Everyone has been saying that since Mercy's first rework lol
            Mercy 2.0 was the most broken thing this game has seen.
                Holy god yes, back when her rez was on a 5 second CD or w/e it was in her ult. Could easily get 15+ rezzes in a game.
                    It was always on 30 second cooldown, BUT:

* instant 

* recharges immediately when activating Valcyrie

* During Valcyrie the cooldown of rezz is only 10 seconds

* Valcyrie lasted for 20 seconds. 

You could rezz, Valk, rezz, rezz 10 seconds later, rezz 10 seconds later, 4 instant rezzes in ~21 seconds.
            Really? r/overwatch gets extremely defensive whenever we suggest a Mercy nerf.
                r/Overwatch isn't really the premiere place for balance ideals in the community

I didn't just mean people on this subreddit when I said "everyone"


                    r/overwatch is very casual-oriented, so I'd say they're sadly representative of the majority of the community.
                        This subreddit is home to some of the biggest babies I've ever met on Reddit. Definitely not representative of the community! 
        Nope. **Mercy was never a must pick until she had rez available every 30 seconds.** 
    > bundling the Mercy nerf with the other support changes is a good way to balance Mercy without feeling like you’re bullying the Mercy mains again.

Except every other healer got a buff, so it feels even more like they are bullying her.
        Except Brigitte
            And Zen
        Brigitte. Got. Nerfed.
        I mean, she still the stronger healer on the meta with Zen, she couldn't get a buff.
i like the changes overall but im concerned about mercy changes simply because she had 50hp/s healing before and it wasnt good (even with old ultimate) when right now we have so much more damage in the game.

Then again, she needs nerf somewhere to give a chance other supports, i just hope it'll be fine doe.

it can be huge change tho, Winston now is able to deal damage trought pocket, if there's 1 more person shooting character you're healing they might die since it'll be hard to outheal it, less charge on her Valk, less time to use for damage boost and so forth, let's just say i hope blizz knows whay they're doing but IMO they should just scrap res, as long as i play mercy i hate that mechanic after moth queen 1.0
Ana's mobility and self sustain is one of the biggest issues. I'm not exactly pleased about the buff but well. 
    For real. Nano is already good if you dont give it to a low health hero (why would you?) and now Blade + Nano seems more OP. She doesnt even need mobility, self heal will make her independent of other healers.
I'm cool with the Brig nerfs- those are fun  

I like the healing aspect for Ana's boost but I'd still like a speed increase like the good ol' days & I'm curious to see how Lucio's ult will change, it'll destroy itself at the same rate so it seems like more of a burst save than it is a lasting health boost now- like you're only to use it in retaliation to enemy ults.  



But that alone doesn't work as his cast time can be incredibly long, and even more harsh as he's one of the easiest to lose ultimates with. Maybe an increase in cast speed as well? Have him come down to the ground quicker from higher locations? It's all interesting nevertheless, and none of it is as fucky and backhanded as the Sombra nerfs

e; i had a word mixup i am SORRY 
    Oh, let's break it DOoo*gets shield bashed*
        *gets hacked, pocket sanded, storm arrowed, shield bashed, hooked, pulled, doomfist punched within 3 seconds*
            https://youtu.be/QLpUq__iQqw
            That's a terrible team comp
                i'm more concerned as to how there's 7 players on a team than the team composition
                    This must be the work of an enemy 「M E R C Y」!
        Oh, let's break it Doo *gets slept*
        Ive heard this to many times. Let me clarify. 

"Oh! Let's break it dow- Woah, woah, woah,  HEY!"
(cuz he says that when he gets stunned. And I heard his stun lines too many times)
    >Maybe an increase in cast time as well?

And nerf Sound Barrier? No thanks. 
    In all fairness, this is actually a fair and reasonable buff for Nano.

I am not that experienced with Ana just yet, but there are situations where I am deterred from using Nano on someone because they're about to die. With this, I can Nano someone mid-fight knowing they will probably be alive to use it actually.
        i didn't fully think about it like that, but i recall several times i encountered a similar issue- i'm welcome to any n all Ana buffs, but i'm greedy n want more for our beloved granny
Just when Mercy thought she got out of the woodshed...
Thank god for the ana buff and bridgette nerf
Wow this along with the hitscan buffs means Pharah's not going to be as viable coming up
Lucio main checking in here. Fuck yes 
So is mercy is supposed to bring the most healing out of out the healers, what does Moira bring with her lack of utility(no damage boost, no rez)?
    Better group healing (orb, ult). Pretty decent damage (for a support) 
        I hadn't considered group healing, that is a good point.
    Mercy is supposed to bring most *consistent* healing.
Stop Blizzard! My pp can only get so hard!
>Nano Boost additionally heals the target instantly for 300 HP.

How to create an invincible ape jumping around the point for 3 years straight
I really REALLY hope the Ana buffs keep on coming.
Oh, another Mercy nerf instead of actually taking the time to balance her and still make her fun to play.. Cool. 
    Agree. I feel sorry for Mercy mains. 

They have spirit and determination to play boring full-support hero in the FPS game full of fun action-packed heroes. 

Not only they don't get any reward for this, but they also branded with a mark of one-buttoned noobs in the game community. Despite all of that, after every nerf they keep pushing their hero to the limits, finding new ways to maximize it's usefulness for a team, which only leads to the new nerfs from the developers.
        Exactly, I wish they’d see these nerfs just suck the character dry. I just want to see some solid changes for Mercy already. But as long as the community does not care, they unfortunately won’t. 
    [deleted]
        Yet she has had some of the highest pick rates of any hero even when she was the weakest healer. Just because you find her boring to play...
            [deleted]
As a Master's Mercy player I feel the Mercy nerfs are fair as she can consistently put out large amounts of healing, while having self sustain, and insane mobility if you have teammates around. Factor in the utility of rez and she is still a fantastic character. Overall, I'm very happy with the changes and feel that it will lead to more diversity. Moreover, if the mercy nerfs are to harsh I'm sure Blizzard will adjust them as they see fit. I think this will break up the meta and make the healing meta more interesting!
    > Moreover, if the mercy nerfs are to harsh I'm sure Blizzard will adjust them as they see fit

I'll believe it when I see it. I'm still miffed at what they did with Sombra.
    Agreed, having the most reliable point healing is powerful enough and minor number tweaks aren't going to make her any less useful if played in the right hands. It more means other healers can keep up instead of always falling short which is always beneficial.

I've been dreaming of the day where other healers become more relevant so hopefully this brings us closer to that.
Blizzard still unwilling to admit Mercy's problem is the ability to rez and consequently making the rest of her kit feel like sh#t.
    They're never going to get rid of it, though; it's up there with like Tracer as one of the defining aspects of Overwatch.  One of the first images you see is of Mercy descending like an angel to bring back her fallen heroes.
    The rework has been a failure but blizzard will never admit it. A series of nerfs since it was place on live. 
    what? thats so dumb.

Your post is a clear example of Riot balancing vs Icefrog balancing. You don't destroy what makes a hero unique. You keep unique abilities strong. Nerf their weaknesses rather than their strengths. 
        That is how you end up with very lopsided heroes. The more the rest of Mercy's kit gets nerfed, the more her power is in the rez, and it's already a *huge* part of her kit.

And the funny part is that because damage just keeps going up in Overwatch, with (pseudo) one-shots becoming almost the norm, the time to kill just keeps going down and healing matters less and less, while rezzing stays strong.
            Yep.  We are in a one-shot sniper meta so healing in general is worthless compared to rez.  
        and how is nerfing mercy's healing, something she does better than any other support, nerfing her weakness?
    Rez is not the problem lmfao, if anything its her survivabiltiy.
    The problem with removing Rez is that it's a direct buff to Widow since Widow's snipe are usualy easy rezzes (as long as you have a sheild) since they tend to be in your area of the map.

Widow is already strong enough as it is.

I don't mind removing Rez and reworking Mercy again, but if they do that, I hope that a lot of heroes will be tweak since the repercussions will be massive.
    You are completely off base. People pick Mercy because she is an incredibly reliable healer. Resurrect is icing on the cake. You nerf her healing, and people won't play her, regardless of how "strong" resurrect is. I don't get why people don't understand this.
    I don't see how rez is a problem. Given that abilities like Riptire or Dragon Strike can instantly delete your team, why is it bad that there is an ability that brings them back? Q to win is allowed, but E to rez is not?
As a mercy main who's finally getting sick of mercy (500+hrs), I am so so happy to see this balance. Moira was always just too short on heals and Anna just wasn't getting enough value. Mercy is great, but so happy to see some changes going through.
Will playing Ana without soft throwing finally be a thing? Find out next season.
I'm actually quite surprised to see zenyatta untouched especially when you could consider discord orb ( and mercy right click ) to be too powerful/valuable in a team composition ( aka best support duo for almost a year if not more now ).

People were debating if 20% discord orb would make zenyatta more fair as a hero especially with how lethal and mendatory he is at the highest level ( zenyatta specialists in OWL in the same spots as Tracer specialits )
    There's too much healing/sustain in this game hence why OHKs are such a big deal. Nerfing discord/mercy tether just feeds that problem and makes chips damage even less important.
    Mercy Nerf is an indirect Zen nerf.
I think the buff to Ana is good, but it's not enough to make her viable again. I hate that they are nerfing Mercy again. I really do. I don't think she needs a nerf at all. The other supports need buffs instead of bringing her down. The lucio buff is nice for sure and the brig nerf is nice as well. 

It'll be interesting to see how this changes things especially with Hammond coming out, but from what I've read so far I don't like it. 
    Let's just keep buffing healing until one-shot abilities are the only way to kill anything.
WOW!
Oh my god, I love these numbers. 

As someone that plays a ton of Mercy and Moira, I’m super stoked about this.  Moira will be a tad easier to play, but 20% regen increase isn’t a ton, so these numbers look good so far.  I actually had figured that reducing Mercy’s HPS would be a legitimate solution here, so I’m glad to see that Blizzard is going this direction with her nerf.

But the biggest thing, by far:

Ana.  Grandma.  You...you got a buff.  I’m so proud of you!
I am good with pretty much every single one of these changes, but I would like to see Mercy lowered slower. 60 to 55 would be a pretty good start. I would also like to see maybe 1 more second on Lucio's ult, and elimination of him having to touch the floor, it needs to be an instant activation.
more mercy nerfs, oh boy
Finally, a nerf to Pharmercy.  Mercy makes everything too damn immortal.
Is this the very first time in Overwatch balance changes history that they're actually reverting something? Talking about Mercy's HPS. 
    Their reasoning for buffing it in the first place was because Ana was outhealing her. They nerfed Ana's healing and the reason for her buff but still she wasn't touched for so long. I am pleasantly surprised. 
Can we just give Mercy something else besides Rez at this point ? Just nerfing everything else about her sucks. 

Or make it her ultimate again please. She was most balanced and fun back then for a lot of people :( 


    I think confining rez (mostly) as is to Valk would be better. 

That’s as close to removing Rez from the game as you could get it, and it wouldn’t feel broken af like the old Rez was.
    Hide in a corner and then 5 man rez for no penalty wasn't fun. Nor was it balanced
        Seriously, I don't know how people have managed to convince themselves that old mercy was more fun. She was *strictly* less interesting and in terms of balance, she was trash tier in pro and only passable in solo q because non-support players could pick her up so easily. 
            This
        ^ This

It makes me wonder what game people were playing where they thought a 5 man rez was balanced.
            If they made Rez an ult, they should give it line of sight and a cast time. I think that would make it balanced
            The game where people were punished for burning all their ults on the final push.

Hide 'n rez Mercy wasn't even that common. Tempo rezzing was the norm.
            Probably “well DVA can wipe a whole team with little threat to herself, so why not let a character do the opposite?”
> Ana: Nano Boost additionally heals the target instantly for 300 HP.

That's fucking insane; even a up-to-50% health restore would be fine if they have to dial this back.

> Brigitte: Shield Bash cooldown increased from 6 to 7 seconds.

They're just going to keep upping this? Have they tried adding a shield health penalty when it hits a target instead? Keep it as a gap closer but make it somewhat costly when used as a stun?

> Mercy: Primary fire healing beam reduced 17% from 60 HP/s to 50 HP/s.

Yeah really not sure this was the right way to go...

> Zenyatta: [nothing]

Oh come on! Just a fresh clip after trans, that's all we're asking!
    >Oh come on! Just a fresh clip after trans, that's all we're asking!

Is that a request for a Zenyatta _buff_? Wowee that was unexpected.

Edit: Aaaaand it happened. Wowee.
        I would also love use meditation to fully restore my balls.
    You're lucky he didn't get nerfed lol
    I think the Mercy change is probably the right way to go. Mercy really is the most consistent healer in Overwatch and they really need to avoid buffing healing too much to avoid another Ana+tank meta. Mercy still is the only support that can erase a solo pick and has a reasonable damage boost and high mobility. I trust that they'll keep track of her healing to make sure they didn't over-nerf it.
    There was a 0% chance if zenyatta was on this list that he would have been buffed. I honestly cant believe he wasnt nerfed
ANA UPDATED

MERCY DEGRADED

LONG HAVE WE WAITED

BALANCED SUPPORTS ACTIVATED
    Every shield and DM say “hi”.
Very happy about all of these
Really spot-on changes. Love it.
Perfect, perfect and PERFECT!
Ah, my favorite time of the month: the Mercy nerfs.

Jokes aside, these changes look pretty dang solid. One major complaint, though.

 I'm really not sure that Moira's buff was necessary. She's already a damn strong healer, even for something as small as this seems unneeded since it just *slightly* grazes off the amount of skill needed to play her (which isn't really all that much [not throwin' any shade to your Moira mains, I love Irish Yzma as much as y'all]).
u/rajattackowski 
Lucio buff! 

Ayy now Lucio's ult can (barely) save an armored squishie from a D.Va ult.
Oh god what, I was actually thinking they should nerf mercy back to the old 50 HPS, it sucks playing Ana cuz I used to be able to outheal her, then they buffed Mercy's heal for no reason. 

Lucio soundwave buff is exactly what I suggested a while ago.

Moira's buff is small, you don't usually rely on passive regen but hey, every bit absolutely helps.

Ana's change is oft-requested, I agree with it.

This is a very good day for me.
I hope this will stop people from screaming to play mercy as the main healer every game. I have over 300 hours on ana. Yes you are getting healed, you only complain when no heals when you’re overextended or not in line of sight of the point. 
Let Ana headshot! 
i love the nano buff but they need something to up her survivability, not another player’s (which i get should in turn helps her’s... but u know what i mean)
I'd like it if they added a heal utility to Zen. Something like teammates who damage the enemy team member with discord receive a percentage of that damage back as healing. Even if it was a small amount, just a little extra would be nice. 
More resource for Moira and a better ult for Lucio? Yes, please
Hopefully her daddy has a free seat on the throw train for Brigitte.
Nanoing a hooked target is a good start to not losing a team fight.
    Also makes for great comedy as the Hog’s team realizes he just yanked a superpowered angry German man into the middle of their formation.
        I always feel bad when I displace a Rein only for him to get nano'd and kill our team. :C
        I FEEEEEEL UNSTOPPABLE! AHAHAHAH!!

Not quite the middle of their formation but I did basically kill my own Hanzo with what you described. :<

now you can actually start the fight that way if they hook your genji.

    I've had so many times where my tanks are playing so passively that I just Nano my Rein (cross my fingers) and we break the choke and cap the point. 
        I wish. I will nano my rein, fire shots into him, nade him, and say "I gotcha, Rein" and he will protect himself with his shield.
            As a tank main, sometimes I don't have a choice. 

Nothing worse than getting nano'd on a long kill zone when the enemy rein has shatter.
            aww.. people just don't play a lot with ana anymore these days, i am sure it will change before long.

for example: way back in the day a rein would not swing his hammer when i (zen) was trancing all around him but these days they almost all do that.
    Offensive Rein is best Rein!  

Edit: *You're powered up, get in there!*
        I AM UNSTOPPABLE!
    Eeeeh... If you want them to stop nanoing you for almost no reason, just don't play the way they want you to. Keep doing what you do if you really want them to stop :P
        I want to play with the team, but whenever I get a good Ana they just keep me alive no matter how stupid a thing I do!
            So YOU'RE one of those kinds of Reinhardts that enables the Anas to give nano boosts randomly! Please stop, you need to play more cautious.
    I refuse to stop enabling my tanks to ruin the other team's day. >:(
    nah, you just need to know when you have an ana with nano behind you and when you have a mercy/zen instead :P
    I almost always boost rein, as I play a lot of rein myself.  It's just a satisfying feeling.

 "Swing the hammer buddy.  Swing that hammer".
    I would like to state for the record the situations you put me in drastically lower my life expectancy.
        In all fairness they drastically lower mine in game.
    There is nothing I love more than wrecking face as Reinhardt.

Bonus if someone says "I have no idea how you did that rein"
I can tell you play ana well. She is one support I love to play. I also know I'm always outhealing because of that nade burst haha. Gold healing for days.
Thanks for posting this!
    No prob - glad I was finally in a situation where I could make it and pay it forward for once
No reloading for transcendance yet... Keep fighting, my omnic brothers.

>Channeled and transformation ultimate abilities now restore ammunition after completion for some heroes

        [deleted]
            Is it? I mean, I see no reason not to do this, but Roadhog ults usually go one of two ways: Hog dies. Hog kills his enemy(ies).

Don't usually see a scenario where Hog needs to keep fighting, but doesn't have ammo. 

But I'm sure this will help with that fringe case. :)
                It’s usually against a dva that manages to eat the last bit of your ult. If she’s already in your face when you finish, and you got no ammo, she can do a lotta damage while youre reloading and healing
        Was just about to post this link. Glad to see they are changing that!
    The new PTR update has reload for Trans now. Hog, Winston, Genji, Pharah, Junkrat, and Zen now have full ammo after ult. https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/overwatch-ptr-patch-notes-july-18-2018/163715
        Glad they made it consistent across all of them. They added it to reaper a while ago
    As a zen main I hope he never gets buffed, the last thing I want is them to buff him, make him op, then give him a rework and ruin him.
        As a D.Va main I can relate a lot.

My primary support hero is Angela, so again: I can relate A LOT.
    Ehh Zen's good enough. Plan your reload imo
        Can't always plan your reload when you have to trans before dying/getting earthshattered.
            Neither does/can Hog when he hooks.....

I main Zen... It doesn't bother me that I don't get a free reload on trans.
                20 balls is a lotta balls. I rarely run out before either I or my enemies die
                But hog isn’t meant to protect a team from an ultimate with his trans. Hog SHOULD have a shot ready when hooking, if not it’s not a valuable hook unless your team is with you to follow up 
    It's been added in this week's PTR patch.
Not all heroes wear capes.
    Do they ever die though?

"...So please play and give feeback!"

Not if you're on console though, fuck your consoles.
I feel like there's a joke or pun somwhere about zenyatta being the that they consider balanced. But I'm too tired to figure it out.
FFS, yet another mercy nerf and worse, while everyone else got a buff... 
WTF is wrong with Blizzard...

Originally Mercy had 50 hps, they buffed her healing to 60 hps because she was weak and now they nerf her again?

Do they even know what they are doing? Moira is better than Mercy anyway...

I think it is time for me to find new game...
It's probably one of, if not the most, recommended change I've seen to Ana, at least around this sub. It will be interesting to see if Rein's start charging in *before* getting Nano'd so that they get the full advantage of the heal.
    Hitting the Rein towards the end of his charge with nano has always been a great way to get value out of it.  This buff seems to now make it *the best* way to get said value.
    > It will be interesting to see if Rein's start charging in before getting Nano'd so that they get the full advantage of the heal.

It would be a waste not to. You charge in, you draw attention of their entire team and maybe even a couple CD's, then you get healed back to full health and have damage boost and damage resistance. You can have a heyday while the enemy team needs to back off and/or shift target priority, and the rest of your team is cleaning up. You're trading your 300HP (which you know you'll get back soon) to force investment of resources from the enemy, so there's an opportunity cost of *not* taking advantage of that free 300HP in that you've allowed the enemy to be in a stronger position than they could have been.
        I like to charge in and land a shatter before the boost but im normally low health.  This fixes that.
    That and it works through barriers. She finally has a way to do an emergency barrier bypassing heal. Not sure if this will be enough but it should help her out at the very least.
    yup it's one of the 2 things I wanted,

The other is the nade going through full health allies.
        >I curse when my nade blows up on full health allies at least once every other game.
            At least.

And don't come and tell me I need to "position better" it happens to everyone at every level. Often time your nade blows up on someone clipping through you from behind.
                Im not crazy then! I knew someone one hit my arm from behind and made me drop that nade on my self! 
        Or just through allies in general. When are you gonna need to bodyshot an ally with a nade that you can't hit the floor for instead?
            while it might makes sense, there's still a lot of case where directly hitting your allies is faster/easier/the only solution.

Also, the nade is realllllllllllllllly powerfull and if you could easily toss it in the middle of a front line , hit everyone allies and foes it might be too powerfull for a single ability and will need to be tone down somewhere else.

I'd rather have this ability to be more reliable (not being wasted on a flying mercy or a hugging torbjorn) without making it even more powerfull than it already is.
        I feel like a good option for this is to use E to throw the nade and then push E or RMB to detonate. That way you could throw it through crowds and choose when to detonate to maximize allies/enemies hit. 
        It'd be great if the hitbox was at least fixed. Trying to throw a nade around an Orisa or Rein at a choke is basically impossible.
    The reason she is off meta is her total lack of self-sustain and mobility.  Not that her nano target dies.
        Buffing her ultimate makes her better at her job though. She doesn’t have the self-sustain of other supports, which is a weakness, but now she is getting a buff to her strength which is enabling her teammates. That’s the Overwatch philosophy: makes strengths strong and weaknesses hard to overcome without teamwork or hero-switching. 
        Yeah, but I haven't actually seen frequent and consistent suggestions on how to fix those two. Nano Boost had more obvious buffs. I do agree this probably won't make her meta alone.
            I think making her reload heal her would be an interesting and unique way to give her a self heal, yet keep it limited.   She is all about being able to do many things, but not simultaneously.   I don't think a life steal or symbiosis self heal fits her design.   She is all about making conscious decisions with deliberate outcomes. 
I edited my original comments/post and moved to Lemmy, not because of Reddit API changes, but because spez does not care about the reddit community; only profits. I encourage others to move to something else.
    Yea especially during those panic ults.
    Now they just need to let you reverse a D.va Meka death by healing it before she jumps out (it is seriously so annoying to think you healed her just in time only to see her jump out of a Meka that is now sitting at 30% HP). lol
    Playing on the edge. Spicy.
I'm excited for it. This will let you pump up your dying tank to turn a fight around in a lot of scenarios where you simply couldn't before. 
    I’ve been playing a fair amount of rein lately and let me tell you, this makes me really happy. 
[deleted]
    Remember that Ana didn't have any extra mobility or self-sustain back when the was the core of the triple tank meta, though. I think the devs consider those weaknesses to be a core part of her character.
        Yeah, it seems that if her ult is useful enough, people will play around her weaknesses (Sombra has encountered this before too). Without that, other heroes are more appealing. This could be exactly the change she needs.
            If they'd made it a smaller heal and also a speed boost they probably wouldn't have felt the need to nerf Brigitte's shield. 
        She did have a helluva lot more healing output, more damage output, and nano gave a speed boost as well. Nades did 60 damage and added 100% healing bonus.

She was a huge pick because her downsides didn't overwhelm her upsides, like they do now.
        She was the core of triple tank because her healing was extremely high and she could easily kill divers by herself.
        Also remember that Lucio and Roadhog were much stronger back then as well and could easily peel for Ana.

Then, they were nerfed and Winston buffed, resulting in the rise of dive, which really screwed Ana over. 
        Also keep in mind that the Ana that ruled the roost back in the day also dealt more damage per shot, her nade dealt more damage, and her healing boost was stronger. Game has changed a lot, yes, but old Ana was also stronger. She was a 1v1 powerhouse.
    [deleted]
        But her counterpart Mercy got nerfed so we'll see.
    No, but at least the gap between her and mercys heal is smaller 
    Good, she should keep her unique weaknesses while buffing her strengths. 
        Agreed, heal denial and sleep are already super powerful in skilled hands. Increasing her mobility would be a pretty terrible idea. All heroes have their strengths and weaknesses, increasing her mobility/giving her a self heal would swing her into too OP 
it fills a similar function to rez, if you think about it - you bring back squishies to full health and a substantial amount of healing on tanks - and then they get 50% DR to boot

wonderful!
    I had the exact same thought! Instant full health for a squishy that was about to die is basically a res. Quite a bit better than res in many circumstances, actually. Nano builds fast enough that you can use it very disposably, as well. 
I feel like it won't make new people play Ana, but those that did will want to play her more... if that makes sense.

Ana has a hard time staying alive especially when targeted by multiple enemies. The change isn't going to do anything for that, but as fast as she generates ult, it will make her a better healer.

I think she's always going to be overly vulnerable; that's clearly her design. However, she needed a little something to encourage people to play her over other supports. This might push a few Ana lovers to keep picking her at the very least.
    I love playing Ana, but she doesn't need self heal.
It's a nice change but Ana still needs a self heal other than the nade. Make her heal herself for a small amount each time she shoots an ally. 
    Ana’s largest issue is that she cannot devote all of her uptime to healing while every other healer can. 

First, Ana has to reload her heal effect. No other healer has to do this with the same totality as Ana. While she is healing, Ana is still forced to interrupt her output for a solid two seconds to reload her gun. If she does not have her Granada available, no healing at all. If she is forced to engage an enemy, she cannot heal her team. Every other support can provide some healing output at all times, even when their abilities are down or they’re engaging an enemy. The only exception to this rule is Mercy, however she still passively heals herself, and her high mobility easily remedies weakness. 

Second, too much of Anas utility is tied to her grenade. While having a grenade that does 4 things is useful, it’s caused balance issues, and reinforces Anas issue with healing uptime. She relies on the grenade to heal herself, yet she needs to have it available to address any flankers or team pushes. If Ana had two grenades, one yellow, one purple, that each performed one half of her current grenade but on two separate cooldowns, players would be able to preserve one that might be needed soon but where both halves aren’t necessary. 

Lastly, Ana is requires line of sight but lacks the mobility to maintain it, decreasing uptime and mitigating her advantage at range. With barriers, body blocks, altitude changes, and just lots of stuff, Ana can not afford to be low to the ground. She needs to keep an eye on the entire battlefield, which requires her to reposition frequently. While she can certainly shoot on the move, she needs to hobble her old body to the high ground for the angle, which requires several seconds. 
    Let her stab one of her darts into her thigh. She would have to channel it so she can't do it in the middle of a fire fight, but she can duck around corners to heal
        Just steal some hogdrogen
Now all Ana has to do is give the heads up she's nano-ing because one problem I have is I always seem to have to reload right as she nano's me, lol
    I can see it potentially playing out similar to Winston’s ult. Get in there, do some damage. Lose some health and then get hit with a nano to bring you back up. 
        And continue on a rampage.  Could work well with dive tanks.  Think about it, they jump in, take damage, you nade and nano them, now they're up 550 health AND have effectively double health and extra damage.
            and take less damage too
                ** effectively double health.  My mistake in my post.
        The Nano/Winston combo has the potential to be so broken.  
Winston dives enemy team.  
Winston's health gets low, Primal Rages.  
Ana farms Ult off Primal Winston.  
Primal Ends.  
Winston starts charging Ult again.  
Ana Nano's Winston when he gets low.  
Winston can now sustain longer and deals so much more cleave damage that he could potentially charge a second Ultimate.


            Doesn't sound easier or more effective than grav dragon combo already is
                It's not meant to. Ults have more usage than just pure damage.
        Or chain it with his ult to do it twice in a row. Scientist jumps in, takes damage, ults, knocks people around, takes damage, gets boosted, melts face.
    Just buff Ana again to make it so the person she boosts instantly reloads lol
        I always wanted an ability to give a reset a teamates cool downs.  It could also counter sombras hack or ult.
    I don't always get nano'd but when I do I always need to reload and miss out on half of the ult
        When you get nano’d as Orisa and you have to reload is just painful.
Looks like it’s time to put my stereo down and dust off my gun :)
    Now is the time to pick the stereo up and play a little game called "get down Mr. President".
Don't worry. With the Lucio buff he is gonna get played more and will just jump in front of nano anyway.

BOOSTIO!!!!
Or if you’re playing Genji/ Rein and trying to dance around the insane focus which makes it harder to get healed and hoping you get a kill or two and don’t disappoint your Ana. :/
It's still outclassed by trans. It's instant, you can trans before an EMP without it getting canceled, block an unboosted dragonstrike, a boosted dragonblade, rocket barrage from not close up and many more. Soundbarrier is only good for small damage on allies that are far apart. Also beat into a push and then can everyone go their way.
    I find Sound Barrier is at its best when it's used as a shield against massive, predictable damage -- mainly RIP Tire and Self-Destruct. It'll also dampen (but not negate) Dragonblade and Tactical Visor -- that second one at least until everyone has a chance to find cover.
    Dragon strike can't be damaged boosted anymore, so it's once again a perfect counter to it too. Still needs a charge time buff and to not lose his ult when casted.
        > Dragon strike can't be damaged boosted anymore, 

What? I read all the patchnotes but might have missed this one. Is this on live servers too?
            It's not live IIRC, but it is on PTR.
IKR!!!! I love this!! I hope this leads to more diverse support meta. Also, as a casual player and Mercy main, I love that this is the kind of nerf they did - just a straight numbers tweak, without changing how she feels to play.
    Uh wait bro, that heal rate nerf is basically a dive comp Buff. [Seagull quote: Winston can now outdmg her heal]
Im really hoping it too though. Need Ana back!
        While -technically- winston can outdamage her healing, once you consider reload time, he doesn't. 300 damage vs 325 healing over 6.5 seconds.
            I think he quoted it on a Zen when the zen is allready low iirc. So basically a classic dive comp scenario.
                But at 10dp/s it'll take 20 seconds to kill a zen. Altho counteracting mercy healing is a big deal
            Those scenarios make no sense though. Dive means a winston, a d.va, a genji and potentially a tracer all jump the same target at the same time. Healing does not matter in that instance because the burst is too much. This is why brigitte is so strong against dive, she doesn't just heal, she increases the health threshold above a point where the target just gets instagibbed. And her stun also helps because a stunned target does 0 dps.
            bruh if winston is shooting you for 6 seconds without dying or having to run you've lost the group fight
        Lucio now counters deathball's grav combo AND synergies even better with dive as well. Dive is definitely coming back. 
        More diverse support meta... hes not wrong.
        Except... a dive comp isn't going to make Ana come back. If anything, it puts her in an even worse position than she's at now.
    Note that this is also a nerf to her ult's healing, and its charge rate, as well
yeah, saw people asking for nanobost buff like hour ago. It's not a speed buff but I think instaheal is actually very well designed buff.
i have no idea why nobody posted this 
Not sure, people are already saying that Winston, D.Va and Wrecking Ball are a very strong combo and it can easily shutdown an Ana. I hope I’m wrong.
    Seagull foreshadowed this on his stream when he was talking to the developers. For those unaware, he basically broke down the possibility of a triple tank dive comp.

* Winston jumping on you with jump pack and isolating you in a bubble with tesla cannon
* Dva shoving matrix and missiles in your face
* Hammond landing on you and knocking you up

Those 3 tanks landing on a single person will be so much burst damage. Like how do you even peel for that? 

-

Lucio Ana was pretty much the ideal support pairing back in the day, but a single boop will not stop all those tanks from just completely murdering your backline. 

You could play Brigitte, but then you lack tank killing tools like discord.

If you play Zen Ana, fucking good luck trying to survive with the two most least mobile heros in the game.

If you play Mercy Ana, then you have no defensive ultimate for team wipe combos.

If you play triple support, then how do you kill the tanks? It'll be like a fucking mosh pit if both teams run triple tank.

-

That said, we don't know how it will play out when Hammond reaches live. He could be like release day-Orisa and he might need changes to be usable in ladder.

I'm excited though. Healer changes and a new tank has to shake the meta at least a little bit.

                And occasionally, they'll eat them.
        Clearly, you amp speed boost Ana to safety around a corner and engage full boostio mode.

 **CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?!?**
        Yeah, but if you have like a Rein/Zarya/Brigitte, would that lose straight up?  No idea because I haven't touched Hammond on PTR, but a mix of bubbles, CC, and hammer-swinging seems to be capable of punishing such a dedicated dive.  Might need to have a Mercy on hand for an instant revive dedicated against those dives.
            If we'll coordinated dva boost melee + pile-driver +jump punch does 215 burst damage.
        TBH we were already seeing 3tank/3heal comps, i guess seeing it spread wouldn't be too surprising.
            Goats comp is not really dive just hold “w” type of thing. 
        Would Orisa help out against this comp with fortify and halt?
            Probably? Dva can eat the halt though.

However compared to when dive took over against the old triple tank with old soldier, we have a lot more tools to deal with dive now.

New Junkrat, New Hanzo, and Brigitte could pose major problems for triple tank dive and might stop the idea altogether. It definitely sounds insane on paper though.


        The thing is that even Doomfist will be strong in the 3x tank dive. Even Blizzard buffed Moira for the tanks. You can swap dps or any other healer to adjust for maps or counter comps. 
        Buff Roadhog for balance against dive ez.
        That’s actually scary, but since Hammond is a high skill hero maybe support players can have some time to figure out to play against him before people start getting really good with him. 

It’s funny how people complain about symmetra but she alone could actually negate all this heavy dive with her teleport. 

        I think you'd counter flying goats (Ham/Win/DVa) with ground goats. Matrix wont block Zarya/Rein left click, Winston is too squishy to survive without Matrix, theres a ton of healing and no good dive target because everyone plays super close together. It'll definitely be the moshpit meta.
Moira should probably be added to this pic since Ana+Moira is a surprisingly good combo.

EDIT: https://imgur.com/a/RCjr9fe

(Edited a second time to make Moira more transparent)
    IIRC this picture is from Moira was in game, when the Triple tank+Ana was the meta.

            Holy shit that is incredible!
                Thank you! Also thanks for the edit in your post! I just edited both my links because I made Moira more transparent. Feel free to update yours as well! <3
                    Updated!
Does dragon strike ignore all damage boosts (super charger/nano)? 
    I think there was a comment in another thread that said yes, blizzard made you unable to damage boost it in any way
        Then while this is definitely a shot at mercy I'm glad it does apply to everyone.  It would have been ***super*** dick to just stop mercy from damage boosting.  Though I'm assuming since Zen applies a "Debuff" that damage will still be added to dragon strike since It's not affecting the base ability. 
        theyre giving it the Riptire treatment being that its an entity separate from Hanzo -- tbh it was an inconsistency in ults that can be dmg boosted that always irked me
            It's not an inconsistency, the only things you can't damage boost are torb turret and rip tire, separate entities in that they have their own health bars. Hanzo ultimate should be damage boost- able as long as things like D.va's self destruct is.
    I'm not sure
    Yes
Wasnt this already added previously though? It was at least announced last week
    Yea it's been on the ptr for a week or so. I just wanted to point out that Mercy has a nerf, aside from the ones listed here, that hasn't gone live yet.
I don't play Mercy often, but when I do, I'm never really familiar with how damage boost works. Does it still apply if the projectile has already been fired once you boost? Which ultimates apply?
    > Does it still apply if the projectile has already been fired once you boost? 

The game checks for the boost effect at the moment damage is dealt. For projectiles with travel time, this means you must be boosting them as it hits.

> Which ultimates apply? 

Currently on live, you cannot damage boost Torbjorn or Symmetra's turrets or Junkrat's tire. On PTR, you also cannot boost Hanzo's dragons.

You can boost D.Va's bomb on live if you apply it to baby D.Va but I'm not sure if that was changed on PTR or not.

Everything else should be boostable, in theory.
        There are reports that damage boosting baby dva no longer boosts her ult damage on PTR
        > you also cannot boost Hanzo's dragons.

wtf this used to be so fun and it made dragons that much more dangerous
            I think they thought it was too powerful since it could outdamage trans.
    There isn't a consistent rule anymore
        This drives me up the wall about so many things within Overwatch; There isn't consistent rules for a lot of abilities and how they interact. 
            Hack Ulting Hog? Ult stops.

Hack Ulting S76? Ult continues.

Hack Turret Mode Bastion? Removed from mode.

Hack Tank Mode Bastion? Nah, still a tank.

Hack Mercy? Damage boost, heal beam and pistol all work.

Hack Moira? Both damage and heal beams work.

Hack Lucio? Primary shot works, but alt fire (boop) and passive heal are stopped.

CONSISTENCY AT ITS FINEST!
                Hack Lucio? Useless.
                    I assume you mean lucio becomes useless.
                        Yes.
                    Apagando las useless.
                It is a bit more consistent than you make it out to be, you just have to know the distinction between channeled ults and transformation ults. The channeled ults like whole hog and coalescence are stopped, but transformation ults like valkeryie, tank mode bastion, and tactical visor are not pretty much ever. They also a few months ago made pretty much all passives disabled by hacks... So a liiiitle bit more consistent than it used to be :)
                    Pretty much all passives... except ongoing ones, and mercy's regen.

Meanwhile certain ongoing things can be interrupted (d.va boost) whereas most others can't.

Meanwhile Bastion's turret transformation is removed, but every other transformation ability in the game is unnaffected.

Meanwhile Moira's left click has a resource bar, but remains unaffected, whereas Bastion's heal has a resource bar and is.

Meanwhile Lucio's ongoing song is shut off, but Zen's ongoing orbs aren't.
                    Also weapons vs abilities. Mercy and moira's left and right clicks aren't abilities, so they don't get stopped by hack, while Lucio's boop *is* an ability and therefore *does* get stopped by it. The fact that it's on right click doesn't matter.
                It's really just ults that are inconsistent. Weapons never get disabled, abilities and passives always get disabled, and ults either do or don't depending on their type.
                    Not all passives though.  Only passives that require a button press get disabled, like Mercy's Angelic Descent and Pharahs jetpack.  Others still work, like Bastion's Ironclad in tank form and Brigitte's Inspire.
                        That's a fair point, but worth noting it's still consistent. Passives that provide additional actions don't do so if you're hacked.
                The only inconsistent one is Lucio since other passives don't get hacked. S76 and Bastion are transformation ult while Hog is a channeled ult. All channeled ults get hacked such as McCree, Pharah, and Hog. Transformations like Bastion, Genji, S76 and Winston do not get hacked. Mercy and Moira left and right click don't get hacked because they are not abilities while Lucio boop is an ability with a cool down etc.
    Mercy's damage boost applies for when the projectile is hit. AKA, you can damage boost after a projectile is fired and still boost its damage.

As for ultimates, you can damage boost most of them: Dva, Roadhog, Bastion, Genji, Hanzo, McCree, Pharah, Reaper, Soldier, Torb (not his turret). 

You cannot damage boost the following ults: Doomfist, Junkrat, Torb's Turret

I am not sure about Tracer or Mei, but I think the damage boost applies for their ults as well.
        Damage boost does work on pulse bomb and blizzard
    The damage boost applies when the damage lands not when it is released 
Dang I hadn't heard that. That's kind of a big deal
I never heard of that. Thanks for pointing out. This is huge and will hopefully kill this damn grav dragon meta.
Mercy hasn’t been fun for me since last fall when she was reworked. It just keeps getting worse. I regret giving her my golden gun back in the day because she just sits on the bench now 
It's a nerf to all damage boosts
So can Lucios new barrier counter Grav Dragons?
I'm pretty sure Deadeye could still out-damage Lucio's shielding, but it would give his team a few seconds to find cover. 

Deadeye builds something around ~250 damage per second for 6 seconds. It should theoretically be capable of murder-killing anything with 1,500HP if McCree can pop it at the very last frame. 
    Technically, a rally + a sound barrier at the right moment will save Reinhardt and Hog, then...
        Don’t forget about torb and symm 

Edit: oh yeah, rip shield gen
    Though by those 6 seconds, everyone probably already hid somewhere... unless they're somehow immobilized by a Shatter / Grav / Blizzard.
        Or just put an arrow through mcree's face.
*casually sends a d.va bomb into the enemy 
INB4 a Sombra ult comes into play immediately afterward.

*Laughs in Spanish.
    I outplay Sombras quite easily. Just hide before they do it (usually along with another Ult) then do it after. 
Current very well timed Sound barrier can also save teammates from RIP Tires, but still.. Junkrats usually wait for the barrier to decay a bit when move into enemies.
As well as heal quite a bit less while in ult, yes. 
I mean, his old radius aoe was MASSIVE

the bonus shield is negated slightly by the fact that it decays in the same amount of time as the old one so it's not like the shield lasts longer in any way
    Yea but now you can survive burst-damage ults, like riptire and death blossom.  It'll also be a lot better against ults like tactical visor and whole hog.    Remember, despite decaying at the same speed, at any given point during the decay the players will have more HP than they did previously.
        Riptire can still wait out your shield to decay.
            the point remains.  also, more time spent fucking around with riptire is more time we can shoot at it
            This was my thought. Lucio ult doesnt do much for one shots because 99% of the time you're gonna get caught in the animation anyway and lose your ult and still die 
the change to the radius results in something like 44% more area covered... it is huge!
But does Moira REALLY need a buff? I feel like she slays already.
    It wouldn't be bad to tweak her a little bit. The ones who really needed the buff was Ana and Lucio for sure though.


The radius increase will also make it easier to get as many people as possible in on the Sound Barrier. A lot of times it's hard to get more than 2 or 3 with it, but the extra area should make a pretty big difference!
Oh, yes.

- a Zen/Lucio/Ana player

I don't want them touching Zen, he's already strong as it is and if they looked at him for changes he'd get a nerf, probably to discord orb.
Perfect Harmony.
Team - "Stop doing damage, you aren't DPS!!!" 

You - "but...I have to rec-"

Team - *Dead* "No heals, Moira is trash!"

You - "..... :( "


Always makes her so weak against double sniper and Pharah comps. Lots of constant, long distance damage and you're nearly empty by the time the enemy tanks roll up. Then you have to get through all the shielding in the current meta to get any juice back and in the meantime your team is still taking long distance damage but they're behind you where you can't see them while you're trying to farm resources. Gah!

No wonder all the successful comps just run Mercy, flying back and forth with infinite heals.
    I've had plenty of success with Moira. I usually take gold healing, even with a Mercy on the team.
Yep. Since I've gotten back into overwatch I've been maining Moira and I die a little inside when a teammate is asking for healing but I have no heal juice left and there's no enemies to recharge with close enough to me
    Yeah. I've learned to be a little more conservative with my orb due to that exact situation. This will help a ton.
Shit I'd settle for a 15% ult charge buff like they did with orisa.. but yes that cast time has got to go  
    To be fair a 15% charge buff would be fucking massive considering how much charge Lucio ult needs. 
        It's the slowest charging is the game isnt it? I mean fuck I could get a 4k+ with a boop and only get like 30% 
            I think Zarya's requires the most ult charge but Lucio might be slower because Zarya can get fully charged and dish out the DPS
                Zarya's Ult charge just got buffed too with the slower energy decay.
            Larger aura should mean faster ult technically. I hope so anyways.
    His ult will already charge faster with the aura buff. He will be able to heal more people with it, allowing him to build more ult charge. It's a similar situation with Mercy. She'll heal slower, so her ult will build slower.
        This is true. I've been playing PTR since it was live and I do gain ult faster. Not a huge amount but its definitely noticeable 
F'ing this. I never lose my ultimates except on Lucio. It hurts. It hurts me deep
    Clearly you aren't playing much Reinhardt these days.

Brig stun EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
VAMOS ESCULACH-
That or have it not deplete until it actually hits the ground.
    Or instead of having the ult charge go from 100% to 0% upon pressing Q have it "drain" from 100% to 0%
        1. I don't think that's a good idea. Although as a Lucio player it doesn't feel good to get stunned/killed while casting and lose ultimate, it also doesn't feel fun for the enemy, who used their cooldown ability reflexively to counter the Lucio ult. Skill imo, should be rewarded.

2. Almost all ults used to work on this drain system, but they changed the game for consistency (and the reason I mentioned) to have all ults go 100-0 the instant you press Q/whatever your ult key is.
    This is how it used to be and people didn't like it. It didn't feel good when you canceled Lucio ult just for him to use it again as soon as he was un-CC'd. There should be counter play. Maybe reduce the cast time on it, but don't straight up remove the only viable counterplay to it (with Sombra being not that viable).
        It’s how it used to be and I was fine with it... it might feel better to play against now but it feels like absolute shit to play. They need to either have some sort of refund system where it slowly depletes throughout the animation or speed up the animation. Something should change.
What If the cast time was zero during his "amp it up"  boost? It would feel a bit more like you're dropping a beat imo.
But how? That slam is iconic to his kit.
 Faster animation I guess.
    Just don't deplete ult charge until it hits. It's fast enough that it's only ever negated by chip damage. It is 100% of the time frustrating.

    Doin' god's work.
[removed]
    Pros hate Mercy way more than they hate Sombra, what are you talking about?
    No pro support player likes to play mercy. They just don't say it cause they had to accept it.
        That’s actually not true. I’ll have to dig for it but there is an interview with an OWL support player who says that Mercy is one of the most rewarding heroes to play well. 

Edit: I found it

https://overwatchwire.usatoday.com/2018/05/23/neptuno-mercy-is-one-of-the-most-complex-heroes-to-play-at-the-maximum-level/
            I get off on mercy jukes. That’s right boys, follow this tail. You know you want it. Oops I flew 60 meters behind you, don’t turn around I’m damage boosting someone.
                I dunno why people say this is boring to be fairly honest. The biggest fun part of playing Mercy is playing the game of cat and mouse, baiting people and generally being a nuisance. 

It's fun. It's not what most people come on OW for which is fine but when someone asks 'Why is Mercy boring?'' She isn't. You're just playing a different type of game. Part of the fun as to why I play both her and Symmetra is being a crafty little bitch.

                    Too many folks have a way too DPS-centric approach to OW.

OW is NOT a classic shooter game. Play/watch something else if you want that or deal with the fact that OW is about a lot more than crispy flicks. I know it's hard to tell with how Blizzard is (re)designing heroes these days, but that has been the original promise at least.
                    Playing mercy is a great break from playing dps. It really is an entirely different play style requiring an entirely different skill set 
                    God this so much. The idea that playing them "Is just a different type of game" is exactly what I say to friends, it's just *so* accurate
I wish I was getting some love. :(
    But we all love you.
        😭 Thanks everybody.
Unless you cast it to soon or too late, in which case you just lose your ult.
He still needs atleast a 15% ult charge buff like they gave Orisa and they need to cut the cast time of the ult in half. I also don't like that they gave him 250 extra shields but kept the same time for them to go away it should be atleast 1 second longer.
Plus trans still charges faster, lasts longer, is uninterruptable and  all of this attached to a much better character than Lucio.
    Sombra can't EMP trans once it is casted either!
        Yes, but your ultimate gets nullified by an ability that's on a 10 second cooldown 
    You raise a good point. Why is his ult cost the highest in the game still? 
        Because he had access to a broken amount of healing charge back with his massive heal-aura that covered the entire battlefield.

They ought to adjust it to his new range's output probably, but I think their thought-process is that they buffed the healing amount when they made it smaller, and his potential for overall healing charge is still the highest in a best case scenario. Zenyatta requires more enemy interaction to get his charge therefore it's seen as less of an issue.
    Trans is better because the meta combos involve CC and putting your team in a meat grinder.   You get a hammond/doomfist/tracer/mccree/junk ult throwing at the grav or shatter and suddenly Zen ult is the bad one.   Stuff like Nano blade or even just Mccree/Mei shots will kill your team even with a HoT on them.

They are 2 different ults (sustain vs burst) that counter 2 different types of danger.   The dps/tank meta is what defines the better support ult.
    One thing to think about is that Ana may come into play with her anti heal to cancel out zen more often now that she's seen a buff.
which means that it's still just as easy to wait it out with a tire or deadeye or such.
The ult buff might not be as significant, but his aura is now 44% larger, which I’d say is pretty significant.
I think the two extra meters will help more than most think it will.
is he? Mercy doesn't have reload time on her beam.
    Considering Winston will only deal 10 dps on a mercy pocket, that's 50 dmg after 5 seconds before reloading for 1.5 seconds, during which mercy would have healed for 75 dmg.

So yeah, still nothing. lol
        But now if a target is at like 40 health before Mercy comes to heal them Winston can actually still get the kill.
        But he'll at least be able to do something. Before, it was fruitless. He'd have to attack Mercy and risk being killed by her pocket. Now he can at least provide pressure
            Winston shouldn't dive someone getting pocketed by himself anyway. Nerfing her so he negates her healing and gets a tickle in is pretty significant.
            But why should Winston be able to kill someone being healed by Mercy (or any healer for that matter) then be able to move on and kill the Mercy or just leave? It's a bad move to dive someone getting healed, and it shouldn't be made easier for that bad choice.
                the problem was when you were fighting someone and mercy would start healing them when they were at like 30/40 hp and well gg you can't kill him anymore.
        Punch in between to get pretty much the same dps, but you don’t have to reload as quickly
Also Pharmercy is less of an issue. Easier to kill her. This is huge for console players as Pharah is the most oppressive hero to fight.
    Don't forget the buffs to damage falloff for Soldier, McCree, Bastion and Mei. Playing Pharah is gonna be pretty rough in general.
        Jesus christ...glad i dont play much anymore. All they do is fuck over the champs i like to play lol

Though most of the time its for a good reason admittantly lol


        She'll have more reason to play ground level and use the air as an "I'm in the clear to attack" instead of being her default. I hope it means people will stop getting angry when I'm not in the air constantly as Pharah. People know she's gonna be in the air, they aren't looking for her to boop herself out of a building to flank
            I think ground-pharah (aka TF2 soldier) will be actually a pretty good idea, with the rise of hitscans (ana counts and will be more prevalent) and the fall of mercy healing.
    Really?! That's very surprising to hear! I mean I probably play with people at my skill-level (pretty fucking bad), but Pharah's only an issue when our team comp completely skips hitscan. Am I missing a technique?

For me on console, I find Tracer and Genji to be the bigger pains in the ass. Blink and double-jump when they're really close makes for a much bigger arc to swing with console reticle tracking. That's their kit so I'm not crying about it - I just find them much more of a challenge than Pharah (since she moves about as fast as a derigible).

Is there something Pharahs are doing that I don't know about?
I wonder how long it'd take to kill a roadhog with a mercy pocket as winston.
    He still can't because of reload time.
Original Mercy had lower healing output. Her healing got buffed shortly after Ana was released to match her healing better. Since then Ana's output was cleaved via the grenade boost but for some reason mercy wasn't reverted till now.
I'm just imagining like a 20 second duel between a Winston left clicking and a frantic DPS + Mercy.
It will only work on targets below 50 health (80 if you count in a melee) since with weapon reloading she will still outheal him.
Only very slowly. It gives him an effective 10DPS which means he'd take more than 20 seconds to kill one hero.
[deleted]
    She is literally the only character that applies to for some reason. Hanzo's weakness was unreliable damage and no horizontal mobility. GUESS WHAT WAS FIXED AND MADE HIM OP AS BALLS?
    Lol another slap in the face for the Roadhog nerfs.

Note I think Roadhog is mostly balanced, but the Blizzard's balancing philosophy for Roadhog was so different from every other balance.
        Yeah.  I suppose he was just too frustrating though.    or they wanted to move him in a slightly different direction.  New hog is a lot of fun to me though.  Well, "new".  The one after the breather buffs.
    Yeah, but they went about it the wrong way. Ana's strengths were burst healing and ult generation, and nano's strength came from the speed boost. So they nerfed her burst healing and ult generation, and removed nano's speed boost. Then they buffed nano a little.

Personally, I think Ana should have inverse damage and healing falloff. Her point blank damage and healing should be similar to what it is now, but at long ranges she should deal more damage and have more healing, rewarding skill rather than standing inside a tank and holding M1.
They specifically want that to be hear weakness though consideirng her overall potential for healing is higher than anyone elses.
Balancing the game isn’t about making xyz hero completely kitted to the teeth, it’s about promoting their niche to provide total game balance. The ana and lucio buffs are nice, but put both on the same team and now it’s deadly. Lucio can help ana escape a bit more easily, ana is arguably (apart from brig) the best support at defending themselves in an active sense of the word, but slow as a rock by herself. Brig + insert any other hero is slightly less OP which is nice. I guess regarding the ana changes, they’ve chosen to go down the route of buffing her niche rather than lessening her weaknesses in order to promote her clutch potential, which among supports is definitely up there with lucio and zens ults. A big rein nano towards the end of a team fight can now seriously swing the game even if ana dies.
They've nerfed almost everything about Mercy and it hasn't been able to balance her, so it was healing outputs turn. CD Rez is the problem though and they're not willing to acknowledge it.
Watching your repair pack track back and forth across the sky trying to reach a panicked Genji in time, only to finally reach his dead corpse on the ground is mildly entertaining, though. 
As much as I wish I could stop playing Mercy in my comp games, it will probably be in the next PTR cycle. This current PTR is already jam packed: hit scans brought back from the grave, Hanzo flicked on the nose and an entire new hero. Tossing the support meta into a blender too? That'd just make it hard to analyze how effective the changes were.


&nbsp;


I mean just imagine Blizzard's statistic department the week after a patch like that drops, "So right now we're in a triple dps meta where Hammond is played as an effectual fourth dps... Is this because the new healers allow such weirdness or are the hit scans just too powerful now?" Obviously it's an extreme example, but if you release too many balancing changes at once we see what in statistics is called "confounding." When there are just too many variables to separate it becomes increasingly hard to determine the real causes of certain things, which may lead to poor balancing choices and knee jerk reactions down the road. So we'll likely see the Hammond patch drop, the new healer ptr go live, and while the healers are in ptr Blizzard can assess how the hitscans are doing so that when the healers go live it'll be easier to read the statistics and evaluate their next balancing move. 
Are ... are you gonna hit me with 3 support buffs at the same time?
    Yes yes yes Oh my god...

Probably not still.  Two people vs one.  But it does help a fair amount.
I don’t think it would mean they counter Pharmercy directly. Rather, with the increased damage and lower healing, it means that Mercy is going to need to babysit Pharah for a longer period of time. And as powerful as Pharah is, if Mercy is always playing catch up with the healing her rockets are not getting boosted and her team is not getting Main healing unless they are foregoing Trans or Sound Barrier and using Ana/Moira instead. That makes them really vulnerable to combos like Shatter or Graviton, so it’s definitely a trade off. Running Pharmercy isn’t going to be as easy as it once was...and I love that. Super annoying to play against in solo queue or quick play because the lack of coordination means it usually dominates. 
I'd hope not. One player by themselves should not counter two players working together. That would just be plain flat-out bad design in a game which is supposed to be built on teamwork.
well, release mercy had SOMETHING going on for her with her ult... 

after the patch every other support will have more to offer than just healing. 
I agree with this.  I've lost track of the amount of times I've just wasted his ult misjudging that knife's edge of timing of survive-ability vs effectiveness.  Too soon and rip tire still kills everyone, too late you end up dropping before the "beat". 
    I think the extra Barrier Health is going to help, but that only means it’s going to drain even faster. Lucios ultimate always feels weird because it lasts maybe 3 seconds and it’s gone, not really making much of a difference unless you can tune it during an Enemy Ult/Firefight pretty well, and good luck keeping him alive during whatever is happening.

Having it be a solid number for a few seconds would help, because at the moment it’s only good for tanking burst-damage like Junkrats Ult, or if you’re quick, maybe a McCree or DVA bomb. The fact that it shaves away so quickly along with Enemies damaging you, it just doesn’t feel like much. It’s gone so quickly.
Ana in a short time, mercy over long time
The key word is “consistently”.

Ana struggles with a lot in order for her to heal, like shields, enemies and aim. Mercy simply ignores it.
Single target burst = Ana

AoE burst = Moira

Sustained = Mercy

Is how it should be at least.
Dont forget Moira, a good one can outheal a Mercy thanks to the aoe even now already.
Pardon my flair, but I think Junkrat is actually pretty average right now save for his ult. I would take a tire nerf (maybe a 7-8 second duration instead of 10) if it meant the grenade size nerf got reverted. That one just came out of the blue for no reason considering his grenade launcher was exactly the same as it was at launch when he was a troll pick...

That and he has one of the lowest pickrates once you get past gold
    Since his riptire nerf, he's been pretty good imo. 
Nah, Junkrat is fine. Hanzo is still annoying though.
If GA gets nerfed you’re better off just reverting her to 1.0 where you have to hide like a mole for most of the game.
The point is everyone needs to have weaknesses, but the strengths should balance the weakness out.
This means you should start nanoing him in these situations, despite you not thinking you should. 
It's coming from the same people who thought Mercy would disappear after her rework.
A lot of it is not missing shots but being denied by barriers. Enemy D.va matrixed your dps? mercy dgaf, Ana does, etc. 
The snail pace they release changes is due to their clinging to the PTR.  They need to give up on that, its a waste of time, they are supposed to be a game development company, test and go live and if you need to change things do it but the PTR is not catching bugs TONS of stuff goes broken from PTR straight to live so why waste weeks/months of time with it.... Sombra is a great example with the last 6 months AND last year with the infinite health pack hack.
> Very clever Blizzard, bundling the Mercy nerf with the other support changes is a good way to balance Mercy without feeling like you’re bullying the Mercy mains again.

Nerfing Mercy in the same patch as buffing other supports is a good way to not make people feel like Mercy got bulled? Lol.
    Buffing 3 Supports and nerfing 2 at least allows Blizzard to dodge the shouts of "MOAR PROOF BLIZZARD HATES SUPPORTS" that seems to accompany every Mercy nerf.
    I use to main Mercy but haven't played her in months, or however long it's been since the rework. I still feel like I'm getting bullied by these changes.
        I stopped playing Overwatch because of the lag and the bullying on Mercy... never played a game with so much anger towards supports.
            Yeah, I agree with you there. I never thought someone who is suppose to keep you alive could get so much hate. Oh well, I still play occasionally, but I don't play support like I use to.
                I've moved towards Paladins, actually. It's got a lot of love for its supports and theres no lag. I'm enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would... still going to play OW though... just no Mercy, despite being a Mercy Main.
        That’s the only good things about her changes to me. I used to basically one trick her. Now I main support but play Moira, Mercy, brigette, hog, mccree mostly so it’s made me branch out. I’ve gotten better at least (made diamond for first time ever). But I still hate to see my favorite character nerfed yet again.
            Same here. I truly enjoyed playing with her old rez, before being able to move, before the invincibility, before all that. I just can't wnjoy the game playing as her now, but I still try to get all her items.
    Def feels like she got bullied. "You all get these great changes. "You get nothing." "You get punished."
        It's better than heavily nerfing Mercy to bring her down to the same level as the other supports, like they have been doing. Instead they are bringing them all up. Plus, Brigitte is getting a nerf as well, though it's not as big I think.
            if they keep this up that shield bash CD is going to be as long as rein's charge C
                Nah, this is probably the last time they'll change it. 5 was overpowered, 6 was overtuned, 7 will be in line with how strong she's designed to be in close range. At worst it'll go to 8, which is the same CD as flashbang.
                    5 sec cooldown on shield bash was so annoying and really overpowered but it felt so nice to murder all the genjis, tracers and winstons, especially after months of dive comps. Never as a support main I had a job that required dealing with flankers and dive, it felt so good.

But 7sec is a fair cooldown for such a powerful ability which is also fairly easy to pull off consistently. 
[deleted]
    Everyone has been saying that since Mercy's first rework lol
        Mercy 2.0 was the most broken thing this game has seen.
            Holy god yes, back when her rez was on a 5 second CD or w/e it was in her ult. Could easily get 15+ rezzes in a game.
                It was always on 30 second cooldown, BUT:

* instant 

* recharges immediately when activating Valcyrie

* During Valcyrie the cooldown of rezz is only 10 seconds

* Valcyrie lasted for 20 seconds. 

You could rezz, Valk, rezz, rezz 10 seconds later, rezz 10 seconds later, 4 instant rezzes in ~21 seconds.
        Really? r/overwatch gets extremely defensive whenever we suggest a Mercy nerf.
            r/Overwatch isn't really the premiere place for balance ideals in the community

I didn't just mean people on this subreddit when I said "everyone"


                r/overwatch is very casual-oriented, so I'd say they're sadly representative of the majority of the community.
                    This subreddit is home to some of the biggest babies I've ever met on Reddit. Definitely not representative of the community! 
    Nope. **Mercy was never a must pick until she had rez available every 30 seconds.** 
> bundling the Mercy nerf with the other support changes is a good way to balance Mercy without feeling like you’re bullying the Mercy mains again.

Except every other healer got a buff, so it feels even more like they are bullying her.
    Except Brigitte
        And Zen
    Brigitte. Got. Nerfed.
    I mean, she still the stronger healer on the meta with Zen, she couldn't get a buff.
For real. Nano is already good if you dont give it to a low health hero (why would you?) and now Blade + Nano seems more OP. She doesnt even need mobility, self heal will make her independent of other healers.
Oh, let's break it DOoo*gets shield bashed*

"Oh! Let's break it dow- Woah, woah, woah,  HEY!"
(cuz he says that when he gets stunned. And I heard his stun lines too many times)
>Maybe an increase in cast time as well?

And nerf Sound Barrier? No thanks. 
In all fairness, this is actually a fair and reasonable buff for Nano.

I am not that experienced with Ana just yet, but there are situations where I am deterred from using Nano on someone because they're about to die. With this, I can Nano someone mid-fight knowing they will probably be alive to use it actually.
    i didn't fully think about it like that, but i recall several times i encountered a similar issue- i'm welcome to any n all Ana buffs, but i'm greedy n want more for our beloved granny
Better group healing (orb, ult). Pretty decent damage (for a support) 
    I hadn't considered group healing, that is a good point.
Mercy is supposed to bring most *consistent* healing.
Agree. I feel sorry for Mercy mains. 

They have spirit and determination to play boring full-support hero in the FPS game full of fun action-packed heroes. 

Not only they don't get any reward for this, but they also branded with a mark of one-buttoned noobs in the game community. Despite all of that, after every nerf they keep pushing their hero to the limits, finding new ways to maximize it's usefulness for a team, which only leads to the new nerfs from the developers.
    Exactly, I wish they’d see these nerfs just suck the character dry. I just want to see some solid changes for Mercy already. But as long as the community does not care, they unfortunately won’t. 
[deleted]
    Yet she has had some of the highest pick rates of any hero even when she was the weakest healer. Just because you find her boring to play...
        [deleted]
> Moreover, if the mercy nerfs are to harsh I'm sure Blizzard will adjust them as they see fit

I'll believe it when I see it. I'm still miffed at what they did with Sombra.
Agreed, having the most reliable point healing is powerful enough and minor number tweaks aren't going to make her any less useful if played in the right hands. It more means other healers can keep up instead of always falling short which is always beneficial.

I've been dreaming of the day where other healers become more relevant so hopefully this brings us closer to that.
They're never going to get rid of it, though; it's up there with like Tracer as one of the defining aspects of Overwatch.  One of the first images you see is of Mercy descending like an angel to bring back her fallen heroes.
The rework has been a failure but blizzard will never admit it. A series of nerfs since it was place on live. 
what? thats so dumb.

Your post is a clear example of Riot balancing vs Icefrog balancing. You don't destroy what makes a hero unique. You keep unique abilities strong. Nerf their weaknesses rather than their strengths. 
    That is how you end up with very lopsided heroes. The more the rest of Mercy's kit gets nerfed, the more her power is in the rez, and it's already a *huge* part of her kit.

And the funny part is that because damage just keeps going up in Overwatch, with (pseudo) one-shots becoming almost the norm, the time to kill just keeps going down and healing matters less and less, while rezzing stays strong.
        Yep.  We are in a one-shot sniper meta so healing in general is worthless compared to rez.  
    and how is nerfing mercy's healing, something she does better than any other support, nerfing her weakness?
Rez is not the problem lmfao, if anything its her survivabiltiy.
The problem with removing Rez is that it's a direct buff to Widow since Widow's snipe are usualy easy rezzes (as long as you have a sheild) since they tend to be in your area of the map.

Widow is already strong enough as it is.

I don't mind removing Rez and reworking Mercy again, but if they do that, I hope that a lot of heroes will be tweak since the repercussions will be massive.
You are completely off base. People pick Mercy because she is an incredibly reliable healer. Resurrect is icing on the cake. You nerf her healing, and people won't play her, regardless of how "strong" resurrect is. I don't get why people don't understand this.
I don't see how rez is a problem. Given that abilities like Riptire or Dragon Strike can instantly delete your team, why is it bad that there is an ability that brings them back? Q to win is allowed, but E to rez is not?
There's too much healing/sustain in this game hence why OHKs are such a big deal. Nerfing discord/mercy tether just feeds that problem and makes chips damage even less important.
Mercy Nerf is an indirect Zen nerf.
Let's just keep buffing healing until one-shot abilities are the only way to kill anything.
Their reasoning for buffing it in the first place was because Ana was outhealing her. They nerfed Ana's healing and the reason for her buff but still she wasn't touched for so long. I am pleasantly surprised. 
I think confining rez (mostly) as is to Valk would be better. 

That’s as close to removing Rez from the game as you could get it, and it wouldn’t feel broken af like the old Rez was.
Hide in a corner and then 5 man rez for no penalty wasn't fun. Nor was it balanced
    Seriously, I don't know how people have managed to convince themselves that old mercy was more fun. She was *strictly* less interesting and in terms of balance, she was trash tier in pro and only passable in solo q because non-support players could pick her up so easily. 
        This
    ^ This

It makes me wonder what game people were playing where they thought a 5 man rez was balanced.
        If they made Rez an ult, they should give it line of sight and a cast time. I think that would make it balanced
        The game where people were punished for burning all their ults on the final push.

Hide 'n rez Mercy wasn't even that common. Tempo rezzing was the norm.
        Probably “well DVA can wipe a whole team with little threat to herself, so why not let a character do the opposite?”
>Oh come on! Just a fresh clip after trans, that's all we're asking!

Is that a request for a Zenyatta _buff_? Wowee that was unexpected.

Edit: Aaaaand it happened. Wowee.
    I would also love use meditation to fully restore my balls.
You're lucky he didn't get nerfed lol
I think the Mercy change is probably the right way to go. Mercy really is the most consistent healer in Overwatch and they really need to avoid buffing healing too much to avoid another Ana+tank meta. Mercy still is the only support that can erase a solo pick and has a reasonable damage boost and high mobility. I trust that they'll keep track of her healing to make sure they didn't over-nerf it.
There was a 0% chance if zenyatta was on this list that he would have been buffed. I honestly cant believe he wasnt nerfed
Every shield and DM say “hi”.
Also makes for great comedy as the Hog’s team realizes he just yanked a superpowered angry German man into the middle of their formation.
    I always feel bad when I displace a Rein only for him to get nano'd and kill our team. :C
    I FEEEEEEL UNSTOPPABLE! AHAHAHAH!!

Not quite the middle of their formation but I did basically kill my own Hanzo with what you described. :< 
    Relevant: https://twitter.com/shenanigansen/status/741731962323361792
    "Guten tag!" - superpowered, angry, German man
oh snap!

now you can actually start the fight that way if they hook your genji.
I've had so many times where my tanks are playing so passively that I just Nano my Rein (cross my fingers) and we break the choke and cap the point. 
    I wish. I will nano my rein, fire shots into him, nade him, and say "I gotcha, Rein" and he will protect himself with his shield.
        As a tank main, sometimes I don't have a choice. 

Nothing worse than getting nano'd on a long kill zone when the enemy rein has shatter.
        aww.. people just don't play a lot with ana anymore these days, i am sure it will change before long.

for example: way back in the day a rein would not swing his hammer when i (zen) was trancing all around him but these days they almost all do that.
Offensive Rein is best Rein!  

Edit: *You're powered up, get in there!*
    I AM UNSTOPPABLE!
Eeeeh... If you want them to stop nanoing you for almost no reason, just don't play the way they want you to. Keep doing what you do if you really want them to stop :P
    I want to play with the team, but whenever I get a good Ana they just keep me alive no matter how stupid a thing I do!
        So YOU'RE one of those kinds of Reinhardts that enables the Anas to give nano boosts randomly! Please stop, you need to play more cautious.
I refuse to stop enabling my tanks to ruin the other team's day. >:(
nah, you just need to know when you have an ana with nano behind you and when you have a mercy/zen instead :P
I almost always boost rein, as I play a lot of rein myself.  It's just a satisfying feeling.

 "Swing the hammer buddy.  Swing that hammer".
I would like to state for the record the situations you put me in drastically lower my life expectancy.
    In all fairness they drastically lower mine in game.
There is nothing I love more than wrecking face as Reinhardt.

Bonus if someone says "I have no idea how you did that rein"
No prob - glad I was finally in a situation where I could make it and pay it forward for once

>Channeled and transformation ultimate abilities now restore ammunition after completion for some heroes

>Channeled abilities affected: Junkrat’s RIP-Tire, Pharah’s Barrage, Roadhog’s Whole Hog, and **Zenyatta’s Transcendence**

    [deleted]
        Is it? I mean, I see no reason not to do this, but Roadhog ults usually go one of two ways: Hog dies. Hog kills his enemy(ies).

Don't usually see a scenario where Hog needs to keep fighting, but doesn't have ammo. 

But I'm sure this will help with that fringe case. :)
            It’s usually against a dva that manages to eat the last bit of your ult. If she’s already in your face when you finish, and you got no ammo, she can do a lotta damage while youre reloading and healing
    Was just about to post this link. Glad to see they are changing that!
The new PTR update has reload for Trans now. Hog, Winston, Genji, Pharah, Junkrat, and Zen now have full ammo after ult. https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/overwatch-ptr-patch-notes-july-18-2018/163715
    Glad they made it consistent across all of them. They added it to reaper a while ago
As a zen main I hope he never gets buffed, the last thing I want is them to buff him, make him op, then give him a rework and ruin him.
    As a D.Va main I can relate a lot.

My primary support hero is Angela, so again: I can relate A LOT.
Ehh Zen's good enough. Plan your reload imo
    Can't always plan your reload when you have to trans before dying/getting earthshattered.
        Neither does/can Hog when he hooks.....

I main Zen... It doesn't bother me that I don't get a free reload on trans.
            20 balls is a lotta balls. I rarely run out before either I or my enemies die
            But hog isn’t meant to protect a team from an ultimate with his trans. Hog SHOULD have a shot ready when hooking, if not it’s not a valuable hook unless your team is with you to follow up 
It's been added in this week's PTR patch.
Do they ever die though?

    #NO CAPES!
    Capes never die!
        For a price.  Consult your tailor for details.
Hitting the Rein towards the end of his charge with nano has always been a great way to get value out of it.  This buff seems to now make it *the best* way to get said value.
> It will be interesting to see if Rein's start charging in before getting Nano'd so that they get the full advantage of the heal.

It would be a waste not to. You charge in, you draw attention of their entire team and maybe even a couple CD's, then you get healed back to full health and have damage boost and damage resistance. You can have a heyday while the enemy team needs to back off and/or shift target priority, and the rest of your team is cleaning up. You're trading your 300HP (which you know you'll get back soon) to force investment of resources from the enemy, so there's an opportunity cost of *not* taking advantage of that free 300HP in that you've allowed the enemy to be in a stronger position than they could have been.
    I like to charge in and land a shatter before the boost but im normally low health.  This fixes that.
That and it works through barriers. She finally has a way to do an emergency barrier bypassing heal. Not sure if this will be enough but it should help her out at the very least.
yup it's one of the 2 things I wanted,

The other is the nade going through full health allies.
    >I curse when my nade blows up on full health allies at least once every other game.
        At least.

And don't come and tell me I need to "position better" it happens to everyone at every level. Often time your nade blows up on someone clipping through you from behind.
            Im not crazy then! I knew someone one hit my arm from behind and made me drop that nade on my self! 
    Or just through allies in general. When are you gonna need to bodyshot an ally with a nade that you can't hit the floor for instead?
        while it might makes sense, there's still a lot of case where directly hitting your allies is faster/easier/the only solution.

Also, the nade is realllllllllllllllly powerfull and if you could easily toss it in the middle of a front line , hit everyone allies and foes it might be too powerfull for a single ability and will need to be tone down somewhere else.

I'd rather have this ability to be more reliable (not being wasted on a flying mercy or a hugging torbjorn) without making it even more powerfull than it already is.
    I feel like a good option for this is to use E to throw the nade and then push E or RMB to detonate. That way you could throw it through crowds and choose when to detonate to maximize allies/enemies hit. 
    It'd be great if the hitbox was at least fixed. Trying to throw a nade around an Orisa or Rein at a choke is basically impossible.
The reason she is off meta is her total lack of self-sustain and mobility.  Not that her nano target dies.
    Buffing her ultimate makes her better at her job though. She doesn’t have the self-sustain of other supports, which is a weakness, but now she is getting a buff to her strength which is enabling her teammates. That’s the Overwatch philosophy: makes strengths strong and weaknesses hard to overcome without teamwork or hero-switching. 
    Yeah, but I haven't actually seen frequent and consistent suggestions on how to fix those two. Nano Boost had more obvious buffs. I do agree this probably won't make her meta alone.
        I think making her reload heal her would be an interesting and unique way to give her a self heal, yet keep it limited.   She is all about being able to do many things, but not simultaneously.   I don't think a life steal or symbiosis self heal fits her design.   She is all about making conscious decisions with deliberate outcomes. 
Yea especially during those panic ults.
Now they just need to let you reverse a D.va Meka death by healing it before she jumps out (it is seriously so annoying to think you healed her just in time only to see her jump out of a Meka that is now sitting at 30% HP). lol
Playing on the edge. Spicy.
I’ve been playing a fair amount of rein lately and let me tell you, this makes me really happy. 
Remember that Ana didn't have any extra mobility or self-sustain back when the was the core of the triple tank meta, though. I think the devs consider those weaknesses to be a core part of her character.
    Yeah, it seems that if her ult is useful enough, people will play around her weaknesses (Sombra has encountered this before too). Without that, other heroes are more appealing. This could be exactly the change she needs.
        If they'd made it a smaller heal and also a speed boost they probably wouldn't have felt the need to nerf Brigitte's shield. 
    She did have a helluva lot more healing output, more damage output, and nano gave a speed boost as well. Nades did 60 damage and added 100% healing bonus.

She was a huge pick because her downsides didn't overwhelm her upsides, like they do now.
    She was the core of triple tank because her healing was extremely high and she could easily kill divers by herself.
    Also remember that Lucio and Roadhog were much stronger back then as well and could easily peel for Ana.

Then, they were nerfed and Winston buffed, resulting in the rise of dive, which really screwed Ana over. 
    Also keep in mind that the Ana that ruled the roost back in the day also dealt more damage per shot, her nade dealt more damage, and her healing boost was stronger. Game has changed a lot, yes, but old Ana was also stronger. She was a 1v1 powerhouse.
[deleted]
    But her counterpart Mercy got nerfed so we'll see.
No, but at least the gap between her and mercys heal is smaller 
Good, she should keep her unique weaknesses while buffing her strengths. 
    Agreed, heal denial and sleep are already super powerful in skilled hands. Increasing her mobility would be a pretty terrible idea. All heroes have their strengths and weaknesses, increasing her mobility/giving her a self heal would swing her into too OP 
I had the exact same thought! Instant full health for a squishy that was about to die is basically a res. Quite a bit better than res in many circumstances, actually. Nano builds fast enough that you can use it very disposably, as well. 
I love playing Ana, but she doesn't need self heal.
Ana’s largest issue is that she cannot devote all of her uptime to healing while every other healer can. 

First, Ana has to reload her heal effect. No other healer has to do this with the same totality as Ana. While she is healing, Ana is still forced to interrupt her output for a solid two seconds to reload her gun. If she does not have her Granada available, no healing at all. If she is forced to engage an enemy, she cannot heal her team. Every other support can provide some healing output at all times, even when their abilities are down or they’re engaging an enemy. The only exception to this rule is Mercy, however she still passively heals herself, and her high mobility easily remedies weakness. 

Second, too much of Anas utility is tied to her grenade. While having a grenade that does 4 things is useful, it’s caused balance issues, and reinforces Anas issue with healing uptime. She relies on the grenade to heal herself, yet she needs to have it available to address any flankers or team pushes. If Ana had two grenades, one yellow, one purple, that each performed one half of her current grenade but on two separate cooldowns, players would be able to preserve one that might be needed soon but where both halves aren’t necessary. 

Lastly, Ana is requires line of sight but lacks the mobility to maintain it, decreasing uptime and mitigating her advantage at range. With barriers, body blocks, altitude changes, and just lots of stuff, Ana can not afford to be low to the ground. She needs to keep an eye on the entire battlefield, which requires her to reposition frequently. While she can certainly shoot on the move, she needs to hobble her old body to the high ground for the angle, which requires several seconds. 
Let her stab one of her darts into her thigh. She would have to channel it so she can't do it in the middle of a fire fight, but she can duck around corners to heal
    Just steal some hogdrogen
I can see it potentially playing out similar to Winston’s ult. Get in there, do some damage. Lose some health and then get hit with a nano to bring you back up. 
    And continue on a rampage.  Could work well with dive tanks.  Think about it, they jump in, take damage, you nade and nano them, now they're up 550 health AND have effectively double health and extra damage.
        and take less damage too
            ** effectively double health.  My mistake in my post.
    The Nano/Winston combo has the potential to be so broken.  
Winston dives enemy team.  
Winston's health gets low, Primal Rages.  
Ana farms Ult off Primal Winston.  
Primal Ends.  
Winston starts charging Ult again.  
Ana Nano's Winston when he gets low.  
Winston can now sustain longer and deals so much more cleave damage that he could potentially charge a second Ultimate.


        Doesn't sound easier or more effective than grav dragon combo already is
            It's not meant to. Ults have more usage than just pure damage.
    Or chain it with his ult to do it twice in a row. Scientist jumps in, takes damage, ults, knocks people around, takes damage, gets boosted, melts face.
Just buff Ana again to make it so the person she boosts instantly reloads lol
    I always wanted an ability to give a reset a teamates cool downs.  It could also counter sombras hack or ult.
I don't always get nano'd but when I do I always need to reload and miss out on half of the ult
    When you get nano’d as Orisa and you have to reload is just painful.
Now is the time to pick the stereo up and play a little game called "get down Mr. President".
I find Sound Barrier is at its best when it's used as a shield against massive, predictable damage -- mainly RIP Tire and Self-Destruct. It'll also dampen (but not negate) Dragonblade and Tactical Visor -- that second one at least until everyone has a chance to find cover.
Dragon strike can't be damaged boosted anymore, so it's once again a perfect counter to it too. Still needs a charge time buff and to not lose his ult when casted.
    > Dragon strike can't be damaged boosted anymore, 

What? I read all the patchnotes but might have missed this one. Is this on live servers too?
        It's not live IIRC, but it is on PTR.
Uh wait bro, that heal rate nerf is basically a dive comp Buff. [Seagull quote: Winston can now outdmg her heal]
Im really hoping it too though. Need Ana back!
    While -technically- winston can outdamage her healing, once you consider reload time, he doesn't. 300 damage vs 325 healing over 6.5 seconds.
        I think he quoted it on a Zen when the zen is allready low iirc. So basically a classic dive comp scenario.
            But at 10dp/s it'll take 20 seconds to kill a zen. Altho counteracting mercy healing is a big deal
        Those scenarios make no sense though. Dive means a winston, a d.va, a genji and potentially a tracer all jump the same target at the same time. Healing does not matter in that instance because the burst is too much. This is why brigitte is so strong against dive, she doesn't just heal, she increases the health threshold above a point where the target just gets instagibbed. And her stun also helps because a stunned target does 0 dps.
        bruh if winston is shooting you for 6 seconds without dying or having to run you've lost the group fight
    Lucio now counters deathball's grav combo AND synergies even better with dive as well. Dive is definitely coming back. 
    More diverse support meta... hes not wrong.
    Except... a dive comp isn't going to make Ana come back. If anything, it puts her in an even worse position than she's at now.
Note that this is also a nerf to her ult's healing, and its charge rate, as well
Seagull foreshadowed this on his stream when he was talking to the developers. For those unaware, he basically broke down the possibility of a triple tank dive comp.

* Winston jumping on you with jump pack and isolating you in a bubble with tesla cannon
* Dva shoving matrix and missiles in your face
* Hammond landing on you and knocking you up

Those 3 tanks landing on a single person will be so much burst damage. Like how do you even peel for that? 

-

Lucio Ana was pretty much the ideal support pairing back in the day, but a single boop will not stop all those tanks from just completely murdering your backline. 

You could play Brigitte, but then you lack tank killing tools like discord.

If you play Zen Ana, fucking good luck trying to survive with the two most least mobile heros in the game.

If you play Mercy Ana, then you have no defensive ultimate for team wipe combos.

If you play triple support, then how do you kill the tanks? It'll be like a fucking mosh pit if both teams run triple tank.

-

That said, we don't know how it will play out when Hammond reaches live. He could be like release day-Orisa and he might need changes to be usable in ladder.

I'm excited though. Healer changes and a new tank has to shake the meta at least a little bit.


    > Hammond landing on you and knocking you up

            And occasionally, they'll eat them.
    Clearly, you amp speed boost Ana to safety around a corner and engage full boostio mode.

 **CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?!?**
    Yeah, but if you have like a Rein/Zarya/Brigitte, would that lose straight up?  No idea because I haven't touched Hammond on PTR, but a mix of bubbles, CC, and hammer-swinging seems to be capable of punishing such a dedicated dive.  Might need to have a Mercy on hand for an instant revive dedicated against those dives.
        If we'll coordinated dva boost melee + pile-driver +jump punch does 215 burst damage.
    TBH we were already seeing 3tank/3heal comps, i guess seeing it spread wouldn't be too surprising.
        Goats comp is not really dive just hold “w” type of thing. 
    Would Orisa help out against this comp with fortify and halt?
        Probably? Dva can eat the halt though.

However compared to when dive took over against the old triple tank with old soldier, we have a lot more tools to deal with dive now.

New Junkrat, New Hanzo, and Brigitte could pose major problems for triple tank dive and might stop the idea altogether. It definitely sounds insane on paper though.


    The thing is that even Doomfist will be strong in the 3x tank dive. Even Blizzard buffed Moira for the tanks. You can swap dps or any other healer to adjust for maps or counter comps. 
    Buff Roadhog for balance against dive ez.
    That’s actually scary, but since Hammond is a high skill hero maybe support players can have some time to figure out to play against him before people start getting really good with him. 

It’s funny how people complain about symmetra but she alone could actually negate all this heavy dive with her teleport. 

    I think you'd counter flying goats (Ham/Win/DVa) with ground goats. Matrix wont block Zarya/Rein left click, Winston is too squishy to survive without Matrix, theres a ton of healing and no good dive target because everyone plays super close together. It'll definitely be the moshpit meta.
IIRC this picture is from Moira was in game, when the Triple tank+Ana was the meta.

Did it :>


        Holy shit that is incredible!
            Thank you! Also thanks for the edit in your post! I just edited both my links because I made Moira more transparent. Feel free to update yours as well! <3
                Updated!
I think there was a comment in another thread that said yes, blizzard made you unable to damage boost it in any way
    Then while this is definitely a shot at mercy I'm glad it does apply to everyone.  It would have been ***super*** dick to just stop mercy from damage boosting.  Though I'm assuming since Zen applies a "Debuff" that damage will still be added to dragon strike since It's not affecting the base ability. 
    theyre giving it the Riptire treatment being that its an entity separate from Hanzo -- tbh it was an inconsistency in ults that can be dmg boosted that always irked me
        It's not an inconsistency, the only things you can't damage boost are torb turret and rip tire, separate entities in that they have their own health bars. Hanzo ultimate should be damage boost- able as long as things like D.va's self destruct is.
I'm not sure
Yes
Yea it's been on the ptr for a week or so. I just wanted to point out that Mercy has a nerf, aside from the ones listed here, that hasn't gone live yet.
> Does it still apply if the projectile has already been fired once you boost? 

The game checks for the boost effect at the moment damage is dealt. For projectiles with travel time, this means you must be boosting them as it hits.

> Which ultimates apply? 

Currently on live, you cannot damage boost Torbjorn or Symmetra's turrets or Junkrat's tire. On PTR, you also cannot boost Hanzo's dragons.

You can boost D.Va's bomb on live if you apply it to baby D.Va but I'm not sure if that was changed on PTR or not.

Everything else should be boostable, in theory.
    There are reports that damage boosting baby dva no longer boosts her ult damage on PTR
    > you also cannot boost Hanzo's dragons.

wtf this used to be so fun and it made dragons that much more dangerous
        I think they thought it was too powerful since it could outdamage trans.
There isn't a consistent rule anymore
    This drives me up the wall about so many things within Overwatch; There isn't consistent rules for a lot of abilities and how they interact. 
        Hack Ulting Hog? Ult stops.

Hack Ulting S76? Ult continues.

Hack Turret Mode Bastion? Removed from mode.

Hack Tank Mode Bastion? Nah, still a tank.

Hack Mercy? Damage boost, heal beam and pistol all work.

Hack Moira? Both damage and heal beams work.

Hack Lucio? Primary shot works, but alt fire (boop) and passive heal are stopped.

CONSISTENCY AT ITS FINEST!
            Hack Lucio? Useless.
                I assume you mean lucio becomes useless.
                    Yes.
                Apagando las useless.
            It is a bit more consistent than you make it out to be, you just have to know the distinction between channeled ults and transformation ults. The channeled ults like whole hog and coalescence are stopped, but transformation ults like valkeryie, tank mode bastion, and tactical visor are not pretty much ever. They also a few months ago made pretty much all passives disabled by hacks... So a liiiitle bit more consistent than it used to be :)
                Pretty much all passives... except ongoing ones, and mercy's regen.

Meanwhile certain ongoing things can be interrupted (d.va boost) whereas most others can't.

Meanwhile Bastion's turret transformation is removed, but every other transformation ability in the game is unnaffected.

Meanwhile Moira's left click has a resource bar, but remains unaffected, whereas Bastion's heal has a resource bar and is.

Meanwhile Lucio's ongoing song is shut off, but Zen's ongoing orbs aren't.
                Also weapons vs abilities. Mercy and moira's left and right clicks aren't abilities, so they don't get stopped by hack, while Lucio's boop *is* an ability and therefore *does* get stopped by it. The fact that it's on right click doesn't matter.
            It's really just ults that are inconsistent. Weapons never get disabled, abilities and passives always get disabled, and ults either do or don't depending on their type.
                Not all passives though.  Only passives that require a button press get disabled, like Mercy's Angelic Descent and Pharahs jetpack.  Others still work, like Bastion's Ironclad in tank form and Brigitte's Inspire.
                    That's a fair point, but worth noting it's still consistent. Passives that provide additional actions don't do so if you're hacked.
            The only inconsistent one is Lucio since other passives don't get hacked. S76 and Bastion are transformation ult while Hog is a channeled ult. All channeled ults get hacked such as McCree, Pharah, and Hog. Transformations like Bastion, Genji, S76 and Winston do not get hacked. Mercy and Moira left and right click don't get hacked because they are not abilities while Lucio boop is an ability with a cool down etc.
Mercy's damage boost applies for when the projectile is hit. AKA, you can damage boost after a projectile is fired and still boost its damage.

As for ultimates, you can damage boost most of them: Dva, Roadhog, Bastion, Genji, Hanzo, McCree, Pharah, Reaper, Soldier, Torb (not his turret). 

You cannot damage boost the following ults: Doomfist, Junkrat, Torb's Turret

I am not sure about Tracer or Mei, but I think the damage boost applies for their ults as well.
    Damage boost does work on pulse bomb and blizzard
The damage boost applies when the damage lands not when it is released 
Technically, a rally + a sound barrier at the right moment will save Reinhardt and Hog, then...
    Don’t forget about torb and symm 

Edit: oh yeah, rip shield gen
Though by those 6 seconds, everyone probably already hid somewhere... unless they're somehow immobilized by a Shatter / Grav / Blizzard.
    Or just put an arrow through mcree's face.
I outplay Sombras quite easily. Just hide before they do it (usually along with another Ult) then do it after. 
Yea but now you can survive burst-damage ults, like riptire and death blossom.  It'll also be a lot better against ults like tactical visor and whole hog.    Remember, despite decaying at the same speed, at any given point during the decay the players will have more HP than they did previously.
    Riptire can still wait out your shield to decay.
        the point remains.  also, more time spent fucking around with riptire is more time we can shoot at it
        This was my thought. Lucio ult doesnt do much for one shots because 99% of the time you're gonna get caught in the animation anyway and lose your ult and still die 
It wouldn't be bad to tweak her a little bit. The ones who really needed the buff was Ana and Lucio for sure though.


I've had plenty of success with Moira. I usually take gold healing, even with a Mercy on the team.
Yeah. I've learned to be a little more conservative with my orb due to that exact situation. This will help a ton.
To be fair a 15% charge buff would be fucking massive considering how much charge Lucio ult needs. 
    It's the slowest charging is the game isnt it? I mean fuck I could get a 4k+ with a boop and only get like 30% 
        I think Zarya's requires the most ult charge but Lucio might be slower because Zarya can get fully charged and dish out the DPS
            Zarya's Ult charge just got buffed too with the slower energy decay.
        Larger aura should mean faster ult technically. I hope so anyways.
His ult will already charge faster with the aura buff. He will be able to heal more people with it, allowing him to build more ult charge. It's a similar situation with Mercy. She'll heal slower, so her ult will build slower.
    This is true. I've been playing PTR since it was live and I do gain ult faster. Not a huge amount but its definitely noticeable 
Clearly you aren't playing much Reinhardt these days.

Brig stun EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
Or instead of having the ult charge go from 100% to 0% upon pressing Q have it "drain" from 100% to 0%
    1. I don't think that's a good idea. Although as a Lucio player it doesn't feel good to get stunned/killed while casting and lose ultimate, it also doesn't feel fun for the enemy, who used their cooldown ability reflexively to counter the Lucio ult. Skill imo, should be rewarded.

2. Almost all ults used to work on this drain system, but they changed the game for consistency (and the reason I mentioned) to have all ults go 100-0 the instant you press Q/whatever your ult key is.
This is how it used to be and people didn't like it. It didn't feel good when you canceled Lucio ult just for him to use it again as soon as he was un-CC'd. There should be counter play. Maybe reduce the cast time on it, but don't straight up remove the only viable counterplay to it (with Sombra being not that viable).
    It’s how it used to be and I was fine with it... it might feel better to play against now but it feels like absolute shit to play. They need to either have some sort of refund system where it slowly depletes throughout the animation or speed up the animation. Something should change.
Just don't deplete ult charge until it hits. It's fast enough that it's only ever negated by chip damage. It is 100% of the time frustrating. 
Doin' god's work.
Pros hate Mercy way more than they hate Sombra, what are you talking about?
No pro support player likes to play mercy. They just don't say it cause they had to accept it.
    That’s actually not true. I’ll have to dig for it but there is an interview with an OWL support player who says that Mercy is one of the most rewarding heroes to play well. 

Edit: I found it

https://overwatchwire.usatoday.com/2018/05/23/neptuno-mercy-is-one-of-the-most-complex-heroes-to-play-at-the-maximum-level/
        I get off on mercy jukes. That’s right boys, follow this tail. You know you want it. Oops I flew 60 meters behind you, don’t turn around I’m damage boosting someone.
            I dunno why people say this is boring to be fairly honest. The biggest fun part of playing Mercy is playing the game of cat and mouse, baiting people and generally being a nuisance. 

It's fun. It's not what most people come on OW for which is fine but when someone asks 'Why is Mercy boring?'' She isn't. You're just playing a different type of game. Part of the fun as to why I play both her and Symmetra is being a crafty little bitch.

                Too many folks have a way too DPS-centric approach to OW.

OW is NOT a classic shooter game. Play/watch something else if you want that or deal with the fact that OW is about a lot more than crispy flicks. I know it's hard to tell with how Blizzard is (re)designing heroes these days, but that has been the original promise at least.
                Playing mercy is a great break from playing dps. It really is an entirely different play style requiring an entirely different skill set 
                God this so much. The idea that playing them "Is just a different type of game" is exactly what I say to friends, it's just *so* accurate
But we all love you.
    😭 Thanks everybody.
Sombra can't EMP trans once it is casted either!
    Yes, but your ultimate gets nullified by an ability that's on a 10 second cooldown 
You raise a good point. Why is his ult cost the highest in the game still? 
    Because he had access to a broken amount of healing charge back with his massive heal-aura that covered the entire battlefield.

They ought to adjust it to his new range's output probably, but I think their thought-process is that they buffed the healing amount when they made it smaller, and his potential for overall healing charge is still the highest in a best case scenario. Zenyatta requires more enemy interaction to get his charge therefore it's seen as less of an issue.
Trans is better because the meta combos involve CC and putting your team in a meat grinder.   You get a hammond/doomfist/tracer/mccree/junk ult throwing at the grav or shatter and suddenly Zen ult is the bad one.   Stuff like Nano blade or even just Mccree/Mei shots will kill your team even with a HoT on them.

They are 2 different ults (sustain vs burst) that counter 2 different types of danger.   The dps/tank meta is what defines the better support ult.
One thing to think about is that Ana may come into play with her anti heal to cancel out zen more often now that she's seen a buff.
Considering Winston will only deal 10 dps on a mercy pocket, that's 50 dmg after 5 seconds before reloading for 1.5 seconds, during which mercy would have healed for 75 dmg.

So yeah, still nothing. lol
    But now if a target is at like 40 health before Mercy comes to heal them Winston can actually still get the kill.
    But he'll at least be able to do something. Before, it was fruitless. He'd have to attack Mercy and risk being killed by her pocket. Now he can at least provide pressure
        Winston shouldn't dive someone getting pocketed by himself anyway. Nerfing her so he negates her healing and gets a tickle in is pretty significant.
        But why should Winston be able to kill someone being healed by Mercy (or any healer for that matter) then be able to move on and kill the Mercy or just leave? It's a bad move to dive someone getting healed, and it shouldn't be made easier for that bad choice.
            the problem was when you were fighting someone and mercy would start healing them when they were at like 30/40 hp and well gg you can't kill him anymore.
    Punch in between to get pretty much the same dps, but you don’t have to reload as quickly
Don't forget the buffs to damage falloff for Soldier, McCree, Bastion and Mei. Playing Pharah is gonna be pretty rough in general.
    Jesus christ...glad i dont play much anymore. All they do is fuck over the champs i like to play lol

Though most of the time its for a good reason admittantly lol


    She'll have more reason to play ground level and use the air as an "I'm in the clear to attack" instead of being her default. I hope it means people will stop getting angry when I'm not in the air constantly as Pharah. People know she's gonna be in the air, they aren't looking for her to boop herself out of a building to flank
        I think ground-pharah (aka TF2 soldier) will be actually a pretty good idea, with the rise of hitscans (ana counts and will be more prevalent) and the fall of mercy healing.
Really?! That's very surprising to hear! I mean I probably play with people at my skill-level (pretty fucking bad), but Pharah's only an issue when our team comp completely skips hitscan. Am I missing a technique?

For me on console, I find Tracer and Genji to be the bigger pains in the ass. Blink and double-jump when they're really close makes for a much bigger arc to swing with console reticle tracking. That's their kit so I'm not crying about it - I just find them much more of a challenge than Pharah (since she moves about as fast as a derigible).

Is there something Pharahs are doing that I don't know about?
He still can't because of reload time.
She is literally the only character that applies to for some reason. Hanzo's weakness was unreliable damage and no horizontal mobility. GUESS WHAT WAS FIXED AND MADE HIM OP AS BALLS?
Lol another slap in the face for the Roadhog nerfs.

Note I think Roadhog is mostly balanced, but the Blizzard's balancing philosophy for Roadhog was so different from every other balance.
    Yeah.  I suppose he was just too frustrating though.    or they wanted to move him in a slightly different direction.  New hog is a lot of fun to me though.  Well, "new".  The one after the breather buffs.
Yeah, but they went about it the wrong way. Ana's strengths were burst healing and ult generation, and nano's strength came from the speed boost. So they nerfed her burst healing and ult generation, and removed nano's speed boost. Then they buffed nano a little.

Personally, I think Ana should have inverse damage and healing falloff. Her point blank damage and healing should be similar to what it is now, but at long ranges she should deal more damage and have more healing, rewarding skill rather than standing inside a tank and holding M1.
Yes yes yes Oh my god...
I think the extra Barrier Health is going to help, but that only means it’s going to drain even faster. Lucios ultimate always feels weird because it lasts maybe 3 seconds and it’s gone, not really making much of a difference unless you can tune it during an Enemy Ult/Firefight pretty well, and good luck keeping him alive during whatever is happening.

Having it be a solid number for a few seconds would help, because at the moment it’s only good for tanking burst-damage like Junkrats Ult, or if you’re quick, maybe a McCree or DVA bomb. The fact that it shaves away so quickly along with Enemies damaging you, it just doesn’t feel like much. It’s gone so quickly.
Since his riptire nerf, he's been pretty good imo. 
Buffing 3 Supports and nerfing 2 at least allows Blizzard to dodge the shouts of "MOAR PROOF BLIZZARD HATES SUPPORTS" that seems to accompany every Mercy nerf.
I use to main Mercy but haven't played her in months, or however long it's been since the rework. I still feel like I'm getting bullied by these changes.
    I stopped playing Overwatch because of the lag and the bullying on Mercy... never played a game with so much anger towards supports.
        Yeah, I agree with you there. I never thought someone who is suppose to keep you alive could get so much hate. Oh well, I still play occasionally, but I don't play support like I use to.
            I've moved towards Paladins, actually. It's got a lot of love for its supports and theres no lag. I'm enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would... still going to play OW though... just no Mercy, despite being a Mercy Main.
    That’s the only good things about her changes to me. I used to basically one trick her. Now I main support but play Moira, Mercy, brigette, hog, mccree mostly so it’s made me branch out. I’ve gotten better at least (made diamond for first time ever). But I still hate to see my favorite character nerfed yet again.
        Same here. I truly enjoyed playing with her old rez, before being able to move, before the invincibility, before all that. I just can't wnjoy the game playing as her now, but I still try to get all her items.
Def feels like she got bullied. "You all get these great changes. "You get nothing." "You get punished."
    It's better than heavily nerfing Mercy to bring her down to the same level as the other supports, like they have been doing. Instead they are bringing them all up. Plus, Brigitte is getting a nerf as well, though it's not as big I think.
        if they keep this up that shield bash CD is going to be as long as rein's charge C
            Nah, this is probably the last time they'll change it. 5 was overpowered, 6 was overtuned, 7 will be in line with how strong she's designed to be in close range. At worst it'll go to 8, which is the same CD as flashbang.
                5 sec cooldown on shield bash was so annoying and really overpowered but it felt so nice to murder all the genjis, tracers and winstons, especially after months of dive comps. Never as a support main I had a job that required dealing with flankers and dive, it felt so good.

But 7sec is a fair cooldown for such a powerful ability which is also fairly easy to pull off consistently. 
Everyone has been saying that since Mercy's first rework lol
    Mercy 2.0 was the most broken thing this game has seen.
        Holy god yes, back when her rez was on a 5 second CD or w/e it was in her ult. Could easily get 15+ rezzes in a game.
            It was always on 30 second cooldown, BUT:

* instant 

* recharges immediately when activating Valcyrie

* During Valcyrie the cooldown of rezz is only 10 seconds

* Valcyrie lasted for 20 seconds. 

You could rezz, Valk, rezz, rezz 10 seconds later, rezz 10 seconds later, 4 instant rezzes in ~21 seconds.
    Really? r/overwatch gets extremely defensive whenever we suggest a Mercy nerf.
        r/Overwatch isn't really the premiere place for balance ideals in the community

I didn't just mean people on this subreddit when I said "everyone"


            r/overwatch is very casual-oriented, so I'd say they're sadly representative of the majority of the community.
                This subreddit is home to some of the biggest babies I've ever met on Reddit. Definitely not representative of the community! 
Nope. **Mercy was never a must pick until she had rez available every 30 seconds.** 
Except Brigitte
    And Zen
Brigitte. Got. Nerfed.
I mean, she still the stronger healer on the meta with Zen, she couldn't get a buff.
*gets hacked, pocket sanded, storm arrowed, shield bashed, hooked, pulled, doomfist punched within 3 seconds*
    https://youtu.be/QLpUq__iQqw
    That's a terrible team comp
        i'm more concerned as to how there's 7 players on a team than the team composition
            This must be the work of an enemy 「M E R C Y」!
Oh, let's break it Doo *gets slept*
Ive heard this to many times. Let me clarify. 

"Oh! Let's break it dow- Woah, woah, woah,  HEY!"
(cuz he says that when he gets stunned. And I heard his stun lines too many times)
i didn't fully think about it like that, but i recall several times i encountered a similar issue- i'm welcome to any n all Ana buffs, but i'm greedy n want more for our beloved granny
I hadn't considered group healing, that is a good point.
Exactly, I wish they’d see these nerfs just suck the character dry. I just want to see some solid changes for Mercy already. But as long as the community does not care, they unfortunately won’t. 
Yet she has had some of the highest pick rates of any hero even when she was the weakest healer. Just because you find her boring to play...
    [deleted]
That is how you end up with very lopsided heroes. The more the rest of Mercy's kit gets nerfed, the more her power is in the rez, and it's already a *huge* part of her kit.

And the funny part is that because damage just keeps going up in Overwatch, with (pseudo) one-shots becoming almost the norm, the time to kill just keeps going down and healing matters less and less, while rezzing stays strong.
    Yep.  We are in a one-shot sniper meta so healing in general is worthless compared to rez.  
and how is nerfing mercy's healing, something she does better than any other support, nerfing her weakness?
Seriously, I don't know how people have managed to convince themselves that old mercy was more fun. She was *strictly* less interesting and in terms of balance, she was trash tier in pro and only passable in solo q because non-support players could pick her up so easily. 
    This
^ This

It makes me wonder what game people were playing where they thought a 5 man rez was balanced.
    If they made Rez an ult, they should give it line of sight and a cast time. I think that would make it balanced
    The game where people were punished for burning all their ults on the final push.

Hide 'n rez Mercy wasn't even that common. Tempo rezzing was the norm.
    Probably “well DVA can wipe a whole team with little threat to herself, so why not let a character do the opposite?”
I would also love use meditation to fully restore my balls.
I always feel bad when I displace a Rein only for him to get nano'd and kill our team. :C
I FEEEEEEL UNSTOPPABLE! AHAHAHAH!!

Not quite the middle of their formation but I did basically kill my own Hanzo with what you described. :< 
Relevant: https://twitter.com/shenanigansen/status/741731962323361792
"Guten tag!" - superpowered, angry, German man
I wish. I will nano my rein, fire shots into him, nade him, and say "I gotcha, Rein" and he will protect himself with his shield.
    As a tank main, sometimes I don't have a choice. 

Nothing worse than getting nano'd on a long kill zone when the enemy rein has shatter.
    aww.. people just don't play a lot with ana anymore these days, i am sure it will change before long.

for example: way back in the day a rein would not swing his hammer when i (zen) was trancing all around him but these days they almost all do that.
I AM UNSTOPPABLE!
I want to play with the team, but whenever I get a good Ana they just keep me alive no matter how stupid a thing I do!
    So YOU'RE one of those kinds of Reinhardts that enables the Anas to give nano boosts randomly! Please stop, you need to play more cautious.
In all fairness they drastically lower mine in game.

    Is it? I mean, I see no reason not to do this, but Roadhog ults usually go one of two ways: Hog dies. Hog kills his enemy(ies).

Don't usually see a scenario where Hog needs to keep fighting, but doesn't have ammo. 

But I'm sure this will help with that fringe case. :)
        It’s usually against a dva that manages to eat the last bit of your ult. If she’s already in your face when you finish, and you got no ammo, she can do a lotta damage while youre reloading and healing
Was just about to post this link. Glad to see they are changing that!
Glad they made it consistent across all of them. They added it to reaper a while ago
As a D.Va main I can relate a lot.

My primary support hero is Angela, so again: I can relate A LOT.
Can't always plan your reload when you have to trans before dying/getting earthshattered.
    Neither does/can Hog when he hooks.....

I main Zen... It doesn't bother me that I don't get a free reload on trans.
        20 balls is a lotta balls. I rarely run out before either I or my enemies die
        But hog isn’t meant to protect a team from an ultimate with his trans. Hog SHOULD have a shot ready when hooking, if not it’s not a valuable hook unless your team is with you to follow up 
#NO CAPES!
Capes never die!
    For a price.  Consult your tailor for details.
I like to charge in and land a shatter before the boost but im normally low health.  This fixes that.
>I curse when my nade blows up on full health allies at least once every other game.
    At least.

And don't come and tell me I need to "position better" it happens to everyone at every level. Often time your nade blows up on someone clipping through you from behind.
        Im not crazy then! I knew someone one hit my arm from behind and made me drop that nade on my self! 
Or just through allies in general. When are you gonna need to bodyshot an ally with a nade that you can't hit the floor for instead?
    while it might makes sense, there's still a lot of case where directly hitting your allies is faster/easier/the only solution.

Also, the nade is realllllllllllllllly powerfull and if you could easily toss it in the middle of a front line , hit everyone allies and foes it might be too powerfull for a single ability and will need to be tone down somewhere else.

I'd rather have this ability to be more reliable (not being wasted on a flying mercy or a hugging torbjorn) without making it even more powerfull than it already is.
I feel like a good option for this is to use E to throw the nade and then push E or RMB to detonate. That way you could throw it through crowds and choose when to detonate to maximize allies/enemies hit. 
It'd be great if the hitbox was at least fixed. Trying to throw a nade around an Orisa or Rein at a choke is basically impossible.
Buffing her ultimate makes her better at her job though. She doesn’t have the self-sustain of other supports, which is a weakness, but now she is getting a buff to her strength which is enabling her teammates. That’s the Overwatch philosophy: makes strengths strong and weaknesses hard to overcome without teamwork or hero-switching. 
Yeah, but I haven't actually seen frequent and consistent suggestions on how to fix those two. Nano Boost had more obvious buffs. I do agree this probably won't make her meta alone.
    I think making her reload heal her would be an interesting and unique way to give her a self heal, yet keep it limited.   She is all about being able to do many things, but not simultaneously.   I don't think a life steal or symbiosis self heal fits her design.   She is all about making conscious decisions with deliberate outcomes. 
Yeah, it seems that if her ult is useful enough, people will play around her weaknesses (Sombra has encountered this before too). Without that, other heroes are more appealing. This could be exactly the change she needs.
    If they'd made it a smaller heal and also a speed boost they probably wouldn't have felt the need to nerf Brigitte's shield. 
She did have a helluva lot more healing output, more damage output, and nano gave a speed boost as well. Nades did 60 damage and added 100% healing bonus.

She was a huge pick because her downsides didn't overwhelm her upsides, like they do now.
She was the core of triple tank because her healing was extremely high and she could easily kill divers by herself.
Also remember that Lucio and Roadhog were much stronger back then as well and could easily peel for Ana.

Then, they were nerfed and Winston buffed, resulting in the rise of dive, which really screwed Ana over. 
Also keep in mind that the Ana that ruled the roost back in the day also dealt more damage per shot, her nade dealt more damage, and her healing boost was stronger. Game has changed a lot, yes, but old Ana was also stronger. She was a 1v1 powerhouse.
But her counterpart Mercy got nerfed so we'll see.
Agreed, heal denial and sleep are already super powerful in skilled hands. Increasing her mobility would be a pretty terrible idea. All heroes have their strengths and weaknesses, increasing her mobility/giving her a self heal would swing her into too OP 
Just steal some hogdrogen
And continue on a rampage.  Could work well with dive tanks.  Think about it, they jump in, take damage, you nade and nano them, now they're up 550 health AND have effectively double health and extra damage.
    and take less damage too
        ** effectively double health.  My mistake in my post.
The Nano/Winston combo has the potential to be so broken.  
Winston dives enemy team.  
Winston's health gets low, Primal Rages.  
Ana farms Ult off Primal Winston.  
Primal Ends.  
Winston starts charging Ult again.  
Ana Nano's Winston when he gets low.  
Winston can now sustain longer and deals so much more cleave damage that he could potentially charge a second Ultimate.


    Doesn't sound easier or more effective than grav dragon combo already is
        It's not meant to. Ults have more usage than just pure damage.
Or chain it with his ult to do it twice in a row. Scientist jumps in, takes damage, ults, knocks people around, takes damage, gets boosted, melts face.
I always wanted an ability to give a reset a teamates cool downs.  It could also counter sombras hack or ult.
When you get nano’d as Orisa and you have to reload is just painful.
> Dragon strike can't be damaged boosted anymore, 

What? I read all the patchnotes but might have missed this one. Is this on live servers too?
    It's not live IIRC, but it is on PTR.
While -technically- winston can outdamage her healing, once you consider reload time, he doesn't. 300 damage vs 325 healing over 6.5 seconds.
    I think he quoted it on a Zen when the zen is allready low iirc. So basically a classic dive comp scenario.
        But at 10dp/s it'll take 20 seconds to kill a zen. Altho counteracting mercy healing is a big deal
    Those scenarios make no sense though. Dive means a winston, a d.va, a genji and potentially a tracer all jump the same target at the same time. Healing does not matter in that instance because the burst is too much. This is why brigitte is so strong against dive, she doesn't just heal, she increases the health threshold above a point where the target just gets instagibbed. And her stun also helps because a stunned target does 0 dps.
    bruh if winston is shooting you for 6 seconds without dying or having to run you've lost the group fight
Lucio now counters deathball's grav combo AND synergies even better with dive as well. Dive is definitely coming back. 
More diverse support meta... hes not wrong.
Except... a dive comp isn't going to make Ana come back. If anything, it puts her in an even worse position than she's at now.

        And occasionally, they'll eat them.
Clearly, you amp speed boost Ana to safety around a corner and engage full boostio mode.

 **CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?!?**
Yeah, but if you have like a Rein/Zarya/Brigitte, would that lose straight up?  No idea because I haven't touched Hammond on PTR, but a mix of bubbles, CC, and hammer-swinging seems to be capable of punishing such a dedicated dive.  Might need to have a Mercy on hand for an instant revive dedicated against those dives.
    If we'll coordinated dva boost melee + pile-driver +jump punch does 215 burst damage.
TBH we were already seeing 3tank/3heal comps, i guess seeing it spread wouldn't be too surprising.
    Goats comp is not really dive just hold “w” type of thing. 
Would Orisa help out against this comp with fortify and halt?
    Probably? Dva can eat the halt though.

However compared to when dive took over against the old triple tank with old soldier, we have a lot more tools to deal with dive now.

New Junkrat, New Hanzo, and Brigitte could pose major problems for triple tank dive and might stop the idea altogether. It definitely sounds insane on paper though.


The thing is that even Doomfist will be strong in the 3x tank dive. Even Blizzard buffed Moira for the tanks. You can swap dps or any other healer to adjust for maps or counter comps. 
Buff Roadhog for balance against dive ez.
That’s actually scary, but since Hammond is a high skill hero maybe support players can have some time to figure out to play against him before people start getting really good with him. 

It’s funny how people complain about symmetra but she alone could actually negate all this heavy dive with her teleport. 

I think you'd counter flying goats (Ham/Win/DVa) with ground goats. Matrix wont block Zarya/Rein left click, Winston is too squishy to survive without Matrix, theres a ton of healing and no good dive target because everyone plays super close together. It'll definitely be the moshpit meta.

Did it :>


    Holy shit that is incredible!
        Thank you! Also thanks for the edit in your post! I just edited both my links because I made Moira more transparent. Feel free to update yours as well! <3
            Updated!
Then while this is definitely a shot at mercy I'm glad it does apply to everyone.  It would have been ***super*** dick to just stop mercy from damage boosting.  Though I'm assuming since Zen applies a "Debuff" that damage will still be added to dragon strike since It's not affecting the base ability. 
theyre giving it the Riptire treatment being that its an entity separate from Hanzo -- tbh it was an inconsistency in ults that can be dmg boosted that always irked me
    It's not an inconsistency, the only things you can't damage boost are torb turret and rip tire, separate entities in that they have their own health bars. Hanzo ultimate should be damage boost- able as long as things like D.va's self destruct is.
There are reports that damage boosting baby dva no longer boosts her ult damage on PTR
> you also cannot boost Hanzo's dragons.

wtf this used to be so fun and it made dragons that much more dangerous
    I think they thought it was too powerful since it could outdamage trans.
This drives me up the wall about so many things within Overwatch; There isn't consistent rules for a lot of abilities and how they interact. 
    Hack Ulting Hog? Ult stops.

Hack Ulting S76? Ult continues.

Hack Turret Mode Bastion? Removed from mode.

Hack Tank Mode Bastion? Nah, still a tank.

Hack Mercy? Damage boost, heal beam and pistol all work.

Hack Moira? Both damage and heal beams work.

Hack Lucio? Primary shot works, but alt fire (boop) and passive heal are stopped.

CONSISTENCY AT ITS FINEST!
        Hack Lucio? Useless.
            I assume you mean lucio becomes useless.
                Yes.
            Apagando las useless.
        It is a bit more consistent than you make it out to be, you just have to know the distinction between channeled ults and transformation ults. The channeled ults like whole hog and coalescence are stopped, but transformation ults like valkeryie, tank mode bastion, and tactical visor are not pretty much ever. They also a few months ago made pretty much all passives disabled by hacks... So a liiiitle bit more consistent than it used to be :)
            Pretty much all passives... except ongoing ones, and mercy's regen.

Meanwhile certain ongoing things can be interrupted (d.va boost) whereas most others can't.

Meanwhile Bastion's turret transformation is removed, but every other transformation ability in the game is unnaffected.

Meanwhile Moira's left click has a resource bar, but remains unaffected, whereas Bastion's heal has a resource bar and is.

Meanwhile Lucio's ongoing song is shut off, but Zen's ongoing orbs aren't.
            Also weapons vs abilities. Mercy and moira's left and right clicks aren't abilities, so they don't get stopped by hack, while Lucio's boop *is* an ability and therefore *does* get stopped by it. The fact that it's on right click doesn't matter.
        It's really just ults that are inconsistent. Weapons never get disabled, abilities and passives always get disabled, and ults either do or don't depending on their type.
            Not all passives though.  Only passives that require a button press get disabled, like Mercy's Angelic Descent and Pharahs jetpack.  Others still work, like Bastion's Ironclad in tank form and Brigitte's Inspire.
                That's a fair point, but worth noting it's still consistent. Passives that provide additional actions don't do so if you're hacked.
        The only inconsistent one is Lucio since other passives don't get hacked. S76 and Bastion are transformation ult while Hog is a channeled ult. All channeled ults get hacked such as McCree, Pharah, and Hog. Transformations like Bastion, Genji, S76 and Winston do not get hacked. Mercy and Moira left and right click don't get hacked because they are not abilities while Lucio boop is an ability with a cool down etc.
Damage boost does work on pulse bomb and blizzard
Don’t forget about torb and symm 

Edit: oh yeah, rip shield gen
Or just put an arrow through mcree's face.
Riptire can still wait out your shield to decay.
    the point remains.  also, more time spent fucking around with riptire is more time we can shoot at it
    This was my thought. Lucio ult doesnt do much for one shots because 99% of the time you're gonna get caught in the animation anyway and lose your ult and still die 
It's the slowest charging is the game isnt it? I mean fuck I could get a 4k+ with a boop and only get like 30% 
    I think Zarya's requires the most ult charge but Lucio might be slower because Zarya can get fully charged and dish out the DPS
        Zarya's Ult charge just got buffed too with the slower energy decay.
    Larger aura should mean faster ult technically. I hope so anyways.
This is true. I've been playing PTR since it was live and I do gain ult faster. Not a huge amount but its definitely noticeable 
1. I don't think that's a good idea. Although as a Lucio player it doesn't feel good to get stunned/killed while casting and lose ultimate, it also doesn't feel fun for the enemy, who used their cooldown ability reflexively to counter the Lucio ult. Skill imo, should be rewarded.

2. Almost all ults used to work on this drain system, but they changed the game for consistency (and the reason I mentioned) to have all ults go 100-0 the instant you press Q/whatever your ult key is.
It’s how it used to be and I was fine with it... it might feel better to play against now but it feels like absolute shit to play. They need to either have some sort of refund system where it slowly depletes throughout the animation or speed up the animation. Something should change.
That’s actually not true. I’ll have to dig for it but there is an interview with an OWL support player who says that Mercy is one of the most rewarding heroes to play well. 

Edit: I found it

https://overwatchwire.usatoday.com/2018/05/23/neptuno-mercy-is-one-of-the-most-complex-heroes-to-play-at-the-maximum-level/
    I get off on mercy jukes. That’s right boys, follow this tail. You know you want it. Oops I flew 60 meters behind you, don’t turn around I’m damage boosting someone.
        I dunno why people say this is boring to be fairly honest. The biggest fun part of playing Mercy is playing the game of cat and mouse, baiting people and generally being a nuisance. 

It's fun. It's not what most people come on OW for which is fine but when someone asks 'Why is Mercy boring?'' She isn't. You're just playing a different type of game. Part of the fun as to why I play both her and Symmetra is being a crafty little bitch.

            Too many folks have a way too DPS-centric approach to OW.

OW is NOT a classic shooter game. Play/watch something else if you want that or deal with the fact that OW is about a lot more than crispy flicks. I know it's hard to tell with how Blizzard is (re)designing heroes these days, but that has been the original promise at least.
            Playing mercy is a great break from playing dps. It really is an entirely different play style requiring an entirely different skill set 
            God this so much. The idea that playing them "Is just a different type of game" is exactly what I say to friends, it's just *so* accurate
😭 Thanks everybody.
Yes, but your ultimate gets nullified by an ability that's on a 10 second cooldown 
Because he had access to a broken amount of healing charge back with his massive heal-aura that covered the entire battlefield.

They ought to adjust it to his new range's output probably, but I think their thought-process is that they buffed the healing amount when they made it smaller, and his potential for overall healing charge is still the highest in a best case scenario. Zenyatta requires more enemy interaction to get his charge therefore it's seen as less of an issue.
But now if a target is at like 40 health before Mercy comes to heal them Winston can actually still get the kill.
But he'll at least be able to do something. Before, it was fruitless. He'd have to attack Mercy and risk being killed by her pocket. Now he can at least provide pressure
    Winston shouldn't dive someone getting pocketed by himself anyway. Nerfing her so he negates her healing and gets a tickle in is pretty significant.
    But why should Winston be able to kill someone being healed by Mercy (or any healer for that matter) then be able to move on and kill the Mercy or just leave? It's a bad move to dive someone getting healed, and it shouldn't be made easier for that bad choice.
        the problem was when you were fighting someone and mercy would start healing them when they were at like 30/40 hp and well gg you can't kill him anymore.
Punch in between to get pretty much the same dps, but you don’t have to reload as quickly
Jesus christ...glad i dont play much anymore. All they do is fuck over the champs i like to play lol

Though most of the time its for a good reason admittantly lol


She'll have more reason to play ground level and use the air as an "I'm in the clear to attack" instead of being her default. I hope it means people will stop getting angry when I'm not in the air constantly as Pharah. People know she's gonna be in the air, they aren't looking for her to boop herself out of a building to flank
    I think ground-pharah (aka TF2 soldier) will be actually a pretty good idea, with the rise of hitscans (ana counts and will be more prevalent) and the fall of mercy healing.
Yeah.  I suppose he was just too frustrating though.    or they wanted to move him in a slightly different direction.  New hog is a lot of fun to me though.  Well, "new".  The one after the breather buffs.
I stopped playing Overwatch because of the lag and the bullying on Mercy... never played a game with so much anger towards supports.
    Yeah, I agree with you there. I never thought someone who is suppose to keep you alive could get so much hate. Oh well, I still play occasionally, but I don't play support like I use to.
        I've moved towards Paladins, actually. It's got a lot of love for its supports and theres no lag. I'm enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would... still going to play OW though... just no Mercy, despite being a Mercy Main.
That’s the only good things about her changes to me. I used to basically one trick her. Now I main support but play Moira, Mercy, brigette, hog, mccree mostly so it’s made me branch out. I’ve gotten better at least (made diamond for first time ever). But I still hate to see my favorite character nerfed yet again.
    Same here. I truly enjoyed playing with her old rez, before being able to move, before the invincibility, before all that. I just can't wnjoy the game playing as her now, but I still try to get all her items.
It's better than heavily nerfing Mercy to bring her down to the same level as the other supports, like they have been doing. Instead they are bringing them all up. Plus, Brigitte is getting a nerf as well, though it's not as big I think.
    if they keep this up that shield bash CD is going to be as long as rein's charge C
        Nah, this is probably the last time they'll change it. 5 was overpowered, 6 was overtuned, 7 will be in line with how strong she's designed to be in close range. At worst it'll go to 8, which is the same CD as flashbang.
            5 sec cooldown on shield bash was so annoying and really overpowered but it felt so nice to murder all the genjis, tracers and winstons, especially after months of dive comps. Never as a support main I had a job that required dealing with flankers and dive, it felt so good.

But 7sec is a fair cooldown for such a powerful ability which is also fairly easy to pull off consistently. 
Mercy 2.0 was the most broken thing this game has seen.
    Holy god yes, back when her rez was on a 5 second CD or w/e it was in her ult. Could easily get 15+ rezzes in a game.
        It was always on 30 second cooldown, BUT:

* instant 

* recharges immediately when activating Valcyrie

* During Valcyrie the cooldown of rezz is only 10 seconds

* Valcyrie lasted for 20 seconds. 

You could rezz, Valk, rezz, rezz 10 seconds later, rezz 10 seconds later, 4 instant rezzes in ~21 seconds.
Really? r/overwatch gets extremely defensive whenever we suggest a Mercy nerf.
    r/Overwatch isn't really the premiere place for balance ideals in the community

I didn't just mean people on this subreddit when I said "everyone"


        r/overwatch is very casual-oriented, so I'd say they're sadly representative of the majority of the community.
            This subreddit is home to some of the biggest babies I've ever met on Reddit. Definitely not representative of the community! 
And Zen

That's a terrible team comp
    i'm more concerned as to how there's 7 players on a team than the team composition
        This must be the work of an enemy 「M E R C Y」!
[deleted]
Yep.  We are in a one-shot sniper meta so healing in general is worthless compared to rez.  
This
If they made Rez an ult, they should give it line of sight and a cast time. I think that would make it balanced
The game where people were punished for burning all their ults on the final push.

Hide 'n rez Mercy wasn't even that common. Tempo rezzing was the norm.
Probably “well DVA can wipe a whole team with little threat to herself, so why not let a character do the opposite?”
As a tank main, sometimes I don't have a choice. 

Nothing worse than getting nano'd on a long kill zone when the enemy rein has shatter.
aww.. people just don't play a lot with ana anymore these days, i am sure it will change before long.

for example: way back in the day a rein would not swing his hammer when i (zen) was trancing all around him but these days they almost all do that.
So YOU'RE one of those kinds of Reinhardts that enables the Anas to give nano boosts randomly! Please stop, you need to play more cautious.
Is it? I mean, I see no reason not to do this, but Roadhog ults usually go one of two ways: Hog dies. Hog kills his enemy(ies).

Don't usually see a scenario where Hog needs to keep fighting, but doesn't have ammo. 

But I'm sure this will help with that fringe case. :)
    It’s usually against a dva that manages to eat the last bit of your ult. If she’s already in your face when you finish, and you got no ammo, she can do a lotta damage while youre reloading and healing
Neither does/can Hog when he hooks.....

I main Zen... It doesn't bother me that I don't get a free reload on trans.
    20 balls is a lotta balls. I rarely run out before either I or my enemies die
    But hog isn’t meant to protect a team from an ultimate with his trans. Hog SHOULD have a shot ready when hooking, if not it’s not a valuable hook unless your team is with you to follow up 
For a price.  Consult your tailor for details.
At least.

And don't come and tell me I need to "position better" it happens to everyone at every level. Often time your nade blows up on someone clipping through you from behind.
    Im not crazy then! I knew someone one hit my arm from behind and made me drop that nade on my self! 
while it might makes sense, there's still a lot of case where directly hitting your allies is faster/easier/the only solution.

Also, the nade is realllllllllllllllly powerfull and if you could easily toss it in the middle of a front line , hit everyone allies and foes it might be too powerfull for a single ability and will need to be tone down somewhere else.

I'd rather have this ability to be more reliable (not being wasted on a flying mercy or a hugging torbjorn) without making it even more powerfull than it already is.
I think making her reload heal her would be an interesting and unique way to give her a self heal, yet keep it limited.   She is all about being able to do many things, but not simultaneously.   I don't think a life steal or symbiosis self heal fits her design.   She is all about making conscious decisions with deliberate outcomes. 
If they'd made it a smaller heal and also a speed boost they probably wouldn't have felt the need to nerf Brigitte's shield. 
and take less damage too
    ** effectively double health.  My mistake in my post.
Doesn't sound easier or more effective than grav dragon combo already is
    It's not meant to. Ults have more usage than just pure damage.
It's not live IIRC, but it is on PTR.
I think he quoted it on a Zen when the zen is allready low iirc. So basically a classic dive comp scenario.
    But at 10dp/s it'll take 20 seconds to kill a zen. Altho counteracting mercy healing is a big deal
Those scenarios make no sense though. Dive means a winston, a d.va, a genji and potentially a tracer all jump the same target at the same time. Healing does not matter in that instance because the burst is too much. This is why brigitte is so strong against dive, she doesn't just heal, she increases the health threshold above a point where the target just gets instagibbed. And her stun also helps because a stunned target does 0 dps.
bruh if winston is shooting you for 6 seconds without dying or having to run you've lost the group fight

    And occasionally, they'll eat them.
If we'll coordinated dva boost melee + pile-driver +jump punch does 215 burst damage.
Goats comp is not really dive just hold “w” type of thing. 
Probably? Dva can eat the halt though.

However compared to when dive took over against the old triple tank with old soldier, we have a lot more tools to deal with dive now.

New Junkrat, New Hanzo, and Brigitte could pose major problems for triple tank dive and might stop the idea altogether. It definitely sounds insane on paper though.


Holy shit that is incredible!
    Thank you! Also thanks for the edit in your post! I just edited both my links because I made Moira more transparent. Feel free to update yours as well! <3
        Updated!
It's not an inconsistency, the only things you can't damage boost are torb turret and rip tire, separate entities in that they have their own health bars. Hanzo ultimate should be damage boost- able as long as things like D.va's self destruct is.
I think they thought it was too powerful since it could outdamage trans.
Hack Ulting Hog? Ult stops.

Hack Ulting S76? Ult continues.

Hack Turret Mode Bastion? Removed from mode.

Hack Tank Mode Bastion? Nah, still a tank.

Hack Mercy? Damage boost, heal beam and pistol all work.

Hack Moira? Both damage and heal beams work.

Hack Lucio? Primary shot works, but alt fire (boop) and passive heal are stopped.

CONSISTENCY AT ITS FINEST!
    Hack Lucio? Useless.
        I assume you mean lucio becomes useless.
            Yes.
        Apagando las useless.
    It is a bit more consistent than you make it out to be, you just have to know the distinction between channeled ults and transformation ults. The channeled ults like whole hog and coalescence are stopped, but transformation ults like valkeryie, tank mode bastion, and tactical visor are not pretty much ever. They also a few months ago made pretty much all passives disabled by hacks... So a liiiitle bit more consistent than it used to be :)
        Pretty much all passives... except ongoing ones, and mercy's regen.

Meanwhile certain ongoing things can be interrupted (d.va boost) whereas most others can't.

Meanwhile Bastion's turret transformation is removed, but every other transformation ability in the game is unnaffected.

Meanwhile Moira's left click has a resource bar, but remains unaffected, whereas Bastion's heal has a resource bar and is.

Meanwhile Lucio's ongoing song is shut off, but Zen's ongoing orbs aren't.
        Also weapons vs abilities. Mercy and moira's left and right clicks aren't abilities, so they don't get stopped by hack, while Lucio's boop *is* an ability and therefore *does* get stopped by it. The fact that it's on right click doesn't matter.
    It's really just ults that are inconsistent. Weapons never get disabled, abilities and passives always get disabled, and ults either do or don't depending on their type.
        Not all passives though.  Only passives that require a button press get disabled, like Mercy's Angelic Descent and Pharahs jetpack.  Others still work, like Bastion's Ironclad in tank form and Brigitte's Inspire.
            That's a fair point, but worth noting it's still consistent. Passives that provide additional actions don't do so if you're hacked.
    The only inconsistent one is Lucio since other passives don't get hacked. S76 and Bastion are transformation ult while Hog is a channeled ult. All channeled ults get hacked such as McCree, Pharah, and Hog. Transformations like Bastion, Genji, S76 and Winston do not get hacked. Mercy and Moira left and right click don't get hacked because they are not abilities while Lucio boop is an ability with a cool down etc.
the point remains.  also, more time spent fucking around with riptire is more time we can shoot at it
This was my thought. Lucio ult doesnt do much for one shots because 99% of the time you're gonna get caught in the animation anyway and lose your ult and still die 
I think Zarya's requires the most ult charge but Lucio might be slower because Zarya can get fully charged and dish out the DPS
    Zarya's Ult charge just got buffed too with the slower energy decay.
Larger aura should mean faster ult technically. I hope so anyways.
I get off on mercy jukes. That’s right boys, follow this tail. You know you want it. Oops I flew 60 meters behind you, don’t turn around I’m damage boosting someone.
    I dunno why people say this is boring to be fairly honest. The biggest fun part of playing Mercy is playing the game of cat and mouse, baiting people and generally being a nuisance. 

It's fun. It's not what most people come on OW for which is fine but when someone asks 'Why is Mercy boring?'' She isn't. You're just playing a different type of game. Part of the fun as to why I play both her and Symmetra is being a crafty little bitch.

        Too many folks have a way too DPS-centric approach to OW.

OW is NOT a classic shooter game. Play/watch something else if you want that or deal with the fact that OW is about a lot more than crispy flicks. I know it's hard to tell with how Blizzard is (re)designing heroes these days, but that has been the original promise at least.
        Playing mercy is a great break from playing dps. It really is an entirely different play style requiring an entirely different skill set 
        God this so much. The idea that playing them "Is just a different type of game" is exactly what I say to friends, it's just *so* accurate
Winston shouldn't dive someone getting pocketed by himself anyway. Nerfing her so he negates her healing and gets a tickle in is pretty significant.
But why should Winston be able to kill someone being healed by Mercy (or any healer for that matter) then be able to move on and kill the Mercy or just leave? It's a bad move to dive someone getting healed, and it shouldn't be made easier for that bad choice.
    the problem was when you were fighting someone and mercy would start healing them when they were at like 30/40 hp and well gg you can't kill him anymore.
I think ground-pharah (aka TF2 soldier) will be actually a pretty good idea, with the rise of hitscans (ana counts and will be more prevalent) and the fall of mercy healing.
Yeah, I agree with you there. I never thought someone who is suppose to keep you alive could get so much hate. Oh well, I still play occasionally, but I don't play support like I use to.
    I've moved towards Paladins, actually. It's got a lot of love for its supports and theres no lag. I'm enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would... still going to play OW though... just no Mercy, despite being a Mercy Main.
Same here. I truly enjoyed playing with her old rez, before being able to move, before the invincibility, before all that. I just can't wnjoy the game playing as her now, but I still try to get all her items.
if they keep this up that shield bash CD is going to be as long as rein's charge C
    Nah, this is probably the last time they'll change it. 5 was overpowered, 6 was overtuned, 7 will be in line with how strong she's designed to be in close range. At worst it'll go to 8, which is the same CD as flashbang.
        5 sec cooldown on shield bash was so annoying and really overpowered but it felt so nice to murder all the genjis, tracers and winstons, especially after months of dive comps. Never as a support main I had a job that required dealing with flankers and dive, it felt so good.

But 7sec is a fair cooldown for such a powerful ability which is also fairly easy to pull off consistently. 
Holy god yes, back when her rez was on a 5 second CD or w/e it was in her ult. Could easily get 15+ rezzes in a game.
    It was always on 30 second cooldown, BUT:

* instant 

* recharges immediately when activating Valcyrie

* During Valcyrie the cooldown of rezz is only 10 seconds

* Valcyrie lasted for 20 seconds. 

You could rezz, Valk, rezz, rezz 10 seconds later, rezz 10 seconds later, 4 instant rezzes in ~21 seconds.
