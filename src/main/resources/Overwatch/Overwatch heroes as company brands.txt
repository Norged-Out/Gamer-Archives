[[Overwatch heroes as company brands]]





Very creative! And nicely executed 👏
    Graphic design POTG right here. I used to be a graphic designer and I'm picky af about design. OP is killing it with these.
    Exactly this. I was scrolling and scrolling and calling out a new favourite at almost every single one. This is one of the best OW fan content I've ever seen.

The widow splatter design is probably my favourite, so messy yet so tasteful and as a core idea, I just love the nail salon the most. Also I need that Hanzo tea container!

I like how you made a visual for each company and not just leave it at the logo.
This is excellent work.

I'd buy the Wrecking Ball shirt in an instant.
    OP has store where he sells it.

    There's some of them for sale [here](https://www.teepublic.com/user/dcmjs). (Shh, it's a secret. I can't self-promote too much!)
        Why only some? I love Symetra, Zenyatta and Junkrat images. Were you planning on adding more of them to tshirts?
            Welp, to be honest it’s because the stores algorithm took down all the other designs for Activision/Blizzard copyright and infringement, which is there prerogative. Somehow the ones there made it through.
                So can you not sell say a Zenyatta yoga shirt? I do yoga and was super interested in it as he's my main.
                i'd also love to buy the zenyatta yoga shirt and would be willing to pay via other means to do so! please pm if that's something you'd be okay with. ♥

either way, love your designs. thanks for sharing!
                Did the algorithm even recognize the Reinhardt? I hoped it might not but when I checked your redbubble I did not find the shirt I need.

As a German this is a must have for me
                Have you ever looked into threadless?

        These are amazing. Starting petition to rename Doomfist Punch Dude
        Did you also post the ones from Paladins? I didn't know they existed.

These are great, I especially loved Hog, Ashe, Rein and Widow's.
    Me too!
"Flying the friendly skies." would work great as a slogan for the Pharah Airline.

A lot of these would work great for a wallpaper.
    > "Flying the friendly skies." would work great as a slogan for the Pharah Airline.

Unfortunately, it's already United Airlines' slogan. :) That's where Pharah got it.
        "Fly safe, fly Pharah."

&#x200B;

(fine print: all passengers must be strapped in for the duration of the flight, no exceptions as our flightplans require considerable deviations in altitude.  All unattended children will be carefully monitored by our attendants and at the end of their flight be given a rocket launcher and triple shot s'mores espresso.)
            This ones, great.
                "Some flights are near, some flights are Phara"
            I read this in Scott Manley's voice
        Pharah gonna drag passengers off of her plane
        SAVINGS RAIN FROM ABOVE!

        American airlines heading straight into the Middle East with that slogan.

    Alright, Genji.
That is some high quality work here. Really cool! Are you a graphic designer or did you make these for fun?
    I am a designer. I do these types of projects to keep my skills sharp!
        What were you using to do the extrusions and other 3D? The 2D look like Illustrator (?)
            Most of them are Photoshop smart layers with multiple effects applied. Alas, my 3D skills are sub-par compared to me vector skills.
                Ah, gotcha. Pseudo-3D works just as well for logo design. 

Random Q: Do you do a lot of vector work in Ps, then? Sad as it is, I'm such an Ai nerd, I never really learned to work Photoshop's vector set into my workflow, instead doing it Ai and going from there. It's clunky, and old-fashioned by now, so I'm curious how useful it would be to start shifting more of the vector portion of design away from Illustrator and into Ps.
                    I create/edit all my vectors in AI, then import them as smart layers (which is the best thing ever to happen to Adobe). When you apply effects to smart layers you don't have to rasterize them, allowing for full editability back in AI. The smart layers are also instanced, meaning if you copy a smart layer in PS, then edit the first instance, it will commit the edit to all instances automatically!
        No surprise there! I work in communication and PR so I immediately noticed the very *professional* adaptation haha. Anyway, good job!
        One criticism- Ashe and B.O.B would make more sense if it was Kentucky Bourbon/Whisky, not Scotch Whiskey. Absolutely love it though, terrific work.
The morse code (translates to >!HELLO!<) for Bastion logo is a really nice touch!
[deleted]
    That's actually why I liked Genji's logo. He's a ninja, its supposed to blend in.
    Winston University textbook reads "defensive **shileding**". These are amazing, though!
        remember to always deshield the nucleus before causing a reaction!
    I would say that Genji's might be the best one as it's stylized like a Japanese personal signature stamp.
    If I may add a 5:

Reaper shoots shutgun shells, not bullets.
        6:
Would change the torb one to quality tools instead of power tools because the logo is then printed on an adjustable wrench. Or change the wrench to an actual power tool.
        If these were real shells/solid slugs, by the time you finished the bottle you'd be lobotomized by the lead.

&#x200B;

That said, the idea is freaking awesome.
        Reapers looks bad all together IMO. I love sugar skulls but it doesn’t look like his skull at all and the label looks weird on the tequila. Also a bullet inside the tequila? Lol
    I actually didn't pay attention to what kind of whiskey Ashe & BOB was. But yeah, scotch is weird. Ashe seems like a bourbon gal to me.
        Plus scotch isn’t American
            Well yeah, that's sort of what i meant, even though looking back that isn't clear.

I meant "it's weird that an American cowgirl from the south would make a Scottish beverage like scotch." But instead I just said "lel scotch is weird"
            But Ashes’ middle name is Caledonia which is a term for Scotland
            Also scotch is a "whisky," not a "whiskey."
    > Genj's name is too hidden in the logo. Looks great but bad marketing.
> 
> 

Ohhhhhhh it was Genji. I saw that one and had no idea who it was meant to be referring to.
    Really great feedback. I don't disagree with anything you said. With Ashe + Bob rye McCree could be the bourbon.
    five: mccree's logo looks like a dude with a fucked up underbite
    Also Scotch is Whisky not Whiskey! If you ever come across a bottle that's labeled "Scotch Whiskey" you're liable to get vodka with caramel color added lol.
        Fun fact: Lagavulin and Laphroaig use caramel coloring in their scotch. It's actually a very common practice.
            I would believe it. It's so cold in Scotland and the barrels are used so they aren't going to impart a ton of color. It would probably look like new-make otherwise!

I can't think of a spirit further away from vodka than an Islay Scotch though!
                Oh, for real. Still like both those when the wallet can afford it. Just kinda blew my mind when I found out.
    Was going to downvote you for critiquing these awesome designs, but you make really fucking good points. About booze. Always upvote good points about booze, that's my motto.
        Why would you downvote someone for giving constructive criticism? A designer can improve from constructive feedback and make even better designs. 

Obviously if someone only says, "your design sucks ass" then downvote them. But you should downvote because their criticism was not constructive. Not because they criticized the design at all.
            What if it's a design for an anal plunger though?
                I dunno maybe someone with anal plunging experience may have some constructive criticism for that too
            Ehhh, it's kind of rude to give even constructive criticism unless it's *asked* for. Typically, the creator is showing you something they're proud of, not workshopping with you.
                Well, to be fair. You got to expect some comments about it since the creator chose to upload it on reddit.
                    Yeah, it is absolutely expected — especially on Reddit where most people aren't artists and etiquette for interacting with artists isn't common knowledge. (For another example: how reposting uncredited fanart is so rampant here.) That's why I just want to gently inform people.
        Half the reason I post is to get better!
            Are you currently working as a graphic designer?
        You should never downvote people for having opinions that don't align with yours.  Just because you don't agree with them, doesn't mean they deserve to be downvoted.

This is a huge problem with Reddit.  People downvote others because they don't agree with them instead of offering quality counter-arguments.  This is why so many subs have little popups for the downvote button suggesting you to not downvote because of different opinions (or based on fandom like with sports teams), and why others require you to be subbed in order to allow for downvoting.
            Downvoted for making sense. Am I doing it right?
            In this case, it's not so much an issue of "opinions that don't align with yours"; it's that it's bad etiquette to offer unsolicited criticism on someone's art. It's like someone cooking you dinner, for free, and you say "it's good, but here's a list of things wrong with it..."
                If the OP is posting on a public forum then he’d have to expect that not every comment will be pure praise. The criticism wasn’t rude, and even began with a compliment. It’s like cooking and serving food in your restaurant and saying that it’s bad etiquette for anyone to critique your food. Good artists always strive to improve and constructive criticism should be encouraged.
            /r/MurderedByWords/
                That’s... not what just happened
        Downvoting people for giving their opinion lol
            welcome to reddit?
    I didn't really understand the Brigitte racing connection, and nice catch on the Ashe being scotch!
Otherwise they were all great
        Brigitte's ult is called Rally. Her voice line for her ult is "Rally to me!"
    Wow, I'm glad I'm not the only person who noticed that the alcohol varieties were wrong.
    Also Scotch Whisky doesn’t have an “E” in it 🤷‍♂️
These look phenomenal. Only issue I really had was Genji was hard to read and not intuitive. Oh yeah, I also had an issue with Fried Mercy Stew
    Genti
        That's one step away from *henti* bruh
    Yeah i took a while to understand that it meant to be genji brand

Anyway, this is just incredible. Great job
    Really should have just been pulled pork.
        That would be cannibalism!
    IMO, the design is aestheticly pleasing how it is, but for actual branding it would probably need some adjustments. More contrast and/or thicker letters could be all it needs to be more legible, but it's still a very nice design.
I tried using a Genji brand knife and now I need healing.
    Measure twice, cut once.
This is really good! Nice job dude!
These are just amazing.

Nitpick: I feel like Wrecking Ball should be demolition, not construction. Or maybe "Construction & Demolition." Also you misspelled "shielding" in the text in the Winston book, not that anyone but me would ever have noticed. :D

I would totally buy a Genji cooking knife, if it were actually high-quality. Or a Reinhardt Double Stout T-shirt. Or a Bastion Systems sticker for my laptop. Are you listening, Blizzard?

Seriously, a lot of these would make fantastic T-shirts. Anyone know how to get the attention of Blizzard's licensing department?

Edit: Actually one more nitpick. Sombra's logo uses a fixed-width font but not quite fixed-width spacing, and as a coder it makes me ANGRY. That is all. Keep up the great work.
    Aw man, you know I even had that typo called out when I posted some of these over 2 years ago and I STILL didn't fix it.
I like how torbjorn Powertools is displayed on a manual wrench lol

I also love the Lucio UI, looks very futuristic and interesting. I want it
Ana owning a pharmacy is way too perfect
Amazing, some people were saying that the Genji name is too hidden, i think its a perfect for a knife, its more of a mark then a logo, and if people are actually sticklers for seeing the name clearly, you could add in small even text "Genji Knives" under the box.
Sombra Software sounds sick.
    The virus pun is appreciated.
Amazing ideas, never thought of it that way!  


I wonder if Tracer does prior-night delivery 🤔...
    What was she doing at your house last night?
        They don’t recall 

~~sorry~~
Mercy General Hospiral, hmmm?  🤔

So that's where the zomnic apocalypse started!
    Her patients **never** die.
    I hate hospitals
        CHAAAAAARRRRRGEEEEEERRRRRRR!
    Once saw it i got l4d flashbacks
This is incredible. If this isn't your job, it should be.
These are incredible! Anywhere I can follow your art?
    Yeah! I don't post a lot on social but [dcmjs.com](https://dcmjs.com) has most of my updated projects.
Is Ashe a brown liquor type of girl?  For some reason, I see the prep shining through in her spirit selection.  Not that she'd pass on some whiskey, but I wouldn't put it as her signature drink.  


Awesome job throughout!
    Whiskey is the drink of the American west. She is a cowgirl. It checks out.
Zarya energies is sick
    Dude that lightning bolt is amazing.
Genji logo is straight fire
Where can I buy Dva Cola...... 0.0
    Seriously, it would be such a cool limited time partnership with Coca-Cola or Pepsi.
        They had some kind of D.Va cola in her animated short iirc, would be awesome if they made that real lol
wow these are tremendous
Amazing! How many years of photoshop experience have you had?
    For context, I started when it was Photoshop 4.0 :)
I love all these except Moira and Brigette... those two just seem so  off to me, the rest all seem like they carry some of the characters personality with them and are awesome!
    A nail salon seems like the antithesis of who Moria is, but that's what made me laugh.  And she does have long nails after all...  


I could totally see Brig in the pit repairing a rally car.
    Moira and Brigitte were the only strange ones to me, too.  Moira seems like she'd be running a lab, Moira Laboratories or something.  The rest are excellent and very in-character, though, some surprisingly so (Genji Knifeworks! Mei Adventure Gear! Soldier Jeans!)
    Moira's should really be like a big pharma company. Does science; questionable ethics.
        Yes!!
''Justice will be *served*''

I hope that was intentional because that is so damn clever.
Working at the airport and constantly seeing airlines logos everywhere i can see Pharah air as a legitimate Egyptian airline company.
This is amazing!
Hey [Jeff](mailto:jkaplan@overwatch.com), there's still time to partner with Reinhardt's instead of ~~Coor's~~ Budweiser, right?
All of them are excellent but I really liked the Genji one with the star flanking the knife .. great detail.

Great job.
These are incredible!!!  As an aspiring logo designer myself, I recognize how much work must have gone into each one, not to mention getting the branding to look convincing.  I am most impressed by the Moira Nails.  Out of curiosity, did you create these concepts from scratch or were there any templates involved?  Either way, they look very professional.
    Thanks for the compliment! Most of them started as ideas/sketches. If I could find a piece of vector art that matched my idea then I started with it and modified it to make it work. It's a just-for-fun project so I felt okay not making every single mark from scratch :)
        Completely understand on not needing to design every little thing from the ground up!  My wife actually asked me to do the same thing to get practice in, take Overwatch-related themes and try to design logos around them.  I'm still a fledgling designer, but I have a lot of inspiration now!
This is *really* good.

One critique: The whiskey should probably be bourbon, not scotch.
Soldier 76 and genji are so goddamn good
These are so well done, holy shit.

A-Mei-Zing!
This is really fucking good.  Most of these make a lot of sense.  The Ana branding feels off but that's because of the name, and not the service the company offers.  You could probably name it "Ana's Pharmaceuticals" instead of "Ana Family Pharmacy".
We all know what that wine leads to based on the design.
    So... Teri Hatcher as the actress for the ad?

\*Actress comes in through the front door of the house, camera has her going from right to left.\*

(voiceover) "Ugh, Kids would ***not stop*** screaming after the school called me in early..."

\*She gets to the island in the well-equipped kitchen\*

"We're going to have to host my sister and that handsy, shiftless boyfriend of hers for a weekend so I could get a night off from watching them...  And they'll just be hopped up on sugar come tomorrow afternoon.  And of course that boyfriend of hers will 'request' porterhouses on the grill.  Bastard."

\*Pulls fresh bottle of Widowmaker from the kitchen rack.  Notices a bottle missing in the rack that shouldn't be.  Woman has a long peer at the missing bottle, camera gets a shot from inside the bare spot on the rack, catching her expression both darken and the sparks of anger in her eyes as a study in contrast.\*

\*Quick, brief action shots timed to syllables in the voiceover\*

"Mo" (bottle placed on island counter)

"ther" (corkscrew bites deep and fast into the cork with an almost mechanical precision)

"***Fuck***" (Cork pops out)

"er..." (vocal fry as the wine fills the glass)

\*Woman takes a long pull as a rythmic thumping begins to grow into the audio of the scene.  With a glass half full of that rich, red wine in her off hand she goes to the closet and pulls out a pistol.  Her footfalls are in time with the thumping.\*

\*Bedroom door opens.  Husband's in bed with someone else, missing bottle of wine and two half-full glasses on the door-side nightstand.  While she drains her glass, she empties the clip into the bed.  A brief scream is cut off and the death spasms of the two in the bed knock over the bottle and glasses to the floor below.\*

\*Woman blinks slowly, looks at the empty glass, and the carnage in front of her and begins to smile.\*

\*Camera shot of winestains and the bottle on the floor as it stops rocking back and forth from the remaining fluid lingers on the screen.  Voiceover gives way to actual voice.\*

"Hey, sis?  Can you and your boy come over.  We've got some cleaning up to do."

"Widowmaker.  Because."
        I love this.
These are incredible! I would totally buy merch
I love how the American brands are jeans, whiskey and leather. Perfect
Imo Moira has the best one, love the logo
IMMERSION BROKEN.  ASHE AND BOB WOULDN'T BE MAKING SCOTCH, MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE KENTUCKY BOURBON OR TENNEESSEE MASH.
Moira's and Genji's are incredibly well done
Holy shit. This was amazing. I’m so impressed. I know my opinion doesn’t matter but I think this is amazing. I hope you find a job making dope logos
Absolutely Incredible. Why doesn't this have more upvotes???
Tequila Reaposado
I can't upvote this hard enough. I know the time it takes to make this stuff. Well done.
Reinhard would Never drink that british piss
Cool
This is glorious.
this is really cool!

This is so cool I think you got all them  spot on
Extremely well thought out and put together!
Incredible job
These are amazing. Also I want a Wrecking Ball shirt. So cute!
"Moira's hair salon"

That's where polnareff got his hair to stand up on its own right?
    Prolly just aqua-net purple can.
Can this be real? Also, you should make more for munz if this is yours.
This is impressive
These are super awesome! I hope the maker has a job in advertising.
This is great, hahah!
i want a mei backpack, looks so legit
This is great! Reminds me of the lukewarm bowls of water...
These are really great, nice job!
Holy shit these are amazing
Phenomenal!
These are amazing!  As a homebrewer myself, I would love to use your label on a batch of Reinhardt Double Stouts!
these are great!
Yeah its actually insane how good these are lol
Wow, I'm a graphic designer and I'm thoroughly impressed. Amazing job! Where did you happen to find all of the mockup applications you used, if you don't mind sharing?
    Thanks! I've been collecting them from around the internet for a while. You can find a lot at sites like [Graphic Burger](https://graphicburger.com/).
Holy shit the quality, well done.
Pharah Air and Ashe Whiskey I'd definitely trust. All these look too fucking real holy shit
These are incredible
i didnt know i needed these thing untill now.
Wow. Just wow that is fucking quality right there. But what's the knifeworks symbol?
    Genji
This is SO cool. I love it
These are all fantastic, but that D.Va Cola is slick. I want some now.
This is actually fucking amazing. More people need to see this.
Dude. These are awesome. You are a talented one, congratulations!
Holy Mother of God these are amazing. Great work.
Wow. To think the Overwatch cast could have been successful business owners instead of locked in a perpetual war against robo beep boops and villain caricatures. They definitely got into the wrong line of work
This is some professional shit
I love how Zenyatta is a yoga teacher
I enjoyed these but Brigitte should have owned a cat cafe. If anyone's personality goes with rally racing, it's probably Junkrat.
    Brigitte's Rocket Cats.  Because when you have a stone-cold killing machine as a companion, you should make them MOAR LETHAL!

I’m a designer and WOW OP, these are phenomenal. Great job! Only thing at first glance for constructive criticism was Genji logo and readability, but still really good application.
This is so perfect, you're such a talented human being!!!!
Damn, you put a lot of effort to these! Very clean work.
Hmm the graphic design is on point! Beautifully done 😍
holy shit, these are incredibly well thought-out and wonderfully composed. I love the in situ examples of each logo, and the Moira's Nail salon logo cracks me up every time.
    And I love that you used the term in situ, which is my favorite term ever. Go Latin!
Wrecking Ball could have been a Bowling Alley Franchise too. Loved all of these
These are absolutely stunning.
These are insane! Thank you for sharing these, you can really see the effort you put into the designs.
These are unreal cool. Absolutely incredible work. The concepts and execution are mind-blowing. I wish I could do graphic design 1/3 as well as this.
The D.va Cola one is pretty slick.
.
Eyy we've got a bunch of Mercy Health's in Michigan
I lost it on moira's nail salon - these are absolutely fantastic!
The Genji and Wrecking Ball logos are amazing. Well done. I'm sure someone is gonna downvote you for self promotion but that's what this platform is good for. Keep it up!
I like Reaper's, but I somehow feel like the candy skull design is more suited for Sombra. Great work though :)
This was amazing. Great job.
Yess! These were posted a couple years ago, but all heroes after Ana didn’t exist. Time to add some to my desktop collection!
Oh my these are fantastic!
These are awesome! I love the Tracer slogan.
Tor - Björn Power Tools

> Shows a hand tool 

Otherwise I love all of them, do you mind if I use any as my desktop background? :D
Awesome
There’s actually a company called Symetra, it’s a financial company though: https://www.symetra.com/about-us/about-symetra/

Your choices were a bit more fitting of the character.
These are amazing, well done!
That’s really well done man.
That Dva cola though.
Some of the best OW art I’ve seen. Being a minimalist I would love to have Zenyata logo (without the Yoga Studio) as my iPhone wallpaper.
This is really cool
The Moira and widowmaker logos are solid AF
Bravo, the ad placement photos are fantastic and so are all the brands.
What did you use to make those logos?
I would drink most of these
Pedantic criticism:  Bordeaux is a wine-gowing region, not a specific varietal.  As the region supports multiple varieties of red wine, one would expect more detail to appear on the bottle, unless the intention it to be obtuse.
These are fucking amazing, OP.
Not gonna lie these were all great choices for matching products with the character.
These are so wonderful! Love that you have the product mock-ups too.
These are fantastic I am in love!!!
Reinhardt double stout, I'd buy the hell out of it!
These are amazing.
I would so buy D.Va Cola if it was real
    Murloco's cream soda, nano cola, Dragonblade Kabosu/Yuzu/Sudachi seltzer water, Mei's Dragonfruit red cream soda, Deadeye Sasparilla & Apple Cinnamon Sasparilla (mixed drink instructions on the back mixing bourbon), 76 Cran-Cherry energy drink, Winston PB&Grape Jelly soda, Light's Out soda (Tamarind, Agave, Lime, Apple), etc.
Could have called it Phairah
These are fantastic. I would pay to dollar for a Doomfist Boxing Gym hoodie.
Fucking amazing. I would die for Reaper tequila.
Roadhog bar and grill sounds amazing
Holy shit that Baptiste one, thanks!!
I'd listen to some sweet Lucio Music Streaming.
So much time and detail put into these. I like the products you included with text, very witty commentary you added there.
Winston reminds me of [redacted] in [redacted].
My favorite one is Widowmaker by far
Awesome! Very well done, I love the execution of most of the logos.
Have you thought about posting this to r/logodesign ?
OHMYGOD this is so awesome!! Well done! :)
Fantastic!
Fucking incredible!
WAY too cool!!
THATS AMAZING!
tfw brig doesn't run a jail
This is the one of the very best OC i have ever seen. Absolutely gorgeous!
I want some of this stuff lol
I want that DF boxing gym sweater. Dope af
I remember these from a while ago, the Reinhardt Double Stout actually looks the part now. My only issue is that Zenyatta has 9 orbs, not 8.
Ah, I saw the original post when you had everyone up to Ana, I believe. I like the new additions!
Genji one is fucking amazing
I don't even want to make suggestions-these ate so good and creative :)
Holy shit, that DVa Cola design is amazing.  I mean, I'd buy almost all of these designs on a tshirt but that cola looks more appealing as a beverage than some of the real soda cans out there.
Woah. These are so perfect. * _ *
Excellent graphic design skills
That genji one is REALLY good. I sat there like "did I miss a hero called Knife or something?" And then realized the maze spelled a name.
A-mei-zing!!!!
This is amazing lol
Every single one is on point.
These are sooo cool. We should get skins themed around sponsoring these like with D.va’s nano cola challenge.
This is some premium gourmet shit
This is SO GOOD WTF
This is really outstanding work. Good job man.
They are all fantastic. Widowmaker is my favorite, pharah next
I'd buy that zenyatta tank top
Enjoying your incoming job offer from Blizzard. You earned it.
This is the kind of original content I love to see on this sub, thank you for sharing (and working on it) OP!
Those are fantastic logos. I LOVE the genji block logo. Kudos.
The wine blood splatter for Widowmakers is excellent.
doomfist one is cool
Why would cowboys from america have a scotch... from Scotland and not an American whiskey like a bourbon ?
Love them all
I'll take one D.Va Cola shirt.
Amazing
Great design!
The D.Va one left more to be desired but outside of that they were all outstanding
You are so talented
I would buy all of this.
I like it but I’m bothered that it’s torbjorn power tools and then it’s a hand tool.
This just shows how creative and amazing the artist is at design and color. It's so cool.
Terrible, not in order.
IDK reaper seems like an arms dealer with the number of guns he has on em. Great stuff tho, I know I would be buying Bastion SSD's!
i love the bullet in the Reaper Tequila as if it’s a Mezcal worm
Phara: plane.


ROCKET BARRAGE INCOMING
I hope you get an A!
There all great but that Moira one is genius.
All beautiful work! Would have liked to see Bastion Ballistics as a gun company!
Wow dude big props on this. Incredible work!
Where can I get a bastion ssd
Graphic design is your passion!!!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This is some amazing work my dude.
Now I need 76 jeans
These are badass, it makes me wish blizzard would do stuff like this
Just so good. I'd buy the shit out of 
T-shirts and other accessories with these designs.
That soldier 76 looks exactly like a type of brand the rich redneck kids when i was in high school would wear
Awesome!

I feel like Lucio should be a Beats competitor.
Well done!!
Holy crap, I'd love to have some of these be real.
A for effort
That is some amazing artwork! And I never knew I wanted a bottle of Ashe and Bobs Whiskey so badly.
These are absolutely stunning!
Moira’s strikes me as more of a Spa. She fits all of the standard buzz words...
- “Toxin” Removal
- Body Rejuvenation/Healing
- Laser Resurfacing 
Plus free spray-tan!
I'm always stunned by the work of creative people. In this case, it just blows my mind how well it all fits the characters and how good the graphics look.

Very well done
Wow! I'd be really surprised if you don't have a degree in graphic design. These are so cool!!!
I love these so much!  I want this as actual merchandise!
Holy crap, this is amazing.
I swore off of tequila years ago, but I'll be dipped if I didn't try a shot. 

The Ashe whiskey was sweet as well
Reminds me of the companies you'd see in Mario Kart
Wow...just wow! Not only is the graphic design on point but the way all themes/logos fit with the specific heroes is absolutely mind blowing. I´m not easily impressed by stuff in general but this is truly amazing work.
If i was able to, I'd give you platinum
This was amazing! Very well done
Very entertaining to scroll though, thanks for your hard work!
I love how most of them are drinks lol
This is amazing.

 I'd exclusively fly PharahAir.
I'd even study for Winston Uni, and that's saying something
>fried mercy stew

...
So imagine a universe where Mercy Hospital is attacked by a gang of clowns and that whole thing might have something to do with a B-Movie style zombie apocalypse. Hmm.
These look like they're logos for real companies. Good work, OP.

Is Tracer's delivery based on the [Tracer's Express Delivery SFM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7Ca2DcxkiE)?

I couldn't help hearing the [Turbulence theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VfWTIJR60Q) when looking at Pharah's one. Also, how'd you get the decal to look shiny and as though it curved with the plane?
Too damm talented
Omg this is so good. Very well done!
Take my upvote, you talented and creative so and so!
"Torbjorn power tools"

Shows a fucking wrench
I would love some of Mccrees raw hide.
I would love to drink reinheardt stout
Mercy Stew? Jeff would like that very much.
This is amaze-balls. I need that doomfist hoodie.
Damn! Pharah air looks fly af!
As a illustrator and graphic designer, so much Yessss!!!! Great job
Shut up and take my money
These are legit incredible. Wow.
Really great job!  The designs are all great and some of the business ideas are really clever.
Havnt even looked at it yet and i already know roadhog is McDonald’s
Edit: i am impressed
That genji one is absolutely amazing!
Suddenly I have a need for some new jeans and a leather belt to go with them
... it’s labelled as Scotch and you spell it WhiskEy?

That’s the Irish way of spelling it
🔥 🔥 🔥
"Try our new fried mercy stew"
As a Roadhog main I feel happy to see this
Amazing, I'd really like to buy some of this stuff. It just looks so good.
Omfg you are a REALLY good graphic designer like for anyone who doesn't understand how hard this is to do, take it from me....

Oh and btw you left out a few designs on your website where you also show off the hero designs, is there a reason for this?
Reminds me of all those fake sponsors in Mario Kart. Great job!
That's so well done!! Amazing.
These are great, especially like the Moira one.
D,va cola lmao
what is a fried mercy stew lol?
That's really amazing! Even though I wouldn't use Sombra software if it was real cause I would be afraid to get hacked by my own phone ;)
Dude— I hope blizzard has seen this, lot of merch potential. Fantastic designs!
Now we need the newly-introduced Sigma to the mix. :3

Would be great if you are doing it (or if you're in the process of doing it, I can't wait! ^^)
Marketing PORN
Graphic design POTG right here. I used to be a graphic designer and I'm picky af about design. OP is killing it with these.
Exactly this. I was scrolling and scrolling and calling out a new favourite at almost every single one. This is one of the best OW fan content I've ever seen.

The widow splatter design is probably my favourite, so messy yet so tasteful and as a core idea, I just love the nail salon the most. Also I need that Hanzo tea container!

There's some of them for sale [here](https://www.teepublic.com/user/dcmjs). (Shh, it's a secret. I can't self-promote too much!)
    Why only some? I love Symetra, Zenyatta and Junkrat images. Were you planning on adding more of them to tshirts?
        Welp, to be honest it’s because the stores algorithm took down all the other designs for Activision/Blizzard copyright and infringement, which is there prerogative. Somehow the ones there made it through.
            So can you not sell say a Zenyatta yoga shirt? I do yoga and was super interested in it as he's my main.
            i'd also love to buy the zenyatta yoga shirt and would be willing to pay via other means to do so! please pm if that's something you'd be okay with. ♥

either way, love your designs. thanks for sharing!
            Did the algorithm even recognize the Reinhardt? I hoped it might not but when I checked your redbubble I did not find the shirt I need.

> "Flying the friendly skies." would work great as a slogan for the Pharah Airline.

Unfortunately, it's already United Airlines' slogan. :) That's where Pharah got it.
    "Fly safe, fly Pharah."

(fine print: all passengers must be strapped in for the duration of the flight, no exceptions as our flightplans require considerable deviations in altitude.  All unattended children will be carefully monitored by our attendants and at the end of their flight be given a rocket launcher and triple shot s'mores espresso.)
        This ones, great.

Alright, Genji.
I am a designer. I do these types of projects to keep my skills sharp!
    What were you using to do the extrusions and other 3D? The 2D look like Illustrator (?)
        Most of them are Photoshop smart layers with multiple effects applied. Alas, my 3D skills are sub-par compared to me vector skills.
            Ah, gotcha. Pseudo-3D works just as well for logo design. 

Random Q: Do you do a lot of vector work in Ps, then? Sad as it is, I'm such an Ai nerd, I never really learned to work Photoshop's vector set into my workflow, instead doing it Ai and going from there. It's clunky, and old-fashioned by now, so I'm curious how useful it would be to start shifting more of the vector portion of design away from Illustrator and into Ps.
                I create/edit all my vectors in AI, then import them as smart layers (which is the best thing ever to happen to Adobe). When you apply effects to smart layers you don't have to rasterize them, allowing for full editability back in AI. The smart layers are also instanced, meaning if you copy a smart layer in PS, then edit the first instance, it will commit the edit to all instances automatically!
    No surprise there! I work in communication and PR so I immediately noticed the very *professional* adaptation haha. Anyway, good job!
    One criticism- Ashe and B.O.B would make more sense if it was Kentucky Bourbon/Whisky, not Scotch Whiskey. Absolutely love it though, terrific work.
That's actually why I liked Genji's logo. He's a ninja, its supposed to blend in.
Winston University textbook reads "defensive **shileding**". These are amazing, though!
    remember to always deshield the nucleus before causing a reaction!
I would say that Genji's might be the best one as it's stylized like a Japanese personal signature stamp.
If I may add a 5:

Reaper shoots shutgun shells, not bullets.
    6:
Would change the torb one to quality tools instead of power tools because the logo is then printed on an adjustable wrench. Or change the wrench to an actual power tool.
    If these were real shells/solid slugs, by the time you finished the bottle you'd be lobotomized by the lead.

&#x200B;

That said, the idea is freaking awesome.
    Reapers looks bad all together IMO. I love sugar skulls but it doesn’t look like his skull at all and the label looks weird on the tequila. Also a bullet inside the tequila? Lol
I actually didn't pay attention to what kind of whiskey Ashe & BOB was. But yeah, scotch is weird. Ashe seems like a bourbon gal to me.
    Plus scotch isn’t American
        Well yeah, that's sort of what i meant, even though looking back that isn't clear.

I meant "it's weird that an American cowgirl from the south would make a Scottish beverage like scotch." But instead I just said "lel scotch is weird"
        But Ashes’ middle name is Caledonia which is a term for Scotland
        Also scotch is a "whisky," not a "whiskey."
> Genj's name is too hidden in the logo. Looks great but bad marketing.
> 
> 

Ohhhhhhh it was Genji. I saw that one and had no idea who it was meant to be referring to.
Really great feedback. I don't disagree with anything you said. With Ashe + Bob rye McCree could be the bourbon.
five: mccree's logo looks like a dude with a fucked up underbite
Also Scotch is Whisky not Whiskey! If you ever come across a bottle that's labeled "Scotch Whiskey" you're liable to get vodka with caramel color added lol.
    Fun fact: Lagavulin and Laphroaig use caramel coloring in their scotch. It's actually a very common practice.
        I would believe it. It's so cold in Scotland and the barrels are used so they aren't going to impart a ton of color. It would probably look like new-make otherwise!

I can't think of a spirit further away from vodka than an Islay Scotch though!
            Oh, for real. Still like both those when the wallet can afford it. Just kinda blew my mind when I found out.
Was going to downvote you for critiquing these awesome designs, but you make really fucking good points. About booze. Always upvote good points about booze, that's my motto.
    Why would you downvote someone for giving constructive criticism? A designer can improve from constructive feedback and make even better designs. 

Obviously if someone only says, "your design sucks ass" then downvote them. But you should downvote because their criticism was not constructive. Not because they criticized the design at all.
        What if it's a design for an anal plunger though?
            I dunno maybe someone with anal plunging experience may have some constructive criticism for that too
        Ehhh, it's kind of rude to give even constructive criticism unless it's *asked* for. Typically, the creator is showing you something they're proud of, not workshopping with you.
            Well, to be fair. You got to expect some comments about it since the creator chose to upload it on reddit.
                Yeah, it is absolutely expected — especially on Reddit where most people aren't artists and etiquette for interacting with artists isn't common knowledge. (For another example: how reposting uncredited fanart is so rampant here.) That's why I just want to gently inform people.
    Half the reason I post is to get better!
        Are you currently working as a graphic designer?
    You should never downvote people for having opinions that don't align with yours.  Just because you don't agree with them, doesn't mean they deserve to be downvoted.

This is a huge problem with Reddit.  People downvote others because they don't agree with them instead of offering quality counter-arguments.  This is why so many subs have little popups for the downvote button suggesting you to not downvote because of different opinions (or based on fandom like with sports teams), and why others require you to be subbed in order to allow for downvoting.
        Downvoted for making sense. Am I doing it right?
        In this case, it's not so much an issue of "opinions that don't align with yours"; it's that it's bad etiquette to offer unsolicited criticism on someone's art. It's like someone cooking you dinner, for free, and you say "it's good, but here's a list of things wrong with it..."
            If the OP is posting on a public forum then he’d have to expect that not every comment will be pure praise. The criticism wasn’t rude, and even began with a compliment. It’s like cooking and serving food in your restaurant and saying that it’s bad etiquette for anyone to critique your food. Good artists always strive to improve and constructive criticism should be encouraged.
        /r/MurderedByWords/
            That’s... not what just happened
    Downvoting people for giving their opinion lol
        welcome to reddit?
I didn't really understand the Brigitte racing connection, and nice catch on the Ashe being scotch!
Otherwise they were all great
    Brigitte's ult is called Rally. Her voice line for her ult is "Rally to me!"
Wow, I'm glad I'm not the only person who noticed that the alcohol varieties were wrong.
Also Scotch Whisky doesn’t have an “E” in it 🤷‍♂️
Genti
    That's one step away from *henti* bruh
Yeah i took a while to understand that it meant to be genji brand

Anyway, this is just incredible. Great job
Really should have just been pulled pork.
    That would be cannibalism!
IMO, the design is aestheticly pleasing how it is, but for actual branding it would probably need some adjustments. More contrast and/or thicker letters could be all it needs to be more legible, but it's still a very nice design.
Measure twice, cut once.
Aw man, you know I even had that typo called out when I posted some of these over 2 years ago and I STILL didn't fix it.
The virus pun is appreciated.
What was she doing at your house last night?

For context, I started when it was Photoshop 4.0 :)
A nail salon seems like the antithesis of who Moria is, but that's what made me laugh.  And she does have long nails after all...  


I could totally see Brig in the pit repairing a rally car.
Moira and Brigitte were the only strange ones to me, too.  Moira seems like she'd be running a lab, Moira Laboratories or something.  The rest are excellent and very in-character, though, some surprisingly so (Genji Knifeworks! Mei Adventure Gear! Soldier Jeans!)
Moira's should really be like a big pharma company. Does science; questionable ethics.
    Yes!!
Thanks for the compliment! Most of them started as ideas/sketches. If I could find a piece of vector art that matched my idea then I started with it and modified it to make it work. It's a just-for-fun project so I felt okay not making every single mark from scratch :)
    Completely understand on not needing to design every little thing from the ground up!  My wife actually asked me to do the same thing to get practice in, take Overwatch-related themes and try to design logos around them.  I'm still a fledgling designer, but I have a lot of inspiration now!
So... Teri Hatcher as the actress for the ad?

\*Actress comes in through the front door of the house, camera has her going from right to left.\*

(voiceover) "Ugh, Kids would ***not stop*** screaming after the school called me in early..."

\*She gets to the island in the well-equipped kitchen\*

"We're going to have to host my sister and that handsy, shiftless boyfriend of hers for a weekend so I could get a night off from watching them...  And they'll just be hopped up on sugar come tomorrow afternoon.  And of course that boyfriend of hers will 'request' porterhouses on the grill.  Bastard."

\*Pulls fresh bottle of Widowmaker from the kitchen rack.  Notices a bottle missing in the rack that shouldn't be.  Woman has a long peer at the missing bottle, camera gets a shot from inside the bare spot on the rack, catching her expression both darken and the sparks of anger in her eyes as a study in contrast.\*

\*Quick, brief action shots timed to syllables in the voiceover\*

"Mo" (bottle placed on island counter)

"ther" (corkscrew bites deep and fast into the cork with an almost mechanical precision)

"***Fuck***" (Cork pops out)

"er..." (vocal fry as the wine fills the glass)

\*Woman takes a long pull as a rythmic thumping begins to grow into the audio of the scene.  With a glass half full of that rich, red wine in her off hand she goes to the closet and pulls out a pistol.  Her footfalls are in time with the thumping.\*

\*Bedroom door opens.  Husband's in bed with someone else, missing bottle of wine and two half-full glasses on the door-side nightstand.  While she drains her glass, she empties the clip into the bed.  A brief scream is cut off and the death spasms of the two in the bed knock over the bottle and glasses to the floor below.\*

\*Woman blinks slowly, looks at the empty glass, and the carnage in front of her and begins to smile.\*

\*Camera shot of winestains and the bottle on the floor as it stops rocking back and forth from the remaining fluid lingers on the screen.  Voiceover gives way to actual voice.\*

"Hey, sis?  Can you and your boy come over.  We've got some cleaning up to do."

"Widowmaker.  Because."
    I love this.
Prolly just aqua-net purple can.

What were you using to do the extrusions and other 3D? The 2D look like Illustrator (?)
    Most of them are Photoshop smart layers with multiple effects applied. Alas, my 3D skills are sub-par compared to me vector skills.
        Ah, gotcha. Pseudo-3D works just as well for logo design. 

Random Q: Do you do a lot of vector work in Ps, then? Sad as it is, I'm such an Ai nerd, I never really learned to work Photoshop's vector set into my workflow, instead doing it Ai and going from there. It's clunky, and old-fashioned by now, so I'm curious how useful it would be to start shifting more of the vector portion of design away from Illustrator and into Ps.
            I create/edit all my vectors in AI, then import them as smart layers (which is the best thing ever to happen to Adobe). When you apply effects to smart layers you don't have to rasterize them, allowing for full editability back in AI. The smart layers are also instanced, meaning if you copy a smart layer in PS, then edit the first instance, it will commit the edit to all instances automatically!
No surprise there! I work in communication and PR so I immediately noticed the very *professional* adaptation haha. Anyway, good job!
One criticism- Ashe and B.O.B would make more sense if it was Kentucky Bourbon/Whisky, not Scotch Whiskey. Absolutely love it though, terrific work.
remember to always deshield the nucleus before causing a reaction!

Would change the torb one to quality tools instead of power tools because the logo is then printed on an adjustable wrench. Or change the wrench to an actual power tool.
If these were real shells/solid slugs, by the time you finished the bottle you'd be lobotomized by the lead.

That said, the idea is freaking awesome.
Reapers looks bad all together IMO. I love sugar skulls but it doesn’t look like his skull at all and the label looks weird on the tequila. Also a bullet inside the tequila? Lol
Plus scotch isn’t American
    Well yeah, that's sort of what i meant, even though looking back that isn't clear.

I meant "it's weird that an American cowgirl from the south would make a Scottish beverage like scotch." But instead I just said "lel scotch is weird"
    But Ashes’ middle name is Caledonia which is a term for Scotland
    Also scotch is a "whisky," not a "whiskey."
Fun fact: Lagavulin and Laphroaig use caramel coloring in their scotch. It's actually a very common practice.
    I would believe it. It's so cold in Scotland and the barrels are used so they aren't going to impart a ton of color. It would probably look like new-make otherwise!

I can't think of a spirit further away from vodka than an Islay Scotch though!
        Oh, for real. Still like both those when the wallet can afford it. Just kinda blew my mind when I found out.
Why would you downvote someone for giving constructive criticism? A designer can improve from constructive feedback and make even better designs. 

Obviously if someone only says, "your design sucks ass" then downvote them. But you should downvote because their criticism was not constructive. Not because they criticized the design at all.
    What if it's a design for an anal plunger though?
        I dunno maybe someone with anal plunging experience may have some constructive criticism for that too
    Ehhh, it's kind of rude to give even constructive criticism unless it's *asked* for. Typically, the creator is showing you something they're proud of, not workshopping with you.
        Well, to be fair. You got to expect some comments about it since the creator chose to upload it on reddit.
            Yeah, it is absolutely expected — especially on Reddit where most people aren't artists and etiquette for interacting with artists isn't common knowledge. (For another example: how reposting uncredited fanart is so rampant here.) That's why I just want to gently inform people.
Half the reason I post is to get better!
    Are you currently working as a graphic designer?
You should never downvote people for having opinions that don't align with yours.  Just because you don't agree with them, doesn't mean they deserve to be downvoted.

This is a huge problem with Reddit.  People downvote others because they don't agree with them instead of offering quality counter-arguments.  This is why so many subs have little popups for the downvote button suggesting you to not downvote because of different opinions (or based on fandom like with sports teams), and why others require you to be subbed in order to allow for downvoting.
    Downvoted for making sense. Am I doing it right?
    In this case, it's not so much an issue of "opinions that don't align with yours"; it's that it's bad etiquette to offer unsolicited criticism on someone's art. It's like someone cooking you dinner, for free, and you say "it's good, but here's a list of things wrong with it..."
        If the OP is posting on a public forum then he’d have to expect that not every comment will be pure praise. The criticism wasn’t rude, and even began with a compliment. It’s like cooking and serving food in your restaurant and saying that it’s bad etiquette for anyone to critique your food. Good artists always strive to improve and constructive criticism should be encouraged.

        That’s... not what just happened
Downvoting people for giving their opinion lol
    welcome to reddit?
Brigitte's ult is called Rally. Her voice line for her ult is "Rally to me!"
That's one step away from *henti* bruh
That would be cannibalism!
They don’t recall 

~~sorry~~
CHAAAAAARRRRRGEEEEEERRRRRRR!
They had some kind of D.Va cola in her animated short iirc, would be awesome if they made that real lol
Yes!!
Completely understand on not needing to design every little thing from the ground up!  My wife actually asked me to do the same thing to get practice in, take Overwatch-related themes and try to design logos around them.  I'm still a fledgling designer, but I have a lot of inspiration now!
I love this.
you said in an instant, not 15 days. i hereby summon you to /r/karmacourt for blatant lying
    Daddy's been giving out a lot of paper lately booboo, gotta make some of it back.
        Pls you can also be my daddy and give me some paper
Welp, to be honest it’s because the stores algorithm took down all the other designs for Activision/Blizzard copyright and infringement, which is there prerogative. Somehow the ones there made it through.
    So can you not sell say a Zenyatta yoga shirt? I do yoga and was super interested in it as he's my main.
    i'd also love to buy the zenyatta yoga shirt and would be willing to pay via other means to do so! please pm if that's something you'd be okay with. ♥

either way, love your designs. thanks for sharing!
    Did the algorithm even recognize the Reinhardt? I hoped it might not but when I checked your redbubble I did not find the shirt I need.

As a German this is a must have for me
    Have you ever looked into threadless?
This ones, great.
