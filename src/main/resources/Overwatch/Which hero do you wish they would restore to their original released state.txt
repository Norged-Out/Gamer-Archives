[[Which hero do you wish they would restore to their original released state]]





I wish they made it so you can use old versions of hero’s in custom games
    Yeah, like an “Old Mechanics” mode where you can select whether or not you use the old version or not
        Yeah but per hero 

So you can choose to use old doom or torb if you want but also still using some of the newer designs of other characters
            Exactly
            Mmmm old hog, gonna hook you from from IRL to OW
        That’s all I’d play. I know people will disagree but the first like 6-8 months of overwatch was so much fun but all the adjustments made for competitions made it feel like more of a chore. I’ve been having fun enough coming back for overwatch but damn I miss the original base gameplay
            No dude it was so broken. The thing that made it more fun back then weren’t the changes but the player base. Everyone was new and figuring overwatch out so it wasn’t as competitive or toxic
        They need a classic mode with the original lineup and loadouts from release. 6v6 no role queue obviously as well. I would play the shit out of that.
    That’s not how apostrophes work
Torb.

COME GETCH' ER ARMOR!
    "Setting up shop" with the armor packs was so ridiculous and fun. Really made him feel like a builder going around, collecting scrap, and using it.

                Blizzard doing as much as they possibly can to make the game dissimilar to TF2 nowadays
            It was a lot of fun before they changed everything to make it competitive.
                I even remember when I first started how I thought overwatch was great because it was less about competitive and more about countering your opponents bullshit move with your bullshit move. Needing to pick up scrap kinda made sense because you also had another character, Reaper, need to pick up souls of the defeated to heal. You also had the glorious.

Welcome to the Car Wash.

They scaled down all the bullshit to make it "balanced". I wish they had scaled UP the bullshit to make it balanced instead.
                    Car wash lmao

Symmetra's probably changed more than anyone, no?
                        [deleted]
                        Sym 1.0 was support, giving shields.

Sym 2.0 was... that was the one that still had the teleporter ult and the latch beam, right?

Then Sym 3.0 had the floating forward shield and her beam no longer latched on and she had the shield generator? Or was that 2.0?

And now 4.0 has the barrier for her ult instead.
                    Yeah I remember as it was happening people complained that fights started feeling more like pillow fights than anything else.

Then double shield happened, GOATS happened, turned out when you took away all these fun things, gameplay becomes slow and boring.

When I first started playing, the way I would sell my friends on the game is "It feels like nearly every character is OP" the gameplay was fun because there was so much bullshit you could do. It was fast-paced and each character felt unique.

They've really scaled back on uniqueness and a lot of characters feel identical to each other now.
                        > Then double shield happened, GOATS happened, turned out when you took away all these fun things, gameplay becomes slow and boring.

That's the part I don't get in their balancing: Yeah sure, 3 tanks + 3 support was problematic. Sure.

But did they never consider that they only created this situation by **specifically** nerfing and/or reworking the heroes that could counteract this? And in turn, when they did forced 2/2/2, their premise for changing things in the first place evaporated, and they **should have** reset everyone to launch-balance **and start over**?

I hate how Blizzard has this morbid corporate mandate to never ever go backtrack something no matter how sensible it'd be.
                            You're completely right, it makes no sense.

At the same time, Blizzard has been pretty obviously catering hard to two groups. OWL viewers, and streamers.

Obviously getting more eyes on their product is a good thing for them, so I can see why they do it, but it means that all their balancing started getting around what looks impressive. When they realised the GOATS issue, they decided to force dive instead of just re-balancing everything. Every balancing decision they've made since GOATs makes sense when you consider the *forced dive* aspect, down to little things like DPS speed boost passive after kills.

And there's also that aspect of people screaming that any character that isn't pure DPS is "no skill" and should be nerfed into the ground. Mei, Junkrat, Sym, they've never been strong, they've never been part of an oppressive meta, but they're constantly seeing nerfs because of some idea of "skill" that people have in their heads. It makes games become really one-note and boring because then nobody picks the nerfed-to-hell interesting characters.

Edit: AH SEE? Completely unnecessary Junkrat nerf in this patch. They didn't even explain why they thought it was needed.
                    Exactly. Overwatch wasn't fun to play *in spite* of the absurd abilities and ults and crazy team-wipe combos. It was fun **because** of them.

Competitive Overwatch is... just another team shooter, tbh. There have been lots of them. And with OW2 it even lost the bonus of being the arguably most-polished one, it's quite beta-y in nature now with lots of quirks and bugs.

But ah well, it's where the money is I suppose, and it's not like there ain't tons of games to play. Don't really need a team FPS right now anyways, plus me and my friends just play some DRG if we feel like shooting at things.

ROCK AND STONE!
                    Fan the hammer was so comically broken it was wonderful. Everyone melted the minute you got close to him.

                    It's adorable that people who say this seem to think the developers are the ones making the money and not their employers.
            Original Doomfist as well. He played like a fighting game character, his moves were very timing based, and combos into each other. Too bad they have such trouble balancing him.
            I had to think about Apex's loba
        Man, the scrap mechanic was oddly entertaining and also the only way you could get Torb's to actually play the game. I used to have armor packs scattered around the point.
            if you played it right he was a pseudo healer
                I loved throwing the armor packs on a large arc to try and protect someone more forward.
                    Not to mention you could just throw it on yourself in a pinch effectively giving torb a lot more hp and dueling power.
                Technically an armor pack would be better than healing the same amount because it provides damage resistance, right?
                    Yup. Symmetra was a support originally for this very reason
            I remember we'd be playing on Hanamura, and they enemy would be at the choke point.

"Hey guys. I'm going on a scrap run!"

Run with my little dwarf legs, run back, armor everyone up then litter the point with armor packs.

Good times.
                I remember he still had the armor packs when Symm got the shield generator. Those were filthy times
                    Whaaat? It was just a Tracer zipping around with ~~275~~ 300hp!
                        And the shield was over the armor too. Some characters became pretty well unstoppable.
                            I actually stayed alive for more than a minute or two as Zenyatta!
                                Especially since the armor also went under his natural shields
                        Actually, 300hp... Lol
                    oh my fucking god i forgot about that absolute nonsense lmao. they were the best of times, they were the worst of times
            I miss torb/sym duos where you'd just have a gazzillion armour. It was stupid and fun.
        He gave armor packs? Which ability did they replace it with? It sounds like he was funner to play back then
            He collected scraps from dead bodies which he could use to upgrade his turret and give armor packs to hit team. His ult was his current E but better because it also made his turret stronger. I don't remember if his gun had an alt-fire at the time though.
                > His ult was his current E but better because it also made his turret stronger

Ahh, the good old days when Torb POTG would be ulting in spawn.
                    Or staring at Widow's ass while his turret did all the work.
                    [Best Torb POTG ever](https://youtu.be/DiMJ-s4T16M)
                        I laughed at the same time as the uploader, in a similar fashion.

Perfect.
                            Lol so did I because it's the funny bit
                    I remember I would Ult, get really close to the Widow on my teams ass and just Hammer away for an easy POTG.
                    Ults insta dies turret kills 5 players easy potg.
                He did have alt fire on his gun!
                wait does his e not buff his turret anymore? oh god ive been using it all wrong
            Torb used to be completely different. You couldn’t throw the turret, instead placing it directly in front of you. It started at level 1 and had to be upgraded using scrap metal he could pick up from dead players, which is also what he used to make armor packs. Overheat didn’t exist because his ultimate was basically a souped up version of the current ability: it gave a ton of health, faster attack and run speed, and temporarily upgraded your turret to level three
                He was a lot more similar to the Engineer from TF2
                    Yes because OW was designed to be like TF2.
                        Just new and exciting and *sexy*
            He really wasn't.

He used to play a lot like TF2 engineer. Build a turret, upgrade it to level 2, collect scraps around the battlefield to give a one-time armor bonus to teammates. Ult would buff you a bit and make your turret stronger.


You relied a lot more on your turret to do the work. It also meant that playing on any mode other than defense was difficult.

Current torb is more fun IMO. His niche isn't as unique but at least he's always playable.
                All they did was change him from a wrench engineer to a gunslinger engineer.
    Also popping his ult, dying immediately and then getting POTG because your 800HP aimbot killed 5 people.

God that was fun.
        Killed 6 ppl!
            11 people. Kills everyone but the mercy. mercy mass rezzes whole team. Whole team dies again.
                The whole ground would be littered with scrap afterwards and you could give your team armor for days
        Literally my first POTG ever from the beta.
        You can still do this if you play Ashe
    Hell yeah.

Level 3 turret = some chill gaming 😎🤘
        They really dismantled him and built a whole new character, didn't they?  They took away his armor packs and gave something similar to Brigitte.  They took away his Level 3 turret and turned it into Bob.
            I was about to say: Bob is just a level 3 Turret with a Rein Charge but no pin.
                Except Bob can be headshotted and CC’d
                I hate it so much.

I loved old Torb. He was the most fun and joy I ever had in the game. Then they took his level 3 turret away and instead gave us Bob, which is almost the same (I still think the level 3 turret killed a little faster than bob does).

And the reason they did it is because too many people hated having a Torb on their team. I know because maining Torb got me banned in 4 seasons. People thought you were throwing when you picked him, especially on attack. I still had a 67% win rate on Torb, even considering that I lost many MANY games due to throwers and griefers that gave up on winning the moment they saw the Torb OTP on their team.

Now we have Ashe, who can win a fight by throwing Bob on a strategic location. I already did the same with Torb back in the day, although with Torb you needed to be a bit smarter about it. Do it at the right moment, when the enemy team was distracted. Pop Molten Core, then put the level 1 turret down and start hammering with increased speed while using your beefed-up body to block anyone trying to shoot your turret while you upgrade it. It worked almost every time, and once the level 3 turret was active, it absolutely MELTED anyone that tried to stay on point, usually resulted in an easy win.
    Yes yes yes and yes
    This is the only thing I have ever wanted
    Level 3 turret was a massive dopamine rush
    He was so much fun to play back then. And i prefer 1000 times the old Molten Core. Please Blizzard give us Torbjorn back
        What did the old version of his ult do?
            What overdrive(?) does currently just buffed a bunch and also temporarily upgraded his turret to shoot faster and fire rockets
                Lmao he was if the Engineer and Heimerdinger had a baby.
                    yeah that was the joke of him when he was like that
                    except you had to make sure your turret was already level 2 so you had to either have it prepared and hope it didnt get destroyed or throw it down and whack it with your hammer for a few seconds. It was not very good lol
                        You also couldn't throw it, you had to place it
                        You hammered super fast in your ult. You could place, activate and hit for less than a second
            His old ult did everything Overload did but better. It lasted longer, and his turret upgraded to level 3, giving it more damage and rocket launchers. 
When they reworked him, they moved that ult to his E ability, removing the armor packs and level 3 turret. The lava ult he has today was completely new. I just wish he kept his level 3 turret :(
                [deleted]
    Torb was so fun to play. Perfect character when you started the game, and aside from the turret upgrade stuff you could actually use having good aim , getting clutch etc. And the ult was real cool, turret going crazy
    Miss this and full machine gun Bastion!
    I was absolutely devastated when torb lost his original kit. The new abilities don't make him feel like a master builder, but more of a tf2 mini sentry engi
Beta bastion. And let's watch the world burn...
    Ah yes, minigun headshots and personal holographic construction area hazard tape with no limit to the number of bastions. Relive the omnic crisis!
        Putting Overwatchs victory in the omnicompetent crisis in that context makes it all the more impressive when you consider it was litterly just a group of 5-6 people
        I just want my minigun headshots back man, I miss gunning down a charging rein T_T
        Let's just full send it and give him his turret form shield back too
    Dear God he's a madman
    what was beta bastion like vs ow1 bastion?
        Turret mode had a personal shield
            also they could not turn around 360 though (idr the exact angle) and their turret form could headshot. there's more that I'm having trouble remembering tho
    Personal shield ftw!
I kind of miss Reaper picking up the Souls of the dead. 

But I do like his current state.
    Thank you! I cannot believe how far I had to scroll to see someone say this. Reaper soul orbs were just cool!
        Oh wow! I had forgotten about them!
            It's funny because I stopped OW1 before that patch and came back like "where's the orbs?" He's honestly much stronger now being able to heal without a kill.
    It was cool in both concept and animation, but man the damage leech feels good
    had to scroll so far to find it. 

being able to self heal from those orbs was rewarding
    One of the funniest interactions with his orbs was that I would kill a junk rat then greedily go in for the orb then I'd die to junkrat's bombs lol.
Oh boy yeah, cum tastes good!
    Me too and i want my damn null sector ultimate sound back
        What? What sound are you talking about?
            On bastion when you use the null sector skin his ultimate sound effect is completely different compared to the default back in OW1 but now in OW2 it doesnt have that unique line anymore
                Gonna be an upcoming mythic skin feature
                    That would be absolutely horrible and somewhat expected
                Oh...
                    Its a shame because it sounded so cool and menacing when you heard it
                        His ult would be so good without the amounts of shield we had back then... I want it back!!!
                            Tank config is so much better than this one it doesnt leave you open like that aswell
                                I would be happy if arty config was like his old turret with the big cannon instead
                        All Null Sector intimidation sound effects are so well done, be it in the regular game, Archives, or cinematics.
        Same I was so disappointed when my favorite skin didn't do the "DUN DUN DUUUUUU" sound...now I just run the omnic crisis skim
            Same even though i have many legendaries and the lego skin i just cant take it off
                Wish I had lego skin limited skins stink
        Thank goodness I’m not the only one lol, I would definitely use that skin if it had the sound
        damm that sucks, didn't even noticed
    I rarely see people get killed by his ulti. I only died once today. 9 out of 10 times, everyone escapes his ulti
        Yeah it sucks.
    I guess I don't dislike the changes as a whole but idk why they swapped his self heal for that super generic grenade? It seems out of place in his kit and just lazy, at least his self heal worked really well with his identity
        Its fun to rocket jump into positions with espeically since u can get really high if u jump on two of them
            Nade jumping around a corner and turning into tank mode in mid-air is the funniest shit
        The grenade definitely looks generic but I've been playing a ton of Bastion and that thing wrecks people if you can get good at placing it. His gun would be kind of meh without it, but combined with a few well placed shots Bastion is a pretty good duelist. You can also shoot the grenade while turreting, which is powerful and I think not everyone knows that. Definitely helps shred a tank faster.

The ult is another story. That thing is buns. On Discord people keep defending it for the two or three things it can accomplish, but overall if I feel more powerful as my normal self than I do with my ult, it's a shitty ult. I'd rather be regular Bastion and actually secure kills than ulting and briefly making the enemy team move a little bit lol.

I did pair my ult with Orisa's the other day, and the two shitty ults actually combined into one good one.
            Bastion's ult is trash but I'm gonna have to defend Orisa's. At first I also thought it was kinda bad, until I realized it's basically just another Grav. It requires some coordination but get a good pull and you can pretty much guarantee a wipe.
        I remember talking a lot about this years ago, Bastion had no burst damage to use vs DPS in recon form making him unfavorable since DPS are expected to duel other DPS in Overwatch. The cruddy accuracy on the SMG meant a low skill ceiling for skilled players that would help make up for the lack of burst damage abilities  This meant that he lost duels regularly, especially with the cruddy accuracy his SMG had vs small DPS hitboxes and was generally considered a detriment to the team for many players.

They did what we asked years ago, buffed SMG accuracy (it's a robot why is it suffering from recoil) and gave him some burst damage to use in duels. What we didn't ask for was to lose tank form to send 3 chinese knockoff doomfist ults.
        Probably would make him too similar to Soldier 76, they opted for Bastion to be an almost purely offensive tank, whereas S76 is more balanced with less health and a heal and more mobility.
        
>It seems out of place in his kit and just lazy,

Blizzard 2.0, self heal was way better and in line with the character. The turret change, okay fair. Self heal though was the shit
        The problem with Bastion now is that he's a complete glass cannon and the new mobility isn't worth the tradeoff of the time limit on his turret mode. Seems incredibly stupid to gut his entire kit besides his primary. I definitely didn't main him before the changes for his personality
        Bastion's self heal was one thing I could accept being removed for game design reasons. It made a good bastion really hard to uproot when he's facing a mediocre team, all without requiring a support to babysit him. Now he can be worn down and requires more team coordination to reach full potential.
    I feel like his standard kit with the rework struck a really solid balance of effectiveness and ability to be countered and his old ult doesn't seem like it would push him into op territory imo.
    I miss jumping on the chandelier in Eichenwalde
    I agree, I miss bastions ult
    I'd love to see them fully embrace the form change thing for Bastion by making them always on like it used to be and swapping up his kit entirely depending on which mode you were in.

Recon gets self-heal, the slow firing rifle, and Mortar

Turret gets the gattling gun with a huge wind-up to compensate for it not being on CD, replaces the self-heal for the grenade, and gets the old tank mode.
It would be nice if they archived the old patches and you could time travel back to nostalgic eras of Overwatch play in like an arcade mode or something. I wasn't around for vanilla, I only came in late 2018.
    Omg now they are gonna release overwatch classic LOL
        1000 iq play to delete OW1 and then re-release it as "classic" but requires you to buy it as dlc for OW2
            Would totally fall for that myself.
        They are totally going to do this within the next 10 years. It’s free money for blizzard and we all know we would buy it. But it would have to be the original first patch. Broken roadhog hook and everything.
        There's a good chance. A lot of people are complaining about the changes and how you can't play the first title anymore. Though they probably won't do it anytime soon, cuz it would undermine OW2's business; but, it really would be nice to just make everyone happy.

            Yes, so much fun
            Genji players get no sympathy. They reap what they sow. Same goes for widow players. They deserve the suffering.
            Yes. Loved that. Fuck Genji.
        God OG Sym was sooo clunky. Had to walk up to a wall to place a turret that had like 2 health, stupidly long cooldowns and she only had 3. TP was nice but limited uses made it ass and giving 25 shields was cool but useless unless you had a Zen on your team and he was only unkillable if you had a Torb with armor packs on him as well. I do wish she still had photon barrier even though that was Sym 2.0
            Sym was literally picked in OG OW because you could give Tracer and Genji rechargeable 25hp shield - which was _insane_ (and why you don't see shield on dive characters).
                > Sym was literally picked in OG OW because you could give Tracer and Genji rechargeable 25hp shield

She was super strong during the betas because shields gave something like 50 to 75HP. The 25HP on live was essentially worthless and she was rarely picked outside of 2CP first points.
                    I always thought her amount of shield giving should be a percentage of the hero's HP.

25 shields on 150 HP Tracer? Fine.  600HP Roadhog would get 150 shields.
            I have rocked all symmetra reworks. I think the current one is actually the most boring.
            OG Teleporter was basically Mercy's resurrect but worse because you still had to wait for people to respawn to use the teleport from spawn.
            Sym actually originally had **SIX** turrets and they slowed and damaged.
    Shield Generator was not Symmetra's original kit, it was just her TP.
        That beam though..
            I just miss putting all my turrets on a basketball and then throwing it at enemies.

                    The super carwash on Echienwald before they added the alternate path was always fun. One path, 18 turrets.
    Iiiiim getting the feeling they have a sheeeiillld generator
    This! I was telling my friend about this the other day and they were shocked this was ever a thing. Between that and torb throwing armor. Ah the good times. 😂🤣
        300 hp tracer still give me nightmares

            And it stacked up to 150, and Repair Pack could grant another 75 armor. With a Brig, Sym, and Torb, you could have a full team with an additional 225 armor under 75 regenerating shield HP, and one member of the team could have a total of 300 extra armor for a couple of seconds.
Hanzo, I want to try scatter-arrow man
    it was a fun ability to use for corner plays with the sonic arrow, strong but not broken. but as the playerbase got better  realized that you just have to aim below a persons feet to get an instant kill the skill became so frustrating to deal with.
        You could 2 shot most tanks, I miss just disappearing roadhogs
    And they replaced it with such a lame ability.
    Shotgun arrow goes brrrrrr
Not the original but symmetra 2.0 was the most fun character in the game imo
    Lock on Laser with an Anna Ult gave me cancer.
        Lucio speedboost + Sym was the best
        But now you can also have a kiriko speed and attack speed boosts at the same time :')
    Lock on laser gun was peak.
        I wasn’t a huge fan of the lock on but I liked the unique problem solving her kit required. Teleporter had a balance of too close and too far. Shield Gen required you to decide between it and a teleporter, and her turrets needed to be either focused for damage or spread out for detection
            Damn I forgot about the shield gen, I reckon that would get some ay in the current game too
        I loved the lock on laser too, but I think Blizzard made the right call taking it out. It was ridiculously broken once you got it ramped up all the way.
            It also took 6 seconds to ramp up to full which is a way longer TTK than any other DPS playing optimally.  Having a character that didn’t need to aim was a really
important accessibility feature for a lot of people who have various physical conditions that make aiming difficult or impossible, and they removed it because Genji mains didn’t know how to swift strike away instead of spamming deflect.
                It definitely took a bit to ramp up, but if you could get it on a tank like [D.va](https://D.va) or Roadhog and then move to healers and dps, you could wipe out two or three players super fast. Honestly, lock on Symmetra was my main and the game has never been quite as fun for me since they reworked her.
                    She was my first golden gun, now I wish they’re refunded the gun price because I never play her.

6 turret microwaves defending right side for Temple of Anubis…so fun.
                Moira has a lock on
                    I found it the other day, she actually doesn't have a lock on. Every character has a custom hitbox just for her alt fire that is a round cylinder slightly larger than their normal hit box. I can probably find the vid if you want a source
                        I think it’s the same as the hitbox for Whip Shot and Chain Hook. If so, it’s only bigger for small characters. The flail and hook can clip through tank models and still miss.
                    It's not a lock-on, just a generous hitbox. The only true lock on left in the game afaicr is Mercy's beam.
                    No she doesn't. It is broken when someone else walks in front. Sym you'd literally lock onto a target and could turn around and look the other way
    I loved the lock on laser, and her orb being able to go through shields was the best counter to the shield meta. Top it off with her sneaky teleport ult... those were the good ol days
        That last one is still doable if you have a team willing to pay attention, and at will too now
            But you could port your team from spawn to some inconspicuous spot behind the point 😂
                SO many won games because of a well placed Teleporter
    Yes please! For me anyways, it was downhill after Symm 3.0 came out. It cemented by feelings that Blizzard really doesn't listen or care about people that actually play these heroes when they just change them. 

I stopped taking OW seriously after that.
        Sym changes were made to appease non-sym players.
    She was so cancer to play against though.  6 turrets that you'd have to spend time shooting.  Having to leave the fight and go on a ridiculous scavenger hunt to find TP/Shield Gen.  Lock on beam.  She definitely needed the rework.
    I'm glad you reminded me it was Symmetra 2.0 because that was going to be my answer. She was so much fun then!
hopefully when doomfist gets a buff they will realize what they done to him
    It’s pathetic how much I miss DPS doomfist
        DPS doomfist was a better tank than tank doomfist
            Wow, that's...Frustratingly accurate from what I've been seeing in recent game play. Nice summation, it really does feel that way.

Or--at the very least--DPS doomfist was "tankier" than tank doomfist, if that makes sense.
                Better movility meaned better survivability. The uppercut was much better than the powerblock.
                this is objectively wrong unfortunately. Being a diamond doom main for both dps and tank. Dps doom was EXTREMELY squishy. Despite 250 health + shields, you would be surprised how many times i had been 1shotted DURING slam uppercut combo, or ccd. (Storm arrow, widow, 2tapped by cass, ashe, hog hook, and this isnt including cc) Peeking while punching is a “snipe me please” button on dpsfist. I dont deny doom not being as tanky as the other tanks. But dps doom was never tanky.
                    Yep. What made DPS tankier was the two other tanks
            I saw a good DF last night for the first time in weeks. He solo carried the other team by picking me (Zen) before every team fight, then picking our other healer, then getting his team to push afterwards. And our tank just could not figure out that it was intentional, so any time our tank would start pushing he'd jump out from some random corner and wail on us in the backline while our tank had no idea we were even in trouble. 

He finished with like 43 elims and 12 deaths, it was fucking nuts. Every other DF I've ever seen since the switch to OW2 has been pure cheeks.
                This would only happen at top 500 doom otp vs bunch of silvers scenario. Hero is just too garbage
            it feels like he's too weak to do damage and is not any good at doing his job as a tank... he's just... bad :/
        only doomfist players miss DPS doomfist.

Everyone else is okay with not getting 1 hit and 1 shot combo'd
            No troll but what’s the difference with a widow 1 shotting you? Honestly agree with you but also have the same feelings with widow. It’s simply zero fun to get 1 hit and not be able to do anything about it.
                I hate widow too, the main difference tho, is that DPS Doomfist could get in and out easily.

Widow on the other hand has to say somewhat stationary and cannot escape as easily if you get in her face.
                    You would be right, however u forget how much cc in the game there was making it hard for an average doomfist to perform really good
                Being able to click on a head is much more respected than a one-shot that supposedly doesn't need any skill to pull off... 

Except anyone who's actually played dps doom knows just how tough it was to get in to get a single kill, nevermind the whole time it'd take to set up, get out and reset. It was never unfair, people just hated him to an extreme degree even when a good Hanzo/Widow/Cass would always make me 10x as miserable as a good doom.
                Widow's is at least a skillshot and you can at least try to play behind cover. Doomfist just takes a flank route, slams in your general direction, combos you to death, shakes off all non-stun peel attempts with the hp he got for smashing you then peaces out with his remaining cooldowns.
                Honestly I felt like widow is worse. Every role had Doom counters, while a good widow meant GG unless your tank knew what to do or you had a better Widow/Hanzo.
            As an Ana/Bap main, DPS Doom was perfectly fine imo. He was lots of fun to play as, and playing against him wasn’t too bad. His large hitbox made him easy to hit with a sleep dart, and because his punch was slow to charge up and went in a straight line, Bap could just jump over it. Sure he could 1-combo squishies, but Widow can also do that while being exposed to far less danger. And don’t even get me started on how they added Sojourn right after making Doom absolute garbage because of his ability to one-combo.
            >Everyone else is okay with not getting 1 hit and 1 shot combo'd

You mean getting punched and then sliding off a wall because the doomfist didn't hit you perfectly perpendicular to it.  Something they still haven't fixed along with Rein's charge basically flipping a coin to decide if it will grab the person it hits knock them out of the way.
            It genuinely blows my mind that people will shit on old doom’s kit, but still think junkrat is just fine or at the very least, *fine enough* to not complain about on Reddit. 

At least with doom you could sleep him or hack him and be fine or get away. Granted, I was only ever diamond, so take that with a grain of salt, but I didn’t really mind doom as much as the rest of you, especially after the infamous stealth nerf he got.
    Doomfist was best when the original game released, and he didn't exist yet.
I wish for the Overwatch Development team to be restored to their original state. 

New team has done nothing but attempt to spin plates to the sound of smashing crockery.
    The old overwatch team had some of the worst balance decisions I’ve ever seen in a game.

Moth mercy, sniper mcree, invincible bastion, double shield, Sombras existence, etc…

We look back at them favorably, but realistically we complained a lot more about balance back then than now
        To be fair you are comparing years of complaints to months of complaints, so yes there will be more incidents to list.
            > To be fair you are comparing years of complaints to months of complaints, so yes there will be more incidents to list.

Month 1 of OW had FTH mccree, hook 1.0, big res, quick scope widow, scatter, 8s dragonblade. Probably a couple others I'm not remembering. That's just mentioning the heroes that were fairly strong. There was also a large part of the roster that was just horrible. Zen was probably the most obvious. 150HP made him essentially unplayable back when Widow could kill him with a bodyshot.
                Zen has been my main since the beta, I remember the pain, and I survived it and played around it. I wouldnt call it unplayable since I had a positive winrate on him but it sucked
        And now we have Sojourn staying OP until 2028 when OW3 releases. Seems like mostly the same people to me
            You spelled Zarya wrong
                There are planned nerfs for Zarya. Sojourn remaining untouched is a new level of whatthefuckery
                they're at least nerfing zarya, they said they won't nerf sojourn
            Not even comparable.  Moth Mercy, Release Brig, GOATS, and Double Shield were far more egregious than anything in OW2.  And if you think waiting a few weeks for balance is bad, wait til you see how long it took those to be balanced....
    Same this game would be much better but they had to go ahead and do some very creepy things that got then fired
        The overwatch team have, as far as I know, no allegations against them. It was entirely other teams.
As much as I like Cassidy in OW2 with his mag nade, I think his flashbang was a key part of what made him so good
    I straight up prefer the flash bang over sticky grenade.   The stick feels even worse than just being stunned imo
        For real. They removed his stun because they wanted player agency, but replaced it with an ability which forces you to die, with almost no counterplay, if you're 130hp or lower? That's 1 cass bodyshot...
            Like weeeee now I get to run around for a bit before I die! Amazing! At least with the flashbang, there was a chance the Cassidy could be taken out by my team, or fuck up and miss. Once I've got that sticky grenade on, it feels bad just waiting to die.
        Well objectively speaking, the sticky grenade is broken, as cassidy is one of the strongest characters right now if you can aim
    Give me fan the hammer headshot damage or give me death.
        Let the man shoot someone from further than 5 feet please
    Back when flashbang,fan the hammer, doge, fth again would shred any tank
        Now he just gets ran over by Orisas.
            Gets ran over by anyone. I'm relentlessly campaigning until these devs realize they can't really balance and at least 1-2 DPS need a true CC in their kit. 

Otherwise, you're just trading on death to spazzy flankers or spam characters. 

You also did way more damage saving the FTH and using a head shot after the stun so he was a skill shot character. FTH was actually best at shredding OOP tanks on CD and shields. 

He doesn't threaten a pharah, loses at range to any other low rate of fire accurate hitscan, loses at range and up close to sojourn, hardly beats a soldier and gets stomped by him past  at mid range, has no sustain, has the worst mobility option.

I guess they want him to be a close range tank buster? He's too weak to hurt a tracer or Genji these days.
            I played this game super intensely for a year from late 2016 onward, had some of the most fun with a game ever back then
            His design is never meant to bully Tanks at the first place.
    The sticky is insane though and I feel like people are underrating it. It's like... 131 dmg??? And the damn thing can't miss. It's like a homing missile. That's 65% of a DPS/support player's max hp. 

Pretty much no one beats a Cassidy in a close range 1v1 these days. Maybe Reaper does, idk.
        So many characters have an ability that just negates the bomb, like wraith form, rewind, deflect etc. basically most the flank character’s which makes 1v1s with them really hard since that’s your main tool for those encounters. 

With the flash at least you had a chance to kill them now you just die when they get close to you.
    McCree*
    right click --> flash --> dogde --> right click = every hero melted to oblivion (was in beta afaik)
    Who is Cassidy?
    Yea I miss the old Cassidy
    Cassidy really has no niche in the current game. 

His output is outclassed by most other hitscan dps(Soldier, Bastion, Sojourn) and he isn’t a reliable anti-dive hero anymore because all dive heroes have a very reliable way to mitigate his sticky.
        There's not much reliable anti-dive at all anymore. It's on purpose.

No more Brig bash stun, no more 'cree stun, no more Sombra long-hack (to hack a Tracer and keep her from zipping away), there's a lot more I can't think of too.

And they gave DPS a speed boost after killing. They want characters like Tracer and Genji to have free reign in the backline. Screw the other heroes.

They're very intentionally buffing Dive because that's what is exciting to watch in OWL.

Then they got surprised they're not getting many people queue for healer to sit back and insta-die.

They rlly went "not you tho" to Sombra by nerfing her into the ground in this patch though haha.
    Half the roster seems to just shake off the sticky bomb.  All the flanking characters Mcree was good at countering (and seemed like his purpose) now have the ability to just avoid it.

It also seems like the tracking on it fluctuates patch to patch.  There was a patch where it basically seemed to not seek at all, and one where it was super easy to land.  Overall I think the balance on that part isn't terrible right now, but for a replacement of the flashbang it *should* be easy to land.

I have like a 70% attach rate or something and I don't do terrible with him overall, but the I hate the sticky bomb.  It also just feels bad.
    Flash bang was really reliable tool that gived cassidy flexibility but the new nade is weird - sometimes it sticks instantly sometimes it almost passes through someone and when you hit it it doesnt feel nice like fb into headshot.
No more team rez? Fine. No more two rez stacks? Fine. Rez cast time 3 times longer? Fine. 30 sec rez cooldown? Fine. But can mercy at least have a more significant healing beam that can outheal winston’s tesla at least.
    Wait, she can’t out heal winston now? Are there numbers for that?
        Mercy does 55 healing/sec while Winston does 60 damage/sec
            That's not taking into account the fact that he has to reload and she doesn't. With his reload he does 44.7dps so she does actually out heal his damage if the person Winston jumps on can survive long enough for him to need to reload, which they should because they'll be getting healed by mercy the whole time.
                He did the ~~monster~~ Mercy math.
                But he can hit multiple targets other than mercy
                    But that also means Winston is closeup with multiple targets, who would all be actively shooting him too. Winston ain't gonna stay around for long if he gets shot to low hp quickly
                If Winston spams melee it does the same dps as holding lmb but greatly extends his effective mag size.
            It is funny that the healer with a wand specifically to heal has less healing per second than kiriko, ana, and moira.
                She can heal through shields, through walls temporarily, and has zero resource management.
            That seems fair. 5 damage per second. If you can't kill that Winston in 40 seconds, then that's kinda deserved.
        its actually been many years since shes been able to. Truly a shell of her former self
    They ruined my girl again and again
        For a while it felt like the dev team had a personal vendetta against her for sure
        The team rezz was stupid but nerfing her again and again was unnecessary
            People weren't here for the moth meta that lasted over a year, and it shows.
                I was there Juan, I remember the screams... Keep Mercy like she is now, I never want to go back to that.
                Yeah, the only people who enjoyed that were mercy players. Her mobility is crazy now… she is fine.
                    Truth! I love the new mobility, at least feels like you can do more now.
    That team Rez was such a threat! Most exciting bullshit ever.
        It felt godly to pull off too. I'm not great at shooters but I always felt so damn good after a team rez.
            Felt even better as a Widow to ping Mercys head right as she tries to ult
                HEROES NEVER--- \*GAHLPH*
            Too many mercy players sacrificing their whole team just for a potg clip. Now everyone's out of position ready to get farmed again..  


I swear, they strongly refused to 'tempo res' the two teammates that got picked in the backline, giving you an actual chance to win the fight.. Nope, always that cheesy bs where they stop healing, your whole team dies (the enemy's not gonna bother using ults lol why would they when they can use attrition)...
        The amount of hype that would happen on my team when our mercy did a team Rez after we lost the team fight with like 20 seconds on the clock at the last point on a payload map.

But on the flip side, goddamn that was some rage quit level anger when the enemy mercy would pull that off against us
    To be fair Winston's Tesla requires reload so you can essentially heal through a full cycle (I think?)
        He also has some of the lowest dps, if I recall correctly.
    I stopped caring at some point... I'm more annoyed with them constantly changing her movement over the years ruining mercy boxing customs balance :(
    Nah cause it takes no aim at all, the supports who have to shoot should always heal more than her
Doom but somewhere deep down I think I want bastion with shield again.
I think OG Mercy's full team rez was a huge dopamine rush, but ultimately terrible for the game. That being said, her intermediate form, when she used to be able to reset her rez CD when she popped Valk was really fun and is my favorite iteration of her. It was broken, but it was a lot of fun being able to get a triple rez if you played your cards right.
    Yeah I saw that thumbnail and was like "oh boy somebody has rose colored glasses on for Mercy rez." The levels of "bad for the game" reached even Overwatch League, where pro Mercy's, getting paid to play the game, would sit around a corner not healing while their team would all-in, try to bait as many enemy ults as they could, and die so that mercy could rez them. The most boring, infuriating shit to not only play against, but even watch.
        I'd argue the goat meta was the worst thing to watch ever, but other than that I agree 100%.
            I enjoyed watching Goats as it felt more like watching professional sports instead of the standard poggers popping off shooter esports usually is.
    And the blaster being awesome. I got so many battle mercy kills during 1.0
Torb and doom
Probably symmetra. Idk why. Idk if she's worst and that's why? 

I played her very early ow1 times and enjoyed the 6 turrets and teleport and just guarding it. Came back she's dps and different.
    She's so unfun to play now, useless ulti and wow you can place tp 20 feet
Def not Mercy LOL  


Give me back Hanzo's stupidly broken Scatter Arrows cause im bad pls.
    I have a friend who wants to have scatter, storm and sonic arrow all together. And I don’t want to imagine that hell
        your friend and I would get along...
            Brig, but move her to the tank role
        What if they all shared a cooldown?
            What if they were all combined into one attack?
                Just sounds broken. Having them all be on the same cooldown and some sort of rotating arrow system would at least somewhat keep it balanced.
                    Or they could all be combined into one attack. That would be fun.
                        Sonic-scatter-storm! Sounds like the type of attack an anime character would pull out lol.
                        Shoots scatter arrows at the speed and quantity of storm arrows, all the while each piece from the scatter marking with the same area a sonic arrow does
            I think that could be cool but would it be on rotation or something along those lines
                Maybe it's a swap arrow button and you'd have to rotate through them.
        Put them all on one arrow. For science.
        Storm arrow just sucks. I’d do so much more with just scatter arrows alone. Don’t even give me regular arrow shots or sonic. I can only use scatter and that’s it. I’ll still be an asset to the team when I just dive onto the tank whenever it’s off cooldown lol
    Scatter was the only counter for tracer. Loved shooting the floor beneath her.
    Plz scatter arrow was a blast
    The only problem with scatter really was the one shot the tank by shooting them in the foot thing. If they remove that might be fun to have scatter back.
    Scatter was the only reason I was good with hanzo lol
    It's a shame I had to come this far down to find hanzo :( old scatter might have been busted but I wish they would have tried to tune it down first before just making hanzo hitscan for 5 shots, very boring imo. 

Headshot tank into scatter at their toes was probably a little op tho.
Tracer
    Other than her damage being higher, what was different in her original state? I do agree she should get her damage back (at least halfway between what it is now and what it is), though.
        Pulse Bomb had a slightly larger radius and did 400 damage.
            Was also able to recall outta grav IIRC.
                Back then all kinds of movement effects could get you out of grav, except Rein charge.
        Yeah but that 30% damage reduction really impacts how she is played and I personally had to re learn her
            Agreed, feel like she could really use that damage back.
        She has a 4 second blink cooldown now too lol
    They gave her ult to Cassidy as a cooldown ability :(
        Seriously his ability is just her ult om steroids. It also has a way easier stick rate. You can miss by 3 feet and it will track on it's own. 10s cool down makes it completely outclass her pulse bomb. 

She needs to be a tank buster again.
I love new Orisa but I miss playing old orisa and her ult
    I feel like they should have kept Orisa's kit, but then made a new hero with Orisa's new kit. 

Orisa was a great pokey tank. There aren't many pokey tanks anymore.
        JQ pokes. With an axe!

And Sigma balls.
            I'm always surprised when I fight against a sigma and they're not spamming balls 24/7.

My balls are getting tossed onto everyone all day every day when I hop on him. It's effectively constant, sustained damage that has no downfall to our team unless there's a Zarya.
    I’m fine with new Orisa because I love the spear, but yeah she should have her old ult back instead of having the worst one in the game
        It's so hard to get a kill with that ult, the people that you suck in just run out or use a movement ability to escape before it gets to charge enough to kill most damages
            Dva has the same issue. It's a zoning ult and it's fine. It should just be a bit bigger to actually effectively zone.
            I think it'd be better if it had an active tractor effect, like a weaker version of Zarya's ult. It's best suited right now to basically herding the enemy team together and bursting them and I'd rather they lean into that identity than try and balance another burst-kill ult
        I assume the ult was changed because of how well it would have synergized with kiriko’s ult.
    Old Orisa was very boring to me too tho
        I didn't think so. Had potential to kill targets, a live lord, grab was useful for grabbing heals trying to run in the back lines, and the shiled was very nice for pushing forward. I liked having a shield on a CD than having to wait on a recharge. I didn't play Reinhardt for that reason.
    Same, my old friend
    Old orisa was a bland character. Only cool thing she had, that required some mastery, was grav. Other than that you essentially watch the game unfold around you with little to no potential to make a huge difference until ult. Even then, you aren't really "doing" anything.
Lootboxes.
    Best comment I've seen so far
EXACTLY how they released on Overwatch’s initial launch (or the hero’s initial launch)?

For the Original cast, I would pick Hanzo. Scatter Arrow is WAY better than Storm Arrow.

For DLC heroes, I would pick Doomfist. I miss Original Orisa but Doomfist is so bad right now and New Orisa is not.

Or do you mean ANY version of a hero?

For an official version, I’d pick Symmetra 2.0. I love Shield Generator and support Sym is the best Sym.

For an experimental version, I’d pick Mercy with Valkyrie as her ability and Resurrect as her ultimate. That was the most fun version of her I had ever played. I would make a few changes (like having her say her ult line while rezzing), but other than that it was amazing. (I also wouldn’t mind OG mass rez).
    You would oneshot a tank straight up with scatter arrow. This isn't a joke and it was really easy to do
    scatter was overly broken, it really doesn’t need to come back ever.
        I always felt scatter was too high reward and low risk. If you’re going to fire it at my feet in the same tiny hallway/room as yourself, those arrows better damage you too. I’ve had instances of playing Hanzo myself and shooting scatter into a spawn gateway and one shotting people that couldn’t even see me.
        I loved it but yeah it made it super easy to one shot people. Unless they brought it back and changed it so it doesn't scatter if it hits the ground first, but then it'd rarely be used so it wouldn't be worth it.
            you could oneshot tanks. Fucking tanks. You didn't even have to see them.
    I just got back to playing after almost 2 years. Did they nerf her pistol? I used to get so many kills with it. Now it feels like it flings spongey nerf balls.
        Hmm, I’m not sure.
    Any hero v 1.0 when they were released was my intended question.
Lootboxes ;-;
Genji
    Yes. Let me triple jump and ledge boost. Other heroes get autism aim and I still get no reg slashes 6 years later.
I know people thought Orisa was boring before the rework but I had a lot of fun with her and I miss the secondary fire pulling shot :( I think her original version would fit really well into the current meta (with some changes of course) seeing as you can only use one tank in role queue.

Also none of her highlight intros make sense after the rework lmfao
    I also think her lore matched her old kit better.
I miss Symmetra's tracking laser :(
    I kind of miss Reaper picking up the Souls of the dead.
#MEI
    I miss freezing people and waving at them as I shoot an ice shard through their head :(
        Or using her "I got you something!" voiceline.
    I miss my Mei.
Brig  

A support who is actually threatening to all the flankers with their get-out-of-jail-free abilities would be nice
    But then how will the poor flanker dps characters get free kills on Zenyatta? /s
        Low-key Zenyatta is great at killing flankers if you've got average or better aim.
            Yeah he's got great damage output; he's just real squishy.
            Great at lower ranks. He gets farmed higher up.
                He's still played at GM, and flankers are far more cautious around a Zen at GM than at low ranks I'd say.  In GM a flanker has to catch Zen by surprise or it's a really risky engage.
    The brig is ridiculously bad right now lol. They kinda disabled her without actually removing from the game. The amount of dps creep in the game makes her shield destroyed instantly and she has 200 health with hitbox that bigger than tanks. Genji destroys her wtf
        "I will be your shi- MY BARRIERS DOWN!"
        I think you’ve really hit the heart of the issue with DPS balance and that’s that changes that were made to counter certain metas are still in effect after the end of those metas.
            Exactly. So many overwatch 1 buffs and nerfs are completely meaningless now and result in characters being just not worth picking
        I've been climbing ranks with almost exclusively Brig, I think she's underrated in her current state I do miss being able to stun people out of ult tho
        Is she really? She feels quite good versus flankers with that 50 shield bash
            50 damage on a 5 second cooldown seems worse than her 35 damage mace.  Without the stun, I almost never use it unless Genji is deflecting.
                You should use it, with proper animation canceling you can do bash-attack-whip in a quick succession and burst someone for 150+ damage.
                    I've definitely tried.  It was Brigitte's bread and butter in OW1.  But without the stun, Dash/Blink/Recall is too easy.
                        I mean, if you do the combo and they run away that's good enough, you don't need to kill the flanker.

Brig still counters Tracer/Genji pretty hard, I would like to have the stun back, but she still counters them.
    As someone who played release Brig with a pocket Mercy, being able to 2v6 the entire enemy team, while fun to play if you weren't on the receiving end, was bad for the game.
    OG brig almost killed this whole game lmfao. There is absolutely no reason a tank/support should have a 150 damage combo that is nearly impossible to miss lol
        It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make..

Jkjk she was busted originally I'd be happy if the repair packs gave armor again
            The immediate post-nerf Brig just before the repair pack nerf was my fav Brig.
        She literally still has a 155 damage combo right now. Bash+m1+whipshot is an easy 155 damage
Mei. I won’t come back to overwatch until she can freeze people again.
    you mean with her primary fire, right?
        Yes, mei just feels bad to play in ow2 because you just feel like a sym turret at close range, even if the freeze was just half a second with her primary i would like that much more than what she can currently* do

*currently meaning the last time she was available to play
    Definitely Mei.  Taking away ice girl's freeze was such a stupid decision.  Literally took away her defining trait.  She's all about ice and cold and her signature move was freezing people.
    Best answer, and I don't even think is was that long ago? 

The best memories I have of this game are slowly freezing someone, knowing their rage bar is building, then staring them DEAD IN THE EYES as I headshot their ass. 

SORRY, sorry, sorry...
    Her launch Ult would be a lot worse.
It was a small circle originally and it didn’t go through barriers. (That was a global change for projectile ults so I guess it’s arguable if that would carry over.)

I would love for her old ice particle effects to come back on Cryo and Wall though, what happened to them?
    I think it’s way better with the increased damage. It just melts people now. (Went from 55/s to 100/s)
        It's not about the DPS... It's about sending a message.

That moment of terror as a frozen tracer knows an icicle is about to pass through their brain.
            oh man... i miss this.. and gettin raged on after that in all chat :D
    Look, it doesn't have to be freeze, but what she does now is just nonsense.  Her left click is pure dead weight 90% of the time.  The only time to use it is when other characters use projectile-countering abilities.  Otherwise, it does way less damage than a right click headshot, without the upside it had before.

So you lose the 1v1 against almost any competent hero.  That means her Ice Block doesn't really work either, because instead of waking up and winning the duel, you just give the enemy time for support to arrive so that you lose even harder.  Mei has no offensive pressure when she loses to almost everyone, and Ice Block doesn't change that.

So her two useful abilities are right click and Wall.  That is not a hero, that's an early alpha sketch of a hero.  In OW1 her abilities actually had synergy with each other, now she's a wall-bot version of Cassidy.

Please.  I just want to play my favorite dps.  Make her kit make sense again.  She's only fun to play in Bronze lobbies where her left click is actually useful.
Brig, but move her to the tank role
    i think the whole idea behind her design was basically 'what if Reinhardt was smaller and a support?'. moving her to the tanks would be kinda pointless if Reinhardt is already there.
        imo she also fills a really important niche as a pseudo off tank right now to help smooth out comps with weak frontlines like JQ and Hammond
            Except she doesn't feel tanky at all and dies almost instantly and kinda sucks with supporting too
                Her whole kit is annoying to play behind. Brig players are always saying "just stand in the back and use your whip shot to keep inspire up" but that isn't what anyone wants to do when they pick Brig. They want to come in behind the shield, get close, and start swinging next to their tank. That's what it looks like she should be able to do, that's what it feels like her kit is for, but she's made of paper so you can't do it. Instead I'm standing around waiting for whip and heal packs to come off cooldown and feeling stupid 60% of the round for not picking Lucio.

If they were going to remove her stun, they should have made some changes to help her sustain better. Brig could really benefit from a Torb-like self buff cooldown to power her up in short bursts so she can engage, close distance, jump into the fray or survive longer- but not all the time. Shield bash is completely worthless now so they should really look into replacing it with literally anything more useful than moving forward slightly faster. The armored, shielded support hero should not be easier to kill than Kiriko and Moira. Her whole thing should be that she is hard to kill, but I'm actually relieved playing DPS when I see her; *thank god she isn't one of the tough supports to take out.*
                    Not to mention that she doesn't have armor or enough to give a damn. That and Armor feels kinda bad since its **slightly** less damage taken. Which means nothing against high damage characters like McCree, Echo, Hanzo for examples.

Theres only one character she vibes well with and i rarely see Rein. Not to mention she has no stun. She has Shield Bash for mobility and damage and her Whip which just displaces and damages. Thats it.


Her Ult is really good afaik but if thats ALL shes useful for.. Then whats the point in playing her otherwise?
                She needs to play at melee range to be effective but can be deleted almost instantly by most DPS. It's not great.

I still do fine with her but I *really* need to be on my game to not instantly die if I want to accomplish anything.
                    Thats the issue. Getting into Melee range. Without her ult or a Rein thats almost impossible it feels. That and her one ability PUSHES enemies away. Which might be useful for keeping the other support alive (until they just dash or keep holding W) but its not helpful for her to stay in melee range.
                To me she's basically an ult bot right now, her ult absolutely helps your frontline but yeah she seems to be pretty shit without it
        Yeah, she was supposed to be a Tank-Support hybrid.  I still think they could have kept that aspect of the character without keeping her as OP as she was.
    But I love bruiser healer :(
        Since we have Tanky tanks, and dpsy tanks, I would not be too reluctant to have a healery tank.

She would do great. Same with a slightly original Mei.
            Mei as a tank would be much better than brig. Mainly because support roster is so small rn and also because mei originally had cc which is something a tank should have. On top of her ice form basically being a broken version of roadhogs breather.
                In HotS they made Mei a tank with a lot of mobility and slows/stuns, so I could see this being transitioned pretty seamlessly
        Bruiser healer best healer
    I feel like tanks need to be bigger then Doom, Queen and Brig. Only reason I like Hogs are because I can actually let me take hits for me by using them as cover
        I mean, Doom is bigger than Zarya is
            But Zarya has bubbles making her bigger, and Doom can only protect himself. People want to shoot Zarya first if they see she isn't bubbled, which makes her a higher target then Doom.
                > Doom can only protect himself

Can he really though? :(
    Yeah, I miss Brig's stun.
        That stun came in clutch especially with a reaper ult coming.
        [deleted]
            And Orisa can harpoon to cancel an ult. As can Doomfist. And Reinhardt.

It doesn't have to be a full stun that goes on for seconds, but at least ult-cancelling would be consistent with all other heroes. And make her much more satisfying to play.
    Disagree on tank role, just restore her to a support who can actually fight back and create some space. Playing support in OW2 feels very vulnerable.
        It’s why I default to Moira so much, she can duel and has a great escape. Also really like Kiriko since she has solid mobility and an oh fuck escape button, conditional on nearby teammates of course
    I was so upset with her nerfs. I loved off-tank brig
    This game needs off tanks now that the tank role is limited to one, she doesn't need to be a tank.
    just embrace the bruiser nature and buff her damage capabilities AND refresh her dash after she gets an elimination. This way, you get rewarded for dashing out into danger smartly (because you gotta get the elim or you die) and get a chance to move into safety again. This would also synergize with her general kit as you gotta be close to proc Inspire
Super hot take but I wish brig was closer to her original state. I enjoyed her mush more when she was able to play with the tanks rather than baby sitting the other support like she does now.
    That take is as hot as the sun and I respect you threw it out there even if I completely disagree. Though I wish she got the stun on her shield back. Would make her a nice peel support as right now she sucks.
Roadhog
    Yeah, those old hog hooks I used to land were truly bonkers. Hook was 6sec and each shot did 50% more damage (but was slower). Although in a single tank meta losing the movement and DR on take a breather would probably blow
        [I'll just leave this legendary video over here ](https://youtu.be/8FiVBqP-XPQ)
            Thank you for this, you never know what you didn't know you needed
    Nah his cross-map, bend-round-corner hooks were too insane
    Oh hell no, extradimensional hooks were **not** okay back then, and they're **not** ok now
Doomfist
    Amen
        Amen
            Amen
Bastion
Symmetra and Bastion, because I'm a bastard
Symmetra
They should realise an "Original" arcade mode with all the original release states of all the heroes. Sure it would be unbalanced, but that's the point.
6v6
SIMPLE GEOMETRY
Bastion
Mccree… I loved the old flashbang, it was a useful tool in teamfights, to stop enemy ultimates or abilities in general
Nowadays he’s just a worse hitscan than sojourn
doom
Mercy
Torbijorn
McCree
    Yeah his heat seaking fucking bomb is way more annoying than his stun ever was
        And the stun grenade also could be used defensively to escape. I found it a lot more fun than just another version of a bomb.
            And at least you had to land your shots afterwards, not you just stick someone, say your shiteating voice line, and watch em blow up
                Agreed. I feel the characters are getting too close to each other in terms of powers.  Soon they’ll all have a shot, a grenade, and an escape power.
bastion
Symmetra! She was the original dps support 😂
I want Bastion back. Fuck Mobility, I rather be the biggest sitting turret with self heal and very good Ult. All of his changes were nerfs for good Bastion players
Tracer.  Unplayable after butt nerf.  /s
old doom (new doom sucks and i miss uppercut)
    I miss abusing the maps geometry
        I miss the fact that no hero in any game existed as a combo fighter like doom did, and they took that away from us. it's just an itch that can't be scratched now.
McCree. Give me back my damn flashbang! Literally no other character that can stop people's movement got nerfed.
    Brig and Mei would like a word with you
    Brig?
Dude *fuuuuck* that, Mass Rez was a plague to the game. It killed the flow of the match.

But my answer is Doomfist, they massacred my boy.
Mccree
DPS Doomfist :( His uppercut molded his kit together and now hes nothing more than....Pillowfist
Why is the sub being flooded by these posts for days now? Isn't that low effort content?
    Most things here are low effort, but it’s super easy to get this sub riled up, so they get a lot of interaction.
    I'd say it promotes discussion, I like reading through these
    Ow2 seems to be low effort release. So why  not.
Sombra, Torb or Brig.

I don't like the current Sombra. Less assassin and more disruptor again. Fuck unlimited translocator and invisibility.
Bring back old Mei
    [deleted]
Seeing Mercy as the thumbnail for this post was a little triggering.
    ;)
[deleted]
I have a few

Mercy - give us Multi Rez back you cowards, why is Mercy the only character who’s Ultimate doesn’t have a direct impact on the game?  Especially compared to literally any of the other Supports.  Just give it a stupidly high charge requirement and don’t give her invulnerability while using it - would it still be swingy and broken, yes, do I care, not really.

Torbjorn - it’s not even about the Level 3 Turret (I miss it, but not THAT much), but I miss his ability to gather scrap to give his teammates armour (even THAT I believe was added later).  It gave him something actually unique - I miss that in characters.

Symmetra - …look I’d just roll her back to her Ult being the Shield Generator.  I mostly just miss setting up 6 Turret choke points with her.

Bastion - his rework was a mistake, I will die on this hill.  He went from being a solid Anti Tank and Area Denial option, to being a subpar version of Soldier 76.
    Honestly they should have made bastion the tank and not doomfist without his heal he’s a big target
        Bastion’s Movement Speed and HP already have more in common with the Tanks than the DPS anyway, might as well go all the way with it.

Hell, I’d take MEI as a Tank over Doomfist - her smol model would be kinda hilarious in the role, but her kit is perfect for it.
    Valkyrie is great, it's just very situational. That multi-healing/multi-boost has saved many a team fight for me just in the past few days.

Multi-rez was fun to pull off, but incredibly unfun to play against.

I love where Mercy is at right now. I'm a Mercy main and am having more fun with her than I have in a *long* time.
Hammond, and easily so.

Followed by Symm.
I like Symmetra 3.0 too much to give her up, but I wish 1.0 and 2.0 would become separate heroes.
I wish they had an arcade mode where every hero would be in their original release state.
Sombra.
She used to be more of a Support/DPS hybrid with how substantially her hacks shut down targets. Managing her invisibility timer, knowing when exactly to hack a target, opening up the entire enemy team with an EMP. These things are what made her fun. Now it feels like ability lockout is an afterthought. 

I get why she was changed though. Silence abilities aren't very fun to play against (although, back then her hack was harder to get off and had a higher cooldown, so the silences were less frequent)
She's just more of your standard DPS now. The fun is gone.
Sombra. Bring her back down
Have over 1000+ hours in Mercy - then they change her. Now she doesn't even heal as strongly as others. Rip 🥺
Brig. I need CC, I need extra armor, I need 250 HP, I need a 500 HP shield. Thank you for listening to my TED Talk
5 rez mercy
The hero we didn't want but we want now 


loot boxes
Yeah, like an “Old Mechanics” mode where you can select whether or not you use the old version or not
    Yeah but per hero 

So you can choose to use old doom or torb if you want but also still using some of the newer designs of other characters
        Exactly
        Mmmm old hog, gonna hook you from from IRL to OW
    That’s all I’d play. I know people will disagree but the first like 6-8 months of overwatch was so much fun but all the adjustments made for competitions made it feel like more of a chore. I’ve been having fun enough coming back for overwatch but damn I miss the original base gameplay
        No dude it was so broken. The thing that made it more fun back then weren’t the changes but the player base. Everyone was new and figuring overwatch out so it wasn’t as competitive or toxic
    They need a classic mode with the original lineup and loadouts from release. 6v6 no role queue obviously as well. I would play the shit out of that.
That’s not how apostrophes work
"Setting up shop" with the armor packs was so ridiculous and fun. Really made him feel like a builder going around, collecting scrap, and using it.
    This sounds like a different game entirely
        It's Team Fortress 2

            Blizzard doing as much as they possibly can to make the game dissimilar to TF2 nowadays
        It was a lot of fun before they changed everything to make it competitive.
            I even remember when I first started how I thought overwatch was great because it was less about competitive and more about countering your opponents bullshit move with your bullshit move. Needing to pick up scrap kinda made sense because you also had another character, Reaper, need to pick up souls of the defeated to heal. You also had the glorious. 

McCree's tank melting fan-the-hammer. 

Zero-Line-of-Sight Hooks. 

Full Team Rez.

Welcome to the Car Wash. 

Day 1 Brig. 

They scaled down all the bullshit to make it "balanced". I wish they had scaled UP the bullshit to make it balanced instead.
                Car wash lmao

Symmetra's probably changed more than anyone, no?
                    [deleted]
                    Sym 1.0 was support, giving shields.

Sym 2.0 was... that was the one that still had the teleporter ult and the latch beam, right?

Then Sym 3.0 had the floating forward shield and her beam no longer latched on and she had the shield generator? Or was that 2.0?

And now 4.0 has the barrier for her ult instead.
                Yeah I remember as it was happening people complained that fights started feeling more like pillow fights than anything else.

Then double shield happened, GOATS happened, turned out when you took away all these fun things, gameplay becomes slow and boring.

When I first started playing, the way I would sell my friends on the game is "It feels like nearly every character is OP" the gameplay was fun because there was so much bullshit you could do. It was fast-paced and each character felt unique.

They've really scaled back on uniqueness and a lot of characters feel identical to each other now.
                    > Then double shield happened, GOATS happened, turned out when you took away all these fun things, gameplay becomes slow and boring.

That's the part I don't get in their balancing: Yeah sure, 3 tanks + 3 support was problematic. Sure.

But did they never consider that they only created this situation by **specifically** nerfing and/or reworking the heroes that could counteract this? And in turn, when they did forced 2/2/2, their premise for changing things in the first place evaporated, and they **should have** reset everyone to launch-balance **and start over**?

I hate how Blizzard has this morbid corporate mandate to never ever go backtrack something no matter how sensible it'd be.
                        You're completely right, it makes no sense.

At the same time, Blizzard has been pretty obviously catering hard to two groups. OWL viewers, and streamers.

Obviously getting more eyes on their product is a good thing for them, so I can see why they do it, but it means that all their balancing started getting around what looks impressive. When they realised the GOATS issue, they decided to force dive instead of just re-balancing everything. Every balancing decision they've made since GOATs makes sense when you consider the *forced dive* aspect, down to little things like DPS speed boost passive after kills.

And there's also that aspect of people screaming that any character that isn't pure DPS is "no skill" and should be nerfed into the ground. Mei, Junkrat, Sym, they've never been strong, they've never been part of an oppressive meta, but they're constantly seeing nerfs because of some idea of "skill" that people have in their heads. It makes games become really one-note and boring because then nobody picks the nerfed-to-hell interesting characters.

Edit: AH SEE? Completely unnecessary Junkrat nerf in this patch. They didn't even explain why they thought it was needed.
                Exactly. Overwatch wasn't fun to play *in spite* of the absurd abilities and ults and crazy team-wipe combos. It was fun **because** of them.

Competitive Overwatch is... just another team shooter, tbh. There have been lots of them. And with OW2 it even lost the bonus of being the arguably most-polished one, it's quite beta-y in nature now with lots of quirks and bugs.

But ah well, it's where the money is I suppose, and it's not like there ain't tons of games to play. Don't really need a team FPS right now anyways, plus me and my friends just play some DRG if we feel like shooting at things.

ROCK AND STONE!
                Fan the hammer was so comically broken it was wonderful. Everyone melted the minute you got close to him.

                It's adorable that people who say this seem to think the developers are the ones making the money and not their employers.
        Original Doomfist as well. He played like a fighting game character, his moves were very timing based, and combos into each other. Too bad they have such trouble balancing him.
        I had to think about Apex's loba
    Man, the scrap mechanic was oddly entertaining and also the only way you could get Torb's to actually play the game. I used to have armor packs scattered around the point.
        if you played it right he was a pseudo healer
            I loved throwing the armor packs on a large arc to try and protect someone more forward.
                Not to mention you could just throw it on yourself in a pinch effectively giving torb a lot more hp and dueling power.
            Technically an armor pack would be better than healing the same amount because it provides damage resistance, right?
                Yup. Symmetra was a support originally for this very reason
        I remember we'd be playing on Hanamura, and they enemy would be at the choke point.

"Hey guys. I'm going on a scrap run!"

Run with my little dwarf legs, run back, armor everyone up then litter the point with armor packs.

Good times.
            I remember he still had the armor packs when Symm got the shield generator. Those were filthy times
                Whaaat? It was just a Tracer zipping around with ~~275~~ 300hp!
                    And the shield was over the armor too. Some characters became pretty well unstoppable.
                        I actually stayed alive for more than a minute or two as Zenyatta!
                            Especially since the armor also went under his natural shields
                    Actually, 300hp... Lol
                oh my fucking god i forgot about that absolute nonsense lmao. they were the best of times, they were the worst of times
        I miss torb/sym duos where you'd just have a gazzillion armour. It was stupid and fun.
    He gave armor packs? Which ability did they replace it with? It sounds like he was funner to play back then
        He collected scraps from dead bodies which he could use to upgrade his turret and give armor packs to hit team. His ult was his current E but better because it also made his turret stronger. I don't remember if his gun had an alt-fire at the time though.
            > His ult was his current E but better because it also made his turret stronger

Ahh, the good old days when Torb POTG would be ulting in spawn.
                Or staring at Widow's ass while his turret did all the work.
                [Best Torb POTG ever](https://youtu.be/DiMJ-s4T16M)
                    I laughed at the same time as the uploader, in a similar fashion.

Perfect.
                        Lol so did I because it's the funny bit
                I remember I would Ult, get really close to the Widow on my teams ass and just Hammer away for an easy POTG.
                Ults insta dies turret kills 5 players easy potg.
            He did have alt fire on his gun!
            wait does his e not buff his turret anymore? oh god ive been using it all wrong
        Torb used to be completely different. You couldn’t throw the turret, instead placing it directly in front of you. It started at level 1 and had to be upgraded using scrap metal he could pick up from dead players, which is also what he used to make armor packs. Overheat didn’t exist because his ultimate was basically a souped up version of the current ability: it gave a ton of health, faster attack and run speed, and temporarily upgraded your turret to level three
            He was a lot more similar to the Engineer from TF2
                Yes because OW was designed to be like TF2.
                    Just new and exciting and *sexy*
        He really wasn't.

He used to play a lot like TF2 engineer. Build a turret, upgrade it to level 2, collect scraps around the battlefield to give a one-time armor bonus to teammates. Ult would buff you a bit and make your turret stronger.


You relied a lot more on your turret to do the work. It also meant that playing on any mode other than defense was difficult.

Current torb is more fun IMO. His niche isn't as unique but at least he's always playable.
            All they did was change him from a wrench engineer to a gunslinger engineer.
Also popping his ult, dying immediately and then getting POTG because your 800HP aimbot killed 5 people.

God that was fun.
    Killed 6 ppl!
        11 people. Kills everyone but the mercy. mercy mass rezzes whole team. Whole team dies again.
            The whole ground would be littered with scrap afterwards and you could give your team armor for days
    Literally my first POTG ever from the beta.
    You can still do this if you play Ashe
Hell yeah.

Level 3 turret = some chill gaming 😎🤘
    They really dismantled him and built a whole new character, didn't they?  They took away his armor packs and gave something similar to Brigitte.  They took away his Level 3 turret and turned it into Bob.
        I was about to say: Bob is just a level 3 Turret with a Rein Charge but no pin.
            Except Bob can be headshotted and CC’d
            I hate it so much.

I loved old Torb. He was the most fun and joy I ever had in the game. Then they took his level 3 turret away and instead gave us Bob, which is almost the same (I still think the level 3 turret killed a little faster than bob does).

And the reason they did it is because too many people hated having a Torb on their team. I know because maining Torb got me banned in 4 seasons. People thought you were throwing when you picked him, especially on attack. I still had a 67% win rate on Torb, even considering that I lost many MANY games due to throwers and griefers that gave up on winning the moment they saw the Torb OTP on their team.

Now we have Ashe, who can win a fight by throwing Bob on a strategic location. I already did the same with Torb back in the day, although with Torb you needed to be a bit smarter about it. Do it at the right moment, when the enemy team was distracted. Pop Molten Core, then put the level 1 turret down and start hammering with increased speed while using your beefed-up body to block anyone trying to shoot your turret while you upgrade it. It worked almost every time, and once the level 3 turret was active, it absolutely MELTED anyone that tried to stay on point, usually resulted in an easy win.
Yes yes yes and yes
This is the only thing I have ever wanted
Level 3 turret was a massive dopamine rush
He was so much fun to play back then. And i prefer 1000 times the old Molten Core. Please Blizzard give us Torbjorn back
    What did the old version of his ult do?
        What overdrive(?) does currently just buffed a bunch and also temporarily upgraded his turret to shoot faster and fire rockets
            Lmao he was if the Engineer and Heimerdinger had a baby.
                yeah that was the joke of him when he was like that
                except you had to make sure your turret was already level 2 so you had to either have it prepared and hope it didnt get destroyed or throw it down and whack it with your hammer for a few seconds. It was not very good lol
                    You also couldn't throw it, you had to place it
                    You hammered super fast in your ult. You could place, activate and hit for less than a second
        His old ult did everything Overload did but better. It lasted longer, and his turret upgraded to level 3, giving it more damage and rocket launchers. 
When they reworked him, they moved that ult to his E ability, removing the armor packs and level 3 turret. The lava ult he has today was completely new. I just wish he kept his level 3 turret :(
            [deleted]
Torb was so fun to play. Perfect character when you started the game, and aside from the turret upgrade stuff you could actually use having good aim , getting clutch etc. And the ult was real cool, turret going crazy
Miss this and full machine gun Bastion!
I was absolutely devastated when torb lost his original kit. The new abilities don't make him feel like a master builder, but more of a tf2 mini sentry engi
Ah yes, minigun headshots and personal holographic construction area hazard tape with no limit to the number of bastions. Relive the omnic crisis!
    Putting Overwatchs victory in the omnicompetent crisis in that context makes it all the more impressive when you consider it was litterly just a group of 5-6 people
    I just want my minigun headshots back man, I miss gunning down a charging rein T_T
    Let's just full send it and give him his turret form shield back too
Dear God he's a madman
what was beta bastion like vs ow1 bastion?
    Turret mode had a personal shield
        also they could not turn around 360 though (idr the exact angle) and their turret form could headshot. there's more that I'm having trouble remembering tho
Personal shield ftw!
Thank you! I cannot believe how far I had to scroll to see someone say this. Reaper soul orbs were just cool!
    Oh wow! I had forgotten about them!
        It's funny because I stopped OW1 before that patch and came back like "where's the orbs?" He's honestly much stronger now being able to heal without a kill.
It was cool in both concept and animation, but man the damage leech feels good
had to scroll so far to find it. 

being able to self heal from those orbs was rewarding
One of the funniest interactions with his orbs was that I would kill a junk rat then greedily go in for the orb then I'd die to junkrat's bombs lol.
Me too and i want my damn null sector ultimate sound back
    What? What sound are you talking about?
        On bastion when you use the null sector skin his ultimate sound effect is completely different compared to the default back in OW1 but now in OW2 it doesnt have that unique line anymore
            Gonna be an upcoming mythic skin feature
                That would be absolutely horrible and somewhat expected
            Oh...
                Its a shame because it sounded so cool and menacing when you heard it
                    His ult would be so good without the amounts of shield we had back then... I want it back!!!
                        Tank config is so much better than this one it doesnt leave you open like that aswell
                            I would be happy if arty config was like his old turret with the big cannon instead
                    All Null Sector intimidation sound effects are so well done, be it in the regular game, Archives, or cinematics.
    Same I was so disappointed when my favorite skin didn't do the "DUN DUN DUUUUUU" sound...now I just run the omnic crisis skim
        Same even though i have many legendaries and the lego skin i just cant take it off
            Wish I had lego skin limited skins stink
    Thank goodness I’m not the only one lol, I would definitely use that skin if it had the sound
    damm that sucks, didn't even noticed
I rarely see people get killed by his ulti. I only died once today. 9 out of 10 times, everyone escapes his ulti
    Yeah it sucks.
I guess I don't dislike the changes as a whole but idk why they swapped his self heal for that super generic grenade? It seems out of place in his kit and just lazy, at least his self heal worked really well with his identity
    Its fun to rocket jump into positions with espeically since u can get really high if u jump on two of them
        Nade jumping around a corner and turning into tank mode in mid-air is the funniest shit
    The grenade definitely looks generic but I've been playing a ton of Bastion and that thing wrecks people if you can get good at placing it. His gun would be kind of meh without it, but combined with a few well placed shots Bastion is a pretty good duelist. You can also shoot the grenade while turreting, which is powerful and I think not everyone knows that. Definitely helps shred a tank faster.

The ult is another story. That thing is buns. On Discord people keep defending it for the two or three things it can accomplish, but overall if I feel more powerful as my normal self than I do with my ult, it's a shitty ult. I'd rather be regular Bastion and actually secure kills than ulting and briefly making the enemy team move a little bit lol.

I did pair my ult with Orisa's the other day, and the two shitty ults actually combined into one good one.
        Bastion's ult is trash but I'm gonna have to defend Orisa's. At first I also thought it was kinda bad, until I realized it's basically just another Grav. It requires some coordination but get a good pull and you can pretty much guarantee a wipe.
    I remember talking a lot about this years ago, Bastion had no burst damage to use vs DPS in recon form making him unfavorable since DPS are expected to duel other DPS in Overwatch. The cruddy accuracy on the SMG meant a low skill ceiling for skilled players that would help make up for the lack of burst damage abilities  This meant that he lost duels regularly, especially with the cruddy accuracy his SMG had vs small DPS hitboxes and was generally considered a detriment to the team for many players.

They did what we asked years ago, buffed SMG accuracy (it's a robot why is it suffering from recoil) and gave him some burst damage to use in duels. What we didn't ask for was to lose tank form to send 3 chinese knockoff doomfist ults.
    Probably would make him too similar to Soldier 76, they opted for Bastion to be an almost purely offensive tank, whereas S76 is more balanced with less health and a heal and more mobility.
    
>It seems out of place in his kit and just lazy,

Blizzard 2.0, self heal was way better and in line with the character. The turret change, okay fair. Self heal though was the shit
    The problem with Bastion now is that he's a complete glass cannon and the new mobility isn't worth the tradeoff of the time limit on his turret mode. Seems incredibly stupid to gut his entire kit besides his primary. I definitely didn't main him before the changes for his personality
    Bastion's self heal was one thing I could accept being removed for game design reasons. It made a good bastion really hard to uproot when he's facing a mediocre team, all without requiring a support to babysit him. Now he can be worn down and requires more team coordination to reach full potential.
I feel like his standard kit with the rework struck a really solid balance of effectiveness and ability to be countered and his old ult doesn't seem like it would push him into op territory imo.
I miss jumping on the chandelier in Eichenwalde
I agree, I miss bastions ult
I'd love to see them fully embrace the form change thing for Bastion by making them always on like it used to be and swapping up his kit entirely depending on which mode you were in.

Recon gets self-heal, the slow firing rifle, and Mortar

Turret gets the gattling gun with a huge wind-up to compensate for it not being on CD, replaces the self-heal for the grenade, and gets the old tank mode.
Omg now they are gonna release overwatch classic LOL
    1000 iq play to delete OW1 and then re-release it as "classic" but requires you to buy it as dlc for OW2
        Would totally fall for that myself.
    They are totally going to do this within the next 10 years. It’s free money for blizzard and we all know we would buy it. But it would have to be the original first patch. Broken roadhog hook and everything.
    There's a good chance. A lot of people are complaining about the changes and how you can't play the first title anymore. Though they probably won't do it anytime soon, cuz it would undermine OW2's business; but, it really would be nice to just make everyone happy.
Like Minecraft

    #AHM GETTING THE FEELING THEY 'AVE A SHIELD GENERATOR
        a  *shＩＩＩＩＩＩＩeld*  generator
    I’m glad that other people experienced that, too. Always feels like a fever dream.
That wasn't even her original kit
    [deleted]
        Yes, so much fun
        Genji players get no sympathy. They reap what they sow. Same goes for widow players. They deserve the suffering.
        Yes. Loved that. Fuck Genji.
    God OG Sym was sooo clunky. Had to walk up to a wall to place a turret that had like 2 health, stupidly long cooldowns and she only had 3. TP was nice but limited uses made it ass and giving 25 shields was cool but useless unless you had a Zen on your team and he was only unkillable if you had a Torb with armor packs on him as well. I do wish she still had photon barrier even though that was Sym 2.0
        Sym was literally picked in OG OW because you could give Tracer and Genji rechargeable 25hp shield - which was _insane_ (and why you don't see shield on dive characters).
            > Sym was literally picked in OG OW because you could give Tracer and Genji rechargeable 25hp shield

She was super strong during the betas because shields gave something like 50 to 75HP. The 25HP on live was essentially worthless and she was rarely picked outside of 2CP first points.
                I always thought her amount of shield giving should be a percentage of the hero's HP.

25 shields on 150 HP Tracer? Fine.  600HP Roadhog would get 150 shields.
        I have rocked all symmetra reworks. I think the current one is actually the most boring.
        OG Teleporter was basically Mercy's resurrect but worse because you still had to wait for people to respawn to use the teleport from spawn.
        Sym actually originally had **SIX** turrets and they slowed and damaged.
Shield Generator was not Symmetra's original kit, it was just her TP.
    That beam though..
        I just miss putting all my turrets on a basketball and then throwing it at enemies.
            I miss the ol' carwash
                The straight to the dome car wash
                The super carwash on Echienwald before they added the alternate path was always fun. One path, 18 turrets.
Iiiiim getting the feeling they have a sheeeiillld generator
This! I was telling my friend about this the other day and they were shocked this was ever a thing. Between that and torb throwing armor. Ah the good times. 😂🤣
    300 hp tracer still give me nightmares
    Also brig armor not expiring. Those were the days
        And it stacked up to 150, and Repair Pack could grant another 75 armor. With a Brig, Sym, and Torb, you could have a full team with an additional 225 armor under 75 regenerating shield HP, and one member of the team could have a total of 300 extra armor for a couple of seconds.
it was a fun ability to use for corner plays with the sonic arrow, strong but not broken. but as the playerbase got better  realized that you just have to aim below a persons feet to get an instant kill the skill became so frustrating to deal with.
    You could 2 shot most tanks, I miss just disappearing roadhogs
And they replaced it with such a lame ability.
Shotgun arrow goes brrrrrr
Lock on Laser with an Anna Ult gave me cancer.
    Lucio speedboost + Sym was the best
    But now you can also have a kiriko speed and attack speed boosts at the same time :')
Lock on laser gun was peak.
    I wasn’t a huge fan of the lock on but I liked the unique problem solving her kit required. Teleporter had a balance of too close and too far. Shield Gen required you to decide between it and a teleporter, and her turrets needed to be either focused for damage or spread out for detection
        Damn I forgot about the shield gen, I reckon that would get some ay in the current game too
    I loved the lock on laser too, but I think Blizzard made the right call taking it out. It was ridiculously broken once you got it ramped up all the way.
        It also took 6 seconds to ramp up to full which is a way longer TTK than any other DPS playing optimally.  Having a character that didn’t need to aim was a really
important accessibility feature for a lot of people who have various physical conditions that make aiming difficult or impossible, and they removed it because Genji mains didn’t know how to swift strike away instead of spamming deflect.
            It definitely took a bit to ramp up, but if you could get it on a tank like [D.va](https://D.va) or Roadhog and then move to healers and dps, you could wipe out two or three players super fast. Honestly, lock on Symmetra was my main and the game has never been quite as fun for me since they reworked her.
                She was my first golden gun, now I wish they’re refunded the gun price because I never play her.

6 turret microwaves defending right side for Temple of Anubis…so fun.
            Moira has a lock on
                I found it the other day, she actually doesn't have a lock on. Every character has a custom hitbox just for her alt fire that is a round cylinder slightly larger than their normal hit box. I can probably find the vid if you want a source
                    I think it’s the same as the hitbox for Whip Shot and Chain Hook. If so, it’s only bigger for small characters. The flail and hook can clip through tank models and still miss.
                It's not a lock-on, just a generous hitbox. The only true lock on left in the game afaicr is Mercy's beam.
                No she doesn't. It is broken when someone else walks in front. Sym you'd literally lock onto a target and could turn around and look the other way
I loved the lock on laser, and her orb being able to go through shields was the best counter to the shield meta. Top it off with her sneaky teleport ult... those were the good ol days
    That last one is still doable if you have a team willing to pay attention, and at will too now
        But you could port your team from spawn to some inconspicuous spot behind the point 😂
            SO many won games because of a well placed Teleporter
Yes please! For me anyways, it was downhill after Symm 3.0 came out. It cemented by feelings that Blizzard really doesn't listen or care about people that actually play these heroes when they just change them. 

I stopped taking OW seriously after that.
    Sym changes were made to appease non-sym players.
She was so cancer to play against though.  6 turrets that you'd have to spend time shooting.  Having to leave the fight and go on a ridiculous scavenger hunt to find TP/Shield Gen.  Lock on beam.  She definitely needed the rework.
I'm glad you reminded me it was Symmetra 2.0 because that was going to be my answer. She was so much fun then!
It’s pathetic how much I miss DPS doomfist
    DPS doomfist was a better tank than tank doomfist
        Wow, that's...Frustratingly accurate from what I've been seeing in recent game play. Nice summation, it really does feel that way.

Or--at the very least--DPS doomfist was "tankier" than tank doomfist, if that makes sense.
            Better movility meaned better survivability. The uppercut was much better than the powerblock.
            this is objectively wrong unfortunately. Being a diamond doom main for both dps and tank. Dps doom was EXTREMELY squishy. Despite 250 health + shields, you would be surprised how many times i had been 1shotted DURING slam uppercut combo, or ccd. (Storm arrow, widow, 2tapped by cass, ashe, hog hook, and this isnt including cc) Peeking while punching is a “snipe me please” button on dpsfist. I dont deny doom not being as tanky as the other tanks. But dps doom was never tanky.
                Yep. What made DPS tankier was the two other tanks
        I saw a good DF last night for the first time in weeks. He solo carried the other team by picking me (Zen) before every team fight, then picking our other healer, then getting his team to push afterwards. And our tank just could not figure out that it was intentional, so any time our tank would start pushing he'd jump out from some random corner and wail on us in the backline while our tank had no idea we were even in trouble. 

He finished with like 43 elims and 12 deaths, it was fucking nuts. Every other DF I've ever seen since the switch to OW2 has been pure cheeks.
            This would only happen at top 500 doom otp vs bunch of silvers scenario. Hero is just too garbage
        it feels like he's too weak to do damage and is not any good at doing his job as a tank... he's just... bad :/
    only doomfist players miss DPS doomfist.

Everyone else is okay with not getting 1 hit and 1 shot combo'd
        No troll but what’s the difference with a widow 1 shotting you? Honestly agree with you but also have the same feelings with widow. It’s simply zero fun to get 1 hit and not be able to do anything about it.
            I hate widow too, the main difference tho, is that DPS Doomfist could get in and out easily.

Widow on the other hand has to say somewhat stationary and cannot escape as easily if you get in her face.
                You would be right, however u forget how much cc in the game there was making it hard for an average doomfist to perform really good
            Being able to click on a head is much more respected than a one-shot that supposedly doesn't need any skill to pull off... 

Except anyone who's actually played dps doom knows just how tough it was to get in to get a single kill, nevermind the whole time it'd take to set up, get out and reset. It was never unfair, people just hated him to an extreme degree even when a good Hanzo/Widow/Cass would always make me 10x as miserable as a good doom.
            Widow's is at least a skillshot and you can at least try to play behind cover. Doomfist just takes a flank route, slams in your general direction, combos you to death, shakes off all non-stun peel attempts with the hp he got for smashing you then peaces out with his remaining cooldowns.
            Honestly I felt like widow is worse. Every role had Doom counters, while a good widow meant GG unless your tank knew what to do or you had a better Widow/Hanzo.
        As an Ana/Bap main, DPS Doom was perfectly fine imo. He was lots of fun to play as, and playing against him wasn’t too bad. His large hitbox made him easy to hit with a sleep dart, and because his punch was slow to charge up and went in a straight line, Bap could just jump over it. Sure he could 1-combo squishies, but Widow can also do that while being exposed to far less danger. And don’t even get me started on how they added Sojourn right after making Doom absolute garbage because of his ability to one-combo.
        >Everyone else is okay with not getting 1 hit and 1 shot combo'd

You mean getting punched and then sliding off a wall because the doomfist didn't hit you perfectly perpendicular to it.  Something they still haven't fixed along with Rein's charge basically flipping a coin to decide if it will grab the person it hits knock them out of the way.
        It genuinely blows my mind that people will shit on old doom’s kit, but still think junkrat is just fine or at the very least, *fine enough* to not complain about on Reddit. 

At least with doom you could sleep him or hack him and be fine or get away. Granted, I was only ever diamond, so take that with a grain of salt, but I didn’t really mind doom as much as the rest of you, especially after the infamous stealth nerf he got.
Doomfist was best when the original game released, and he didn't exist yet.
The old overwatch team had some of the worst balance decisions I’ve ever seen in a game.

Moth mercy, sniper mcree, invincible bastion, double shield, Sombras existence, etc…

We look back at them favorably, but realistically we complained a lot more about balance back then than now
    To be fair you are comparing years of complaints to months of complaints, so yes there will be more incidents to list.
        > To be fair you are comparing years of complaints to months of complaints, so yes there will be more incidents to list.

Month 1 of OW had FTH mccree, hook 1.0, big res, quick scope widow, scatter, 8s dragonblade. Probably a couple others I'm not remembering. That's just mentioning the heroes that were fairly strong. There was also a large part of the roster that was just horrible. Zen was probably the most obvious. 150HP made him essentially unplayable back when Widow could kill him with a bodyshot.
            Zen has been my main since the beta, I remember the pain, and I survived it and played around it. I wouldnt call it unplayable since I had a positive winrate on him but it sucked
    And now we have Sojourn staying OP until 2028 when OW3 releases. Seems like mostly the same people to me
        You spelled Zarya wrong
            There are planned nerfs for Zarya. Sojourn remaining untouched is a new level of whatthefuckery
            they're at least nerfing zarya, they said they won't nerf sojourn
        Not even comparable.  Moth Mercy, Release Brig, GOATS, and Double Shield were far more egregious than anything in OW2.  And if you think waiting a few weeks for balance is bad, wait til you see how long it took those to be balanced....
Same this game would be much better but they had to go ahead and do some very creepy things that got then fired
    The overwatch team have, as far as I know, no allegations against them. It was entirely other teams.
I straight up prefer the flash bang over sticky grenade.   The stick feels even worse than just being stunned imo
    For real. They removed his stun because they wanted player agency, but replaced it with an ability which forces you to die, with almost no counterplay, if you're 130hp or lower? That's 1 cass bodyshot...
        Like weeeee now I get to run around for a bit before I die! Amazing! At least with the flashbang, there was a chance the Cassidy could be taken out by my team, or fuck up and miss. Once I've got that sticky grenade on, it feels bad just waiting to die.
    Well objectively speaking, the sticky grenade is broken, as cassidy is one of the strongest characters right now if you can aim
Give me fan the hammer headshot damage or give me death.
    Let the man shoot someone from further than 5 feet please
Back when flashbang,fan the hammer, doge, fth again would shred any tank
    Now he just gets ran over by Orisas.
        Gets ran over by anyone. I'm relentlessly campaigning until these devs realize they can't really balance and at least 1-2 DPS need a true CC in their kit. 

Otherwise, you're just trading on death to spazzy flankers or spam characters. 

You also did way more damage saving the FTH and using a head shot after the stun so he was a skill shot character. FTH was actually best at shredding OOP tanks on CD and shields. 

He doesn't threaten a pharah, loses at range to any other low rate of fire accurate hitscan, loses at range and up close to sojourn, hardly beats a soldier and gets stomped by him past  at mid range, has no sustain, has the worst mobility option.

I guess they want him to be a close range tank buster? He's too weak to hurt a tracer or Genji these days.
        I played this game super intensely for a year from late 2016 onward, had some of the most fun with a game ever back then
        His design is never meant to bully Tanks at the first place.
The sticky is insane though and I feel like people are underrating it. It's like... 131 dmg??? And the damn thing can't miss. It's like a homing missile. That's 65% of a DPS/support player's max hp. 

Pretty much no one beats a Cassidy in a close range 1v1 these days. Maybe Reaper does, idk.
    So many characters have an ability that just negates the bomb, like wraith form, rewind, deflect etc. basically most the flank character’s which makes 1v1s with them really hard since that’s your main tool for those encounters. 

With the flash at least you had a chance to kill them now you just die when they get close to you.
McCree*
right click --> flash --> dogde --> right click = every hero melted to oblivion (was in beta afaik)
Who is Cassidy?
Yea I miss the old Cassidy
Cassidy really has no niche in the current game. 

His output is outclassed by most other hitscan dps(Soldier, Bastion, Sojourn) and he isn’t a reliable anti-dive hero anymore because all dive heroes have a very reliable way to mitigate his sticky.
    There's not much reliable anti-dive at all anymore. It's on purpose.

No more Brig bash stun, no more 'cree stun, no more Sombra long-hack (to hack a Tracer and keep her from zipping away), there's a lot more I can't think of too.

And they gave DPS a speed boost after killing. They want characters like Tracer and Genji to have free reign in the backline. Screw the other heroes.

They're very intentionally buffing Dive because that's what is exciting to watch in OWL.

Then they got surprised they're not getting many people queue for healer to sit back and insta-die.

They rlly went "not you tho" to Sombra by nerfing her into the ground in this patch though haha.
Half the roster seems to just shake off the sticky bomb.  All the flanking characters Mcree was good at countering (and seemed like his purpose) now have the ability to just avoid it.

It also seems like the tracking on it fluctuates patch to patch.  There was a patch where it basically seemed to not seek at all, and one where it was super easy to land.  Overall I think the balance on that part isn't terrible right now, but for a replacement of the flashbang it *should* be easy to land.

I have like a 70% attach rate or something and I don't do terrible with him overall, but the I hate the sticky bomb.  It also just feels bad.
Flash bang was really reliable tool that gived cassidy flexibility but the new nade is weird - sometimes it sticks instantly sometimes it almost passes through someone and when you hit it it doesnt feel nice like fb into headshot.
Wait, she can’t out heal winston now? Are there numbers for that?
    Mercy does 55 healing/sec while Winston does 60 damage/sec
        That's not taking into account the fact that he has to reload and she doesn't. With his reload he does 44.7dps so she does actually out heal his damage if the person Winston jumps on can survive long enough for him to need to reload, which they should because they'll be getting healed by mercy the whole time.
            He did the ~~monster~~ Mercy math.
            But he can hit multiple targets other than mercy
                But that also means Winston is closeup with multiple targets, who would all be actively shooting him too. Winston ain't gonna stay around for long if he gets shot to low hp quickly
            If Winston spams melee it does the same dps as holding lmb but greatly extends his effective mag size.
        It is funny that the healer with a wand specifically to heal has less healing per second than kiriko, ana, and moira.
            She can heal through shields, through walls temporarily, and has zero resource management.
        That seems fair. 5 damage per second. If you can't kill that Winston in 40 seconds, then that's kinda deserved.
    its actually been many years since shes been able to. Truly a shell of her former self
They ruined my girl again and again
    For a while it felt like the dev team had a personal vendetta against her for sure
    The team rezz was stupid but nerfing her again and again was unnecessary
        People weren't here for the moth meta that lasted over a year, and it shows.
            I was there Juan, I remember the screams... Keep Mercy like she is now, I never want to go back to that.
            Yeah, the only people who enjoyed that were mercy players. Her mobility is crazy now… she is fine.
                Truth! I love the new mobility, at least feels like you can do more now.
That team Rez was such a threat! Most exciting bullshit ever.
    It felt godly to pull off too. I'm not great at shooters but I always felt so damn good after a team rez.
        Felt even better as a Widow to ping Mercys head right as she tries to ult
            HEROES NEVER--- \*GAHLPH*
        Too many mercy players sacrificing their whole team just for a potg clip. Now everyone's out of position ready to get farmed again..  


I swear, they strongly refused to 'tempo res' the two teammates that got picked in the backline, giving you an actual chance to win the fight.. Nope, always that cheesy bs where they stop healing, your whole team dies (the enemy's not gonna bother using ults lol why would they when they can use attrition)...
    The amount of hype that would happen on my team when our mercy did a team Rez after we lost the team fight with like 20 seconds on the clock at the last point on a payload map.

But on the flip side, goddamn that was some rage quit level anger when the enemy mercy would pull that off against us
To be fair Winston's Tesla requires reload so you can essentially heal through a full cycle (I think?)
    He also has some of the lowest dps, if I recall correctly.
I stopped caring at some point... I'm more annoyed with them constantly changing her movement over the years ruining mercy boxing customs balance :(
Nah cause it takes no aim at all, the supports who have to shoot should always heal more than her
Yeah I saw that thumbnail and was like "oh boy somebody has rose colored glasses on for Mercy rez." The levels of "bad for the game" reached even Overwatch League, where pro Mercy's, getting paid to play the game, would sit around a corner not healing while their team would all-in, try to bait as many enemy ults as they could, and die so that mercy could rez them. The most boring, infuriating shit to not only play against, but even watch.
    I'd argue the goat meta was the worst thing to watch ever, but other than that I agree 100%.
        I enjoyed watching Goats as it felt more like watching professional sports instead of the standard poggers popping off shooter esports usually is.
And the blaster being awesome. I got so many battle mercy kills during 1.0
She's so unfun to play now, useless ulti and wow you can place tp 20 feet
I have a friend who wants to have scatter, storm and sonic arrow all together. And I don’t want to imagine that hell
    your friend and I would get along...
        Brig, but move her to the tank role
    What if they all shared a cooldown?
        What if they were all combined into one attack?
            Just sounds broken. Having them all be on the same cooldown and some sort of rotating arrow system would at least somewhat keep it balanced.
                Or they could all be combined into one attack. That would be fun.
                    Sonic-scatter-storm! Sounds like the type of attack an anime character would pull out lol.
                    Shoots scatter arrows at the speed and quantity of storm arrows, all the while each piece from the scatter marking with the same area a sonic arrow does
        I think that could be cool but would it be on rotation or something along those lines
            Maybe it's a swap arrow button and you'd have to rotate through them.
    Put them all on one arrow. For science.
    Storm arrow just sucks. I’d do so much more with just scatter arrows alone. Don’t even give me regular arrow shots or sonic. I can only use scatter and that’s it. I’ll still be an asset to the team when I just dive onto the tank whenever it’s off cooldown lol
Scatter was the only counter for tracer. Loved shooting the floor beneath her.
Plz scatter arrow was a blast
The only problem with scatter really was the one shot the tank by shooting them in the foot thing. If they remove that might be fun to have scatter back.
Scatter was the only reason I was good with hanzo lol
It's a shame I had to come this far down to find hanzo :( old scatter might have been busted but I wish they would have tried to tune it down first before just making hanzo hitscan for 5 shots, very boring imo. 

Headshot tank into scatter at their toes was probably a little op tho.
Other than her damage being higher, what was different in her original state? I do agree she should get her damage back (at least halfway between what it is now and what it is), though.
    Pulse Bomb had a slightly larger radius and did 400 damage.
        Was also able to recall outta grav IIRC.
            Back then all kinds of movement effects could get you out of grav, except Rein charge.
    Yeah but that 30% damage reduction really impacts how she is played and I personally had to re learn her
        Agreed, feel like she could really use that damage back.
    She has a 4 second blink cooldown now too lol
They gave her ult to Cassidy as a cooldown ability :(
    Seriously his ability is just her ult om steroids. It also has a way easier stick rate. You can miss by 3 feet and it will track on it's own. 10s cool down makes it completely outclass her pulse bomb. 

She needs to be a tank buster again.
I feel like they should have kept Orisa's kit, but then made a new hero with Orisa's new kit. 

Orisa was a great pokey tank. There aren't many pokey tanks anymore.
    JQ pokes. With an axe!

And Sigma balls.
        I'm always surprised when I fight against a sigma and they're not spamming balls 24/7.

My balls are getting tossed onto everyone all day every day when I hop on him. It's effectively constant, sustained damage that has no downfall to our team unless there's a Zarya.
I’m fine with new Orisa because I love the spear, but yeah she should have her old ult back instead of having the worst one in the game
    It's so hard to get a kill with that ult, the people that you suck in just run out or use a movement ability to escape before it gets to charge enough to kill most damages
        Dva has the same issue. It's a zoning ult and it's fine. It should just be a bit bigger to actually effectively zone.
        I think it'd be better if it had an active tractor effect, like a weaker version of Zarya's ult. It's best suited right now to basically herding the enemy team together and bursting them and I'd rather they lean into that identity than try and balance another burst-kill ult
    I assume the ult was changed because of how well it would have synergized with kiriko’s ult.
Old Orisa was very boring to me too tho
    I didn't think so. Had potential to kill targets, a live lord, grab was useful for grabbing heals trying to run in the back lines, and the shiled was very nice for pushing forward. I liked having a shield on a CD than having to wait on a recharge. I didn't play Reinhardt for that reason.
Same, my old friend
Old orisa was a bland character. Only cool thing she had, that required some mastery, was grav. Other than that you essentially watch the game unfold around you with little to no potential to make a huge difference until ult. Even then, you aren't really "doing" anything.
Best comment I've seen so far
You would oneshot a tank straight up with scatter arrow. This isn't a joke and it was really easy to do
scatter was overly broken, it really doesn’t need to come back ever.
    I always felt scatter was too high reward and low risk. If you’re going to fire it at my feet in the same tiny hallway/room as yourself, those arrows better damage you too. I’ve had instances of playing Hanzo myself and shooting scatter into a spawn gateway and one shotting people that couldn’t even see me.
    I loved it but yeah it made it super easy to one shot people. Unless they brought it back and changed it so it doesn't scatter if it hits the ground first, but then it'd rarely be used so it wouldn't be worth it.
        you could oneshot tanks. Fucking tanks. You didn't even have to see them.
I just got back to playing after almost 2 years. Did they nerf her pistol? I used to get so many kills with it. Now it feels like it flings spongey nerf balls.
    Hmm, I’m not sure.
Any hero v 1.0 when they were released was my intended question.
Yes. Let me triple jump and ledge boost. Other heroes get autism aim and I still get no reg slashes 6 years later.
I also think her lore matched her old kit better.
I kind of miss Reaper picking up the Souls of the dead.
I miss freezing people and waving at them as I shoot an ice shard through their head :(
    Or using her "I got you something!" voiceline.
I miss my Mei.
But then how will the poor flanker dps characters get free kills on Zenyatta? /s
    Low-key Zenyatta is great at killing flankers if you've got average or better aim.
        Yeah he's got great damage output; he's just real squishy.
        Great at lower ranks. He gets farmed higher up.
            He's still played at GM, and flankers are far more cautious around a Zen at GM than at low ranks I'd say.  In GM a flanker has to catch Zen by surprise or it's a really risky engage.
The brig is ridiculously bad right now lol. They kinda disabled her without actually removing from the game. The amount of dps creep in the game makes her shield destroyed instantly and she has 200 health with hitbox that bigger than tanks. Genji destroys her wtf
    "I will be your shi- MY BARRIERS DOWN!"
    I think you’ve really hit the heart of the issue with DPS balance and that’s that changes that were made to counter certain metas are still in effect after the end of those metas.
        Exactly. So many overwatch 1 buffs and nerfs are completely meaningless now and result in characters being just not worth picking
    I've been climbing ranks with almost exclusively Brig, I think she's underrated in her current state I do miss being able to stun people out of ult tho
    Is she really? She feels quite good versus flankers with that 50 shield bash
        50 damage on a 5 second cooldown seems worse than her 35 damage mace.  Without the stun, I almost never use it unless Genji is deflecting.
            You should use it, with proper animation canceling you can do bash-attack-whip in a quick succession and burst someone for 150+ damage.
                I've definitely tried.  It was Brigitte's bread and butter in OW1.  But without the stun, Dash/Blink/Recall is too easy.
                    I mean, if you do the combo and they run away that's good enough, you don't need to kill the flanker.

Brig still counters Tracer/Genji pretty hard, I would like to have the stun back, but she still counters them.
As someone who played release Brig with a pocket Mercy, being able to 2v6 the entire enemy team, while fun to play if you weren't on the receiving end, was bad for the game.
OG brig almost killed this whole game lmfao. There is absolutely no reason a tank/support should have a 150 damage combo that is nearly impossible to miss lol
    It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make..

Jkjk she was busted originally I'd be happy if the repair packs gave armor again
        The immediate post-nerf Brig just before the repair pack nerf was my fav Brig.
    She literally still has a 155 damage combo right now. Bash+m1+whipshot is an easy 155 damage
you mean with her primary fire, right?
    Yes, mei just feels bad to play in ow2 because you just feel like a sym turret at close range, even if the freeze was just half a second with her primary i would like that much more than what she can currently* do

*currently meaning the last time she was available to play
Definitely Mei.  Taking away ice girl's freeze was such a stupid decision.  Literally took away her defining trait.  She's all about ice and cold and her signature move was freezing people.
Best answer, and I don't even think is was that long ago? 

The best memories I have of this game are slowly freezing someone, knowing their rage bar is building, then staring them DEAD IN THE EYES as I headshot their ass. 

SORRY, sorry, sorry...
Her launch Ult would be a lot worse.
It was a small circle originally and it didn’t go through barriers. (That was a global change for projectile ults so I guess it’s arguable if that would carry over.)

I would love for her old ice particle effects to come back on Cryo and Wall though, what happened to them?
I think it’s way better with the increased damage. It just melts people now. (Went from 55/s to 100/s)
    It's not about the DPS... It's about sending a message.

That moment of terror as a frozen tracer knows an icicle is about to pass through their brain.
        oh man... i miss this.. and gettin raged on after that in all chat :D
Look, it doesn't have to be freeze, but what she does now is just nonsense.  Her left click is pure dead weight 90% of the time.  The only time to use it is when other characters use projectile-countering abilities.  Otherwise, it does way less damage than a right click headshot, without the upside it had before.

So you lose the 1v1 against almost any competent hero.  That means her Ice Block doesn't really work either, because instead of waking up and winning the duel, you just give the enemy time for support to arrive so that you lose even harder.  Mei has no offensive pressure when she loses to almost everyone, and Ice Block doesn't change that.

So her two useful abilities are right click and Wall.  That is not a hero, that's an early alpha sketch of a hero.  In OW1 her abilities actually had synergy with each other, now she's a wall-bot version of Cassidy.

Please.  I just want to play my favorite dps.  Make her kit make sense again.  She's only fun to play in Bronze lobbies where her left click is actually useful.
i think the whole idea behind her design was basically 'what if Reinhardt was smaller and a support?'. moving her to the tanks would be kinda pointless if Reinhardt is already there.
    imo she also fills a really important niche as a pseudo off tank right now to help smooth out comps with weak frontlines like JQ and Hammond
        Except she doesn't feel tanky at all and dies almost instantly and kinda sucks with supporting too
            Her whole kit is annoying to play behind. Brig players are always saying "just stand in the back and use your whip shot to keep inspire up" but that isn't what anyone wants to do when they pick Brig. They want to come in behind the shield, get close, and start swinging next to their tank. That's what it looks like she should be able to do, that's what it feels like her kit is for, but she's made of paper so you can't do it. Instead I'm standing around waiting for whip and heal packs to come off cooldown and feeling stupid 60% of the round for not picking Lucio.

If they were going to remove her stun, they should have made some changes to help her sustain better. Brig could really benefit from a Torb-like self buff cooldown to power her up in short bursts so she can engage, close distance, jump into the fray or survive longer- but not all the time. Shield bash is completely worthless now so they should really look into replacing it with literally anything more useful than moving forward slightly faster. The armored, shielded support hero should not be easier to kill than Kiriko and Moira. Her whole thing should be that she is hard to kill, but I'm actually relieved playing DPS when I see her; *thank god she isn't one of the tough supports to take out.*
                Not to mention that she doesn't have armor or enough to give a damn. That and Armor feels kinda bad since its **slightly** less damage taken. Which means nothing against high damage characters like McCree, Echo, Hanzo for examples.

Theres only one character she vibes well with and i rarely see Rein. Not to mention she has no stun. She has Shield Bash for mobility and damage and her Whip which just displaces and damages. Thats it.


Her Ult is really good afaik but if thats ALL shes useful for.. Then whats the point in playing her otherwise?
            She needs to play at melee range to be effective but can be deleted almost instantly by most DPS. It's not great.

I still do fine with her but I *really* need to be on my game to not instantly die if I want to accomplish anything.
                Thats the issue. Getting into Melee range. Without her ult or a Rein thats almost impossible it feels. That and her one ability PUSHES enemies away. Which might be useful for keeping the other support alive (until they just dash or keep holding W) but its not helpful for her to stay in melee range.
            To me she's basically an ult bot right now, her ult absolutely helps your frontline but yeah she seems to be pretty shit without it
    Yeah, she was supposed to be a Tank-Support hybrid.  I still think they could have kept that aspect of the character without keeping her as OP as she was.
But I love bruiser healer :(
    Since we have Tanky tanks, and dpsy tanks, I would not be too reluctant to have a healery tank.

She would do great. Same with a slightly original Mei.
        Mei as a tank would be much better than brig. Mainly because support roster is so small rn and also because mei originally had cc which is something a tank should have. On top of her ice form basically being a broken version of roadhogs breather.
            In HotS they made Mei a tank with a lot of mobility and slows/stuns, so I could see this being transitioned pretty seamlessly
    Bruiser healer best healer
I feel like tanks need to be bigger then Doom, Queen and Brig. Only reason I like Hogs are because I can actually let me take hits for me by using them as cover
    I mean, Doom is bigger than Zarya is
        But Zarya has bubbles making her bigger, and Doom can only protect himself. People want to shoot Zarya first if they see she isn't bubbled, which makes her a higher target then Doom.
            > Doom can only protect himself

Can he really though? :(
Yeah, I miss Brig's stun.
    That stun came in clutch especially with a reaper ult coming.
    [deleted]
        And Orisa can harpoon to cancel an ult. As can Doomfist. And Reinhardt.

It doesn't have to be a full stun that goes on for seconds, but at least ult-cancelling would be consistent with all other heroes. And make her much more satisfying to play.
Disagree on tank role, just restore her to a support who can actually fight back and create some space. Playing support in OW2 feels very vulnerable.
    It’s why I default to Moira so much, she can duel and has a great escape. Also really like Kiriko since she has solid mobility and an oh fuck escape button, conditional on nearby teammates of course
I was so upset with her nerfs. I loved off-tank brig
This game needs off tanks now that the tank role is limited to one, she doesn't need to be a tank.
just embrace the bruiser nature and buff her damage capabilities AND refresh her dash after she gets an elimination. This way, you get rewarded for dashing out into danger smartly (because you gotta get the elim or you die) and get a chance to move into safety again. This would also synergize with her general kit as you gotta be close to proc Inspire
That take is as hot as the sun and I respect you threw it out there even if I completely disagree. Though I wish she got the stun on her shield back. Would make her a nice peel support as right now she sucks.
Yeah, those old hog hooks I used to land were truly bonkers. Hook was 6sec and each shot did 50% more damage (but was slower). Although in a single tank meta losing the movement and DR on take a breather would probably blow
    [I'll just leave this legendary video over here ](https://youtu.be/8FiVBqP-XPQ)
        Thank you for this, you never know what you didn't know you needed
Nah his cross-map, bend-round-corner hooks were too insane
Oh hell no, extradimensional hooks were **not** okay back then, and they're **not** ok now
Amen
    Amen
        Amen
Yeah his heat seaking fucking bomb is way more annoying than his stun ever was
    And the stun grenade also could be used defensively to escape. I found it a lot more fun than just another version of a bomb.
        And at least you had to land your shots afterwards, not you just stick someone, say your shiteating voice line, and watch em blow up
            Agreed. I feel the characters are getting too close to each other in terms of powers.  Soon they’ll all have a shot, a grenade, and an escape power.
I miss abusing the maps geometry
    I miss the fact that no hero in any game existed as a combo fighter like doom did, and they took that away from us. it's just an itch that can't be scratched now.
Brig and Mei would like a word with you
Brig?
Most things here are low effort, but it’s super easy to get this sub riled up, so they get a lot of interaction.
I'd say it promotes discussion, I like reading through these
Ow2 seems to be low effort release. So why  not.
[deleted]
;)
Honestly they should have made bastion the tank and not doomfist without his heal he’s a big target
    Bastion’s Movement Speed and HP already have more in common with the Tanks than the DPS anyway, might as well go all the way with it.

Hell, I’d take MEI as a Tank over Doomfist - her smol model would be kinda hilarious in the role, but her kit is perfect for it.
Valkyrie is great, it's just very situational. That multi-healing/multi-boost has saved many a team fight for me just in the past few days.

Multi-rez was fun to pull off, but incredibly unfun to play against.

I love where Mercy is at right now. I'm a Mercy main and am having more fun with her than I have in a *long* time.
Yeah but per hero 

So you can choose to use old doom or torb if you want but also still using some of the newer designs of other characters
    Exactly
    Mmmm old hog, gonna hook you from from IRL to OW
That’s all I’d play. I know people will disagree but the first like 6-8 months of overwatch was so much fun but all the adjustments made for competitions made it feel like more of a chore. I’ve been having fun enough coming back for overwatch but damn I miss the original base gameplay
    No dude it was so broken. The thing that made it more fun back then weren’t the changes but the player base. Everyone was new and figuring overwatch out so it wasn’t as competitive or toxic
They need a classic mode with the original lineup and loadouts from release. 6v6 no role queue obviously as well. I would play the shit out of that.
This sounds like a different game entirely
    It's Team Fortress 2

        Blizzard doing as much as they possibly can to make the game dissimilar to TF2 nowadays
    It was a lot of fun before they changed everything to make it competitive.
        I even remember when I first started how I thought overwatch was great because it was less about competitive and more about countering your opponents bullshit move with your bullshit move. Needing to pick up scrap kinda made sense because you also had another character, Reaper, need to pick up souls of the defeated to heal. You also had the glorious. 

McCree's tank melting fan-the-hammer.

Full Team Rez.

Welcome to the Car Wash. 

Day 1 Brig. 

They scaled down all the bullshit to make it "balanced". I wish they had scaled UP the bullshit to make it balanced instead.
            Car wash lmao

Symmetra's probably changed more than anyone, no?
                [deleted]
                Sym 1.0 was support, giving shields.

Sym 2.0 was... that was the one that still had the teleporter ult and the latch beam, right?

Then Sym 3.0 had the floating forward shield and her beam no longer latched on and she had the shield generator? Or was that 2.0?

And now 4.0 has the barrier for her ult instead.
            Yeah I remember as it was happening people complained that fights started feeling more like pillow fights than anything else.

Then double shield happened, GOATS happened, turned out when you took away all these fun things, gameplay becomes slow and boring.

When I first started playing, the way I would sell my friends on the game is "It feels like nearly every character is OP" the gameplay was fun because there was so much bullshit you could do. It was fast-paced and each character felt unique.

They've really scaled back on uniqueness and a lot of characters feel identical to each other now.
                > Then double shield happened, GOATS happened, turned out when you took away all these fun things, gameplay becomes slow and boring.

That's the part I don't get in their balancing: Yeah sure, 3 tanks + 3 support was problematic. Sure.

But did they never consider that they only created this situation by **specifically** nerfing and/or reworking the heroes that could counteract this? And in turn, when they did forced 2/2/2, their premise for changing things in the first place evaporated, and they **should have** reset everyone to launch-balance **and start over**?

I hate how Blizzard has this morbid corporate mandate to never ever go backtrack something no matter how sensible it'd be.
                    You're completely right, it makes no sense.

At the same time, Blizzard has been pretty obviously catering hard to two groups. OWL viewers, and streamers.

Obviously getting more eyes on their product is a good thing for them, so I can see why they do it, but it means that all their balancing started getting around what looks impressive. When they realised the GOATS issue, they decided to force dive instead of just re-balancing everything. Every balancing decision they've made since GOATs makes sense when you consider the *forced dive* aspect, down to little things like DPS speed boost passive after kills.

And there's also that aspect of people screaming that any character that isn't pure DPS is "no skill" and should be nerfed into the ground. Mei, Junkrat, Sym, they've never been strong, they've never been part of an oppressive meta, but they're constantly seeing nerfs because of some idea of "skill" that people have in their heads. It makes games become really one-note and boring because then nobody picks the nerfed-to-hell interesting characters.

Edit: AH SEE? Completely unnecessary Junkrat nerf in this patch. They didn't even explain why they thought it was needed.
            Exactly. Overwatch wasn't fun to play *in spite* of the absurd abilities and ults and crazy team-wipe combos. It was fun **because** of them.

Competitive Overwatch is... just another team shooter, tbh. There have been lots of them. And with OW2 it even lost the bonus of being the arguably most-polished one, it's quite beta-y in nature now with lots of quirks and bugs.

But ah well, it's where the money is I suppose, and it's not like there ain't tons of games to play. Don't really need a team FPS right now anyways, plus me and my friends just play some DRG if we feel like shooting at things.

ROCK AND STONE!
            Fan the hammer was so comically broken it was wonderful. Everyone melted the minute you got close to him.

            It's adorable that people who say this seem to think the developers are the ones making the money and not their employers.
    Original Doomfist as well. He played like a fighting game character, his moves were very timing based, and combos into each other. Too bad they have such trouble balancing him.
    I had to think about Apex's loba
Man, the scrap mechanic was oddly entertaining and also the only way you could get Torb's to actually play the game. I used to have armor packs scattered around the point.
    if you played it right he was a pseudo healer
        I loved throwing the armor packs on a large arc to try and protect someone more forward.
            Not to mention you could just throw it on yourself in a pinch effectively giving torb a lot more hp and dueling power.
        Technically an armor pack would be better than healing the same amount because it provides damage resistance, right?
            Yup. Symmetra was a support originally for this very reason
    I remember we'd be playing on Hanamura, and they enemy would be at the choke point.

"Hey guys. I'm going on a scrap run!"

Run with my little dwarf legs, run back, armor everyone up then litter the point with armor packs.

Good times.
        I remember he still had the armor packs when Symm got the shield generator. Those were filthy times
            Whaaat? It was just a Tracer zipping around with ~~275~~ 300hp!
                And the shield was over the armor too. Some characters became pretty well unstoppable.
                    I actually stayed alive for more than a minute or two as Zenyatta!
                        Especially since the armor also went under his natural shields
                Actually, 300hp... Lol
            oh my fucking god i forgot about that absolute nonsense lmao. they were the best of times, they were the worst of times
    I miss torb/sym duos where you'd just have a gazzillion armour. It was stupid and fun.
He gave armor packs? Which ability did they replace it with? It sounds like he was funner to play back then
    He collected scraps from dead bodies which he could use to upgrade his turret and give armor packs to hit team. His ult was his current E but better because it also made his turret stronger. I don't remember if his gun had an alt-fire at the time though.
        > His ult was his current E but better because it also made his turret stronger

Ahh, the good old days when Torb POTG would be ulting in spawn.
            Or staring at Widow's ass while his turret did all the work.
            [Best Torb POTG ever](https://youtu.be/DiMJ-s4T16M)
                I laughed at the same time as the uploader, in a similar fashion.

Perfect.
                    Lol so did I because it's the funny bit
            I remember I would Ult, get really close to the Widow on my teams ass and just Hammer away for an easy POTG.
            Ults insta dies turret kills 5 players easy potg.
        He did have alt fire on his gun!
        wait does his e not buff his turret anymore? oh god ive been using it all wrong
    Torb used to be completely different. You couldn’t throw the turret, instead placing it directly in front of you. It started at level 1 and had to be upgraded using scrap metal he could pick up from dead players, which is also what he used to make armor packs. Overheat didn’t exist because his ultimate was basically a souped up version of the current ability: it gave a ton of health, faster attack and run speed, and temporarily upgraded your turret to level three
        He was a lot more similar to the Engineer from TF2
            Yes because OW was designed to be like TF2.
                Just new and exciting and *sexy*
    He really wasn't.

He used to play a lot like TF2 engineer. Build a turret, upgrade it to level 2, collect scraps around the battlefield to give a one-time armor bonus to teammates. Ult would buff you a bit and make your turret stronger.


You relied a lot more on your turret to do the work. It also meant that playing on any mode other than defense was difficult.

Current torb is more fun IMO. His niche isn't as unique but at least he's always playable.
        All they did was change him from a wrench engineer to a gunslinger engineer.
Killed 6 ppl!
    11 people. Kills everyone but the mercy. mercy mass rezzes whole team. Whole team dies again.
        The whole ground would be littered with scrap afterwards and you could give your team armor for days
Literally my first POTG ever from the beta.
You can still do this if you play Ashe
They really dismantled him and built a whole new character, didn't they?  They took away his armor packs and gave something similar to Brigitte.  They took away his Level 3 turret and turned it into Bob.
    I was about to say: Bob is just a level 3 Turret with a Rein Charge but no pin.
        Except Bob can be headshotted and CC’d
        I hate it so much.

I loved old Torb. He was the most fun and joy I ever had in the game. Then they took his level 3 turret away and instead gave us Bob, which is almost the same (I still think the level 3 turret killed a little faster than bob does).

And the reason they did it is because too many people hated having a Torb on their team. I know because maining Torb got me banned in 4 seasons. People thought you were throwing when you picked him, especially on attack. I still had a 67% win rate on Torb, even considering that I lost many MANY games due to throwers and griefers that gave up on winning the moment they saw the Torb OTP on their team.

Now we have Ashe, who can win a fight by throwing Bob on a strategic location. I already did the same with Torb back in the day, although with Torb you needed to be a bit smarter about it. Do it at the right moment, when the enemy team was distracted. Pop Molten Core, then put the level 1 turret down and start hammering with increased speed while using your beefed-up body to block anyone trying to shoot your turret while you upgrade it. It worked almost every time, and once the level 3 turret was active, it absolutely MELTED anyone that tried to stay on point, usually resulted in an easy win.
What did the old version of his ult do?
    What overdrive(?) does currently just buffed a bunch and also temporarily upgraded his turret to shoot faster and fire rockets
        Lmao he was if the Engineer and Heimerdinger had a baby.
            yeah that was the joke of him when he was like that
            except you had to make sure your turret was already level 2 so you had to either have it prepared and hope it didnt get destroyed or throw it down and whack it with your hammer for a few seconds. It was not very good lol
                You also couldn't throw it, you had to place it
                You hammered super fast in your ult. You could place, activate and hit for less than a second
    His old ult did everything Overload did but better. It lasted longer, and his turret upgraded to level 3, giving it more damage and rocket launchers. 
When they reworked him, they moved that ult to his E ability, removing the armor packs and level 3 turret. The lava ult he has today was completely new. I just wish he kept his level 3 turret :(

Putting Overwatchs victory in the omnicompetent crisis in that context makes it all the more impressive when you consider it was litterly just a group of 5-6 people
I just want my minigun headshots back man, I miss gunning down a charging rein T_T
Let's just full send it and give him his turret form shield back too
Turret mode had a personal shield
    also they could not turn around 360 though (idr the exact angle) and their turret form could headshot. there's more that I'm having trouble remembering tho
Oh wow! I had forgotten about them!
    It's funny because I stopped OW1 before that patch and came back like "where's the orbs?" He's honestly much stronger now being able to heal without a kill.
What? What sound are you talking about?
    On bastion when you use the null sector skin his ultimate sound effect is completely different compared to the default back in OW1 but now in OW2 it doesnt have that unique line anymore
        Gonna be an upcoming mythic skin feature
            That would be absolutely horrible and somewhat expected
        Oh...
            Its a shame because it sounded so cool and menacing when you heard it
                His ult would be so good without the amounts of shield we had back then... I want it back!!!
                    Tank config is so much better than this one it doesnt leave you open like that aswell
                        I would be happy if arty config was like his old turret with the big cannon instead
                All Null Sector intimidation sound effects are so well done, be it in the regular game, Archives, or cinematics.
Same I was so disappointed when my favorite skin didn't do the "DUN DUN DUUUUUU" sound...now I just run the omnic crisis skim
    Same even though i have many legendaries and the lego skin i just cant take it off
        Wish I had lego skin limited skins stink
Thank goodness I’m not the only one lol, I would definitely use that skin if it had the sound
damm that sucks, didn't even noticed
Yeah it sucks.
Its fun to rocket jump into positions with espeically since u can get really high if u jump on two of them
    Nade jumping around a corner and turning into tank mode in mid-air is the funniest shit
The grenade definitely looks generic but I've been playing a ton of Bastion and that thing wrecks people if you can get good at placing it. His gun would be kind of meh without it, but combined with a few well placed shots Bastion is a pretty good duelist. You can also shoot the grenade while turreting, which is powerful and I think not everyone knows that. Definitely helps shred a tank faster.

The ult is another story. That thing is buns. On Discord people keep defending it for the two or three things it can accomplish, but overall if I feel more powerful as my normal self than I do with my ult, it's a shitty ult. I'd rather be regular Bastion and actually secure kills than ulting and briefly making the enemy team move a little bit lol.

I did pair my ult with Orisa's the other day, and the two shitty ults actually combined into one good one.
    Bastion's ult is trash but I'm gonna have to defend Orisa's. At first I also thought it was kinda bad, until I realized it's basically just another Grav. It requires some coordination but get a good pull and you can pretty much guarantee a wipe.
I remember talking a lot about this years ago, Bastion had no burst damage to use vs DPS in recon form making him unfavorable since DPS are expected to duel other DPS in Overwatch. The cruddy accuracy on the SMG meant a low skill ceiling for skilled players that would help make up for the lack of burst damage abilities  This meant that he lost duels regularly, especially with the cruddy accuracy his SMG had vs small DPS hitboxes and was generally considered a detriment to the team for many players.

They did what we asked years ago, buffed SMG accuracy (it's a robot why is it suffering from recoil) and gave him some burst damage to use in duels. What we didn't ask for was to lose tank form to send 3 chinese knockoff doomfist ults.
Probably would make him too similar to Soldier 76, they opted for Bastion to be an almost purely offensive tank, whereas S76 is more balanced with less health and a heal and more mobility.

>It seems out of place in his kit and just lazy,

Blizzard 2.0, self heal was way better and in line with the character. The turret change, okay fair. Self heal though was the shit
The problem with Bastion now is that he's a complete glass cannon and the new mobility isn't worth the tradeoff of the time limit on his turret mode. Seems incredibly stupid to gut his entire kit besides his primary. I definitely didn't main him before the changes for his personality
Bastion's self heal was one thing I could accept being removed for game design reasons. It made a good bastion really hard to uproot when he's facing a mediocre team, all without requiring a support to babysit him. Now he can be worn down and requires more team coordination to reach full potential.
1000 iq play to delete OW1 and then re-release it as "classic" but requires you to buy it as dlc for OW2
    Would totally fall for that myself.
They are totally going to do this within the next 10 years. It’s free money for blizzard and we all know we would buy it. But it would have to be the original first patch. Broken roadhog hook and everything.
There's a good chance. A lot of people are complaining about the changes and how you can't play the first title anymore. Though they probably won't do it anytime soon, cuz it would undermine OW2's business; but, it really would be nice to just make everyone happy.
#AHM GETTING THE FEELING THEY 'AVE A SHIELD GENERATOR
    a  *shＩＩＩＩＩＩＩeld*  generator
I’m glad that other people experienced that, too. Always feels like a fever dream.
[deleted]
    Yes, so much fun
    Genji players get no sympathy. They reap what they sow. Same goes for widow players. They deserve the suffering.
    Yes. Loved that. Fuck Genji.
God OG Sym was sooo clunky. Had to walk up to a wall to place a turret that had like 2 health, stupidly long cooldowns and she only had 3. TP was nice but limited uses made it ass and giving 25 shields was cool but useless unless you had a Zen on your team and he was only unkillable if you had a Torb with armor packs on him as well. I do wish she still had photon barrier even though that was Sym 2.0
    Sym was literally picked in OG OW because you could give Tracer and Genji rechargeable 25hp shield - which was _insane_ (and why you don't see shield on dive characters).
        > Sym was literally picked in OG OW because you could give Tracer and Genji rechargeable 25hp shield

She was super strong during the betas because shields gave something like 50 to 75HP. The 25HP on live was essentially worthless and she was rarely picked outside of 2CP first points.
            I always thought her amount of shield giving should be a percentage of the hero's HP.

25 shields on 150 HP Tracer? Fine.  600HP Roadhog would get 150 shields.
    I have rocked all symmetra reworks. I think the current one is actually the most boring.
    OG Teleporter was basically Mercy's resurrect but worse because you still had to wait for people to respawn to use the teleport from spawn.
    Sym actually originally had **SIX** turrets and they slowed and damaged.
That beam though..
    I just miss putting all my turrets on a basketball and then throwing it at enemies.
        I miss the ol' carwash
            The straight to the dome car wash
            The super carwash on Echienwald before they added the alternate path was always fun. One path, 18 turrets.
300 hp tracer still give me nightmares
Also brig armor not expiring. Those were the days
    And it stacked up to 150, and Repair Pack could grant another 75 armor. With a Brig, Sym, and Torb, you could have a full team with an additional 225 armor under 75 regenerating shield HP, and one member of the team could have a total of 300 extra armor for a couple of seconds.
You could 2 shot most tanks, I miss just disappearing roadhogs
Lucio speedboost + Sym was the best
But now you can also have a kiriko speed and attack speed boosts at the same time :')
I wasn’t a huge fan of the lock on but I liked the unique problem solving her kit required. Teleporter had a balance of too close and too far. Shield Gen required you to decide between it and a teleporter, and her turrets needed to be either focused for damage or spread out for detection
    Damn I forgot about the shield gen, I reckon that would get some ay in the current game too
I loved the lock on laser too, but I think Blizzard made the right call taking it out. It was ridiculously broken once you got it ramped up all the way.
    It also took 6 seconds to ramp up to full which is a way longer TTK than any other DPS playing optimally.  Having a character that didn’t need to aim was a really
important accessibility feature for a lot of people who have various physical conditions that make aiming difficult or impossible, and they removed it because Genji mains didn’t know how to swift strike away instead of spamming deflect.
        It definitely took a bit to ramp up, but if you could get it on a tank like [D.va](https://D.va) or Roadhog and then move to healers and dps, you could wipe out two or three players super fast. Honestly, lock on Symmetra was my main and the game has never been quite as fun for me since they reworked her.
            She was my first golden gun, now I wish they’re refunded the gun price because I never play her.

6 turret microwaves defending right side for Temple of Anubis…so fun.
        Moira has a lock on
            I found it the other day, she actually doesn't have a lock on. Every character has a custom hitbox just for her alt fire that is a round cylinder slightly larger than their normal hit box. I can probably find the vid if you want a source
                I think it’s the same as the hitbox for Whip Shot and Chain Hook. If so, it’s only bigger for small characters. The flail and hook can clip through tank models and still miss.
            It's not a lock-on, just a generous hitbox. The only true lock on left in the game afaicr is Mercy's beam.
            No she doesn't. It is broken when someone else walks in front. Sym you'd literally lock onto a target and could turn around and look the other way
That last one is still doable if you have a team willing to pay attention, and at will too now
    But you could port your team from spawn to some inconspicuous spot behind the point 😂
        SO many won games because of a well placed Teleporter
Sym changes were made to appease non-sym players.
DPS doomfist was a better tank than tank doomfist
    Wow, that's...Frustratingly accurate from what I've been seeing in recent game play. Nice summation, it really does feel that way.

Or--at the very least--DPS doomfist was "tankier" than tank doomfist, if that makes sense.
        Better movility meaned better survivability. The uppercut was much better than the powerblock.
        this is objectively wrong unfortunately. Being a diamond doom main for both dps and tank. Dps doom was EXTREMELY squishy. Despite 250 health + shields, you would be surprised how many times i had been 1shotted DURING slam uppercut combo, or ccd. (Storm arrow, widow, 2tapped by cass, ashe, hog hook, and this isnt including cc) Peeking while punching is a “snipe me please” button on dpsfist. I dont deny doom not being as tanky as the other tanks. But dps doom was never tanky.
            Yep. What made DPS tankier was the two other tanks
    I saw a good DF last night for the first time in weeks. He solo carried the other team by picking me (Zen) before every team fight, then picking our other healer, then getting his team to push afterwards. And our tank just could not figure out that it was intentional, so any time our tank would start pushing he'd jump out from some random corner and wail on us in the backline while our tank had no idea we were even in trouble. 

He finished with like 43 elims and 12 deaths, it was fucking nuts. Every other DF I've ever seen since the switch to OW2 has been pure cheeks.
        This would only happen at top 500 doom otp vs bunch of silvers scenario. Hero is just too garbage
    it feels like he's too weak to do damage and is not any good at doing his job as a tank... he's just... bad :/
only doomfist players miss DPS doomfist.

Everyone else is okay with not getting 1 hit and 1 shot combo'd
    No troll but what’s the difference with a widow 1 shotting you? Honestly agree with you but also have the same feelings with widow. It’s simply zero fun to get 1 hit and not be able to do anything about it.
        I hate widow too, the main difference tho, is that DPS Doomfist could get in and out easily.

Widow on the other hand has to say somewhat stationary and cannot escape as easily if you get in her face.
            You would be right, however u forget how much cc in the game there was making it hard for an average doomfist to perform really good
        Being able to click on a head is much more respected than a one-shot that supposedly doesn't need any skill to pull off... 

Except anyone who's actually played dps doom knows just how tough it was to get in to get a single kill, nevermind the whole time it'd take to set up, get out and reset. It was never unfair, people just hated him to an extreme degree even when a good Hanzo/Widow/Cass would always make me 10x as miserable as a good doom.
        Widow's is at least a skillshot and you can at least try to play behind cover. Doomfist just takes a flank route, slams in your general direction, combos you to death, shakes off all non-stun peel attempts with the hp he got for smashing you then peaces out with his remaining cooldowns.
        Honestly I felt like widow is worse. Every role had Doom counters, while a good widow meant GG unless your tank knew what to do or you had a better Widow/Hanzo.
    As an Ana/Bap main, DPS Doom was perfectly fine imo. He was lots of fun to play as, and playing against him wasn’t too bad. His large hitbox made him easy to hit with a sleep dart, and because his punch was slow to charge up and went in a straight line, Bap could just jump over it. Sure he could 1-combo squishies, but Widow can also do that while being exposed to far less danger. And don’t even get me started on how they added Sojourn right after making Doom absolute garbage because of his ability to one-combo.
    >Everyone else is okay with not getting 1 hit and 1 shot combo'd

You mean getting punched and then sliding off a wall because the doomfist didn't hit you perfectly perpendicular to it.  Something they still haven't fixed along with Rein's charge basically flipping a coin to decide if it will grab the person it hits knock them out of the way.
    It genuinely blows my mind that people will shit on old doom’s kit, but still think junkrat is just fine or at the very least, *fine enough* to not complain about on Reddit. 

At least with doom you could sleep him or hack him and be fine or get away. Granted, I was only ever diamond, so take that with a grain of salt, but I didn’t really mind doom as much as the rest of you, especially after the infamous stealth nerf he got.
To be fair you are comparing years of complaints to months of complaints, so yes there will be more incidents to list.
    > To be fair you are comparing years of complaints to months of complaints, so yes there will be more incidents to list.

Month 1 of OW had FTH mccree, hook 1.0, big res, quick scope widow, scatter, 8s dragonblade. Probably a couple others I'm not remembering. That's just mentioning the heroes that were fairly strong. There was also a large part of the roster that was just horrible. Zen was probably the most obvious. 150HP made him essentially unplayable back when Widow could kill him with a bodyshot.
        Zen has been my main since the beta, I remember the pain, and I survived it and played around it. I wouldnt call it unplayable since I had a positive winrate on him but it sucked
And now we have Sojourn staying OP until 2028 when OW3 releases. Seems like mostly the same people to me
    You spelled Zarya wrong
        There are planned nerfs for Zarya. Sojourn remaining untouched is a new level of whatthefuckery
        they're at least nerfing zarya, they said they won't nerf sojourn
    Not even comparable.  Moth Mercy, Release Brig, GOATS, and Double Shield were far more egregious than anything in OW2.  And if you think waiting a few weeks for balance is bad, wait til you see how long it took those to be balanced....
The overwatch team have, as far as I know, no allegations against them. It was entirely other teams.
For real. They removed his stun because they wanted player agency, but replaced it with an ability which forces you to die, with almost no counterplay, if you're 130hp or lower? That's 1 cass bodyshot...
    Like weeeee now I get to run around for a bit before I die! Amazing! At least with the flashbang, there was a chance the Cassidy could be taken out by my team, or fuck up and miss. Once I've got that sticky grenade on, it feels bad just waiting to die.
Well objectively speaking, the sticky grenade is broken, as cassidy is one of the strongest characters right now if you can aim
Let the man shoot someone from further than 5 feet please
Now he just gets ran over by Orisas.
    Gets ran over by anyone. I'm relentlessly campaigning until these devs realize they can't really balance and at least 1-2 DPS need a true CC in their kit. 

Otherwise, you're just trading on death to spazzy flankers or spam characters. 

You also did way more damage saving the FTH and using a head shot after the stun so he was a skill shot character. FTH was actually best at shredding OOP tanks on CD and shields. 

He doesn't threaten a pharah, loses at range to any other low rate of fire accurate hitscan, loses at range and up close to sojourn, hardly beats a soldier and gets stomped by him past  at mid range, has no sustain, has the worst mobility option.

I guess they want him to be a close range tank buster? He's too weak to hurt a tracer or Genji these days.
    I played this game super intensely for a year from late 2016 onward, had some of the most fun with a game ever back then
    His design is never meant to bully Tanks at the first place.
So many characters have an ability that just negates the bomb, like wraith form, rewind, deflect etc. basically most the flank character’s which makes 1v1s with them really hard since that’s your main tool for those encounters. 

With the flash at least you had a chance to kill them now you just die when they get close to you.
There's not much reliable anti-dive at all anymore. It's on purpose.

No more Brig bash stun, no more 'cree stun, no more Sombra long-hack (to hack a Tracer and keep her from zipping away), there's a lot more I can't think of too.

And they gave DPS a speed boost after killing. They want characters like Tracer and Genji to have free reign in the backline. Screw the other heroes.

They're very intentionally buffing Dive because that's what is exciting to watch in OWL.

Then they got surprised they're not getting many people queue for healer to sit back and insta-die.

They rlly went "not you tho" to Sombra by nerfing her into the ground in this patch though haha.
Mercy does 55 healing/sec while Winston does 60 damage/sec
    That's not taking into account the fact that he has to reload and she doesn't. With his reload he does 44.7dps so she does actually out heal his damage if the person Winston jumps on can survive long enough for him to need to reload, which they should because they'll be getting healed by mercy the whole time.
        He did the ~~monster~~ Mercy math.
        But he can hit multiple targets other than mercy
            But that also means Winston is closeup with multiple targets, who would all be actively shooting him too. Winston ain't gonna stay around for long if he gets shot to low hp quickly
        If Winston spams melee it does the same dps as holding lmb but greatly extends his effective mag size.
    It is funny that the healer with a wand specifically to heal has less healing per second than kiriko, ana, and moira.
        She can heal through shields, through walls temporarily, and has zero resource management.
    That seems fair. 5 damage per second. If you can't kill that Winston in 40 seconds, then that's kinda deserved.
its actually been many years since shes been able to. Truly a shell of her former self
For a while it felt like the dev team had a personal vendetta against her for sure
The team rezz was stupid but nerfing her again and again was unnecessary
    People weren't here for the moth meta that lasted over a year, and it shows.
        I was there Juan, I remember the screams... Keep Mercy like she is now, I never want to go back to that.
        Yeah, the only people who enjoyed that were mercy players. Her mobility is crazy now… she is fine.
            Truth! I love the new mobility, at least feels like you can do more now.
It felt godly to pull off too. I'm not great at shooters but I always felt so damn good after a team rez.
    Felt even better as a Widow to ping Mercys head right as she tries to ult
        HEROES NEVER--- \*GAHLPH*
    Too many mercy players sacrificing their whole team just for a potg clip. Now everyone's out of position ready to get farmed again..  


I swear, they strongly refused to 'tempo res' the two teammates that got picked in the backline, giving you an actual chance to win the fight.. Nope, always that cheesy bs where they stop healing, your whole team dies (the enemy's not gonna bother using ults lol why would they when they can use attrition)...
The amount of hype that would happen on my team when our mercy did a team Rez after we lost the team fight with like 20 seconds on the clock at the last point on a payload map.

But on the flip side, goddamn that was some rage quit level anger when the enemy mercy would pull that off against us
He also has some of the lowest dps, if I recall correctly.
I'd argue the goat meta was the worst thing to watch ever, but other than that I agree 100%.
    I enjoyed watching Goats as it felt more like watching professional sports instead of the standard poggers popping off shooter esports usually is.
your friend and I would get along...
    Brig, but move her to the tank role
What if they all shared a cooldown?
    What if they were all combined into one attack?
        Just sounds broken. Having them all be on the same cooldown and some sort of rotating arrow system would at least somewhat keep it balanced.
            Or they could all be combined into one attack. That would be fun.
                Sonic-scatter-storm! Sounds like the type of attack an anime character would pull out lol.
                Shoots scatter arrows at the speed and quantity of storm arrows, all the while each piece from the scatter marking with the same area a sonic arrow does
    I think that could be cool but would it be on rotation or something along those lines
        Maybe it's a swap arrow button and you'd have to rotate through them.
Put them all on one arrow. For science.
Storm arrow just sucks. I’d do so much more with just scatter arrows alone. Don’t even give me regular arrow shots or sonic. I can only use scatter and that’s it. I’ll still be an asset to the team when I just dive onto the tank whenever it’s off cooldown lol
Pulse Bomb had a slightly larger radius and did 400 damage.
    Was also able to recall outta grav IIRC.
        Back then all kinds of movement effects could get you out of grav, except Rein charge.
Yeah but that 30% damage reduction really impacts how she is played and I personally had to re learn her
    Agreed, feel like she could really use that damage back.
She has a 4 second blink cooldown now too lol
Seriously his ability is just her ult om steroids. It also has a way easier stick rate. You can miss by 3 feet and it will track on it's own. 10s cool down makes it completely outclass her pulse bomb. 

She needs to be a tank buster again.
JQ pokes. With an axe!

And Sigma balls.
    I'm always surprised when I fight against a sigma and they're not spamming balls 24/7.

My balls are getting tossed onto everyone all day every day when I hop on him. It's effectively constant, sustained damage that has no downfall to our team unless there's a Zarya.
It's so hard to get a kill with that ult, the people that you suck in just run out or use a movement ability to escape before it gets to charge enough to kill most damages
    Dva has the same issue. It's a zoning ult and it's fine. It should just be a bit bigger to actually effectively zone.
    I think it'd be better if it had an active tractor effect, like a weaker version of Zarya's ult. It's best suited right now to basically herding the enemy team together and bursting them and I'd rather they lean into that identity than try and balance another burst-kill ult
I assume the ult was changed because of how well it would have synergized with kiriko’s ult.
I didn't think so. Had potential to kill targets, a live lord, grab was useful for grabbing heals trying to run in the back lines, and the shiled was very nice for pushing forward. I liked having a shield on a CD than having to wait on a recharge. I didn't play Reinhardt for that reason.
I always felt scatter was too high reward and low risk. If you’re going to fire it at my feet in the same tiny hallway/room as yourself, those arrows better damage you too. I’ve had instances of playing Hanzo myself and shooting scatter into a spawn gateway and one shotting people that couldn’t even see me.
I loved it but yeah it made it super easy to one shot people. Unless they brought it back and changed it so it doesn't scatter if it hits the ground first, but then it'd rarely be used so it wouldn't be worth it.
    you could oneshot tanks. Fucking tanks. You didn't even have to see them.
Hmm, I’m not sure.
Or using her "I got you something!" voiceline.
Low-key Zenyatta is great at killing flankers if you've got average or better aim.
    Yeah he's got great damage output; he's just real squishy.
    Great at lower ranks. He gets farmed higher up.
        He's still played at GM, and flankers are far more cautious around a Zen at GM than at low ranks I'd say.  In GM a flanker has to catch Zen by surprise or it's a really risky engage.
"I will be your shi- MY BARRIERS DOWN!"
I think you’ve really hit the heart of the issue with DPS balance and that’s that changes that were made to counter certain metas are still in effect after the end of those metas.
    Exactly. So many overwatch 1 buffs and nerfs are completely meaningless now and result in characters being just not worth picking
I've been climbing ranks with almost exclusively Brig, I think she's underrated in her current state I do miss being able to stun people out of ult tho
Is she really? She feels quite good versus flankers with that 50 shield bash
    50 damage on a 5 second cooldown seems worse than her 35 damage mace.  Without the stun, I almost never use it unless Genji is deflecting.
        You should use it, with proper animation canceling you can do bash-attack-whip in a quick succession and burst someone for 150+ damage.
            I've definitely tried.  It was Brigitte's bread and butter in OW1.  But without the stun, Dash/Blink/Recall is too easy.
                I mean, if you do the combo and they run away that's good enough, you don't need to kill the flanker.

Brig still counters Tracer/Genji pretty hard, I would like to have the stun back, but she still counters them.
It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make..

Jkjk she was busted originally I'd be happy if the repair packs gave armor again
    The immediate post-nerf Brig just before the repair pack nerf was my fav Brig.
She literally still has a 155 damage combo right now. Bash+m1+whipshot is an easy 155 damage
Yes, mei just feels bad to play in ow2 because you just feel like a sym turret at close range, even if the freeze was just half a second with her primary i would like that much more than what she can currently* do

*currently meaning the last time she was available to play
It's not about the DPS... It's about sending a message.

That moment of terror as a frozen tracer knows an icicle is about to pass through their brain.
    oh man... i miss this.. and gettin raged on after that in all chat :D
imo she also fills a really important niche as a pseudo off tank right now to help smooth out comps with weak frontlines like JQ and Hammond
    Except she doesn't feel tanky at all and dies almost instantly and kinda sucks with supporting too
        Her whole kit is annoying to play behind. Brig players are always saying "just stand in the back and use your whip shot to keep inspire up" but that isn't what anyone wants to do when they pick Brig. They want to come in behind the shield, get close, and start swinging next to their tank. That's what it looks like she should be able to do, that's what it feels like her kit is for, but she's made of paper so you can't do it. Instead I'm standing around waiting for whip and heal packs to come off cooldown and feeling stupid 60% of the round for not picking Lucio.

If they were going to remove her stun, they should have made some changes to help her sustain better. Brig could really benefit from a Torb-like self buff cooldown to power her up in short bursts so she can engage, close distance, jump into the fray or survive longer- but not all the time. Shield bash is completely worthless now so they should really look into replacing it with literally anything more useful than moving forward slightly faster. The armored, shielded support hero should not be easier to kill than Kiriko and Moira. Her whole thing should be that she is hard to kill, but I'm actually relieved playing DPS when I see her; *thank god she isn't one of the tough supports to take out.*
            Not to mention that she doesn't have armor or enough to give a damn. That and Armor feels kinda bad since its **slightly** less damage taken. Which means nothing against high damage characters like McCree, Echo, Hanzo for examples.

Theres only one character she vibes well with and i rarely see Rein. Not to mention she has no stun. She has Shield Bash for mobility and damage and her Whip which just displaces and damages. Thats it.


Her Ult is really good afaik but if thats ALL shes useful for.. Then whats the point in playing her otherwise?
        She needs to play at melee range to be effective but can be deleted almost instantly by most DPS. It's not great.

I still do fine with her but I *really* need to be on my game to not instantly die if I want to accomplish anything.
            Thats the issue. Getting into Melee range. Without her ult or a Rein thats almost impossible it feels. That and her one ability PUSHES enemies away. Which might be useful for keeping the other support alive (until they just dash or keep holding W) but its not helpful for her to stay in melee range.
        To me she's basically an ult bot right now, her ult absolutely helps your frontline but yeah she seems to be pretty shit without it
Yeah, she was supposed to be a Tank-Support hybrid.  I still think they could have kept that aspect of the character without keeping her as OP as she was.
Since we have Tanky tanks, and dpsy tanks, I would not be too reluctant to have a healery tank.

She would do great. Same with a slightly original Mei.
    Mei as a tank would be much better than brig. Mainly because support roster is so small rn and also because mei originally had cc which is something a tank should have. On top of her ice form basically being a broken version of roadhogs breather.
        In HotS they made Mei a tank with a lot of mobility and slows/stuns, so I could see this being transitioned pretty seamlessly
Bruiser healer best healer
I mean, Doom is bigger than Zarya is
    But Zarya has bubbles making her bigger, and Doom can only protect himself. People want to shoot Zarya first if they see she isn't bubbled, which makes her a higher target then Doom.
        > Doom can only protect himself

Can he really though? :(
That stun came in clutch especially with a reaper ult coming.
[deleted]
    And Orisa can harpoon to cancel an ult. As can Doomfist. And Reinhardt.

It doesn't have to be a full stun that goes on for seconds, but at least ult-cancelling would be consistent with all other heroes. And make her much more satisfying to play.
It’s why I default to Moira so much, she can duel and has a great escape. Also really like Kiriko since she has solid mobility and an oh fuck escape button, conditional on nearby teammates of course
[I'll just leave this legendary video over here ](https://youtu.be/8FiVBqP-XPQ)
    Thank you for this, you never know what you didn't know you needed
Amen
    Amen
And the stun grenade also could be used defensively to escape. I found it a lot more fun than just another version of a bomb.
    And at least you had to land your shots afterwards, not you just stick someone, say your shiteating voice line, and watch em blow up
        Agreed. I feel the characters are getting too close to each other in terms of powers.  Soon they’ll all have a shot, a grenade, and an escape power.
I miss the fact that no hero in any game existed as a combo fighter like doom did, and they took that away from us. it's just an itch that can't be scratched now.
Bastion’s Movement Speed and HP already have more in common with the Tanks than the DPS anyway, might as well go all the way with it.

Hell, I’d take MEI as a Tank over Doomfist - her smol model would be kinda hilarious in the role, but her kit is perfect for it.
Exactly
Mmmm old hog, gonna hook you from from IRL to OW
No dude it was so broken. The thing that made it more fun back then weren’t the changes but the player base. Everyone was new and figuring overwatch out so it wasn’t as competitive or toxic

    Blizzard doing as much as they possibly can to make the game dissimilar to TF2 nowadays
It was a lot of fun before they changed everything to make it competitive.
    I even remember when I first started how I thought overwatch was great because it was less about competitive and more about countering your opponents bullshit move with your bullshit move. Needing to pick up scrap kinda made sense because you also had another character, Reaper, need to pick up souls of the defeated to heal. You also had the glorious. 

McCree's tank melting fan-the-hammer.

Welcome to the Car Wash. 

Day 1 Brig. 

They scaled down all the bullshit to make it "balanced". I wish they had scaled UP the bullshit to make it balanced instead.
        Car wash lmao

Symmetra's probably changed more than anyone, no?
            [deleted]
            Sym 1.0 was support, giving shields.

Sym 2.0 was... that was the one that still had the teleporter ult and the latch beam, right?

Then Sym 3.0 had the floating forward shield and her beam no longer latched on and she had the shield generator? Or was that 2.0?

And now 4.0 has the barrier for her ult instead.
        Yeah I remember as it was happening people complained that fights started feeling more like pillow fights than anything else.

Then double shield happened, GOATS happened, turned out when you took away all these fun things, gameplay becomes slow and boring.

When I first started playing, the way I would sell my friends on the game is "It feels like nearly every character is OP" the gameplay was fun because there was so much bullshit you could do. It was fast-paced and each character felt unique.

They've really scaled back on uniqueness and a lot of characters feel identical to each other now.
            > Then double shield happened, GOATS happened, turned out when you took away all these fun things, gameplay becomes slow and boring.

That's the part I don't get in their balancing: Yeah sure, 3 tanks + 3 support was problematic. Sure.

But did they never consider that they only created this situation by **specifically** nerfing and/or reworking the heroes that could counteract this? And in turn, when they did forced 2/2/2, their premise for changing things in the first place evaporated, and they **should have** reset everyone to launch-balance **and start over**?

I hate how Blizzard has this morbid corporate mandate to never ever go backtrack something no matter how sensible it'd be.
                You're completely right, it makes no sense.

At the same time, Blizzard has been pretty obviously catering hard to two groups. OWL viewers, and streamers.

Obviously getting more eyes on their product is a good thing for them, so I can see why they do it, but it means that all their balancing started getting around what looks impressive. When they realised the GOATS issue, they decided to force dive instead of just re-balancing everything. Every balancing decision they've made since GOATs makes sense when you consider the *forced dive* aspect, down to little things like DPS speed boost passive after kills.

And there's also that aspect of people screaming that any character that isn't pure DPS is "no skill" and should be nerfed into the ground. Mei, Junkrat, Sym, they've never been strong, they've never been part of an oppressive meta, but they're constantly seeing nerfs because of some idea of "skill" that people have in their heads. It makes games become really one-note and boring because then nobody picks the nerfed-to-hell interesting characters.

Edit: AH SEE? Completely unnecessary Junkrat nerf in this patch. They didn't even explain why they thought it was needed.
        Exactly. Overwatch wasn't fun to play *in spite* of the absurd abilities and ults and crazy team-wipe combos. It was fun **because** of them.

Competitive Overwatch is... just another team shooter, tbh. There have been lots of them. And with OW2 it even lost the bonus of being the arguably most-polished one, it's quite beta-y in nature now with lots of quirks and bugs.

But ah well, it's where the money is I suppose, and it's not like there ain't tons of games to play. Don't really need a team FPS right now anyways, plus me and my friends just play some DRG if we feel like shooting at things.

ROCK AND STONE!
        Fan the hammer was so comically broken it was wonderful. Everyone melted the minute you got close to him.
    [deleted]
        It's adorable that people who say this seem to think the developers are the ones making the money and not their employers.
Original Doomfist as well. He played like a fighting game character, his moves were very timing based, and combos into each other. Too bad they have such trouble balancing him.
I had to think about Apex's loba
if you played it right he was a pseudo healer
    I loved throwing the armor packs on a large arc to try and protect someone more forward.
        Not to mention you could just throw it on yourself in a pinch effectively giving torb a lot more hp and dueling power.
    Technically an armor pack would be better than healing the same amount because it provides damage resistance, right?
        Yup. Symmetra was a support originally for this very reason
I remember we'd be playing on Hanamura, and they enemy would be at the choke point.

"Hey guys. I'm going on a scrap run!"

Run with my little dwarf legs, run back, armor everyone up then litter the point with armor packs.

Good times.
    I remember he still had the armor packs when Symm got the shield generator. Those were filthy times
        Whaaat? It was just a Tracer zipping around with ~~275~~ 300hp!
            And the shield was over the armor too. Some characters became pretty well unstoppable.
                I actually stayed alive for more than a minute or two as Zenyatta!
                    Especially since the armor also went under his natural shields
            Actually, 300hp... Lol
        oh my fucking god i forgot about that absolute nonsense lmao. they were the best of times, they were the worst of times
I miss torb/sym duos where you'd just have a gazzillion armour. It was stupid and fun.
He collected scraps from dead bodies which he could use to upgrade his turret and give armor packs to hit team. His ult was his current E but better because it also made his turret stronger. I don't remember if his gun had an alt-fire at the time though.
    > His ult was his current E but better because it also made his turret stronger

Ahh, the good old days when Torb POTG would be ulting in spawn.
        Or staring at Widow's ass while his turret did all the work.
        [Best Torb POTG ever](https://youtu.be/DiMJ-s4T16M)
            I laughed at the same time as the uploader, in a similar fashion.

Perfect.
                Lol so did I because it's the funny bit
        I remember I would Ult, get really close to the Widow on my teams ass and just Hammer away for an easy POTG.
        Ults insta dies turret kills 5 players easy potg.
    He did have alt fire on his gun!
    wait does his e not buff his turret anymore? oh god ive been using it all wrong
Torb used to be completely different. You couldn’t throw the turret, instead placing it directly in front of you. It started at level 1 and had to be upgraded using scrap metal he could pick up from dead players, which is also what he used to make armor packs. Overheat didn’t exist because his ultimate was basically a souped up version of the current ability: it gave a ton of health, faster attack and run speed, and temporarily upgraded your turret to level three
    He was a lot more similar to the Engineer from TF2
        Yes because OW was designed to be like TF2.
            Just new and exciting and *sexy*
He really wasn't.

He used to play a lot like TF2 engineer. Build a turret, upgrade it to level 2, collect scraps around the battlefield to give a one-time armor bonus to teammates. Ult would buff you a bit and make your turret stronger.


You relied a lot more on your turret to do the work. It also meant that playing on any mode other than defense was difficult.

Current torb is more fun IMO. His niche isn't as unique but at least he's always playable.
    All they did was change him from a wrench engineer to a gunslinger engineer.
11 people. Kills everyone but the mercy. mercy mass rezzes whole team. Whole team dies again.
    The whole ground would be littered with scrap afterwards and you could give your team armor for days
I was about to say: Bob is just a level 3 Turret with a Rein Charge but no pin.
    Except Bob can be headshotted and CC’d
    I hate it so much.

I loved old Torb. He was the most fun and joy I ever had in the game. Then they took his level 3 turret away and instead gave us Bob, which is almost the same (I still think the level 3 turret killed a little faster than bob does).

And the reason they did it is because too many people hated having a Torb on their team. I know because maining Torb got me banned in 4 seasons. People thought you were throwing when you picked him, especially on attack. I still had a 67% win rate on Torb, even considering that I lost many MANY games due to throwers and griefers that gave up on winning the moment they saw the Torb OTP on their team.

Now we have Ashe, who can win a fight by throwing Bob on a strategic location. I already did the same with Torb back in the day, although with Torb you needed to be a bit smarter about it. Do it at the right moment, when the enemy team was distracted. Pop Molten Core, then put the level 1 turret down and start hammering with increased speed while using your beefed-up body to block anyone trying to shoot your turret while you upgrade it. It worked almost every time, and once the level 3 turret was active, it absolutely MELTED anyone that tried to stay on point, usually resulted in an easy win.
What overdrive(?) does currently just buffed a bunch and also temporarily upgraded his turret to shoot faster and fire rockets
    Lmao he was if the Engineer and Heimerdinger had a baby.
        yeah that was the joke of him when he was like that
        except you had to make sure your turret was already level 2 so you had to either have it prepared and hope it didnt get destroyed or throw it down and whack it with your hammer for a few seconds. It was not very good lol
            You also couldn't throw it, you had to place it
            You hammered super fast in your ult. You could place, activate and hit for less than a second
His old ult did everything Overload did but better. It lasted longer, and his turret upgraded to level 3, giving it more damage and rocket launchers. 
When they reworked him, they moved that ult to his E ability, removing the armor packs and level 3 turret. The lava ult he has today was completely new. I just wish he kept his level 3 turret :(
    [deleted]
also they could not turn around 360 though (idr the exact angle) and their turret form could headshot. there's more that I'm having trouble remembering tho
It's funny because I stopped OW1 before that patch and came back like "where's the orbs?" He's honestly much stronger now being able to heal without a kill.
On bastion when you use the null sector skin his ultimate sound effect is completely different compared to the default back in OW1 but now in OW2 it doesnt have that unique line anymore
    Gonna be an upcoming mythic skin feature
        That would be absolutely horrible and somewhat expected
    Oh...
        Its a shame because it sounded so cool and menacing when you heard it
            His ult would be so good without the amounts of shield we had back then... I want it back!!!
                Tank config is so much better than this one it doesnt leave you open like that aswell
                    I would be happy if arty config was like his old turret with the big cannon instead
            All Null Sector intimidation sound effects are so well done, be it in the regular game, Archives, or cinematics.
Same even though i have many legendaries and the lego skin i just cant take it off
    Wish I had lego skin limited skins stink
Nade jumping around a corner and turning into tank mode in mid-air is the funniest shit
Bastion's ult is trash but I'm gonna have to defend Orisa's. At first I also thought it was kinda bad, until I realized it's basically just another Grav. It requires some coordination but get a good pull and you can pretty much guarantee a wipe.
Would totally fall for that myself.
a  *shＩＩＩＩＩＩＩeld*  generator
Yes, so much fun
Genji players get no sympathy. They reap what they sow. Same goes for widow players. They deserve the suffering.
Yes. Loved that. Fuck Genji.
Sym was literally picked in OG OW because you could give Tracer and Genji rechargeable 25hp shield - which was _insane_ (and why you don't see shield on dive characters).
    > Sym was literally picked in OG OW because you could give Tracer and Genji rechargeable 25hp shield

She was super strong during the betas because shields gave something like 50 to 75HP. The 25HP on live was essentially worthless and she was rarely picked outside of 2CP first points.
        I always thought her amount of shield giving should be a percentage of the hero's HP.

25 shields on 150 HP Tracer? Fine.  600HP Roadhog would get 150 shields.
I have rocked all symmetra reworks. I think the current one is actually the most boring.
OG Teleporter was basically Mercy's resurrect but worse because you still had to wait for people to respawn to use the teleport from spawn.
Sym actually originally had **SIX** turrets and they slowed and damaged.
I just miss putting all my turrets on a basketball and then throwing it at enemies.
    I miss the ol' carwash
        The straight to the dome car wash
        The super carwash on Echienwald before they added the alternate path was always fun. One path, 18 turrets.
And it stacked up to 150, and Repair Pack could grant another 75 armor. With a Brig, Sym, and Torb, you could have a full team with an additional 225 armor under 75 regenerating shield HP, and one member of the team could have a total of 300 extra armor for a couple of seconds.
Damn I forgot about the shield gen, I reckon that would get some ay in the current game too
It also took 6 seconds to ramp up to full which is a way longer TTK than any other DPS playing optimally.  Having a character that didn’t need to aim was a really
important accessibility feature for a lot of people who have various physical conditions that make aiming difficult or impossible, and they removed it because Genji mains didn’t know how to swift strike away instead of spamming deflect.
    It definitely took a bit to ramp up, but if you could get it on a tank like [D.va](https://D.va) or Roadhog and then move to healers and dps, you could wipe out two or three players super fast. Honestly, lock on Symmetra was my main and the game has never been quite as fun for me since they reworked her.
        She was my first golden gun, now I wish they’re refunded the gun price because I never play her.

6 turret microwaves defending right side for Temple of Anubis…so fun.
    Moira has a lock on
        I found it the other day, she actually doesn't have a lock on. Every character has a custom hitbox just for her alt fire that is a round cylinder slightly larger than their normal hit box. I can probably find the vid if you want a source
            I think it’s the same as the hitbox for Whip Shot and Chain Hook. If so, it’s only bigger for small characters. The flail and hook can clip through tank models and still miss.
        It's not a lock-on, just a generous hitbox. The only true lock on left in the game afaicr is Mercy's beam.
        No she doesn't. It is broken when someone else walks in front. Sym you'd literally lock onto a target and could turn around and look the other way
But you could port your team from spawn to some inconspicuous spot behind the point 😂
    SO many won games because of a well placed Teleporter
Wow, that's...Frustratingly accurate from what I've been seeing in recent game play. Nice summation, it really does feel that way.

Or--at the very least--DPS doomfist was "tankier" than tank doomfist, if that makes sense.
    Better movility meaned better survivability. The uppercut was much better than the powerblock.
    this is objectively wrong unfortunately. Being a diamond doom main for both dps and tank. Dps doom was EXTREMELY squishy. Despite 250 health + shields, you would be surprised how many times i had been 1shotted DURING slam uppercut combo, or ccd. (Storm arrow, widow, 2tapped by cass, ashe, hog hook, and this isnt including cc) Peeking while punching is a “snipe me please” button on dpsfist. I dont deny doom not being as tanky as the other tanks. But dps doom was never tanky.
        Yep. What made DPS tankier was the two other tanks
I saw a good DF last night for the first time in weeks. He solo carried the other team by picking me (Zen) before every team fight, then picking our other healer, then getting his team to push afterwards. And our tank just could not figure out that it was intentional, so any time our tank would start pushing he'd jump out from some random corner and wail on us in the backline while our tank had no idea we were even in trouble. 

He finished with like 43 elims and 12 deaths, it was fucking nuts. Every other DF I've ever seen since the switch to OW2 has been pure cheeks.
    This would only happen at top 500 doom otp vs bunch of silvers scenario. Hero is just too garbage
it feels like he's too weak to do damage and is not any good at doing his job as a tank... he's just... bad :/
No troll but what’s the difference with a widow 1 shotting you? Honestly agree with you but also have the same feelings with widow. It’s simply zero fun to get 1 hit and not be able to do anything about it.
    I hate widow too, the main difference tho, is that DPS Doomfist could get in and out easily.

Widow on the other hand has to say somewhat stationary and cannot escape as easily if you get in her face.
        You would be right, however u forget how much cc in the game there was making it hard for an average doomfist to perform really good
    Being able to click on a head is much more respected than a one-shot that supposedly doesn't need any skill to pull off... 

Except anyone who's actually played dps doom knows just how tough it was to get in to get a single kill, nevermind the whole time it'd take to set up, get out and reset. It was never unfair, people just hated him to an extreme degree even when a good Hanzo/Widow/Cass would always make me 10x as miserable as a good doom.
    Widow's is at least a skillshot and you can at least try to play behind cover. Doomfist just takes a flank route, slams in your general direction, combos you to death, shakes off all non-stun peel attempts with the hp he got for smashing you then peaces out with his remaining cooldowns.
    Honestly I felt like widow is worse. Every role had Doom counters, while a good widow meant GG unless your tank knew what to do or you had a better Widow/Hanzo.
As an Ana/Bap main, DPS Doom was perfectly fine imo. He was lots of fun to play as, and playing against him wasn’t too bad. His large hitbox made him easy to hit with a sleep dart, and because his punch was slow to charge up and went in a straight line, Bap could just jump over it. Sure he could 1-combo squishies, but Widow can also do that while being exposed to far less danger. And don’t even get me started on how they added Sojourn right after making Doom absolute garbage because of his ability to one-combo.
>Everyone else is okay with not getting 1 hit and 1 shot combo'd

You mean getting punched and then sliding off a wall because the doomfist didn't hit you perfectly perpendicular to it.  Something they still haven't fixed along with Rein's charge basically flipping a coin to decide if it will grab the person it hits knock them out of the way.
It genuinely blows my mind that people will shit on old doom’s kit, but still think junkrat is just fine or at the very least, *fine enough* to not complain about on Reddit. 

At least with doom you could sleep him or hack him and be fine or get away. Granted, I was only ever diamond, so take that with a grain of salt, but I didn’t really mind doom as much as the rest of you, especially after the infamous stealth nerf he got.
> To be fair you are comparing years of complaints to months of complaints, so yes there will be more incidents to list.

Month 1 of OW had FTH mccree, hook 1.0, big res, quick scope widow, scatter, 8s dragonblade. Probably a couple others I'm not remembering. That's just mentioning the heroes that were fairly strong. There was also a large part of the roster that was just horrible. Zen was probably the most obvious. 150HP made him essentially unplayable back when Widow could kill him with a bodyshot.
    Zen has been my main since the beta, I remember the pain, and I survived it and played around it. I wouldnt call it unplayable since I had a positive winrate on him but it sucked
You spelled Zarya wrong
    There are planned nerfs for Zarya. Sojourn remaining untouched is a new level of whatthefuckery
    they're at least nerfing zarya, they said they won't nerf sojourn
Not even comparable.  Moth Mercy, Release Brig, GOATS, and Double Shield were far more egregious than anything in OW2.  And if you think waiting a few weeks for balance is bad, wait til you see how long it took those to be balanced....
Like weeeee now I get to run around for a bit before I die! Amazing! At least with the flashbang, there was a chance the Cassidy could be taken out by my team, or fuck up and miss. Once I've got that sticky grenade on, it feels bad just waiting to die.
Gets ran over by anyone. I'm relentlessly campaigning until these devs realize they can't really balance and at least 1-2 DPS need a true CC in their kit. 

Otherwise, you're just trading on death to spazzy flankers or spam characters. 

You also did way more damage saving the FTH and using a head shot after the stun so he was a skill shot character. FTH was actually best at shredding OOP tanks on CD and shields. 

He doesn't threaten a pharah, loses at range to any other low rate of fire accurate hitscan, loses at range and up close to sojourn, hardly beats a soldier and gets stomped by him past  at mid range, has no sustain, has the worst mobility option.

I guess they want him to be a close range tank buster? He's too weak to hurt a tracer or Genji these days.
I played this game super intensely for a year from late 2016 onward, had some of the most fun with a game ever back then
His design is never meant to bully Tanks at the first place.
That's not taking into account the fact that he has to reload and she doesn't. With his reload he does 44.7dps so she does actually out heal his damage if the person Winston jumps on can survive long enough for him to need to reload, which they should because they'll be getting healed by mercy the whole time.
    He did the ~~monster~~ Mercy math.
    But he can hit multiple targets other than mercy
        But that also means Winston is closeup with multiple targets, who would all be actively shooting him too. Winston ain't gonna stay around for long if he gets shot to low hp quickly
    If Winston spams melee it does the same dps as holding lmb but greatly extends his effective mag size.
It is funny that the healer with a wand specifically to heal has less healing per second than kiriko, ana, and moira.
    She can heal through shields, through walls temporarily, and has zero resource management.
That seems fair. 5 damage per second. If you can't kill that Winston in 40 seconds, then that's kinda deserved.
People weren't here for the moth meta that lasted over a year, and it shows.
    I was there Juan, I remember the screams... Keep Mercy like she is now, I never want to go back to that.
    Yeah, the only people who enjoyed that were mercy players. Her mobility is crazy now… she is fine.
        Truth! I love the new mobility, at least feels like you can do more now.
Felt even better as a Widow to ping Mercys head right as she tries to ult
    HEROES NEVER--- \*GAHLPH*
Too many mercy players sacrificing their whole team just for a potg clip. Now everyone's out of position ready to get farmed again..  


I swear, they strongly refused to 'tempo res' the two teammates that got picked in the backline, giving you an actual chance to win the fight.. Nope, always that cheesy bs where they stop healing, your whole team dies (the enemy's not gonna bother using ults lol why would they when they can use attrition)...
I enjoyed watching Goats as it felt more like watching professional sports instead of the standard poggers popping off shooter esports usually is.
Brig, but move her to the tank role
What if they were all combined into one attack?
    Just sounds broken. Having them all be on the same cooldown and some sort of rotating arrow system would at least somewhat keep it balanced.
        Or they could all be combined into one attack. That would be fun.
            Sonic-scatter-storm! Sounds like the type of attack an anime character would pull out lol.
            Shoots scatter arrows at the speed and quantity of storm arrows, all the while each piece from the scatter marking with the same area a sonic arrow does
I think that could be cool but would it be on rotation or something along those lines
    Maybe it's a swap arrow button and you'd have to rotate through them.
Was also able to recall outta grav IIRC.
    Back then all kinds of movement effects could get you out of grav, except Rein charge.
Agreed, feel like she could really use that damage back.
I'm always surprised when I fight against a sigma and they're not spamming balls 24/7.

My balls are getting tossed onto everyone all day every day when I hop on him. It's effectively constant, sustained damage that has no downfall to our team unless there's a Zarya.
Dva has the same issue. It's a zoning ult and it's fine. It should just be a bit bigger to actually effectively zone.
I think it'd be better if it had an active tractor effect, like a weaker version of Zarya's ult. It's best suited right now to basically herding the enemy team together and bursting them and I'd rather they lean into that identity than try and balance another burst-kill ult
you could oneshot tanks. Fucking tanks. You didn't even have to see them.
Yeah he's got great damage output; he's just real squishy.
Great at lower ranks. He gets farmed higher up.
    He's still played at GM, and flankers are far more cautious around a Zen at GM than at low ranks I'd say.  In GM a flanker has to catch Zen by surprise or it's a really risky engage.
Exactly. So many overwatch 1 buffs and nerfs are completely meaningless now and result in characters being just not worth picking
50 damage on a 5 second cooldown seems worse than her 35 damage mace.  Without the stun, I almost never use it unless Genji is deflecting.
    You should use it, with proper animation canceling you can do bash-attack-whip in a quick succession and burst someone for 150+ damage.
        I've definitely tried.  It was Brigitte's bread and butter in OW1.  But without the stun, Dash/Blink/Recall is too easy.
            I mean, if you do the combo and they run away that's good enough, you don't need to kill the flanker.

Brig still counters Tracer/Genji pretty hard, I would like to have the stun back, but she still counters them.
The immediate post-nerf Brig just before the repair pack nerf was my fav Brig.
oh man... i miss this.. and gettin raged on after that in all chat :D
Except she doesn't feel tanky at all and dies almost instantly and kinda sucks with supporting too
    Her whole kit is annoying to play behind. Brig players are always saying "just stand in the back and use your whip shot to keep inspire up" but that isn't what anyone wants to do when they pick Brig. They want to come in behind the shield, get close, and start swinging next to their tank. That's what it looks like she should be able to do, that's what it feels like her kit is for, but she's made of paper so you can't do it. Instead I'm standing around waiting for whip and heal packs to come off cooldown and feeling stupid 60% of the round for not picking Lucio.

If they were going to remove her stun, they should have made some changes to help her sustain better. Brig could really benefit from a Torb-like self buff cooldown to power her up in short bursts so she can engage, close distance, jump into the fray or survive longer- but not all the time. Shield bash is completely worthless now so they should really look into replacing it with literally anything more useful than moving forward slightly faster. The armored, shielded support hero should not be easier to kill than Kiriko and Moira. Her whole thing should be that she is hard to kill, but I'm actually relieved playing DPS when I see her; *thank god she isn't one of the tough supports to take out.*
        Not to mention that she doesn't have armor or enough to give a damn. That and Armor feels kinda bad since its **slightly** less damage taken. Which means nothing against high damage characters like McCree, Echo, Hanzo for examples.

Theres only one character she vibes well with and i rarely see Rein. Not to mention she has no stun. She has Shield Bash for mobility and damage and her Whip which just displaces and damages. Thats it.


Her Ult is really good afaik but if thats ALL shes useful for.. Then whats the point in playing her otherwise?
    She needs to play at melee range to be effective but can be deleted almost instantly by most DPS. It's not great.

I still do fine with her but I *really* need to be on my game to not instantly die if I want to accomplish anything.
        Thats the issue. Getting into Melee range. Without her ult or a Rein thats almost impossible it feels. That and her one ability PUSHES enemies away. Which might be useful for keeping the other support alive (until they just dash or keep holding W) but its not helpful for her to stay in melee range.
    To me she's basically an ult bot right now, her ult absolutely helps your frontline but yeah she seems to be pretty shit without it
Mei as a tank would be much better than brig. Mainly because support roster is so small rn and also because mei originally had cc which is something a tank should have. On top of her ice form basically being a broken version of roadhogs breather.
    In HotS they made Mei a tank with a lot of mobility and slows/stuns, so I could see this being transitioned pretty seamlessly
But Zarya has bubbles making her bigger, and Doom can only protect himself. People want to shoot Zarya first if they see she isn't bubbled, which makes her a higher target then Doom.
    > Doom can only protect himself

Can he really though? :(
And Orisa can harpoon to cancel an ult. As can Doomfist. And Reinhardt.

It doesn't have to be a full stun that goes on for seconds, but at least ult-cancelling would be consistent with all other heroes. And make her much more satisfying to play.
Thank you for this, you never know what you didn't know you needed
Amen
And at least you had to land your shots afterwards, not you just stick someone, say your shiteating voice line, and watch em blow up
    Agreed. I feel the characters are getting too close to each other in terms of powers.  Soon they’ll all have a shot, a grenade, and an escape power.

Literally just 100% the engineer from TF2
Blizzard doing as much as they possibly can to make the game dissimilar to TF2 nowadays
I even remember when I first started how I thought overwatch was great because it was less about competitive and more about countering your opponents bullshit move with your bullshit move. Needing to pick up scrap kinda made sense because you also had another character, Reaper, need to pick up souls of the defeated to heal. You also had the glorious. 

McCree's tank melting fan-the-hammer. 

Zero-Line-of-Sight Hooks. 

Full Team Rez.

Welcome to the Car Wash. 

Day 1 Brig. 

They scaled down all the bullshit to make it "balanced". I wish they had scaled UP the bullshit to make it balanced instead.
    Car wash lmao

Symmetra's probably changed more than anyone, no?
        [deleted]
        Sym 1.0 was support, giving shields.

Sym 2.0 was... that was the one that still had the teleporter ult and the latch beam, right?

Then Sym 3.0 had the floating forward shield and her beam no longer latched on and she had the shield generator? Or was that 2.0?

And now 4.0 has the barrier for her ult instead.
    Yeah I remember as it was happening people complained that fights started feeling more like pillow fights than anything else.

Then double shield happened, GOATS happened, turned out when you took away all these fun things, gameplay becomes slow and boring.

When I first started playing, the way I would sell my friends on the game is "It feels like nearly every character is OP" the gameplay was fun because there was so much bullshit you could do. It was fast-paced and each character felt unique.

They've really scaled back on uniqueness and a lot of characters feel identical to each other now.
        > Then double shield happened, GOATS happened, turned out when you took away all these fun things, gameplay becomes slow and boring.

That's the part I don't get in their balancing: Yeah sure, 3 tanks + 3 support was problematic. Sure.

But did they never consider that they only created this situation by **specifically** nerfing and/or reworking the heroes that could counteract this? And in turn, when they did forced 2/2/2, their premise for changing things in the first place evaporated, and they **should have** reset everyone to launch-balance **and start over**?

I hate how Blizzard has this morbid corporate mandate to never ever go backtrack something no matter how sensible it'd be.
            You're completely right, it makes no sense.

At the same time, Blizzard has been pretty obviously catering hard to two groups. OWL viewers, and streamers.

Obviously getting more eyes on their product is a good thing for them, so I can see why they do it, but it means that all their balancing started getting around what looks impressive. When they realised the GOATS issue, they decided to force dive instead of just re-balancing everything. Every balancing decision they've made since GOATs makes sense when you consider the *forced dive* aspect, down to little things like DPS speed boost passive after kills.

And there's also that aspect of people screaming that any character that isn't pure DPS is "no skill" and should be nerfed into the ground. Mei, Junkrat, Sym, they've never been strong, they've never been part of an oppressive meta, but they're constantly seeing nerfs because of some idea of "skill" that people have in their heads. It makes games become really one-note and boring because then nobody picks the nerfed-to-hell interesting characters.

Edit: AH SEE? Completely unnecessary Junkrat nerf in this patch. They didn't even explain why they thought it was needed.
    Exactly. Overwatch wasn't fun to play *in spite* of the absurd abilities and ults and crazy team-wipe combos. It was fun **because** of them.

Competitive Overwatch is... just another team shooter, tbh. There have been lots of them. And with OW2 it even lost the bonus of being the arguably most-polished one, it's quite beta-y in nature now with lots of quirks and bugs.

But ah well, it's where the money is I suppose, and it's not like there ain't tons of games to play. Don't really need a team FPS right now anyways, plus me and my friends just play some DRG if we feel like shooting at things.

ROCK AND STONE!
    Fan the hammer was so comically broken it was wonderful. Everyone melted the minute you got close to him.
[deleted]
    It's adorable that people who say this seem to think the developers are the ones making the money and not their employers.
I loved throwing the armor packs on a large arc to try and protect someone more forward.
    Not to mention you could just throw it on yourself in a pinch effectively giving torb a lot more hp and dueling power.
Technically an armor pack would be better than healing the same amount because it provides damage resistance, right?
    Yup. Symmetra was a support originally for this very reason
I remember he still had the armor packs when Symm got the shield generator. Those were filthy times
    Whaaat? It was just a Tracer zipping around with ~~275~~ 300hp!
        And the shield was over the armor too. Some characters became pretty well unstoppable.
            I actually stayed alive for more than a minute or two as Zenyatta!
                Especially since the armor also went under his natural shields
        Actually, 300hp... Lol
    oh my fucking god i forgot about that absolute nonsense lmao. they were the best of times, they were the worst of times
> His ult was his current E but better because it also made his turret stronger

Ahh, the good old days when Torb POTG would be ulting in spawn.
    Or staring at Widow's ass while his turret did all the work.
    [Best Torb POTG ever](https://youtu.be/DiMJ-s4T16M)
        I laughed at the same time as the uploader, in a similar fashion.

Perfect.
            Lol so did I because it's the funny bit
    I remember I would Ult, get really close to the Widow on my teams ass and just Hammer away for an easy POTG.
    Ults insta dies turret kills 5 players easy potg.
He did have alt fire on his gun!
wait does his e not buff his turret anymore? oh god ive been using it all wrong
He was a lot more similar to the Engineer from TF2
    Yes because OW was designed to be like TF2.
        Just new and exciting and *sexy*
All they did was change him from a wrench engineer to a gunslinger engineer.
The whole ground would be littered with scrap afterwards and you could give your team armor for days
Except Bob can be headshotted and CC’d
I hate it so much.

I loved old Torb. He was the most fun and joy I ever had in the game. Then they took his level 3 turret away and instead gave us Bob, which is almost the same (I still think the level 3 turret killed a little faster than bob does).

And the reason they did it is because too many people hated having a Torb on their team. I know because maining Torb got me banned in 4 seasons. People thought you were throwing when you picked him, especially on attack. I still had a 67% win rate on Torb, even considering that I lost many MANY games due to throwers and griefers that gave up on winning the moment they saw the Torb OTP on their team.

Now we have Ashe, who can win a fight by throwing Bob on a strategic location. I already did the same with Torb back in the day, although with Torb you needed to be a bit smarter about it. Do it at the right moment, when the enemy team was distracted. Pop Molten Core, then put the level 1 turret down and start hammering with increased speed while using your beefed-up body to block anyone trying to shoot your turret while you upgrade it. It worked almost every time, and once the level 3 turret was active, it absolutely MELTED anyone that tried to stay on point, usually resulted in an easy win.
Lmao he was if the Engineer and Heimerdinger had a baby.
    yeah that was the joke of him when he was like that
    except you had to make sure your turret was already level 2 so you had to either have it prepared and hope it didnt get destroyed or throw it down and whack it with your hammer for a few seconds. It was not very good lol
        You also couldn't throw it, you had to place it
        You hammered super fast in your ult. You could place, activate and hit for less than a second
[deleted]
Gonna be an upcoming mythic skin feature
    That would be absolutely horrible and somewhat expected
Oh...
    Its a shame because it sounded so cool and menacing when you heard it
        His ult would be so good without the amounts of shield we had back then... I want it back!!!
            Tank config is so much better than this one it doesnt leave you open like that aswell
                I would be happy if arty config was like his old turret with the big cannon instead
        All Null Sector intimidation sound effects are so well done, be it in the regular game, Archives, or cinematics.
Wish I had lego skin limited skins stink
> Sym was literally picked in OG OW because you could give Tracer and Genji rechargeable 25hp shield

She was super strong during the betas because shields gave something like 50 to 75HP. The 25HP on live was essentially worthless and she was rarely picked outside of 2CP first points.
    I always thought her amount of shield giving should be a percentage of the hero's HP.

25 shields on 150 HP Tracer? Fine.  600HP Roadhog would get 150 shields.
I miss the ol' carwash
    The straight to the dome car wash
    The super carwash on Echienwald before they added the alternate path was always fun. One path, 18 turrets.
It definitely took a bit to ramp up, but if you could get it on a tank like [D.va](https://D.va) or Roadhog and then move to healers and dps, you could wipe out two or three players super fast. Honestly, lock on Symmetra was my main and the game has never been quite as fun for me since they reworked her.
    She was my first golden gun, now I wish they’re refunded the gun price because I never play her.

6 turret microwaves defending right side for Temple of Anubis…so fun.
Moira has a lock on
    I found it the other day, she actually doesn't have a lock on. Every character has a custom hitbox just for her alt fire that is a round cylinder slightly larger than their normal hit box. I can probably find the vid if you want a source
        I think it’s the same as the hitbox for Whip Shot and Chain Hook. If so, it’s only bigger for small characters. The flail and hook can clip through tank models and still miss.
    It's not a lock-on, just a generous hitbox. The only true lock on left in the game afaicr is Mercy's beam.
    No she doesn't. It is broken when someone else walks in front. Sym you'd literally lock onto a target and could turn around and look the other way
SO many won games because of a well placed Teleporter
Better movility meaned better survivability. The uppercut was much better than the powerblock.
this is objectively wrong unfortunately. Being a diamond doom main for both dps and tank. Dps doom was EXTREMELY squishy. Despite 250 health + shields, you would be surprised how many times i had been 1shotted DURING slam uppercut combo, or ccd. (Storm arrow, widow, 2tapped by cass, ashe, hog hook, and this isnt including cc) Peeking while punching is a “snipe me please” button on dpsfist. I dont deny doom not being as tanky as the other tanks. But dps doom was never tanky.
    Yep. What made DPS tankier was the two other tanks
This would only happen at top 500 doom otp vs bunch of silvers scenario. Hero is just too garbage
I hate widow too, the main difference tho, is that DPS Doomfist could get in and out easily.

Widow on the other hand has to say somewhat stationary and cannot escape as easily if you get in her face.
    You would be right, however u forget how much cc in the game there was making it hard for an average doomfist to perform really good
Being able to click on a head is much more respected than a one-shot that supposedly doesn't need any skill to pull off... 

Except anyone who's actually played dps doom knows just how tough it was to get in to get a single kill, nevermind the whole time it'd take to set up, get out and reset. It was never unfair, people just hated him to an extreme degree even when a good Hanzo/Widow/Cass would always make me 10x as miserable as a good doom.
Widow's is at least a skillshot and you can at least try to play behind cover. Doomfist just takes a flank route, slams in your general direction, combos you to death, shakes off all non-stun peel attempts with the hp he got for smashing you then peaces out with his remaining cooldowns.
Honestly I felt like widow is worse. Every role had Doom counters, while a good widow meant GG unless your tank knew what to do or you had a better Widow/Hanzo.
Zen has been my main since the beta, I remember the pain, and I survived it and played around it. I wouldnt call it unplayable since I had a positive winrate on him but it sucked
There are planned nerfs for Zarya. Sojourn remaining untouched is a new level of whatthefuckery

If they were going to remove her stun, they should have made some changes to help her sustain better. Brig could really benefit from a Torb-like self buff cooldown to power her up in short bursts so she can engage, close distance, jump into the fray or survive longer- but not all the time. Shield bash is completely worthless now so they should really look into replacing it with literally anything more useful than moving forward slightly faster. The armored, shielded support hero should not be easier to kill than Kiriko and Moira. Her whole thing should be that she is hard to kill, but I'm actually relieved playing DPS when I see her; *thank god she isn't one of the tough supports to take out.*
    Not to mention that she doesn't have armor or enough to give a damn. That and Armor feels kinda bad since its **slightly** less damage taken. Which means nothing against high damage characters like McCree, Echo, Hanzo for examples.

Theres only one character she vibes well with and i rarely see Rein. Not to mention she has no stun. She has Shield Bash for mobility and damage and her Whip which just displaces and damages. Thats it.


Her Ult is really good afaik but if thats ALL shes useful for.. Then whats the point in playing her otherwise?
She needs to play at melee range to be effective but can be deleted almost instantly by most DPS. It's not great.

I still do fine with her but I *really* need to be on my game to not instantly die if I want to accomplish anything.
    Thats the issue. Getting into Melee range. Without her ult or a Rein thats almost impossible it feels. That and her one ability PUSHES enemies away. Which might be useful for keeping the other support alive (until they just dash or keep holding W) but its not helpful for her to stay in melee range.
To me she's basically an ult bot right now, her ult absolutely helps your frontline but yeah she seems to be pretty shit without it
In HotS they made Mei a tank with a lot of mobility and slows/stuns, so I could see this being transitioned pretty seamlessly
> Doom can only protect himself

Can he really though? :(
Agreed. I feel the characters are getting too close to each other in terms of powers.  Soon they’ll all have a shot, a grenade, and an escape power.
Need ah dispensah here!
    Pootis pencer here!
That mercy is a spy
    *killbinds*
        Thanks (explodes)
That dispenser's a spy!
    that spy is a dispenser!
        I have a bucket!
            Dear god.
                There's more.
            There are many like it, but this one is MINE
Pootis
Car wash lmao

Symmetra's probably changed more than anyone, no?
    [deleted]
    Sym 1.0 was support, giving shields.

Sym 2.0 was... that was the one that still had the teleporter ult and the latch beam, right?

Then Sym 3.0 had the floating forward shield and her beam no longer latched on and she had the shield generator? Or was that 2.0?

And now 4.0 has the barrier for her ult instead.
Yeah I remember as it was happening people complained that fights started feeling more like pillow fights than anything else.

Then double shield happened, GOATS happened, turned out when you took away all these fun things, gameplay becomes slow and boring.

When I first started playing, the way I would sell my friends on the game is "It feels like nearly every character is OP" the gameplay was fun because there was so much bullshit you could do. It was fast-paced and each character felt unique.

They've really scaled back on uniqueness and a lot of characters feel identical to each other now.
    > Then double shield happened, GOATS happened, turned out when you took away all these fun things, gameplay becomes slow and boring.

That's the part I don't get in their balancing: Yeah sure, 3 tanks + 3 support was problematic. Sure.

But did they never consider that they only created this situation by **specifically** nerfing and/or reworking the heroes that could counteract this? And in turn, when they did forced 2/2/2, their premise for changing things in the first place evaporated, and they **should have** reset everyone to launch-balance **and start over**?

I hate how Blizzard has this morbid corporate mandate to never ever go backtrack something no matter how sensible it'd be.
        You're completely right, it makes no sense.

At the same time, Blizzard has been pretty obviously catering hard to two groups. OWL viewers, and streamers.

Obviously getting more eyes on their product is a good thing for them, so I can see why they do it, but it means that all their balancing started getting around what looks impressive. When they realised the GOATS issue, they decided to force dive instead of just re-balancing everything. Every balancing decision they've made since GOATs makes sense when you consider the *forced dive* aspect, down to little things like DPS speed boost passive after kills.

And there's also that aspect of people screaming that any character that isn't pure DPS is "no skill" and should be nerfed into the ground. Mei, Junkrat, Sym, they've never been strong, they've never been part of an oppressive meta, but they're constantly seeing nerfs because of some idea of "skill" that people have in their heads. It makes games become really one-note and boring because then nobody picks the nerfed-to-hell interesting characters.

Edit: AH SEE? Completely unnecessary Junkrat nerf in this patch. They didn't even explain why they thought it was needed.
Exactly. Overwatch wasn't fun to play *in spite* of the absurd abilities and ults and crazy team-wipe combos. It was fun **because** of them.

Competitive Overwatch is... just another team shooter, tbh. There have been lots of them. And with OW2 it even lost the bonus of being the arguably most-polished one, it's quite beta-y in nature now with lots of quirks and bugs.

But ah well, it's where the money is I suppose, and it's not like there ain't tons of games to play. Don't really need a team FPS right now anyways, plus me and my friends just play some DRG if we feel like shooting at things.

ROCK AND STONE!
Fan the hammer was so comically broken it was wonderful. Everyone melted the minute you got close to him.
It's adorable that people who say this seem to think the developers are the ones making the money and not their employers.
Not to mention you could just throw it on yourself in a pinch effectively giving torb a lot more hp and dueling power.
Yup. Symmetra was a support originally for this very reason
Whaaat? It was just a Tracer zipping around with ~~275~~ 300hp!
    And the shield was over the armor too. Some characters became pretty well unstoppable.
        I actually stayed alive for more than a minute or two as Zenyatta!
            Especially since the armor also went under his natural shields
    Actually, 300hp... Lol
oh my fucking god i forgot about that absolute nonsense lmao. they were the best of times, they were the worst of times
Or staring at Widow's ass while his turret did all the work.
[Best Torb POTG ever](https://youtu.be/DiMJ-s4T16M)
    I laughed at the same time as the uploader, in a similar fashion.

Perfect.
        Lol so did I because it's the funny bit
I remember I would Ult, get really close to the Widow on my teams ass and just Hammer away for an easy POTG.
Ults insta dies turret kills 5 players easy potg.
Yes because OW was designed to be like TF2.
    Just new and exciting and *sexy*
yeah that was the joke of him when he was like that
except you had to make sure your turret was already level 2 so you had to either have it prepared and hope it didnt get destroyed or throw it down and whack it with your hammer for a few seconds. It was not very good lol
    You also couldn't throw it, you had to place it
    You hammered super fast in your ult. You could place, activate and hit for less than a second
That would be absolutely horrible and somewhat expected
Its a shame because it sounded so cool and menacing when you heard it
    His ult would be so good without the amounts of shield we had back then... I want it back!!!
        Tank config is so much better than this one it doesnt leave you open like that aswell
            I would be happy if arty config was like his old turret with the big cannon instead
    All Null Sector intimidation sound effects are so well done, be it in the regular game, Archives, or cinematics.
I always thought her amount of shield giving should be a percentage of the hero's HP.

25 shields on 150 HP Tracer? Fine.  600HP Roadhog would get 150 shields.
The straight to the dome car wash
The super carwash on Echienwald before they added the alternate path was always fun. One path, 18 turrets.
She was my first golden gun, now I wish they’re refunded the gun price because I never play her.

6 turret microwaves defending right side for Temple of Anubis…so fun.
I found it the other day, she actually doesn't have a lock on. Every character has a custom hitbox just for her alt fire that is a round cylinder slightly larger than their normal hit box. I can probably find the vid if you want a source
    I think it’s the same as the hitbox for Whip Shot and Chain Hook. If so, it’s only bigger for small characters. The flail and hook can clip through tank models and still miss.
It's not a lock-on, just a generous hitbox. The only true lock on left in the game afaicr is Mercy's beam.
No she doesn't. It is broken when someone else walks in front. Sym you'd literally lock onto a target and could turn around and look the other way
Yep. What made DPS tankier was the two other tanks
You would be right, however u forget how much cc in the game there was making it hard for an average doomfist to perform really good
But that also means Winston is closeup with multiple targets, who would all be actively shooting him too. Winston ain't gonna stay around for long if he gets shot to low hp quickly
Truth! I love the new mobility, at least feels like you can do more now.
Or they could all be combined into one attack. That would be fun.
    Sonic-scatter-storm! Sounds like the type of attack an anime character would pull out lol.
    Shoots scatter arrows at the speed and quantity of storm arrows, all the while each piece from the scatter marking with the same area a sonic arrow does
I've definitely tried.  It was Brigitte's bread and butter in OW1.  But without the stun, Dash/Blink/Recall is too easy.
    I mean, if you do the combo and they run away that's good enough, you don't need to kill the flanker.

Brig still counters Tracer/Genji pretty hard, I would like to have the stun back, but she still counters them.
Not to mention that she doesn't have armor or enough to give a damn. That and Armor feels kinda bad since its **slightly** less damage taken. Which means nothing against high damage characters like McCree, Echo, Hanzo for examples.
