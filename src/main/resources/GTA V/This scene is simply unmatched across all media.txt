[[This scene is simply unmatched across all media]]





Man that scene escalated so quickly to gave me freaking whiplash when I first played it

    Came here to say this. Now replaying it for the 69th time (cause fk online) and im just planning which fool gets headshotted first. Gotta beat that ‚Äúslightly faster game completion%‚Äù

 And then another twist, Trevor is there too! And he‚Äôs helping Michael!
    And he's only there because he's so obstinate about killing Michael himself and that makes it so much better hahaha
        Vegeta vibes lmfao
    That was the best of lot. The way he arrived holding sniper, yelling at the top of his voice, sharing "concern" for Michael and at then shot the helicopter. 

It was just way too beautiful.....
This belongs in the top 5 cutscenes in the entire franchise
    Ne, in all of gaming

On my like 4th play through I did this mission right after I changed Michael‚Äôs clothes into a Hawaiian shirt, cargo shorts, and flip flops. I was letting him go through a little relaxation arc. I was really immersed in the story and was trying to play each character as lore-accurate as possible.

I got to this scene with all the federal agents and private military people showing up, and there in the middle of all of it was my gta protagonist in a Hawaiian shirt. Michael stood out so much the entire cutscene, yet with the way I played the story it made perfect sense as to why he‚Äôd be dressed like that in my head cannon. It made the whole scene 10 times as funny.

I had played all the 3D gtas before, but I think that was the moment I finally *got* gta
    lol glad to know I'm not the only one who pulled up to a shootout between federal agents and a private military in a Hawaiian shirt and flip flops
        Same! I just felt Mike was so stressed. He needed some r and r.
    I haven‚Äôt came to that epiphany quite yet but playing through 4 & episodes for the first time changed my perception of gta.
    This is how I play, I also like to stick to different radio stations for each character. Feel like it adds a nice bit of immersion and also let‚Äôs me explore stations I might not get to otherwise
    Just make him bald and you would've been playing Max Payne 3.
Betrayal is these brothers favorite plot point
I ‚ù§Ô∏è GTA
Imagine how much better this would‚Äôve been if OP didn‚Äôt put that shitty music over this and actually let us hear the dialogue
    Yeah, I‚Äôve only played the story through once nearly a decade ago and forgot what happens here.
        just look where the guns are pointing
            ..everywhere?  Like story-wise, I don‚Äôt remember what was said or what the twist(s) even were.
                Basically everybody is surprised at each other's presence
                    Well IAA came for Steve and FIB Came for Dave and Merryweather came for Michael and all 3 are shooting at each other.
Same goddamn leg!
Honestly, one of my fav missions across the universe and it just kept getting better. The number of mercenaries and agents was overwhelming and it required some good precision to make it unscathed.
I hope there‚Äôs some hilarious IAA/FIB missions in Cuba in gta VI tbh.
    We might wont get get any since we are gonna be playing as a rookie criminal and not like Michael that is very professional criminal and had a deal with FIB agents
My favorite mission on V as far as story goes(boosting the cars and delivering them as Franklin was dope but didn‚Äôt do much story wise other than Franklin getting screwed). I‚Äôve played through the story multiple times but just once since 2017. So I was like 12-17 playing through it. Playing it recently as a 24 year old makes the story make so much more sense. Realize just how fucked it all is
Never understood why the Noose didn't start blasting after agent small cock blasts his assistant in the head
This should be the new spidermans pointing at each other meme
When I first saw that scene, it was crazy. I was so excited as well. I still remember Michael saying "What the fuck?" after Trevor came in to "help out"
Anyone know the song name? Kinda slaps
    Tame Impala - Let It Happen, but seems to be a remix of some sort or something
        Got it! This helped thanks, I think it is this remix sped up a little: https://youtu.be/tfr-h6BaYN8?si=YK29q8HyIdXYzQYn
            The song kicks ass and I don't hate this remix at all, cheers
You would love John Woo, if you like this kind of escalation/ stand off, OP.
I mean, if you've never seen a crime movie before.
    It's not often you see this level of scalation on twists in just one scene, and actually work
    Okay then. Suggest me some crime movies with scenes like this.
        Lethal Weapon 5 with Danny Devito
            You know it‚Äôs gonna be good when Danny Devito is in it
        My favourite [Mexican Standoff](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandOff) is in the American version of The Departed.

In GTA games the plot mostly exists to facilitate as many crime movie tropes as possible. Interactive crime movie parody.

Edit:[my second favourite Mexican Standoff.](https://youtu.be/IHQr0HCIN2w?si=9b0k4xMt_guM_1uP)
        The ending of True Romance had to have been a major inspiration for this scene. Right down to the escalation with new groups getting involved in a major Mexican standoff.
One of the top 5 or even Top 3 GTA Moments. Shit keeps elevating and elevating
‚ÄúAgent Sanchez you‚Äôll do no such thing‚Äù
    "Now Steeeeeve"
        ‚ÄúWe agggred to speeak to MICHAEL‚Äù
            "To try and and explaaaain things to him"
                ‚ÄúNot this‚Äù
                    ‚ÄúThis causes problems for us all‚Äù
It‚Äôs too bad the lads have broken up. 6 is gonna be a hit or miss
Just played through this mission again yesterday it's so good.
This scene was awesome and hilarious
This scene is better than all scenes from GTA IV.
Story in GTA V is done in such terrible taste and now we have a couple of generations who consider it good.

This scene is as shallow as it gets. It's another flashy moment with zero build up, just like the rest of GTA V.
    Lemme guess. GTA IV is your favorite GTA amiright?
        GTA V story sucks even if my favorite GTA is True Crime: New York.
    While I agree to an extent, can you elaborate your point?
When gta still had some soul, gta 6 is gonna be a shit show
This was very well done, thank you for sharing
    It‚Äôs been nearly 11 years. If someone hasn‚Äôt played it and is in the subreddit, it‚Äôs their own fault
    Fr what a spoiler, I can‚Äôt believe this, I went spoiler free for the 10 years this game has been out, now I‚Äôm RUINED üò≠üò≠üò≠

How could you spoil my 10 year old game
    The spoiler; angent Sanchez does not become president and in fact is not obama
It‚Äôs pathetic that a game from 2013 has better writing than most of movies, shows, and even games today, especially MWIII
    It's Rockstar by the way. They've always been out of everyone's reach.
Across all Media is crazy..
Oooo boy I just started a new playthrough. I forgot what I‚Äôm getting myself into.
One of my favourite missions
This is like Resevoir Dogs but times 10
That scene was hilarious lmao
The video left out the best one - Trevor!
Song name?
    Let It Happen - Tame Impala (this version is sped up a bit though)
My god was this scene badass. The tension rising between the characters as more and more show up, eventually leading to Steve shooting Sanchez in the head, leaving a hole in his head and leaving a bit of his brain exposed.

Fucking loved this.
RIP to UL Paper
    He‚Äôs not dead
        Really?
            Doomsday Heist & Operation Paper Trail in Online has confirmed this as they both take place way after story mode.
I was waiting for the Telemundo News anchors to pop up as well
These guys pulling up in the carpark amd waiting their tun to run in
Fuck I wish I could play this for the first time again
sanchez getting his brains blown out by the AP pistol and them literally making an entire couple of frames showing it was dope
Why is Matto in the top left
can't wait to play gta 6...in 2027 when it comes to pc.
How much time needs to pass until spoilers are no longer needed? üëÄ
GTA 5 campaign has done things in a game I still haven‚Äôt seen.
As soon as that dick head got shot in the knee I knew the shit had hit the fan. I just could have never expected that headshot‚Ä¶
Anyone know what song this is?
The twists hit every single beat
Pretty much did the same thing on rdr2 in chapter 6
What I like to say "SHIT GOT REAL FROM 0 TO 180!"
ima miss danny boy
It's been a while since I play could someone remind me what's going on
What mission was this again?
    The Wrap Up
Music name please !
I find it funny how it makes the gun Michael holds accurate to the modifications you make on it, so Steve, Sanchez and Davey are all holding regular pistols and then there's Michael with a gold pistol with suppressor, flashlight and extended magazine
Ayyye vinny
Can anyone tell me the name of the music used here?
the storyline to this game always confused the shit outta me
