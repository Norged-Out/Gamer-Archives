[[drove off a cliff and michael turned into tony hawk]]





This was the best thing I've seen in my years of GTA
    Came to say this. That was absolutely, no holds barred, the best thing I've seen in GTA. What a coincidence. Thank the gods for video capture in games.
    and it's near impossible to repeat haha
Ballin
    They see me rollin' , they hatin'...
The new skate game looks great
Michael DeSanta‚Äôs Downhill Jam
    Come on and slam
Can we propose a video game mashup?
I‚Äôm so disappointed they made a game about California and no skateboarding or rollerblading.
    ikr, the best we‚Äôve got is bmx which is good and all but those would be good too
    It looks like it would be light work for RAGE to support, snowboards too. I imagine nobody even thought about it before.
        Except for the fact that there's only snow for like a week of the year and only in online as well lol. Maybe in north Yankton otherwise
I‚Äôve been laughing for 2 minutes straight. Thanks for this!
didn't know car doors go that far
    If you ever really wanna have fun watch how far a bike helmet falls if you drop it on a hill or something.
Oppressor Mk3 leaked footage
I remember this happening back in 2014 on my Xbox 360 when I was messing around with cheats with a friend of mine one day. I skated down mount chiliad on a rapid gt's engine hood... Me and my friend were laughing our asses off, wish I could record that, it was priceless
Someone did a thing:

Excellent footage of Mike Hawk.
This needs to be cross posted in r/oddlysatisfying
Don't need no car, a car door is enough
This was amazing
Tony Hawk Pro Doorer
Have my free award, OP

That‚Äôs siiiick
Discombobulating.
that dusting off while getting up was dope!
Michael de Santa's Pro Car Door
No kickflip??

Michael De Santa's Pro Skater

Dang the new extreme sports update looks legit
üòÖ that's funny
That walk off at the end was brilliant.
Tony De Santa
Ngl one of my favourite things to do in gta v
Mike Hawk
Omg guys it‚Äôs Michael Hawk!!!
Shawn white

Have you ever seen tony hawk and Michael in the same room?
Gr8 sk8 m8 I‚Äôd r8 8/8

        atleast credit me in the description
This is so good!

I've a different question. Do you guys keep your game recording to always on so that such moments are captured, or is there a better way? 

I know windows game bar allows us to capture what happened 10 seconds ago. But this looks longer.
    it was on xbox and you can save clips between 15 seconds and 5 minutes, on pc i‚Äôm not sure sorry
‚ÄúAw crap, that hurt‚Äù

*proceeds to compete in the X games*
micahel: damn it feels good to be a gangsta, a (n word) ass gangsta
WHAAAAAT üíÄüòÇ
Even Jimmy has to admit that was pretty fucking rad
SICK 360 DUDE. WOAH THAT WAS WICKED. BACKSIDE 180 TOO? INSANE DUDE.
That texture of the door at the end... Does the game tried to display a scratched interior? :D
    yeah i think so lol
I love how you tried to get back on at the end
    yeah i tried for round 2
Scate 4
At least you got to phase through the bushes no matter the size unlike perico... crashing on a little shrub. Nice downhill grind either way üòâ
For an old fat boomer

Michael for sure is great
‚ÄúHe was falling  W I T H S T Y L E ‚Äú
You just invented the next GTA release
Imagine if Rockstar actually added a Skateboard to GTA, which they will never but just Imagine
    that would be sick
I love GTA 5's sandbox and physics engine for moments like that. If your physics engine can't do wacky stuff like that, that kinda makes since, but not intended to, like using a car door as a sled, it's not that good in my book.

Same thing can be done in RDR2
You forget thousand things everyday, how about you make sure it's one of them.

    nope it‚Äôs my clip, people have been reuploading it to youtube though
Fuckin A
You saved yourself a hell of a long walk.
There's no way rockstar did this on purpose. I guess it's just a collusion of object mechanics and character mechanics working together in harmony.
I thought a cougar would come out of nowhere
