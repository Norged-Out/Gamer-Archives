==How British Standards are made==

The BSI Group as a whole does not produce British Standards, as standards work within the BSI is decentralized.  The governing Board of BSI establishes a Standards Board.  The Standards Board does little apart from setting up Sector Boards (a Sector in BSI parlance being a field of standardization such as ICT, Quality, Agriculture, Manufacturing, or Fire).  Each Sector Board in turn constitutes several Technical Committees.  It is the Technical Committees that, formally, approve a British Standard, which is then presented to the Secretary of the supervisory Sector Board for endorsement of the fact that the Technical Committee has indeed completed a task for which it was constituted.
