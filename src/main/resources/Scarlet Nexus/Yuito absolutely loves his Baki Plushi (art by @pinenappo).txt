    Indeed
Tsugumi in the back going “I already seen this with my special eyes.” *Hugs the plant her and Yuito planted together*
Naomi going to heaven in this looks both morbid and cute at the same time.
Who is the one saying "You're cuter"?
    I think all four are
    I'm 100% sure it's Hanabi, because Shidden wouldn't be caught dead saying that.
        And what happened to Kasane?
            The amount of cuteness almost gave her a heart attack
                kasane having emotions?
                    That's an oxymoron
 what is hanabi doing in the last panel
    Holding in a nose bleed?
Girls are literally on last breath from too much cutesy.
