[[How is Scarlet Nexus]]


So just asking as I sometimes see the game on sale for 10$, and was wondering if the full version was worth investing in.




So far, what I know about the game is that it is a game about telepathy, and I wanted to know if it's true that the game takes a while to pick up.



Basically I want to know if the full version of the game is worth my time as I only know a little about it through the demo, and wanted to get an idea of what to expect if I were to obtain the full version.


I absolutely loved this game.
    I did too. Now i just started the anime of it on Funimation.

            I just googled the codes but I imagine it was interesting doing both at once
            Ooh, I'll have to keep this in mind if I ever pick up the game -- that I should watch the anime semi-concurrently.

The dual protagonist thing was promising but delivered horribly. Yuito's route was boring af and Kasane's route had much more to be desired. You end up playing one route, which has many plot holes and then play the other thinking that the other route will fill in the holes. But NOPE. Its the same exact story with the same exact maps and everything, but told in a slightly different perspective that offers no additional information on the overarching narrative. Just some additional characters. Hell, I was hoping at least the bases were going to be different, but their exactly the same. At least the combat is good, and some of the characters are quirky and fun. Also, the anime sucks hot garbage, and there is no reason to watch it other than skipping to the opening and listening to the Oral Cigarettes (might as well for the game, too). 6/10. If they make a sequel thats good (which it has a very high potential to do so) then it might be bumped up.
    Hard disagree, I found the two character perspective worked really well where you have some of the information missing in your first play through in ways that really makes you think and effectively creates the illusion of bigger things going on beyond what you get to see through these main characters, while the next play through with the other protagonist fills in the gape in effective and satisfying way. Also sure the two play through share many of the maps, there were very different locations that are locations for major story events that's only part of either one of the protagonist's arc. And despite of some of the shared locations, you interact with a completely different groups of characters through 2/3 of each of the protagonist's story arc so you are experiencing completely different stories, and that's not even considering the completely different companion specific stories which are also completely different because you are interacting with different group of people as different characters.
    Nier did this better
Short review : great combat, nice graphics, bland yet endearing characters, stupid plot, awful dialogue presentation.

Also, maybe that's what you meant, but the main characters have telekinesis powers, not telepathy. There is a bit of telepathy involved, but the main gimmick is telekinesis.

I've played Kasane's (the woman) story, and I've read that you get more answers out of it, compared to Yuito's (the man) story which is more of a traditional "fish out of water" story. Clarification : the story is the same, but depending on the protagonist you choose, you have a different perspective on it.

In the end, I think I played about 40 hours, and despite all its faults, I was a little sad when I uninstalled the game.
    I regret playing Yuito's first, assuming I'd play the other route later. The game was fun, but the story was so stupid that by the end I had no desire to go back. 

And since I played it on game pass, i doubt I'll ever get it to play the other character.
        Iâ€™ve started the second character and I really think you (and I) made the right choice playing Yuito first. As silly as the story became, Yuitoâ€™s version made more sense to me. Playing as the second character is only bringing up more questions for me rather than answering them.
            Imo the story in this game is so bad that you should just prioritize the gameplay, meaning combat, experience. 

In which case Yuito is probably the better option, he just plays more fluidly and his playstyle is more suitable to the game as a whole. 

I see what they were trying to do with Kasane, but all Im thinking if Im playing her is that the game is exactly the same except that Kasane sucks at melee.
                Yup thatâ€™s how Iâ€™m approaching it. I still plan on finishing the game and Iâ€™m enjoying it. I can appreciate what they tried to do with the story but itâ€™s definitely not the highlight of the experience
    Actually Yuito route is a better starter route. Cause with Kasane they don't explain some basic stuff, cause they assume you already know them. 

I started Kasane route and later when i played Yuito i finally understood some fine details why everyone looked like a kid even though some of them where much older. They don't explain that in Kasanes route. Both routes have the exact same story though. But different perspectives and the later 3rd of the game is identical.
        > They don't explain that in Kasanes route.

Its mentioned a few times during the pseudo brain talk sequences, like the random conversations your party members sometimes have with you in random places. 

At least one of them has Kyoka mention the anti aging drug. 

Im pretty sure Gemmas bond also references it, even on Kasanes route. 

Both are easy to miss though.
        Also the combat, Yuito's combat mechanics is a lot easier to pick up in your first playthrough while Kasane's combat mechanics is clearly designed for someone who's already familiar with Yuito's combat mechnics, and can be particularly unintuitive for someone who's playing their first playthrough, but much more satisfying for someone who's already mastered Yuito's combat mechanics.
It's a peculiar game, which got more budget that most peculiar games do.

* The combat is great and (importantly for an action game) *feels* good, moment-to-moment. Combat is certainly what the game does best
* Interesting if woefully under-exposed world
* Vibrantly colorful anime aesthetic that was cozy to me as a God Eater fan
* The story makes no goddamn sense and is at times aggressively stupid
* All of the characters are either weird or cliche with not much inbetween. They're likable enough despite that though

If the demo didn't grab you though, I don't think the full game is going to change your mind.
Itâ€™s a fun game. Story is wonky but youâ€™re in a JRPG sun so youâ€™re used to it. The combat is fast and entertaining. Itâ€™s not terribly long, and you donâ€™t need to do everything to get a satisfying ending.
    Not a JRPG sun lmao. Then Iâ€™m a JRPG sun, visual novel moon, and whatever-genre-Katamari-is risingðŸ˜Œ
        No no, you misunderstand: JRPG Sun is a subgenre. Golden Sun is a good one.
            Oh I miss the golden sun series.  I really liked the most recent one but they just left it hanging without a continuation, made me sad
For the 10-20$ price I think itâ€™s absolute worth a look beat it 2 months ago was a decent play
Combat is fun, game plays well, story is meh but not bad. I'd easily buy it for $10
I got bored halfway through -- the story is really stupid (more a series of plot twists than an actual story) and the combat is mediocre if serviceable. 

That being said, I definitely got $10 of entertainment out of it before getting bored, so I'd probably say you aren't risking much at that price.
i loved it. one of my favorite battle systems in an arpg. does take a little while to get going as you need to recruit people to unlock powers, but once in full swing, it's really fun. good character interaction with lots of interpersonal quests.

Itâ€™s a great game that doesnâ€™t have a great post end game content. At least thatâ€™s my opinion about it as someone who have platinumed it. 

Hopefully there is a part 2 that builds on it, it have sci-fi element to it, so if youâ€™re not a fan of that stay clear, if youâ€™re then youâ€™ll enjoy it.
    >Itâ€™s a great game that doesnâ€™t have a great post end game content. 

When did you last played the game?

The free updates added Vision Simulator combat missions and the Brain Eater DLC has a superboss
        It been a long while, might check those out sometime later. Thanks for letting me know.
I loved the demo, bought the game at full price, and set it down halfway through. Not because I hated it, but as RL got in the way. But, if you saw this on sale for as low as $10, I'd still totally try it. 

Combat, world building, and aesthetic are very cool and sharp. The world lore I wanted more of. You need to be okay with a game that slaps you in the face with how ANIME it is, too.

The game's story falls a bit flat, and its budget constraints with the comic book style dialogue pages are sometimes really jarring. I was desperate for more actual FMVs between character.

I feel like Bandai Namco had their paws on a potentially bold, new, cool IP here but didn't fully commit to it, which frustrated me.
It didnâ€™t connect for me it didnâ€™t feel enjoyable and there wasnâ€™t anything to really make me want to stick with it. Played it for an hour or two then deleted it and picked up live a live. Unless you can get it free on ps+ or something Iâ€™d avoid tbh.
It's solid. It screams " has a great sequel if it ever gets made" in every moment. It's biggest weakness is that basically, there's nothing to do in gameplay but combat (which is kinds absurd when you figure in the abilities of the characters you have access to). Exploration is barely worth doing, there's either no or braindead puzzles, all the levels are just connected hallways and arenas, etc.

&#x200B;

I think the dual protagonists hindered more than helped. Imagine if they had a single main campaign and character they could have increased the variety more.
    They *could* have done dual protagonists if they did it like FFVIII/BoF4 style, just changing the protagonist for the necessary segments, whether thats done through having one "main" and one "sub" protagonist or allowing you to choose the main protag is debatable, although I wouldnt recommend an equal split, since to me personally, Kasanes gameplay feels much worse.
Donâ€™t buy it not worth it
It's an average games tbh. The combat is the only interesting thing for me and even I got bored of it in the end, the story is average it does have some shocking moments but not enough to make it interesting. I would give this a 6/10
Not a fan tbh. Combat didn't click with me at all, plus lock-on and camera felt kind of weird.
it's really good
It's a solid 8/10 imo.

The Good:

-Gameplay.  Fast, responsive, good variety of skills to use and a pretty impactful feeling ability unlock system; enemy design and general variety isn't great but the variety of weaknesses and tactics needed to deal with them makes it good enough for what it is.

-Visuals.  Cool and unique semi-cyberized setting, combat choreography (and cutscenes too when you actually get one) and effects are excellent, as one would expect from the Namco crew.

-The Base: Give your party members gifts and they place them in the base, and it just fills up with miscellaneous junk as you progress through the game.  NG+ through the other character's story gives you another set of gifts so you can get a ton of stuff in there by the end of everything.  It doesnt really mean much but that shit gets the dopamine flowing for me.

The meh:

-Story.  It's just ok, it's a pretty typical popcorn thriller that rushes to drop all its cool twists, while it leaves the more filler/worldbuilding stuff and character development in the backseat; there is some of it through the totally-not-social-links but it's not a super detailed deep dive character/worldbuilding drama like this sub in particular tends to prefer and the writing isn't great.  It's fine for what it is though, and it runs a bit darker than typical RPG fare does nowadays.

-Music doesn't really stand out.  Typical decent soundtrack that fits the game fine but doesn't elevate it or stand super strongly on its own.

-Characters.  For the most part they were very middle-of-the-road; they're superficially likeable for the most part, but their personalities and story arcs are fairly generic with just a couple exceptions.


The bad:

-Cutscenes. The game clearly had a budget target, and this is what they decided to cut the most heavily.  About 95% of the story dialogue is delivered through janky comic-book style scenes with like a really short (~1 second) animation bridging some of the 'pages'.  Some people end up liking the style, personally I thought it was very unappealing.

The short version: At least for me, the game was mostly carried by the combat and its visual gimmicks, but they did a really good job of carrying it and there wasn't much that I felt particularly negative about.
Itâ€™s a meh game. Not bad, Not good. For 10$ I would grab it. The only thing I rly hated about it was the social links idea they implemented. It was a damn right stupid.

Plus there was no point for the dual protagonists. Once you play one story you will figure every thing and they will even tell you what happened in the other path. I recommend playing the boy path as it has more mysteries surrounding it till the end.
There is a demo.  

I wasn't a fan due to the bad lock-on camera and limited weapon options.
Based on my time with the demo, it's aggressively anime  (which may be a good or a bad thing, depending on your tastes) and just sort of so-so in the combat department.

You could do worse, but you could do better, too. Pick it up on sale. Don't drop more than $40 on it. $25 might be even better.
I regret buying it on sale TBH
It is action jrpg with fun battle system, combat gets a bit repetitive by the end, the later the more options you have in battle. World and graphics are really pretty,lots of characters that you get to spend time with, game basically have two routes for each mc,but you won't miss much if you play just one. Story is alright, nothing spectacular, but i never felt bored. Ost is really good, i still listen some tracks.

See if you like demo and decide for yourself. Imo it is absolutely worth it on sale. I liked it more than its sibling jrpg tales of arise.
I think it takes a while to pick up, I started playing and gave up after 2 hours
Itâ€™s solid, it has very apparent flaws that can hinder someoneâ€™s ability to enjoy it but it has a lot of strengths mixed in with it, the IP has a ton of potential if they worked on the quirks in a sequel. 

Game has a absolutely 10/10 soundtrack, game is worth $10 for that alone
i loved this game so much. Enjoyable combat, great music. fun characters.
Itâ€™s fine. The story is interesting but the game has a lot of padding. The combat can be really fun or really annoying depending on the enemies. I really wanted to finish it for the story but after about 13 hours I just wanted to keep going through the story and the game kept making me re do areas that didnâ€™t contribute anything to the story.
It's a solidly "good" game. I'd recommend it if bought on sale. The enemy set is small and repetitive, which is a shame for otherwise interesting combat. The ability to borrow abilities from teammates is pretty cool. The story is convoluted and the game's version of bonding events is half baked and doesn't work with the larger story.
The battle system was fantastic. Some of the most fun I've had in JRPG combat. The story completely put me to sleep.
It's content is packed two routes still slowly playing finished yuito route now currently doing kasane

For best experience please go with yuito route first
I got it for five bucks on crazy sale. I sadly couldn't get into it. Dropped it a handful of hours in. Just, nothing was clicking with me. Combat was alright but felt very repetitive. Mash button to charge then hold button to throw a thing at the baddies. Story seemed ok but failed to hook me.

Maybe I'll try again in a few months.
This game kicks so much ass its one of my favorites extremely hard recommend. Takes a little bit to get going but do side quests for your party members and the combat will go pretty crazy relatively early in, also recommend doing both routes, they're simillar but not totally the same and still worth it for the gameplay change alone
Cool game.  Would definitely recommend it for only 10 bucks if the action appeals to you.

The combat and the character/enemy (mainly enemy) designs are the highlight.  Combat is quite fun.  Pretty slick and really fun when you get enough stuff to pop off.  Some cool tools to play with.  Not super deep but challenging enough. 

Stuff like story, sidequests, character bonding range between "ok" and "good", but nothing special.
Combat is really unique, fun and sometimes frustrating. The story is not good at all. It actually doesn't, are any sense the way these people talk.
I just bought it for $10. Well worth it for that price.
I enjoyed it, but I'd recommend other games for sure.
You canâ€™t lose for $10 but the story is too stretched out, you have to replay a lot for all trophies/achievements.  I thought the setting was cool and the gameplay was interesting, but the story wasnâ€™t the best (or the worst).  Even so I got all the trophies anyway, so I would say itâ€™s quite decent.
What I've played of it is good
Action is pretty fun but repetitive, was just about wearing out its welcome at endgame for me.
I didn't find the little character dialog bonding event things compelling at all. they seemed kinda tacked on or half assed. In general I do like those features but not so much here.

Anyways it's decent but not super remarkable imho. Good for a filler game on a cheapo sale maybe.
Not a perfect game but I like it definitely worth $10 imho
Are multiple playthroughs necessary to get the full story, or is it just a case of a different cutscene or two?
    Yes and no. It's not an entirely different experience but you got to see more characters interaction, some different story aspects and the gameplay is also a bit different. It's not NieR-level necessary though.
    The story remains the same, but the middle portion (chapter 4-9) is very different as you play things from each protagonists perspective, and the bonding events do change depending on your protagonist. I'll say that a 2nd playthrough will go through significantly faster due to NG+, so it's not that long to finish whoever you decide to do second anyway as you can rush through all the fights with your party being overleveled and having endgame gear.
pog gameplay, nice art direction, ok char design (all stereotypes), level design is... HEH, story is... interesting but you'll tell me how it is
A solid 7/10 and an enjoyable experience if you're into the action/DmC style of combat. I highly recommend higher difficulty for the full experience as the game is on the easy side otherwise.
I liked it quite a bit, combat is fast and flashy, and the game looks great. 

Story is a bit all over the place and characters are bland, but it didnt really matter to me at that point since the core gameplay loop is fun.
For $10 it's absolutely worth it. I played it on launch and got a solid amount of playing time. You get to choose between 2 protagonists at the start with different play styles. Choosing a different protagonist does change the story perspective a lot and adds a lot of depth to the game. The best part of the game was the combat which is super fun to mix and match other characters abilities with your own. Enemy variety does get a little stale towards the middle/end since most enemies end up as reskinned versions of others. The story is really good and even with the enemy variety being limited, I still loved playing it. Worth it for $10, probably wouldn't buy it at full price though
If it's on sale it's worth. Character designs are nice, art style is great! Combat is serviceable but kind of gets boring later (at least for me). Games all right in my book
I loved the game. It's a little linear for my taste, but I loved the Story and the interation among the characters.

The anime is basicaly the same story, but with litle changings. However, it isn't as good drawing as the game modeling.

The version I bought came with a digital book art. It's short, but interesting.
I paid full price for it on release and don't regret it. It's not life-changing, but it's super fun game play with fast and satisfying combat. The story and characters are fairly run-of-the-mill JRPG, but that's probably a non-issue since we are all here on this sub, lol. You'll probably enjoy it.

P.S.   Play Kasane's route first! You'll be content if you don't feel like replaying the game via the other route.
fun combat  
  
story is a bit drawn out? it's kinda meh  
  
the social mechanics are OK, but I think it could still use some polish (which I hope they do on a potential sequel)  
  
I think it's worth the $10  
  
it has some level of replayability to it cause of the 2 main protagonist (different playstyle, kinda)   
it turns into a power fantasy once you're 'fully decked out' (or at least get 2 specific upgrades)
For $10 youâ€™ll have a blast and enjoy it!
Highly recommend this game.
Its a fun game but I found myself wanting it to end by the 30 hour mark. The gameplay is fresh and the graphics look and perform great, but from the first hour to the last, you will be fighting the same enemies. It gets rather repetitive and I found myself tuning out often. 

If you like repetition, then go for it. I really enjoyed the characters, art style, and music as well.
It's not bad as far as story and combat go but the side quests weren't  fun at all.
Started it from PS+ Game Catalogue a while ago, Kasane's route. The characters, the story, the lore, the combat... everything right up my alley so far. Fingers crossed for a Switch port someday.
The combat actually gave me slight motion sickness before they patched it. I would recommend it though if you donâ€™t have anything else youâ€™re interested in! If you like anime (which I do) you will like it
I wanna get into it as well but the idea of telepathically launching things into enemies as part of combat turns me off. Is this a big part of the combat or is there a lot more to it?
The combat is solid and a lot of fun which is the main draw. If you enjoy good action combat it's a great time especially for $10.

If you're someone who only cares about story then probably not since the story is mediocre at best.
There is a super soldier named Karen. Best game ever!

I loved Scarlet Nexus, if you like silly shonen stories and good action on a JRPG I'll like it.
I liked it but didn't finish it. The action was unique and crazy fun and that's what kept me going. The story wasn't too bad, either, and I did want to see how it turned out.

But there's virtually zero world-building, the characters aren't great, and even the combat started to wear on me toward the end of my playthrough with the guy (never got around to playing as the girl). I started off really enjoying it but ultimately it felt like a slog that I just wasn't invested in anymore.

I know many others feel differently, though. And for $10, it's at least worth a try (I paid $20 and I thought it was worth it for the attempt).
Played this game on release. I'd say that the best thing about the game is its combat. Story is decent and may get a bit convoluted at times. If I am to name one bad thing about the game is it's a bit too repetitive for my taste. There will come a time somewhere in the middle part of the game where you'll figure out a very reliable sequence of moves that can pretty much carry you til the end. Other than that, I think it's a worth a shot especially if it is on sale.
I'm actually playing through Scarlet Nexus for the first time and can possibly give an on-the-spot review. I'm a little over twenty hours in on the Kasane route.

The combat is interesting to say the least. If you've played an action-RPG such as Tales-anything then it's similar (This is a Bandai Namco game like Tales.), however unlike Tales you only control the main character and rely on CPU for the rest of the party. The CPU does a decent job and you won't find yourself micro managing your party in combat.

The telekinesis function is interesting. The main character that you control can grab nearby objects and hurl them at enemies, while simultaneously executing melee attacks. It results in a lot flying around and the action relatively fast paced. My biggest gripe was wishing some of the controls could be streamlined some, such as dealing with targeting other enemies while attacking another. There's a good deal of combo-button functions you have to remember.

The setting/graphics/that sort of thing has an fun aesthetic. Everything is a futuristic cyberpunk-style setting with anime flare. It gets explained that most of the artificial items the population see is sent through their brains. It makes more sense when you play the game for a little at the start.

Dungeons/fighting areas are varied, which I like, but the procedures to advance tend to be very cookie-cutter-ish. You either advance to the very end of an area to fight a boss, or you play find-the-switch/item. There's usually a start area, mid area, then end area. It's predictable.

The story so far for me has been very meh. After twenty hours it's not done anything extraordinary. The characters have a lot of variety, but many feel quite lifeless; even ones that are trying to stand-out. Most of the narrative is advanced via comic style cutscenes similar to Tales, and if you've played Tales unfortunately it leaves you desiring Tales-type skits rather than what is portrayed in Scarlet Nexus.

Overall it's kept me in it enough to not drop the game. I typically know by ten to fifteen hours in if I'm going to go all the way through, and Scarlet Nexus has me at least holding on.

For as cheap as it is I won't say you wasted your money, but don't drop it immediately after the first few hours. Give it a little time.
I did too. Now i just started the anime of it on Funimation.

        Yup thatâ€™s how Iâ€™m approaching it. I still plan on finishing the game and Iâ€™m enjoying it. I can appreciate what they tried to do with the story but itâ€™s definitely not the highlight of the experience
> They don't explain that in Kasanes route.

Its mentioned a few times during the pseudo brain talk sequences, like the random conversations your party members sometimes have with you in random places. 

At least one of them has Kyoka mention the anti aging drug. 

Im pretty sure Gemmas bond also references it, even on Kasanes route. 

Both are easy to miss though.
Also the combat, Yuito's combat mechanics is a lot easier to pick up in your first playthrough while Kasane's combat mechanics is clearly designed for someone who's already familiar with Yuito's combat mechnics, and can be particularly unintuitive for someone who's playing their first playthrough, but much more satisfying for someone who's already mastered Yuito's combat mechanics.
No no, you misunderstand: JRPG Sun is a subgenre. Golden Sun is a good one.
    Oh I miss the golden sun series.  I really liked the most recent one but they just left it hanging without a continuation, made me sad
It been a long while, might check those out sometime later. Thanks for letting me know.
I just googled the codes but I imagine it was interesting doing both at once
Ooh, I'll have to keep this in mind if I ever pick up the game -- that I should watch the anime semi-concurrently.
Imo the story in this game is so bad that you should just prioritize the gameplay, meaning combat, experience.
