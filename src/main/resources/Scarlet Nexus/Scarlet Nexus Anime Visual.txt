    https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1372566131634892805
        Dope. June is way closer than it feels.
            Finally another game to look forward too. Sucks it isn't Ps5 and XSX exclusive. Older gen is like tapped out

Edit: you all would say the same thing if you had a ps5 or xsx
                You DO realize there's been a damn shortage of those systems since they came out, right?
                I have a PS5 and I wouldn’t say it 

It’s a damn anime game, how exactly is the older hardware holding it back? It’s not gonna have photorealistic graphics 

It’ll be fine
    yeah, get it out so we can get Tales of Arise news lol
        OHHHHHH ELDEN RING
            We know the true pain, brother.
    No PC :(

I would buy it. Probably play it for an hour or two, then never play it again.
        It's on Steam lol (and PS4/PS5). https://store.steampowered.com/app/775500/SCARLET_NEXUS/
It is based on an action role-playing game by Bandai Namco Studios. It is scheduled to air in July, and is produced by Sunrise.

[Teaser trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDLMe29Skfs)

**Synopsis from official website**
>In the far distant future, a psionic hormone was discovered in the human brain, granting people extra-sensory powers and changed the world as we knew it.

>As humanity entered this new era, deranged mutants known as Others began to descend from the sky with a hunger for human brains. Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity.

>Those with acute extra-sensory abilities, known as psionics, were our only chance to fight the onslaught from above.

>Since then, psionics have been scouted for their talents and recruited to the Other Suppression Force (OSF), humanity’s last line of defense.

LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Code Vein now pls
    I actually liked code vein as a game, buggy as fuck but I enjoyed it and I'm pretty sure that UFOTABLE did something on that game. Now imagine Ufotable Code Vein anime...
        I just got it a few weeks ago just about to finish my first playthrough. The character  creation is insane and i’m a little disappointed that SN won’t have it. Still a good game regardless and it’s interesting to see that they’re pushing an anime to go along with the release
            There wont be a character creator within Scarlet Nexus?
                No sadly
                    As someone who spent 20 hours in Code vein character creation, I can remove that game from my wishlist :(
        They didn’t the opening thingy when you stay on the start screen for so long it plays it
        >  Now imagine Ufotable Code Vein anime...

I don't understand Ufotable circlejerk. They've made Tales of Zestiria the X based on game and it's meh
            Ufotable are known for their fx, not the writing of story.
            https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/43/ufotable

Yes, all the anime they have done is just Tales of Zestiria....
                Iirc they made two tv anime based on games(let's not count VN), both are meh
                    Are you just intentionally ignoring all their other works?
                        Yes because we are talking about adapting video game, why would I focus on manga adaptation?
            They make godlike animations. Just look at how they turned an average manga like Demon Slayer into a huge success
                They also made many other anime that weren't that successful. Demon slayer success probably won't be replicated ever
                    Wdym? They already did lol. Fate UBW is one of the most famous animes out there for its gorgeous looks and a big hit for the anime community; kara no kyoukai is also amazing in terms of animation, but isn't as well known. Now with the fate heaven's feels they are having a lot of monetary success again (sure its box office can't compare to demon slayer's movie, but mugen train single handedly even overcame Spirited Away's box office - that's like being the cristiano ronaldo of anime movies).

Ufotable can't hit the jackpot every single time, but the animation is top quality every time. About tales of zestiria - it's understandable. I mean, how do you even make a decent adaptation about a game that's 50+ hours long? They had to cram the whole plot into 8 hours of anime - and to be honest, tales of zestiria's in-game story was already pretty questionable to begin with (Tales of Berseria was definitely better). Tbh, all Tales games are bad choices for anime adaptations since there is so much in-game dialogue and skits for character development. Still, the animation was gorgeous - just look at the fight scenes in zestiria and it's \*chef's kiss\*
                        > Wdym? They already did lol.

Are you delusional? There's nothing comparable to the success of Demon slayer in the history of anime. Amount of demon slayer manga sold is absolutely crazy. Fate had some success but it's nothing compared to Demon Slayer

> but the animation is top quality every time

And that's why God of Highschool fans are happy by adaptation of their favourite webtoon...

> how the f*ck do you even want to make a decent adaptation about a game that's 50 hours long? 

So you are agree with me that Code Vein anime made by Ufotable would be shit? Nice.
                            >Are you delusional? There's nothing comparable to the success of Demon slayer in the history of anime. Amount of demon slayer manga sold is absolutely crazy

Demon slayer got immense attention and a huge boost to sales after the anime (nearly tripled the pre-anime sales per volume), THANKS TO UFOTABLE'S AMAZING ADAPTATION. They've shown us time and time again both with Fate series, Demon Slayer and Kara no Kyoukai that they can make amazing adaptations

>And that's why God of Highschool fans are happy by adaptation of their favourite webtoon...

God of Highschool had top tier animation. The pacing was trash though but it was made by a totally different studio, so what's your point? Trying to push their failure unto another different studio?

>So you are agree with me that Code Vein anime made by Ufotable would be shit? Nice.

Holy sh\*t, I was trying to be reasonable and explain our point of view but you're such a huge d\*ck. Stop putting words in my mouth like an arrogant prick. Code vein has around 25 hours of gameplay - and since it's a souls like game, most of it is fighting time; **actual story content** is a lot less (you can see on youtube - all cutscenes are like 3:30H if you remove the different variations. And as someone who played code vein, I'd love if ufotable would make an anime of it

You watched one of ufotable's worst adaptations - Tales of Zestiria - and keep bashing them for no reason. I'm done here with how stubborn and narrow-minded you are
        No bugs, enjoyed it \^\^
What episode of wandavision is this
    Wanda went through the five stages of grief and ended up as an anime girl?
        Naturally
Damn, that's a nice aesthetic.
An Astral Chain anime would be sick.
    you mean jojo?
The fuck. I'm still waiting for the game to come out in June and now it has an anime? 

I wonder how it'd connect to the game. Maybe the anime would be a prequel of sorts.
A cool visual; gives me guilty crown vibes
...

Code Vein anime plz
This character design reminds me of Inori from Guilty Crown.
We don’t even have the game yet!
Scarlet ~~Witch is a~~ Nexus ~~being.~~
I dunno much about the game storyline but in what way is this connected to it? Same as the game or spin-off?
    The game doesn't release until the end of June, so no one knows.
Oh the game is now getting an anime?

Huh sounds neat. Hopefully it does well.
Damn.nice thighs
looks like aqua ngl
    ...How?
    I agree. Saw that pic and was like “aqua looks pissed”
This is pretty poggers. I've been in interested in the game for a while now.
looks cool but honestly dont expect the anime to be that interesting. its based off a video game that looks pretty generic
Eh. Looks like the new Fate movie

Edit: I have nothing against this series. I'm just making an observation.
    I fail to see how that's a bad thing.
        I fail to see when I said it was a bad thing
            It was implied with the use of Eh.
                Forgive me for my bad use of Eh.
                    It's okay, I forgive you.
                        Thank you kind stranger
It's getting an anime? That's cool, I'm even more excited for the game
Batarangs? I'm in!
damm that look epic wots the anime about
Waiting for this game so much
Finally! Been waiting for the release date!
This pics kinda givin me guilty crown vibes. Ill def check it out.
Can Anyone Tell me what this anime is about?
Can’t wait for the astral chain anime
This cover gives me ex arm vibes for some reason
Looks fire!!
Daaaaaaaaamn, I'm in.
Does anyone know is this is the exact same story is as the game or something alternative? It looks interesting but I want to play the game, so I don't want the show to spoiler it

Demon slayer got immense attention and a huge boost to sales after the anime (nearly tripled the pre-anime sales per volume), THANKS TO UFOTABLE'S AMAZING ADAPTATION. They've shown us time and time again both with Fate series, Demon Slayer and Kara no Kyoukai that they can make amazing adaptations

>And that's why God of Highschool fans are happy by adaptation of their favourite webtoon...

God of Highschool had top tier animation. The pacing was trash though but it was made by a totally different studio, so what's your point? Trying to push their failure unto another different studio?

Holy sh\*t, I was trying to be reasonable and explain our point of view but you're such a huge d\*ck. Stop putting words in my mouth like an arrogant prick. Code vein has around 25 hours of gameplay - and since it's a souls like game, most of it is fighting time; **actual story content** is a lot less (you can see on youtube - all cutscenes are like 3:30H if you remove the different variations. And as someone who played code vein, I'd love if ufotable would make an anime of it

You watched one of ufotable's worst adaptations - Tales of Zestiria - and keep bashing them for no reason. I'm done here with how stubborn and narrow-minded you are
Forgive me for my bad use of Eh.
    It's okay, I forgive you.
        Thank you kind stranger
As someone who spent 20 hours in Code vein character creation, I can remove that game from my wishlist :(
Are you just intentionally ignoring all their other works?
    Yes because we are talking about adapting video game, why would I focus on manga adaptation?
Wdym? They already did lol. Fate UBW is one of the most famous animes out there for its gorgeous looks and a big hit for the anime community; kara no kyoukai is also amazing in terms of animation, but isn't as well known. Now with the fate heaven's feels they are having a lot of monetary success again (sure its box office can't compare to demon slayer's movie, but mugen train single handedly even overcame Spirited Away's box office - that's like being the cristiano ronaldo of anime movies).

Ufotable can't hit the jackpot every single time, but the animation is top quality every time. About tales of zestiria - it's understandable. I mean, how do you even make a decent adaptation about a game that's 50+ hours long? They had to cram the whole plot into 8 hours of anime - and to be honest, tales of zestiria's in-game story was already pretty questionable to begin with (Tales of Berseria was definitely better). Tbh, all Tales games are bad choices for anime adaptations since there is so much in-game dialogue and skits for character development. Still, the animation was gorgeous - just look at the fight scenes in zestiria and it's \*chef's kiss\*
    > Wdym? They already did lol.

Are you delusional? There's nothing comparable to the success of Demon slayer in the history of anime. Amount of demon slayer manga sold is absolutely crazy. Fate had some success but it's nothing compared to Demon Slayer

> but the animation is top quality every time

And that's why God of Highschool fans are happy by adaptation of their favourite webtoon...
