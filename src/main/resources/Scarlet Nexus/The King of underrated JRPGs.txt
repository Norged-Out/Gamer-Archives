[[The King of underrated JRPGs]]


Scarlet Nexus is a hidden gem


ah shit solo leveling posting (i think?)
    It is
    Most of the games shown are not JRPGs
        which ones?
            Nier Replicant, Three Hopes, and 13 Sentinels for starters.

Edit: [What is a JRPG?](https://youtu.be/f5YWOWHUNaE?si=sX8ZPcH5gBdL0t2a) TLDW: JRPGs are not "RPGs made in Japan."
                They're Japanese, and they're Role-Playing Games. Sounds like JRPGs to me.
                    yep, if its japan made, an anime, and an rpg, its jrpg automatically for me
                    Just because a game is japanese doesn't make it a jrpg. That's like calling The Dark souls games jrpgs. Tales of Arise, Neir, and Grandblue Relink are action rpgs. And Persona Strikes is a Musou game with persons skills and fusion added to the gameplay.
                        I thought "action RPG" is a subgenre of RPG, therefore those games are at a higher level an RPG game, therefore they are JRPG?

For reference Yoko Taro himself invoked the statement that NieR "is an RPG" as the explanation for why they have progression systems lol
                        I thought jrpg ate like ff games and tales games. Where as loz are just rpg. Dmc is arpg. 

Apparently anything with leveling system is an rpg of some kind. 

Doom has no leveling system, you just pick up weapons and kill shit. 

That's was always my understanding
                            LOZ (legend of zelda) is not a ARPG. it is an action adventure game. excluding legend of zelda 2 links quest where thats an actual RPG because it has actual RPG elements and systems.
                        Tales is most definitely a jrpg, and one of the longest running in fact. Saying it's not is like saying Final Fantasy isn't.
                        lol i literally call myself a jrpg fan coz those are my main games named above so idk, idk its the same arguement as ARPGs, which i learned last year thats what dark souls actually is
                        idk how to break it to you, but dark souls is a jrpg
                            no the fuck its not its a souls like game which is its own genre which it created and if you wanna be that person and not use souls like its an ARPG action role playing game which most definitly it is. the whole JRPG is literally like someone had said a RPG made in japan. if you dont know what a JRPG is then you need to go culture yourself.
                                By your definition they are partly JRPGs though, From Soft is a Japanese company.
                                    It's either a jrpg or not there is no such thing as a JARPG no body is using that because if it was a thing then we've been mis labeling all the tales of games which supercede dark souls.
                                You do realize that a game can fit into many different categories at once don’t you?
                                first of all, chill out, no need to go crazy. second, “Souls-like” is a shit descriptor for games, and should never have become one. it encompasses pretty much any game with exploration, leveling, and big punishing gameplay or bosses. which is super generic, “Metroidvania” is also a crap “genre”, encompassing sprawling side-scrolling maps and exploration, sequential weapon upgrades, and big, punishing bosses.

a good example of why this sucks is a game like Hollow Knight, which unsuprisingly, can have both of those applied because there is functionally no difference to them, except the 2D aspect.

sorry to everyone for the rant.
                                    Bruh you chose to the first thing and not the rest. I literally explained what darksouls it I didn't stick to the whole souls-like. And there is a something that souls like games have is when you die you spawn at last checkpoint so you can run it back with the boss. Some metroidvania games depending if they have Rouge-like elements when you die you game over, there is no checkpoint. For example blood stained is a metroidvania ,why because when you die you game over restart from last save.i didn't play hollow knight because the Fandom is as cringe as undertale and Steven universe but I'm pretty sure when you die it's game over restart form last save. Hell here's a nother one in blazblue entropy effect it has metroidvania in 1 section of the game and it's a Rouge like so if you die game over restart whole game. There are better ways to explain how a game is. Here's one I'll give some genre stuff and I bet it literally labels like every game ever in the category. 2-D action adventure platformer with upgrades for the main character. Bet you didn't think I was talking about super Mario hell because I was talking about risk of rain.its OK for sub categories like metroidvania and souls like who cares if you think they are crap everyone is sick of saying 2-D action adventure platformer it's so blanket. Don't even get started with 3-d games you can't even describe games if you just say action RPG. Is it kingdom hearts, DMC, Bayonetta, or darksouls.
                    The amount of genre purists here baffles me. I have been gaming aince the mid 90s and can say that yes, a lot of these games wouldn't be called jRPGs or even RPGs at that era or the 2000s even.

 The definition of what fits into a genre however is flexible and changes over time, especially with a genre as  broad as the RPG genre where anything from having customizable MCs, level/xp/perk/loot based progression and agency over plot direction via narrative choices classifies a game as an RPG. 

An honest question: if franchises like Mass Effect or The Witcher - all considered RPGs even though they are a departure from the traditional tabletop inspired turn based formula - were developed in Japan would they be considered jRPGs even though they deviate from the traditional formula of being turn based? In my opinion they would given they fit the most basic definition: a RPG made in Japan. To argue otherwise because of over 3 decades old criteria just seems like being needless pedantic to me, like if you are going to be THIS strict might aswell argue that the only true RPGs are games that adapt Tabletop rulesets like Baldur's Gate and Pathfinder Kingmaker/Wrath of The Righteous, but that would be silly wouldn't it?
                        
The way I understand the difference between jrpg and rpg: 

Jrpgs are usually narrative driven games with customizable characters (lvls, skills, equipment, etc.) based on the ttrpg mechanics. There are alternative endings but usually narratives are the same across play throughs.

What makes western rpgs distinct, I believe, from Jrpgs is the fact that they usually emphasize player choices in game that affect the narrative and world state (such as your alignment good/evil, factions you side with, people you kill.) Mass Effect and Witcher both have world states that carry choices across their trilogies, which would make them rpgs even if made by a Japanese company. Similarly, Souls games by most I think would be considered rpgs and not jrpgs even though made in Japan because of the world state aspect.
                    how very reductive, while they are japanese and rpgs, several of these would definitely be more accurately described in other ways.

Three Hopes is more like Hack and Slash rpgs like Hyrule Warriors in my opinion.

GB Relink plays more like a MonHun than any standard jrpg.

Nier games are also fairly hack and slash, with a splash of giant action adventure boss battling, and play very similarly to their…sister games i guess, the Drakengard series.

so i would agree with @Lord_Mikal. less jrpg than the others.
                Persona 5 strikers also isn't a jrpg. It's literally not even an rpg. The person making this meme clearly hasn't played many titles...
                Meh, they kinda are though. If it’s an RPG made in Japan I’m calling it a JRPG. All of these games are fantastic either way.
                How are they not? They’re RPG games made in Japan.
                 Rpgs were easier to distinguish until they started to become action games. I remember when Zelda was  considered an action adventure game. No one ever called it an RPG until probably around the start of the PS3  era.  I still prefer to keep turn base games as rpgs and action adventure games as such.
                    because thats how these lables work imagine calling 4X simulators RTS games. that makes no sense and for those who dont know what those are its like calling star craft a sid miers civ game or vice versa.
                are you PLAYING a ROLE in a story driven world?  
Are you made by the japanese?  
You are a JRPG  
Are you PLAYING a ROLE in a story driven world?  
were you made by what is considered a western power? (EU, NA)  
You are a Western RPG  
is your combat more active and not turn based?  
You are in the subgenre Action RPG  
so Scarlet. You are an "Action JRPG"
                    By your definition, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is a JRPG.
                        Technically yes. In the same sense that ice is technically lava, since water is a mineral-based component and in its solid form it would technically be considered a crystalline rock and in its liquid form it would be considered lava which by definition is liquid mineral.

That's why sub genres exist, technically honeypop is a western RPG because it definitely has a story element but it's also a puzzle. So it would be a puzzle Western RPG. Well also being an excellent source of smut.

The definition of RPG is broad which is why there are like 61 or so sub genres for it on steam. Japanese being it was made by the Japanese, I'm not going to have it be made by the Japanese and call it an Italian RPG, that would be stupid.

Is it an RPG, sure, was it made by the Japanese, of course it was. It is a Japanese RPG puzzle.
Just because it's not a genre that was officially recognized at the time or is very popular, that is how it will be scientifically and historically labeled. Dr robotnik's mean bean machine, if it is driven by story mechanics. And you play an active role as a character in that story not as an observer then it would be a JRPG. However Tetris is not an RPG, first you don't play a role you are an operator, you have no character, you have no thing representing you other than your input into the game directly from the pad.

Pretty sure Tetris doesn't have a story.

Except for maybe to seize the means of production and throw down the proletariat comrade!

As long as it can be categorizes as an RPG, well Bob's your uncle.

The Jurassic Park for the classic game boy, though it was produced by Nintendo and it may have even been written by the Japanese is technically a Western ARPG as you play Dr Grant, and a side scroll action adventure, cuz it is a Western IP with a Japanese development team.

The IP itself would have to be an original creation of a Japanese mind like the final fantasy series, Bayonetta would be a Japanese ARPG.

Street fighter would not because that falls underneath the genre of a fighting game and beat him up and know there can be stories you can represent multiple characters. It's subtle.

Doom would not be an RPG cuz even though you do play doom guy and there is a light story it is a first-person shooter because it is a first person viewpoint and the only form of combat is shooting your weapons or chainsaw or fists or whatever.

You don't actually interact with any other characters except enemies when playing Doom, at least the classic one. However the modern doom would be a Western RPG shooter.

You interact with civil characters, you actually have a choice during one of the DLCs. That can change the story and how it evolves though barely any at all

Ultimately it comes down to the classification of RPG. And how it can differentiate.

Whether it's Western or Japanese or Pollock, or Martian. Depends entirely on the original IPs creation and source material.

If a western developer which has happened several times with independent games. Uses the RPG Maker software to make a term base final fantasy style RPG but they are definitely not Japanese. Then the storytelling would be a Western RPG, with turn-based elements.

Japanese is not an adjective of playstyle, it is a source, it is from Japan, the IP was created in Japan, it is Japanese.

The Witcher, is from the West, it is a western RPG
                Those 3 are jrpgs
                Why are you guys so concerned with what label to put on the games just play them n be done with it simple as that
It is but it's kinda weird, like the Bond Episodes are too much and too important since not only lore is locked behind it but Bond level too. Also the story is confusing, a lot of things look like they are huge but then don't go anywhere, are completely forgotten or are resolved too fast without any real repercussion to how hyped it was going to become. Of course I won't spoil here but people who played know what I'm talking about.
    I love the action in this game and the art style, but I agree that the bond episodes can be a little much.  Also the plot, which starts out strong, eventually goes off the rails a bit.
        Definitely hoping that if they make a second one, since they’ve nigh perfected the combat system, they can focus more on crafting a perfect story, including making the “social link” aspect of the game a bit better.
    Well, the name of this game "Nexus" somehow implied me that relationship between partners which called Bond Episodes was important and big part to this game.

The context conform to its topic actually.
        Well, a lot is very unimportant, which is fine on a 70h game and sprinkled here and there. Now on a 20h game, that woul be 10h without it?
Specially after Phase 9, where the story gets serious, spending an hour watching bond episodes before you can continue is high key annoying.
    >a lot of things look like they are huge but then don't go anywhere

Could you give an example?
        The "civil war" when that char is transformed in an Other, that bitch that we fight like 3x then just vanish, very much alive, after a while and is never mentioned again, everything about Suoh... just to name a few
            Yeah ok i guess youre right
Xenoblade erasure
    Xenoblade is critically acclaimed by all metrics. It's not underrated.
        So is NieR Replicant, and Star Ocean, and Fire Emblem, and Persona 5, and Octopath Traveler 2, and Trails of Cold Steel, and Ys, and Granblue Fantasy. All games that--*checks notes*--appear in this meme.

Fascinating...
            People confuse underrated with not being popular enough
            Not persona 5 but persona five strikers, the weird dynasty warriors clone
                It’s actually much more than that. It feels like a persona action game rather than a dynasty warriors game. It was the only warriors type game I could enjoy since it didn’t even feel like one.
                    Yeh its basically persona 5 with action combat. Even the dungeons feel like persona 5 dungeons. Not just big map with strongholds you have to kill 500 soldiers to take over.
                        Weird?
                            Not weird, good.
                        I heard somewhere that P5 was originally gonna ditch TBC  for mor Action based, but that was scrapped. I like to imagine that idea was put in to motion with Strikers.
                            Maybe but PStudio didnt even make Strikers Koei Techmo did
                        HOLY SHIT IS THAT A TAKE OVER REFERENCE
                    no its definitly a musuo game but with persona elements. as per the other musuo games that are collab titles like the LOZ musuo game and even the fire emblem musuo game they have their own little charm and gameplay to draw from. sure you dont choose stages like in the normal musuo games but you choose the  palace (the stage you want to do) and roam the areas while dispatching huge hordes of enemies which is all musuo games are.
                    I will say that I personally do like Warriors games but I also think Fire Emblem: Three Hopes & Hyrule Warriors (original, not Age of Calamity or w/e) also feel more like action spinoffs of their original franchises than warrior games. Would recommend if you're a fan of either series

Edit: both games are closer to warriors than persona 5 strikers is to be clear, but i still think they do a good job seperating themselves from the rest of the warriors game
            Well at least for the fire emblem and persona games (cause idk about most of the others), it was the spinoffs where were well rated (like 9/10) but barely broke a million sold vs the original games which sold many times that. Its well rated but relatively unknown/underplayed for how good the games were
        Yes people forget it gets high 80s and low 90s scores
        Persona and fire emblem are right there
    Meh that game literally put me to sleep. The combat was boring. Since gameplay is mostly combat i couldnt stay up long enough get anywhere  substantial in the campaign. I kind of wish i knew it was gonna play like an mmo but i didnt get that vibe from the ads.
        the 1st game's combat is Drakengard levels of donkey doo. The rest of the Blade games have amazing combat, tho X's is very confusing and has a negative number of tutorials
            Hard disagree on 1’s combat being outright bad. It’s good, just not as great as the rest.
                Much like... Pretty much every game ever, the gameplay really shines once you get further in. The superbosses are peak combat design, and *IMMENSELY* satisfying to defeat.
                    Yeah but the games i mentioned in my reply have way better and more satisfying combat systems that i was able to enjoy from the jump. Its one thing for the dev to not throw everything at you at once so its not overwhelming but i dont like it when im being introduced to key battle mechanics 4 or 5hrs into the game.
                I like the action rpgs that have systems more like nioh or tales of berseria or ff7remake. And xenoblade 1 was not it. It felt more like an anime version of dragons age inquisition. I thought it was gonna be like tales.
            I disagree completely with your statement but "donkey doo" is probably a new favorite phrase for me.
    Maybe xenogear. Not xenoblade
    Xenoblade X maybe.
Arise is underrated...how?
    i think they are bowing to the 3 in front because those have gotten far less recognition. all the ones on the bottom have gotten tons of public recognition.

at least that’s my interpretation
        I simply don't agree if that's the interpretation.  Tales of arise is bordering mainstream jrpg with 3 million sales pre being on any subscription service and was very well reviewed, in fact the highest reviewed is I am not mistaken.
            not bowing like those three are more known, bowing like showing respect for the lesser known.

i think i messed up what i meant
                Replicant and Gestalt are definitely overshadowed by Automata when it comes to public interest.  It may have done well but it still lives in Automata's shadow in regards to mainstream acknowledgement, so I understand that one there.  


Star Ocean in general is usually that series that most have heard about but haven't played as far as mainstream goes.  


Scarlet Nexus speaks for itself lol.  I've played it and liked it but yeah I hear no one ever mentioning it.
                    Which is so sad because I think replicant and gestalt have a far better story and cast of characters than automata. But 2b wins because of her ass🥲
                        ngl I wouldn't be surprised if a large part of why Automata gets all the attention it gets is because of how recognizable 2B is as a character.  Not even including the ass.  She's just a very cool, attractive, and stand-out as a game character in general before even getting to dat ass lol.  


Tho I think the main thing is that Automata came out with a lot of mainstream hype whereas the original Nier had more of a cult following in the first place.  That cult following probably helped carry Automata's hype but at the time you'd need to get an Xbox 360 to find out why when Automata you could just get on modern systems.  


Gestalt/Replicant walked so Automata could run, basically.
    More like overrated, did they fix the dogshit companion AI or is it still as garbage as it was at launch?
        Dunno but that isn't even on my list of complaints for arise but I do have a metric ton of them.  I don't think having the final boss of the game appear should make me bark out a laugh of derision because of how much of a stupid asspull It was.
As a massive Tales fan Arise is heavily over rated not underrated
    Agreed, especially given how it passed the 3 million mark in terms of sales. People seem to like it a lot, but I dislike it for its combat and story, which are pretty pivotal in an action rpg. I'd put Neo Twewy on this list though.
    For real. I didn't even finish the game, I've only beaten like 1/3rd and kinda just can't find time nor motivation to continue for now. It's kinda mediocre not gonna lie. The short scenes where characters talk with each other are so unnecessary and cringe, you can't walk 5 steps without getting another one. Removing this shit alone would make the game much more enjoyable.

I only tried it because it looked kinda similiar to Scarlet Nexus which I loved and I've seen a bunch of people saying Arise is better. I felt scammed.
    I still can’t fucking believe it won RPG of the year.
I have very much enjoyed all of these. A shame there might not be any more SN…
Loving granblue relink. I got it because it was a game of a series I liked and really didn't expect much. ***Holy fuck*** I was wrong to not expect a lot, it's really fun
    A buddy picked up granblue delink as a gift for me. I’d never heard of the gacha or fighting game before, so I don’t care about the world much, but the game itself is super super fun
        It's best to watch the anime if you want to understand the world and characters a bit better, anyway. There's quite a bit of context you don't have if you play the game first
I feel like JARPG aren’t going anywhere. Game sales aren’t mega stellar 500million copies sold, but their gameplay/features continue to creep into mainstream gaming. Unicorn Overlord will be a success, and will probably be Vanillawares highest selling title of all time. FFVII rebirth will continue to show people the merits of action JRPG, and bring their gameplay to a mainstream audience. I agree that the genre is under appreciated atm, but I think we can expect more good stuff in the future.
just got my platinum trophy in Scarlet Nexus. can confirm it is super good! absolutely LOVE the gameplay and SAS combos and brain crush is SOOO satisfying!
i wish it could have been ported to switch
Ah yes, well known underrated games like persona, fire emblem and nier
    yeah this post is a total circlejerk
    Nier: replicant is barely talked about compared to Automota.

That persona game is very clearly Persona 5: Strikers, which is often overlooked when compared to all the mainline games, even though it’s a very good game and sequel in its own right.

And I don’t know much about fire emblem really…
        >fire emblem

Its one of the most popular Nintendo franchisees and the mobile game made 61mill USD just in 2023

>Persona 5: Strikers

Not really? I see it get talked about way more then tactica or dancing due to it actually being a sequel
            Oh I know what fire emblem is, just not about that specific game and why it may be considered underrated.
                Three Hopes is a spin off game made by the people who did Dynasty Warriors so it was a third person hack and slash rather than the top down tactical turn based game that main FE games are. Rather than being a continuation of Three Houses storyline (which would’ve been nearly impossible to do) it was kinda like a big fan fiction which played with the idea of how the story would have been different if certain events had been altered. 

It definitely appealed to a pretty narrow section of the fanbase, but I personally loved it.
    Tbf they chose their spin off games. I’ve never met another person who played Three Hopes (but I personally loved it).
        I played through all of the endings for three hopes and loved it too, it did all the things I wanted another fodlan game to do.
Code Vein anyone?
    So underrated that it’s not even in the underrated memes..
    Code vein was more raw than it had reason to be. I would have liked a better weapon system but it was less about that. Also the tie in to God eater?? More please :] The god eater-code vein link hasn't even been discussed much despite the anime for God eater being pretty fantastic. Hopefully there's a bit more development in that connection in the form of a game soon
Nier Replicant is so underrated. I don’t understand it.
    Replicants vibe was so good, better than Automata imo, i just wish Replicant was longer and had more content
        100% agree. I feel like replicant really hit that Zelda feeling for me. Automata felt too complicated by comparison.
            Yeah I absolutely love Automata still and it’s always going to be in my gold standard of video games but Replicant just hit different
Maybe it’s the setting and tone combination being so unique, you have these lively typical JRPG locations but then you remember The Aerie exists
Not to mention how insane the final act is 🤌 absolute 10/10 game
    Honestly? I disagree, the game was painfully boring whether it was the combat or even the story.
        Filtered, I'm afraid
Astral Chain
    Looking for this one
        You should. It's like scarlet nexus but better in every way imo. For the record I love both games but you can't beat the platinum style and quality.
            I meant looking for this comment lol. Working on 100% Astral Chain 🙌 Great game!
                Hell yeah, I'll keep spreading the gospel elsewhere then.
SCARLET NEXUS MENTIONED(I know it’s the sub but still nobody talks about it enough)
Isn't Granblue Relink a massive success?
P5strikers isn’t a game that should be here. I’ve played it and enjoyed it but it’s another warrior type game that gets boring real fast if you have played other warrior type games
My dude most of these games have large followings and did super well. To put Replicant in here and act like it alone was underrated is insane to me. It literally was insanely popular on release and to this day has a huge following. Tales was also said to be huge when it came out. What are you smoking. I'm not even in this community but holy hell is this meme bad lol
Shitpost?
A good majority of games here aren’t underrated at all
Granblue fantasy relink literally has one of the top concurrent player bases in steam😂😂
Really? Tales of arise is considered underrated?
...but it's a tales game.
Tales of Arise sold 3m units and Relink sold 1m in less than 2 weeks. Hardly underrated.
Scarlet Nexus will forever be a masterpiece
Scarlet nexus isnt a hidden gem, It had its time in the sun it was simi popular, bandai namco is known for these anime esq games they randomly put out like CodeVein or God Eater. Your just another one of those. Not even to the level of god eater because that filled a neich before Monster Hunter World. that was popular enough due to its neich to warent 2 good selling games and God eater 3 which was good but world killed it before it released.
Nier Replicant has a decent story and amazing music but the gameplay is honestly awful and super repetitive.
Arise and relink are not under rated. They both sold and performed really well.
Yooo Ys fan here! I will never tire of Adol Christin. I'm even more excited because Ys X English was announced for Fall 24 by NISA. Playing Dana and Nox at the moment. Had Seven for a while. Love them all.
    Ys 8 is a masterpiece and I'll politely argue with anyone who disagrees.

Sunshine Coastline is the best start to any adventure, ever.
        Still my favorite action game
i just assume you put nier on the side only because it actually garnered attention..?
    Yes
Tales of arise is a savage
Wait why is Tales of Arise here? Definitely among the best for Tales of games. Vesperia and Arise are my top.
This picture reminds me of the opening episodes of Solo Leveling. I'm assuming it is from the Manga that anime is based on?
    It's a webtoon
I dont think Nier Replicant is underrated tbh. It's overshadowed by Automata but everyone is aware of Replicant's existence and its sales are high as well. It's the second most selling JPRG on this list right under Tales of Arise.

Its not overrated too. It's right in between.
I recently got into tales of arise, and completely forgot it was the game that collaborated with scarlet nexus. I was surprised when I recognized stuff lmao
Seeing as I read "scarlet nexus" and pictured "tales of arise" in my head maybe this is true
Astral Chain is underrated
Scarlet Nexus is a perfectly rated mid game. The story is an incoherent mess.
    Respectfully Disagree, Scarlet Nexus was amazing to me, loved every second of it.
SCARLET NEXUS MENTIONED
WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING
stumbling upon granblue fantasy relink has opened my eyes to a universe of action-jrpgs.

Hate to hijack your topic, but what would you recommend for me next?  I kinda burned out on GBFR and even though they just released a new raid, its kind of exhausting and I think I need to let it sit for a bit.

I play on steam btw.

Strangers of paradise really caught my eye and its on sale.  Tales of arise and scarlet nexus are on sale as well.
    I would recommend Scarlet Nexus of course! The game is amazing In opinion. love the characters so much and the combat is S tier. One of the slept most slept on rpgs of all time. Other action rpgs of I would recommend: Final Fantasy VII Remake, NieR:Automata (these two are must plays in opinion), NieR Replicant ver1.22. I would've put Final Fantasy XVI on here too but it's still  only on PS5 right now but whenever it comes to Steam, this game is another must play. The Eikon boss are some of the greatest boss fights ever created in all of gaming (especially the one where you fight bahaumut) it's a crime that it didn't get nominated for game of the year last year
        appreciate it!  nier has been on my list for a long time so I think that will move up in priority.  there was a tales and scarlet bundle on steam for the spring sale so i grabbed that.  i've heard great things about ff16.  The ffvii game that just came out looks pretty amazing, but it'll be awhile for that to be on pc.
Please tell me this is a shitpost
putting scarlet over  nier is kind of crazy ngl
Astral Chain deserves more recognition.
Does astral chain count there?
13 sentinels should be the one on the big chair
    I recently bought it on sale the other week as the art style looks awesome but im hessitant to start playing it as it looks like one hell of a commitment
        maybe mentally but not really with time, it took me like 40 hours

like that can be a lot for some people but not so much in terms of rpgs
            Oh im happy to sink hundereds of hours into a game it’s purely down to learning the new game mechanics that 13-S will have as it seems like nothing ive ever played
                oh the gameplay isn't that deep don't worry it's kinda like baby's first rts
    13 sents deadass has one of the greatest stories ever told and it’s criminal it’s slept on
I never finished this game cause I put it down (i have no memory why)

But I love the artstyle and animation of this game. Its definitly the best looking anime game I've every played and probably ever will. The only other one that comes close are the nier games.

when I come back I'll definitly restart cause I don't remember the controls anyway.

I guess its preference or whatever, but I think games like tales of arise look really ugly, and the characters running look very poor and feel terrible. But this game has none of that stuff, art looks fantastic, running looks amazing and feels nice, combat is fluid.

I also loved the bond episodes and just relaxing at the hangout
Absolutely. One of the last jrpgs along with tales of arise I absolutely loved. Combat in scarlett is beautifully fluid and best in class for any genre in my book. Exactly the kind of game I love and one of the few I can't wait to hopefully play a sequel to.
All of these games suck. I feel the only way to make them better is for vanillaware to port muramasa the demon blade to ps5. I want to play through all the dlc campaigns. These games aint shit. They need a muramasa the demon blade port to be better.We...no I need muramasa the demon blade ported to current gen systems.
If we count the 90s and 2000s too there's a LOT of names you can put in this photo man.
Nier Replicant was good but there are way too many endings and it's very tedious replaying it over and over again
    I get that but it was totally worth it
Scarlet Nexus was the only bearable game of these I played.
    Music was a banger.

DREAM IN DRIVE
    I really enjoyed cold steel 4 and arise tho
        I got to Cysloden in Arise. It was cool. The characters are kinda dry. 

Scarlet Nexus has some interesting characters
Is octopath traveler ii better than the 1st one?
    Yes, by literally every metric imo
my partner and i both love Automata, they just finished Replicant while I’ve been playing Elden Ring and they said it was very mid and underwhelming compared to Automata. do people feel strongly about it?
Not even close to as good as GBFR!
Nahhhhh, Octopath 2 is the most underrated JRPG of all time. It has the potential to hit a way wider audience because it isn’t super typical with the voice acting and mechanics and things like that. No cute cat chicks with huge boobs, just a really solid game that built up on the first one in ALL the best ways.
13 Sentinels is a JRPG? (Never finished it so idk)
Where's Crystar bro
SAO Alicziation Lycoris  and Phantasy Star Universe outta be up there side by side with SN
Fire emblem three hopes and persona 5 strikers barley constitute as rpg’s, they are musuo games with an existing rpg paint. Still good
Ys was wilddd play that game on shrooms
The term jrpg has gotten very lax i see
Another JRPG I dont hear anyone talking about is Robotrek (aka Slapstick in Japan) for the SNES (it's old so that's probably why)

I never finished it, but from what I remember it was really cool concept of creating your own robot and allocating stat points to your liking. Great soundtrack too!
Scarlet Nexus has an 80 on Metacritic.  It's appropriately rated.
[all good choices, but not even close](https://www.escapistmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/skies-of-arcadia-remaster.jpg?fit=1280%2C720)
Played my first playthings for Yuito and was so confused with all the memory blanks and mystery, til it all unraveled at the end thinking "this makes so much sense!" It's a well drawn game.
I keep forgetting to pick up Star Ocean Second Story R.
Is Scarlet Nexus a RRG tho?
I be in the kitchen whippin', Tryna cook the soft
Game is boring ass hell
Since when was Cold Steel underrated
Why Fate/Remnant there and not Fate/Extra
Y'all forget dark cloud 1 and 2(dark chronicle)
Ok scarlet nexus is actually good but its not better than octopath 2
King of underrated for english speakers is astlibra tbh 20000 overwhelmingly positive reviews but 90% are foreigners and the subreddit is sitting at 600 members
Where The Fuck Is Blue Reflection
Almost all these games should not even be on that list.
Meanwhile, im sitting here sad that Scarlet Nexus, Code Vein or Astral Chain aren’t getting a second game…
Err....
I think calling Scarlet Nexus a JRPG is kinda generous. It's pretty loose on those elements.
Tales of Besaria?
Scarlet nexus was fire
Persona and fire emblem underrated? Lol.
The gods of not jrpgs
I really enjoyed the game but the combat got too repetitive for me which is odd because it is repetitive in most games but I couldn't keep going.
scarlet nexus should be prostrating to fire emblem
I remember hearing about near and I always got it confused with Scarlett Nexus I never played any of them or heard about them but I always looked at Scarlett Nexus and I thought it looked so cool and I have not played it yet I have played near and I love that game probably one of my top favorite games of all time but do you think I should start Scarlett Nexus and I just want to know what you like about it because I am going to get it eventually but what do you like about it
    Characters, story, art style, combat, music. I love literally everything about Scarlet Nexus. I know that there's a demo on PS4 & PS5 if you wanna try it out. I'm not too sure about PC & Xbox
Tales of arise is so fun
Scarlet nexus was like a 7/10 I'd say it's properly rated
    Respectfully disagree, Scarlet Nexus is a 9/10 for me easyily, I loved every second of it. One of my favorite RPGs of all time.
        Sure, to each their own I'm glad you enjoyed it that much.
I don’t know if Tales of Arise is underrated. I enjoyed most of my time with it, but I feel like the second half of the game is significantly weaker than the first. I feel like it reduces the complexity of the story into something much more generic. The combat also just started to drag for me by the end. It’s not bad, but I don’t feel it’s some hidden masterpiece.
The combat was certainly dope
I bought Scarlet Nexus and played for 5 hours but could not get into it. Help me see the light…
Absolutely!
Haven’t seen anything but unanimous praise for Star Ocean 2nd
I loved playing Scarlet Nexus and the action combat and music really stood out to me as welcoming title to game pass for me. Dealt with losing my save data a few times but once I got past that it held up to be a really fun and involved game. Agreeable that the plot got a little off the rails at some points, thought the ending of the game was slightly underwhelming but to be fair I like how the plot resolved. I feel one area of the game (covered in snow) got closed off and had its plot wrapped up way too quickly. The game may be confusing if you don’t play both stories but for me I only played Kasane’s story as I really only cared for her pov, the other story was from the perspective of a confused protagonist who hardly solved any mysteries where as Kasane was actually uncovering the plot. I enjoyed it overall but I do agree the games plot could’ve used just a bit more direction
Funnily enough, I’m playing arise right now
Was Scarlet Nexus actually good? Or was it just underrated? 

I have a deep feeling that it isn't anywhere as good as Nier: A/R. I'd rather not waste a bunch of time with a game that's unrealistically put on the same pedestal as Nier.

Also questionable with having 13 Sentinels bowing to any of the other games presented here.
NieR, Octopath, and Tales are very popular
Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah son,  13 sentinels is the real hidden gem
Well, I can understand your feeling. I haven't played many games. I started to play game when I went to work so that I can earn money to buy PS4 or PS5 etc...

SN on sale was on June,2021. But I bought it thanks to 60% discount at that time which was on December 2023.

Before I bought, my memory about this game was that I had watched a popular streamer in my region playing it at 2021. The memory was still a blur.

This game pretty fit my favor. So I still look forward to a sequel.
Yes, to a T
I would say Scarlet Nexus deserves more credit but for underrated gems the Trails Series shines hard and I say this as a fan of both games
My biggest gripe with Scarlet is that the story quality in both narrative direction and character interactions were designed around kasane as the focal point. Yuito's perspective of the main story had a few interesting moments, maybe. As a whole, it was a safe structure of making him seem like a shining paragon with no faults with the typical shounen trope of having his female team mates crushing on and the bros praising him and giving him complete authority as a ROOKIE. He was flat and boring.

I find it so fascinating how even Yuito himself as a character was given so much more perspective and development AS AN NPC from Kasane's perspective of the story. Even his teammates are more impactful and are explored more deeply from Kasane's perspective. You literally don't get to see most of what every character struggles through and grows from unless it's from Kasane's perspective. 

If SN gets a sequel. I'm willing to bet Yuito will be a side character bar none, save MAYBE as a supporting character in office. I'm not trying to say Yuito deserves better, I'm just so weirded out how jarring the quality differences are.
    I had heard many people said like what you mentioned.
Yuito's personality was too pure and positive.And his platoon member often took something seriously just like him.
At Kasane side, she and her platoon got nagative context. Like Shiden's  sarcastic words , "Lazy Arashi"
A spy mom and a moon assassin.
As you can see , disadvantages can improve a lot.

When this game designed having two protagonists,
the two main character should be a clear contrast.
Bro put a fucking persona 5 game but not the world ends with you im crying
The only reason I know of tails of arise and grand blue fantasy is because of youtube sponsorships
You'll get even less recognition when Stellar Blade is out
the only game I jaw dropped and cried alot in the end  
not to mention final battle was peak
3 houses is definitely better than scarlet nexus lol
Can Scarlet Nexus be considered a JRPG, though? I thought it had to be turn-based to be a JRPG.
Where is EDF?
Give replicant that middle spot and we should be all good
code vein too
Always happy to see Ys recognition.
GBF:R isn't a JRPG. It's more like an ARPG from Japan, kind of like Monster Hunter.
Twewy where?
Nier replicant is the goat 🐐
Cries in astral chain
It could have been if the bond episodes weren’t written by a third grader.
Star Ocean in general.
As much as I like SNX... Tales of Arise will always be the one for me especially the ending... Maybe if SNX 2 somehow comes out then maybe
Ok, if you are gonna put p5 strikers in there, you gotta put p2, come on
Some games are destined to be underrated,but fans can save it from that by talking about it everywhere or making fan arts or stuff if they can, I did that in the past for adol or ys series the few games I love but some people told me they never heard about it but maybe if u show Ur love for Ur favourite games more 
then alot of people will remember adol Christin or others.
I enjoyed the gameplay, but the story is all over the place, very hard to follow.
damn Trails of cold steel is underrated? bro i’ve re-played that series so many times
I hope they make another one the gameplay was lots of fun.
Bro put 3 hopes in there and thought we wouldn’t notice.
I've played almost all of those and yeah scarlet nexus was a great surprise! Tales of arise was pretty great too, that year was a good jrpg harvest lol
Lmao like a 3rd of these aren't underrated
Also a steam deck banger.
The gameplay and art direction is what kept me coming back tbh. I don't really enjoy much else about it outside of maybe one or two characters. The story is way too out there for me and really didn't need a time travel element.
HEY! SCARLET NEXUS! GET OUT OF NIERS SEAT! YOU COCKY BASTARD.
I have scarlet nexus installed never opened it I do see it’s potential since it’s by bandinamco
relink is an action rpg though?
    Yes
Out of the ones here I’ve played, the issue is that they’re niche. Three Hopes basically only works if you’re a Houses fan, Replicant’s gameplay was improved but only to the point of being okay, and Nexus is a combination of several different mostly niche games with story told in a highly unusual way and a branching story that’s practically pointless, P5S only really works if you’re a persona fan, and Octopath 2 has the issue of everyone who played 1 and didn’t like it not giving 2 a chance. Also I’m not sure fate, atelier, and tales are exactly underrated
Scarlet nexus is horrible.
P5S underrated fr
better than replicant? what a joke 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wouldn't say fate remnant is underrated at all. It's consistently rated above average, which is what it is.
Umm, Tales of Arise won tons of major RPG and JRPG awards, in the same year that Scarlet Nexus released... I played both at launch and loved both of them. However, I enjoyed Tales far more. The story telling through the bond episodes became a bit too tedious.
    I loved the bond episodes, so much so that I purchased the dlc that included the ex bond episodes because I just wanted more of them. In the dlc you were also able  to unlock bond episodes to learn more about Karen Travers. His extra bond episodes showed more context on why he wanted to save Alice so badly (Hanabi's Aunt). They made feel sympathetic towards Karen and made understand why he did the things he did to save her, they made appreciate his character much more. I think Karen was a well written antagonist and that's yet another reason why I loved this game so much
I actually just found the Ys games so I’m glad to see some representation
Good to see star ocean up there I love those games ever since I played them on the PSP.
Phantasy star
The enemies in this game are such massive damage sponges, even on normal difficulty. The devs know it too since they added an very easy mode on top of the normal easy mode. The game is actually pretty tolerable on very easy mode
I agree Octopath traveler 2 is severely ignored. Persona 5 strikers is not a jrpg it’s a hack and slash.
I tried to play Nier Replicant but for some reason I had this weird issue where my game would like hitch up for like 20 seconds every few minutes then go right back up to 60 fps, couldn't play it because the hitches would get me killed a lot
Scarlet Nexus was such a good game.
Man I wanna get into Ys 8 on Switch but the performance seemed terrible, I’ll wait to see that new Ys game coming to Switch
    I highy recommend you watch Digital Foundry's tech review of Ys X Nordics to see how that game runs on switch. It seems to be a bit better than the Ys 8 & Ys 9 switch ports.
Star ocean 2nd story? That game got me to know Enix along with Valkyrie profile
In no fucking universe are GBF Relink and Octopath 2 bowing down to Scarlet Nexus.
I haven't played Scarlet Nexus yet,  but I've heard good things.   I might just pick it up and give it a shot.
    Do it!
Would you call a Musuo style game a jrpg? I mean on a very technical level Three Hopes is both Japanese and an RPG, I just feel weird calling a warriors game a jrpg
This is just an ungodly misinformed opinion
What is Scarlet Nexus?
    This right here is exactly what I'm talking about. Not enough people are aware of this incredible game. Which is a shame because to me, this one greatest Action RPGs of all time, easyily some of the most fun I ever had playing a game.
        How much is it?
            The Deluxe addition is on sale right now for $14.39 on PlayStation. Unfortunately, it's still full price $60 on Xbox & Steam but there's a free demo to try out the game on all 3 platforms. It's also less than $14 right now on Amazon.
To be fair most of them are bland and generic
I know blood aint putting strikers doen there, thats crazy
Meanwhile on the frontier, the Wild Arms franchise whistles
Final fantasy 9 should be here since people always overlook it in favor of 7 and 8
Trails and Ys should be up there instead of Nexus and Star Ocean lol
Excuse me why is neir here its not underrated nor is alot of these
May be a hot take but fate samurai remnant sucked ass. I personally didn't like it.
Can you toss Xenoblade onto that list too?
Persona 5 Strikers is better than Royal and I will die on that hill.

Trails of Cold Steel IV though? Nah, that game has abysmal pacing, long winded cutscenes, and (imo) a really crappy plot, which is made even worse because it had to pay off the *eight* games that were made before it and couldn’t stand on its own merits. But even if it *was* a stand alone game, it would still be bad. The gameplay is okay, even good at times, but those games need an editor badly. Because Cold Steel is four games long, but it only has two games’ worth of content.
Tales of arise. That's not even the best tales game. Those are the best
Is fate/samurai remnant an rpg I assumed it was a VN
someone never played .hack. thats an underrated jrpg.
is scarlet nexus that good???? I played the first few hours and I already felt it was repetitive. Does it get better later on?
    Yes. The story will blow your mind
        Thanks! Yeah, it’s actually more gameplay wise that I was worried! Might give it another chance… the soundtrack was cool!
Code vein
Dude I never talk about this game cause I thought it was some garbage I just liked the combats so goddamn fluid
I would hardly call Persona 5 underrated
Dot hack?
Sorry but, switch nexus with trails
Actually playing through P5Strikers currently, I recommend it. Just save often because infinite loading screens happen to be a problem. Also, Octopath Traveler 2 is great. Should I play Tales of Arise after?
It is
Most of the games shown are not JRPGs
    which ones?
        Nier Replicant, Three Hopes, and 13 Sentinels for starters.

Edit: [What is a JRPG?](https://youtu.be/f5YWOWHUNaE?si=sX8ZPcH5gBdL0t2a) TLDW: JRPGs are not "RPGs made in Japan."
            They're Japanese, and they're Role-Playing Games. Sounds like JRPGs to me.
                yep, if its japan made, an anime, and an rpg, its jrpg automatically for me
                Just because a game is japanese doesn't make it a jrpg. That's like calling The Dark souls games jrpgs. Tales of Arise, Neir, and Grandblue Relink are action rpgs. And Persona Strikes is a Musou game with persons skills and fusion added to the gameplay.
                    I thought "action RPG" is a subgenre of RPG, therefore those games are at a higher level an RPG game, therefore they are JRPG?

For reference Yoko Taro himself invoked the statement that NieR "is an RPG" as the explanation for why they have progression systems lol
                    I thought jrpg ate like ff games and tales games. Where as loz are just rpg. Dmc is arpg. 

Apparently anything with leveling system is an rpg of some kind. 

Doom has no leveling system, you just pick up weapons and kill shit. 

That's was always my understanding
                        LOZ (legend of zelda) is not a ARPG. it is an action adventure game. excluding legend of zelda 2 links quest where thats an actual RPG because it has actual RPG elements and systems.
                    Tales is most definitely a jrpg, and one of the longest running in fact. Saying it's not is like saying Final Fantasy isn't.
                    lol i literally call myself a jrpg fan coz those are my main games named above so idk, idk its the same arguement as ARPGs, which i learned last year thats what dark souls actually is
                    idk how to break it to you, but dark souls is a jrpg
                        no the fuck its not its a souls like game which is its own genre which it created and if you wanna be that person and not use souls like its an ARPG action role playing game which most definitly it is. the whole JRPG is literally like someone had said a RPG made in japan. if you dont know what a JRPG is then you need to go culture yourself.
                            By your definition they are partly JRPGs though, From Soft is a Japanese company.
                                It's either a jrpg or not there is no such thing as a JARPG no body is using that because if it was a thing then we've been mis labeling all the tales of games which supercede dark souls.
                            You do realize that a game can fit into many different categories at once don’t you?
                            first of all, chill out, no need to go crazy. second, “Souls-like” is a shit descriptor for games, and should never have become one. it encompasses pretty much any game with exploration, leveling, and big punishing gameplay or bosses. which is super generic, “Metroidvania” is also a crap “genre”, encompassing sprawling side-scrolling maps and exploration, sequential weapon upgrades, and big, punishing bosses.

a good example of why this sucks is a game like Hollow Knight, which unsuprisingly, can have both of those applied because there is functionally no difference to them, except the 2D aspect.

sorry to everyone for the rant.
                                Bruh you chose to the first thing and not the rest. I literally explained what darksouls it I didn't stick to the whole souls-like. And there is a something that souls like games have is when you die you spawn at last checkpoint so you can run it back with the boss. Some metroidvania games depending if they have Rouge-like elements when you die you game over, there is no checkpoint. For example blood stained is a metroidvania ,why because when you die you game over restart from last save.i didn't play hollow knight because the Fandom is as cringe as undertale and Steven universe but I'm pretty sure when you die it's game over restart form last save. Hell here's a nother one in blazblue entropy effect it has metroidvania in 1 section of the game and it's a Rouge like so if you die game over restart whole game. There are better ways to explain how a game is. Here's one I'll give some genre stuff and I bet it literally labels like every game ever in the category. 2-D action adventure platformer with upgrades for the main character. Bet you didn't think I was talking about super Mario hell because I was talking about risk of rain.its OK for sub categories like metroidvania and souls like who cares if you think they are crap everyone is sick of saying 2-D action adventure platformer it's so blanket. Don't even get started with 3-d games you can't even describe games if you just say action RPG. Is it kingdom hearts, DMC, Bayonetta, or darksouls.
                The amount of genre purists here baffles me. I have been gaming aince the mid 90s and can say that yes, a lot of these games wouldn't be called jRPGs or even RPGs at that era or the 2000s even.

 The definition of what fits into a genre however is flexible and changes over time, especially with a genre as  broad as the RPG genre where anything from having customizable MCs, level/xp/perk/loot based progression and agency over plot direction via narrative choices classifies a game as an RPG. 

An honest question: if franchises like Mass Effect or The Witcher - all considered RPGs even though they are a departure from the traditional tabletop inspired turn based formula - were developed in Japan would they be considered jRPGs even though they deviate from the traditional formula of being turn based? In my opinion they would given they fit the most basic definition: a RPG made in Japan. To argue otherwise because of over 3 decades old criteria just seems like being needless pedantic to me, like if you are going to be THIS strict might aswell argue that the only true RPGs are games that adapt Tabletop rulesets like Baldur's Gate and Pathfinder Kingmaker/Wrath of The Righteous, but that would be silly wouldn't it?
                    
The way I understand the difference between jrpg and rpg: 

Jrpgs are usually narrative driven games with customizable characters (lvls, skills, equipment, etc.) based on the ttrpg mechanics. There are alternative endings but usually narratives are the same across play throughs.

What makes western rpgs distinct, I believe, from Jrpgs is the fact that they usually emphasize player choices in game that affect the narrative and world state (such as your alignment good/evil, factions you side with, people you kill.) Mass Effect and Witcher both have world states that carry choices across their trilogies, which would make them rpgs even if made by a Japanese company. Similarly, Souls games by most I think would be considered rpgs and not jrpgs even though made in Japan because of the world state aspect.
                how very reductive, while they are japanese and rpgs, several of these would definitely be more accurately described in other ways.

Three Hopes is more like Hack and Slash rpgs like Hyrule Warriors in my opinion.

GB Relink plays more like a MonHun than any standard jrpg.

Nier games are also fairly hack and slash, with a splash of giant action adventure boss battling, and play very similarly to their…sister games i guess, the Drakengard series.

so i would agree with @Lord_Mikal. less jrpg than the others.
            Persona 5 strikers also isn't a jrpg. It's literally not even an rpg. The person making this meme clearly hasn't played many titles...
            Meh, they kinda are though. If it’s an RPG made in Japan I’m calling it a JRPG. All of these games are fantastic either way.
            How are they not? They’re RPG games made in Japan.
             Rpgs were easier to distinguish until they started to become action games. I remember when Zelda was  considered an action adventure game. No one ever called it an RPG until probably around the start of the PS3  era.  I still prefer to keep turn base games as rpgs and action adventure games as such.
                because thats how these lables work imagine calling 4X simulators RTS games. that makes no sense and for those who dont know what those are its like calling star craft a sid miers civ game or vice versa.
            are you PLAYING a ROLE in a story driven world?  
Are you made by the japanese?  
You are a JRPG  
Are you PLAYING a ROLE in a story driven world?  
were you made by what is considered a western power? (EU, NA)  
You are a Western RPG  
is your combat more active and not turn based?  
You are in the subgenre Action RPG  
so Scarlet. You are an "Action JRPG"
                By your definition, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is a JRPG.
                    Technically yes. In the same sense that ice is technically lava, since water is a mineral-based component and in its solid form it would technically be considered a crystalline rock and in its liquid form it would be considered lava which by definition is liquid mineral.

That's why sub genres exist, technically honeypop is a western RPG because it definitely has a story element but it's also a puzzle. So it would be a puzzle Western RPG. Well also being an excellent source of smut.

The definition of RPG is broad which is why there are like 61 or so sub genres for it on steam. Japanese being it was made by the Japanese, I'm not going to have it be made by the Japanese and call it an Italian RPG, that would be stupid.

Is it an RPG, sure, was it made by the Japanese, of course it was. It is a Japanese RPG puzzle.
Just because it's not a genre that was officially recognized at the time or is very popular, that is how it will be scientifically and historically labeled. Dr robotnik's mean bean machine, if it is driven by story mechanics. And you play an active role as a character in that story not as an observer then it would be a JRPG. However Tetris is not an RPG, first you don't play a role you are an operator, you have no character, you have no thing representing you other than your input into the game directly from the pad.

Pretty sure Tetris doesn't have a story.

Except for maybe to seize the means of production and throw down the proletariat comrade!

As long as it can be categorizes as an RPG, well Bob's your uncle.

The Jurassic Park for the classic game boy, though it was produced by Nintendo and it may have even been written by the Japanese is technically a Western ARPG as you play Dr Grant, and a side scroll action adventure, cuz it is a Western IP with a Japanese development team.

The IP itself would have to be an original creation of a Japanese mind like the final fantasy series, Bayonetta would be a Japanese ARPG.

Street fighter would not because that falls underneath the genre of a fighting game and beat him up and know there can be stories you can represent multiple characters. It's subtle.

Doom would not be an RPG cuz even though you do play doom guy and there is a light story it is a first-person shooter because it is a first person viewpoint and the only form of combat is shooting your weapons or chainsaw or fists or whatever.

You don't actually interact with any other characters except enemies when playing Doom, at least the classic one. However the modern doom would be a Western RPG shooter.

You interact with civil characters, you actually have a choice during one of the DLCs. That can change the story and how it evolves though barely any at all

Ultimately it comes down to the classification of RPG. And how it can differentiate.

Whether it's Western or Japanese or Pollock, or Martian. Depends entirely on the original IPs creation and source material.

If a western developer which has happened several times with independent games. Uses the RPG Maker software to make a term base final fantasy style RPG but they are definitely not Japanese. Then the storytelling would be a Western RPG, with turn-based elements.

Japanese is not an adjective of playstyle, it is a source, it is from Japan, the IP was created in Japan, it is Japanese.

The Witcher, is from the West, it is a western RPG
            Those 3 are jrpgs
            Why are you guys so concerned with what label to put on the games just play them n be done with it simple as that
I love the action in this game and the art style, but I agree that the bond episodes can be a little much.  Also the plot, which starts out strong, eventually goes off the rails a bit.
    Definitely hoping that if they make a second one, since they’ve nigh perfected the combat system, they can focus more on crafting a perfect story, including making the “social link” aspect of the game a bit better.
Well, the name of this game "Nexus" somehow implied me that relationship between partners which called Bond Episodes was important and big part to this game.

The context conform to its topic actually.
    Well, a lot is very unimportant, which is fine on a 70h game and sprinkled here and there. Now on a 20h game, that woul be 10h without it?
Specially after Phase 9, where the story gets serious, spending an hour watching bond episodes before you can continue is high key annoying.
>a lot of things look like they are huge but then don't go anywhere

Could you give an example?
    The "civil war" when that char is transformed in an Other, that bitch that we fight like 3x then just vanish, very much alive, after a while and is never mentioned again, everything about Suoh... just to name a few
        Yeah ok i guess youre right
Xenoblade is critically acclaimed by all metrics. It's not underrated.
    So is NieR Replicant, and Star Ocean, and Fire Emblem, and Persona 5, and Octopath Traveler 2, and Trails of Cold Steel, and Ys, and Granblue Fantasy. All games that--*checks notes*--appear in this meme.

Fascinating...
        People confuse underrated with not being popular enough
        Not persona 5 but persona five strikers, the weird dynasty warriors clone
            It’s actually much more than that. It feels like a persona action game rather than a dynasty warriors game. It was the only warriors type game I could enjoy since it didn’t even feel like one.
                Yeh its basically persona 5 with action combat. Even the dungeons feel like persona 5 dungeons. Not just big map with strongholds you have to kill 500 soldiers to take over.
                    Weird?
                        Not weird, good.
                    I heard somewhere that P5 was originally gonna ditch TBC  for mor Action based, but that was scrapped. I like to imagine that idea was put in to motion with Strikers.
                        Maybe but PStudio didnt even make Strikers Koei Techmo did
                    HOLY SHIT IS THAT A TAKE OVER REFERENCE
                no its definitly a musuo game but with persona elements. as per the other musuo games that are collab titles like the LOZ musuo game and even the fire emblem musuo game they have their own little charm and gameplay to draw from. sure you dont choose stages like in the normal musuo games but you choose the  palace (the stage you want to do) and roam the areas while dispatching huge hordes of enemies which is all musuo games are.
                I will say that I personally do like Warriors games but I also think Fire Emblem: Three Hopes & Hyrule Warriors (original, not Age of Calamity or w/e) also feel more like action spinoffs of their original franchises than warrior games. Would recommend if you're a fan of either series

Edit: both games are closer to warriors than persona 5 strikers is to be clear, but i still think they do a good job seperating themselves from the rest of the warriors game
        Well at least for the fire emblem and persona games (cause idk about most of the others), it was the spinoffs where were well rated (like 9/10) but barely broke a million sold vs the original games which sold many times that. Its well rated but relatively unknown/underplayed for how good the games were
    Yes people forget it gets high 80s and low 90s scores
    Persona and fire emblem are right there
Meh that game literally put me to sleep. The combat was boring. Since gameplay is mostly combat i couldnt stay up long enough get anywhere  substantial in the campaign. I kind of wish i knew it was gonna play like an mmo but i didnt get that vibe from the ads.
    the 1st game's combat is Drakengard levels of donkey doo. The rest of the Blade games have amazing combat, tho X's is very confusing and has a negative number of tutorials
        Hard disagree on 1’s combat being outright bad. It’s good, just not as great as the rest.
            Much like... Pretty much every game ever, the gameplay really shines once you get further in. The superbosses are peak combat design, and *IMMENSELY* satisfying to defeat.
                Yeah but the games i mentioned in my reply have way better and more satisfying combat systems that i was able to enjoy from the jump. Its one thing for the dev to not throw everything at you at once so its not overwhelming but i dont like it when im being introduced to key battle mechanics 4 or 5hrs into the game.
            I like the action rpgs that have systems more like nioh or tales of berseria or ff7remake. And xenoblade 1 was not it. It felt more like an anime version of dragons age inquisition. I thought it was gonna be like tales.
        I disagree completely with your statement but "donkey doo" is probably a new favorite phrase for me.
Maybe xenogear. Not xenoblade
Xenoblade X maybe.
i think they are bowing to the 3 in front because those have gotten far less recognition. all the ones on the bottom have gotten tons of public recognition.

at least that’s my interpretation
    I simply don't agree if that's the interpretation.  Tales of arise is bordering mainstream jrpg with 3 million sales pre being on any subscription service and was very well reviewed, in fact the highest reviewed is I am not mistaken.
        not bowing like those three are more known, bowing like showing respect for the lesser known.

i think i messed up what i meant
            Replicant and Gestalt are definitely overshadowed by Automata when it comes to public interest.  It may have done well but it still lives in Automata's shadow in regards to mainstream acknowledgement, so I understand that one there.  


Star Ocean in general is usually that series that most have heard about but haven't played as far as mainstream goes.  


Scarlet Nexus speaks for itself lol.  I've played it and liked it but yeah I hear no one ever mentioning it.
                Which is so sad because I think replicant and gestalt have a far better story and cast of characters than automata. But 2b wins because of her ass🥲
                    ngl I wouldn't be surprised if a large part of why Automata gets all the attention it gets is because of how recognizable 2B is as a character.  Not even including the ass.  She's just a very cool, attractive, and stand-out as a game character in general before even getting to dat ass lol.  


Tho I think the main thing is that Automata came out with a lot of mainstream hype whereas the original Nier had more of a cult following in the first place.  That cult following probably helped carry Automata's hype but at the time you'd need to get an Xbox 360 to find out why when Automata you could just get on modern systems.  


Gestalt/Replicant walked so Automata could run, basically.
More like overrated, did they fix the dogshit companion AI or is it still as garbage as it was at launch?
    Dunno but that isn't even on my list of complaints for arise but I do have a metric ton of them.  I don't think having the final boss of the game appear should make me bark out a laugh of derision because of how much of a stupid asspull It was.
Agreed, especially given how it passed the 3 million mark in terms of sales. People seem to like it a lot, but I dislike it for its combat and story, which are pretty pivotal in an action rpg. I'd put Neo Twewy on this list though.
For real. I didn't even finish the game, I've only beaten like 1/3rd and kinda just can't find time nor motivation to continue for now. It's kinda mediocre not gonna lie. The short scenes where characters talk with each other are so unnecessary and cringe, you can't walk 5 steps without getting another one. Removing this shit alone would make the game much more enjoyable.

I only tried it because it looked kinda similiar to Scarlet Nexus which I loved and I've seen a bunch of people saying Arise is better. I felt scammed.
I still can’t fucking believe it won RPG of the year.
A buddy picked up granblue delink as a gift for me. I’d never heard of the gacha or fighting game before, so I don’t care about the world much, but the game itself is super super fun
    It's best to watch the anime if you want to understand the world and characters a bit better, anyway. There's quite a bit of context you don't have if you play the game first
yeah this post is a total circlejerk
Nier: replicant is barely talked about compared to Automota.

That persona game is very clearly Persona 5: Strikers, which is often overlooked when compared to all the mainline games, even though it’s a very good game and sequel in its own right.

And I don’t know much about fire emblem really…
    >fire emblem

Its one of the most popular Nintendo franchisees and the mobile game made 61mill USD just in 2023

>Persona 5: Strikers

Not really? I see it get talked about way more then tactica or dancing due to it actually being a sequel
        Oh I know what fire emblem is, just not about that specific game and why it may be considered underrated.
            Three Hopes is a spin off game made by the people who did Dynasty Warriors so it was a third person hack and slash rather than the top down tactical turn based game that main FE games are. Rather than being a continuation of Three Houses storyline (which would’ve been nearly impossible to do) it was kinda like a big fan fiction which played with the idea of how the story would have been different if certain events had been altered. 

It definitely appealed to a pretty narrow section of the fanbase, but I personally loved it.
Tbf they chose their spin off games. I’ve never met another person who played Three Hopes (but I personally loved it).
    I played through all of the endings for three hopes and loved it too, it did all the things I wanted another fodlan game to do.
So underrated that it’s not even in the underrated memes..
Code vein was more raw than it had reason to be. I would have liked a better weapon system but it was less about that. Also the tie in to God eater?? More please :] The god eater-code vein link hasn't even been discussed much despite the anime for God eater being pretty fantastic. Hopefully there's a bit more development in that connection in the form of a game soon
Replicants vibe was so good, better than Automata imo, i just wish Replicant was longer and had more content
    100% agree. I feel like replicant really hit that Zelda feeling for me. Automata felt too complicated by comparison.
        Yeah I absolutely love Automata still and it’s always going to be in my gold standard of video games but Replicant just hit different
Maybe it’s the setting and tone combination being so unique, you have these lively typical JRPG locations but then you remember The Aerie exists
Not to mention how insane the final act is 🤌 absolute 10/10 game
Honestly? I disagree, the game was painfully boring whether it was the combat or even the story.
    Filtered, I'm afraid
Looking for this one
    You should. It's like scarlet nexus but better in every way imo. For the record I love both games but you can't beat the platinum style and quality.
        I meant looking for this comment lol. Working on 100% Astral Chain 🙌 Great game!
            Hell yeah, I'll keep spreading the gospel elsewhere then.
Ys 8 is a masterpiece and I'll politely argue with anyone who disagrees.

Sunshine Coastline is the best start to any adventure, ever.
    Still my favorite action game
Yes
It's a webtoon
Respectfully Disagree, Scarlet Nexus was amazing to me, loved every second of it.
I would recommend Scarlet Nexus of course! The game is amazing In opinion. love the characters so much and the combat is S tier. One of the slept most slept on rpgs of all time. Other action rpgs of I would recommend: Final Fantasy VII Remake, NieR:Automata (these two are must plays in opinion), NieR Replicant ver1.22. I would've put Final Fantasy XVI on here too but it's still  only on PS5 right now but whenever it comes to Steam, this game is another must play. The Eikon boss are some of the greatest boss fights ever created in all of gaming (especially the one where you fight bahaumut) it's a crime that it didn't get nominated for game of the year last year
    appreciate it!  nier has been on my list for a long time so I think that will move up in priority.  there was a tales and scarlet bundle on steam for the spring sale so i grabbed that.  i've heard great things about ff16.  The ffvii game that just came out looks pretty amazing, but it'll be awhile for that to be on pc.
I recently bought it on sale the other week as the art style looks awesome but im hessitant to start playing it as it looks like one hell of a commitment
    maybe mentally but not really with time, it took me like 40 hours

like that can be a lot for some people but not so much in terms of rpgs
        Oh im happy to sink hundereds of hours into a game it’s purely down to learning the new game mechanics that 13-S will have as it seems like nothing ive ever played
            oh the gameplay isn't that deep don't worry it's kinda like baby's first rts
13 sents deadass has one of the greatest stories ever told and it’s criminal it’s slept on
I get that but it was totally worth it
Music was a banger.

DREAM IN DRIVE
I really enjoyed cold steel 4 and arise tho
    I got to Cysloden in Arise. It was cool. The characters are kinda dry. 

Scarlet Nexus has some interesting characters
Yes, by literally every metric imo
Characters, story, art style, combat, music. I love literally everything about Scarlet Nexus. I know that there's a demo on PS4 & PS5 if you wanna try it out. I'm not too sure about PC & Xbox
Respectfully disagree, Scarlet Nexus is a 9/10 for me easyily, I loved every second of it. One of my favorite RPGs of all time.
    Sure, to each their own I'm glad you enjoyed it that much.
I had heard many people said like what you mentioned.
Yuito's personality was too pure and positive.And his platoon member often took something seriously just like him.
At Kasane side, she and her platoon got nagative context. Like Shiden's  sarcastic words , "Lazy Arashi"
A spy mom and a moon assassin.
As you can see , disadvantages can improve a lot.

When this game designed having two protagonists,
the two main character should be a clear contrast.
Yes
I loved the bond episodes, so much so that I purchased the dlc that included the ex bond episodes because I just wanted more of them. In the dlc you were also able  to unlock bond episodes to learn more about Karen Travers. His extra bond episodes showed more context on why he wanted to save Alice so badly (Hanabi's Aunt). They made feel sympathetic towards Karen and made understand why he did the things he did to save her, they made appreciate his character much more. I think Karen was a well written antagonist and that's yet another reason why I loved this game so much
I highy recommend you watch Digital Foundry's tech review of Ys X Nordics to see how that game runs on switch. It seems to be a bit better than the Ys 8 & Ys 9 switch ports.
Do it!
This right here is exactly what I'm talking about. Not enough people are aware of this incredible game. Which is a shame because to me, this one greatest Action RPGs of all time, easyily some of the most fun I ever had playing a game.
    How much is it?
        The Deluxe addition is on sale right now for $14.39 on PlayStation. Unfortunately, it's still full price $60 on Xbox & Steam but there's a free demo to try out the game on all 3 platforms. It's also less than $14 right now on Amazon.
Yes. The story will blow your mind
    Thanks! Yeah, it’s actually more gameplay wise that I was worried! Might give it another chance… the soundtrack was cool!
which ones?
    Nier Replicant, Three Hopes, and 13 Sentinels for starters.

Edit: [What is a JRPG?](https://youtu.be/f5YWOWHUNaE?si=sX8ZPcH5gBdL0t2a) TLDW: JRPGs are not "RPGs made in Japan."
        They're Japanese, and they're Role-Playing Games. Sounds like JRPGs to me.
            yep, if its japan made, an anime, and an rpg, its jrpg automatically for me
            Just because a game is japanese doesn't make it a jrpg. That's like calling The Dark souls games jrpgs. Tales of Arise, Neir, and Grandblue Relink are action rpgs. And Persona Strikes is a Musou game with persons skills and fusion added to the gameplay.
                I thought "action RPG" is a subgenre of RPG, therefore those games are at a higher level an RPG game, therefore they are JRPG?

For reference Yoko Taro himself invoked the statement that NieR "is an RPG" as the explanation for why they have progression systems lol
                I thought jrpg ate like ff games and tales games. Where as loz are just rpg. Dmc is arpg. 

Apparently anything with leveling system is an rpg of some kind. 

Doom has no leveling system, you just pick up weapons and kill shit. 

That's was always my understanding
                    LOZ (legend of zelda) is not a ARPG. it is an action adventure game. excluding legend of zelda 2 links quest where thats an actual RPG because it has actual RPG elements and systems.
                Tales is most definitely a jrpg, and one of the longest running in fact. Saying it's not is like saying Final Fantasy isn't.
                lol i literally call myself a jrpg fan coz those are my main games named above so idk, idk its the same arguement as ARPGs, which i learned last year thats what dark souls actually is
                idk how to break it to you, but dark souls is a jrpg
                    no the fuck its not its a souls like game which is its own genre which it created and if you wanna be that person and not use souls like its an ARPG action role playing game which most definitly it is. the whole JRPG is literally like someone had said a RPG made in japan. if you dont know what a JRPG is then you need to go culture yourself.
                        By your definition they are partly JRPGs though, From Soft is a Japanese company.
                            It's either a jrpg or not there is no such thing as a JARPG no body is using that because if it was a thing then we've been mis labeling all the tales of games which supercede dark souls.
                        You do realize that a game can fit into many different categories at once don’t you?
                        first of all, chill out, no need to go crazy. second, “Souls-like” is a shit descriptor for games, and should never have become one. it encompasses pretty much any game with exploration, leveling, and big punishing gameplay or bosses. which is super generic, “Metroidvania” is also a crap “genre”, encompassing sprawling side-scrolling maps and exploration, sequential weapon upgrades, and big, punishing bosses.

a good example of why this sucks is a game like Hollow Knight, which unsuprisingly, can have both of those applied because there is functionally no difference to them, except the 2D aspect.

sorry to everyone for the rant.
                            Bruh you chose to the first thing and not the rest. I literally explained what darksouls it I didn't stick to the whole souls-like. And there is a something that souls like games have is when you die you spawn at last checkpoint so you can run it back with the boss. Some metroidvania games depending if they have Rouge-like elements when you die you game over, there is no checkpoint. For example blood stained is a metroidvania ,why because when you die you game over restart from last save.i didn't play hollow knight because the Fandom is as cringe as undertale and Steven universe but I'm pretty sure when you die it's game over restart form last save. Hell here's a nother one in blazblue entropy effect it has metroidvania in 1 section of the game and it's a Rouge like so if you die game over restart whole game. There are better ways to explain how a game is. Here's one I'll give some genre stuff and I bet it literally labels like every game ever in the category. 2-D action adventure platformer with upgrades for the main character. Bet you didn't think I was talking about super Mario hell because I was talking about risk of rain.its OK for sub categories like metroidvania and souls like who cares if you think they are crap everyone is sick of saying 2-D action adventure platformer it's so blanket. Don't even get started with 3-d games you can't even describe games if you just say action RPG. Is it kingdom hearts, DMC, Bayonetta, or darksouls.
            The amount of genre purists here baffles me. I have been gaming aince the mid 90s and can say that yes, a lot of these games wouldn't be called jRPGs or even RPGs at that era or the 2000s even.

 The definition of what fits into a genre however is flexible and changes over time, especially with a genre as  broad as the RPG genre where anything from having customizable MCs, level/xp/perk/loot based progression and agency over plot direction via narrative choices classifies a game as an RPG. 

An honest question: if franchises like Mass Effect or The Witcher - all considered RPGs even though they are a departure from the traditional tabletop inspired turn based formula - were developed in Japan would they be considered jRPGs even though they deviate from the traditional formula of being turn based? In my opinion they would given they fit the most basic definition: a RPG made in Japan. To argue otherwise because of over 3 decades old criteria just seems like being needless pedantic to me, like if you are going to be THIS strict might aswell argue that the only true RPGs are games that adapt Tabletop rulesets like Baldur's Gate and Pathfinder Kingmaker/Wrath of The Righteous, but that would be silly wouldn't it?
                
The way I understand the difference between jrpg and rpg: 

Jrpgs are usually narrative driven games with customizable characters (lvls, skills, equipment, etc.) based on the ttrpg mechanics. There are alternative endings but usually narratives are the same across play throughs.

What makes western rpgs distinct, I believe, from Jrpgs is the fact that they usually emphasize player choices in game that affect the narrative and world state (such as your alignment good/evil, factions you side with, people you kill.) Mass Effect and Witcher both have world states that carry choices across their trilogies, which would make them rpgs even if made by a Japanese company. Similarly, Souls games by most I think would be considered rpgs and not jrpgs even though made in Japan because of the world state aspect.
            how very reductive, while they are japanese and rpgs, several of these would definitely be more accurately described in other ways.

Three Hopes is more like Hack and Slash rpgs like Hyrule Warriors in my opinion.

GB Relink plays more like a MonHun than any standard jrpg.

Nier games are also fairly hack and slash, with a splash of giant action adventure boss battling, and play very similarly to their…sister games i guess, the Drakengard series.

so i would agree with @Lord_Mikal. less jrpg than the others.
        Persona 5 strikers also isn't a jrpg. It's literally not even an rpg. The person making this meme clearly hasn't played many titles...
        Meh, they kinda are though. If it’s an RPG made in Japan I’m calling it a JRPG. All of these games are fantastic either way.
        How are they not? They’re RPG games made in Japan.
         Rpgs were easier to distinguish until they started to become action games. I remember when Zelda was  considered an action adventure game. No one ever called it an RPG until probably around the start of the PS3  era.  I still prefer to keep turn base games as rpgs and action adventure games as such.
            because thats how these lables work imagine calling 4X simulators RTS games. that makes no sense and for those who dont know what those are its like calling star craft a sid miers civ game or vice versa.
        are you PLAYING a ROLE in a story driven world?  
Are you made by the japanese?  
You are a JRPG  
Are you PLAYING a ROLE in a story driven world?  
were you made by what is considered a western power? (EU, NA)  
You are a Western RPG  
is your combat more active and not turn based?  
You are in the subgenre Action RPG  
so Scarlet. You are an "Action JRPG"
            By your definition, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is a JRPG.
                Technically yes. In the same sense that ice is technically lava, since water is a mineral-based component and in its solid form it would technically be considered a crystalline rock and in its liquid form it would be considered lava which by definition is liquid mineral.

That's why sub genres exist, technically honeypop is a western RPG because it definitely has a story element but it's also a puzzle. So it would be a puzzle Western RPG. Well also being an excellent source of smut.

The definition of RPG is broad which is why there are like 61 or so sub genres for it on steam. Japanese being it was made by the Japanese, I'm not going to have it be made by the Japanese and call it an Italian RPG, that would be stupid.

Is it an RPG, sure, was it made by the Japanese, of course it was. It is a Japanese RPG puzzle.
Just because it's not a genre that was officially recognized at the time or is very popular, that is how it will be scientifically and historically labeled. Dr robotnik's mean bean machine, if it is driven by story mechanics. And you play an active role as a character in that story not as an observer then it would be a JRPG. However Tetris is not an RPG, first you don't play a role you are an operator, you have no character, you have no thing representing you other than your input into the game directly from the pad.

Pretty sure Tetris doesn't have a story.

Except for maybe to seize the means of production and throw down the proletariat comrade!

As long as it can be categorizes as an RPG, well Bob's your uncle.

The Jurassic Park for the classic game boy, though it was produced by Nintendo and it may have even been written by the Japanese is technically a Western ARPG as you play Dr Grant, and a side scroll action adventure, cuz it is a Western IP with a Japanese development team.

The IP itself would have to be an original creation of a Japanese mind like the final fantasy series, Bayonetta would be a Japanese ARPG.

Street fighter would not because that falls underneath the genre of a fighting game and beat him up and know there can be stories you can represent multiple characters. It's subtle.

Doom would not be an RPG cuz even though you do play doom guy and there is a light story it is a first-person shooter because it is a first person viewpoint and the only form of combat is shooting your weapons or chainsaw or fists or whatever.

You don't actually interact with any other characters except enemies when playing Doom, at least the classic one. However the modern doom would be a Western RPG shooter.

You interact with civil characters, you actually have a choice during one of the DLCs. That can change the story and how it evolves though barely any at all

Ultimately it comes down to the classification of RPG. And how it can differentiate.

Whether it's Western or Japanese or Pollock, or Martian. Depends entirely on the original IPs creation and source material.

If a western developer which has happened several times with independent games. Uses the RPG Maker software to make a term base final fantasy style RPG but they are definitely not Japanese. Then the storytelling would be a Western RPG, with turn-based elements.

Japanese is not an adjective of playstyle, it is a source, it is from Japan, the IP was created in Japan, it is Japanese.

The Witcher, is from the West, it is a western RPG
        Those 3 are jrpgs
        Why are you guys so concerned with what label to put on the games just play them n be done with it simple as that
Definitely hoping that if they make a second one, since they’ve nigh perfected the combat system, they can focus more on crafting a perfect story, including making the “social link” aspect of the game a bit better.
Well, a lot is very unimportant, which is fine on a 70h game and sprinkled here and there. Now on a 20h game, that woul be 10h without it?
Specially after Phase 9, where the story gets serious, spending an hour watching bond episodes before you can continue is high key annoying.
The "civil war" when that char is transformed in an Other, that bitch that we fight like 3x then just vanish, very much alive, after a while and is never mentioned again, everything about Suoh... just to name a few
    Yeah ok i guess youre right
So is NieR Replicant, and Star Ocean, and Fire Emblem, and Persona 5, and Octopath Traveler 2, and Trails of Cold Steel, and Ys, and Granblue Fantasy. All games that--*checks notes*--appear in this meme.

Fascinating...
    People confuse underrated with not being popular enough
    Not persona 5 but persona five strikers, the weird dynasty warriors clone
        It’s actually much more than that. It feels like a persona action game rather than a dynasty warriors game. It was the only warriors type game I could enjoy since it didn’t even feel like one.
            Yeh its basically persona 5 with action combat. Even the dungeons feel like persona 5 dungeons. Not just big map with strongholds you have to kill 500 soldiers to take over.
                Weird?
                    Not weird, good.
                I heard somewhere that P5 was originally gonna ditch TBC  for mor Action based, but that was scrapped. I like to imagine that idea was put in to motion with Strikers.
                    Maybe but PStudio didnt even make Strikers Koei Techmo did
                HOLY SHIT IS THAT A TAKE OVER REFERENCE
            no its definitly a musuo game but with persona elements. as per the other musuo games that are collab titles like the LOZ musuo game and even the fire emblem musuo game they have their own little charm and gameplay to draw from. sure you dont choose stages like in the normal musuo games but you choose the  palace (the stage you want to do) and roam the areas while dispatching huge hordes of enemies which is all musuo games are.
            I will say that I personally do like Warriors games but I also think Fire Emblem: Three Hopes & Hyrule Warriors (original, not Age of Calamity or w/e) also feel more like action spinoffs of their original franchises than warrior games. Would recommend if you're a fan of either series

Edit: both games are closer to warriors than persona 5 strikers is to be clear, but i still think they do a good job seperating themselves from the rest of the warriors game
    Well at least for the fire emblem and persona games (cause idk about most of the others), it was the spinoffs where were well rated (like 9/10) but barely broke a million sold vs the original games which sold many times that. Its well rated but relatively unknown/underplayed for how good the games were
Yes people forget it gets high 80s and low 90s scores
Persona and fire emblem are right there
the 1st game's combat is Drakengard levels of donkey doo. The rest of the Blade games have amazing combat, tho X's is very confusing and has a negative number of tutorials
    Hard disagree on 1’s combat being outright bad. It’s good, just not as great as the rest.
        Much like... Pretty much every game ever, the gameplay really shines once you get further in. The superbosses are peak combat design, and *IMMENSELY* satisfying to defeat.
            Yeah but the games i mentioned in my reply have way better and more satisfying combat systems that i was able to enjoy from the jump. Its one thing for the dev to not throw everything at you at once so its not overwhelming but i dont like it when im being introduced to key battle mechanics 4 or 5hrs into the game.
        I like the action rpgs that have systems more like nioh or tales of berseria or ff7remake. And xenoblade 1 was not it. It felt more like an anime version of dragons age inquisition. I thought it was gonna be like tales.
    I disagree completely with your statement but "donkey doo" is probably a new favorite phrase for me.
I simply don't agree if that's the interpretation.  Tales of arise is bordering mainstream jrpg with 3 million sales pre being on any subscription service and was very well reviewed, in fact the highest reviewed is I am not mistaken.
    not bowing like those three are more known, bowing like showing respect for the lesser known.

i think i messed up what i meant
        Replicant and Gestalt are definitely overshadowed by Automata when it comes to public interest.  It may have done well but it still lives in Automata's shadow in regards to mainstream acknowledgement, so I understand that one there.  


Star Ocean in general is usually that series that most have heard about but haven't played as far as mainstream goes.  


Scarlet Nexus speaks for itself lol.  I've played it and liked it but yeah I hear no one ever mentioning it.
            Which is so sad because I think replicant and gestalt have a far better story and cast of characters than automata. But 2b wins because of her ass🥲
                ngl I wouldn't be surprised if a large part of why Automata gets all the attention it gets is because of how recognizable 2B is as a character.  Not even including the ass.  She's just a very cool, attractive, and stand-out as a game character in general before even getting to dat ass lol.  


Tho I think the main thing is that Automata came out with a lot of mainstream hype whereas the original Nier had more of a cult following in the first place.  That cult following probably helped carry Automata's hype but at the time you'd need to get an Xbox 360 to find out why when Automata you could just get on modern systems.  


Gestalt/Replicant walked so Automata could run, basically.
Dunno but that isn't even on my list of complaints for arise but I do have a metric ton of them.  I don't think having the final boss of the game appear should make me bark out a laugh of derision because of how much of a stupid asspull It was.
It's best to watch the anime if you want to understand the world and characters a bit better, anyway. There's quite a bit of context you don't have if you play the game first
>fire emblem

Its one of the most popular Nintendo franchisees and the mobile game made 61mill USD just in 2023

>Persona 5: Strikers

Not really? I see it get talked about way more then tactica or dancing due to it actually being a sequel
    Oh I know what fire emblem is, just not about that specific game and why it may be considered underrated.
        Three Hopes is a spin off game made by the people who did Dynasty Warriors so it was a third person hack and slash rather than the top down tactical turn based game that main FE games are. Rather than being a continuation of Three Houses storyline (which would’ve been nearly impossible to do) it was kinda like a big fan fiction which played with the idea of how the story would have been different if certain events had been altered. 

It definitely appealed to a pretty narrow section of the fanbase, but I personally loved it.
I played through all of the endings for three hopes and loved it too, it did all the things I wanted another fodlan game to do.
100% agree. I feel like replicant really hit that Zelda feeling for me. Automata felt too complicated by comparison.
    Yeah I absolutely love Automata still and it’s always going to be in my gold standard of video games but Replicant just hit different
Maybe it’s the setting and tone combination being so unique, you have these lively typical JRPG locations but then you remember The Aerie exists
Not to mention how insane the final act is 🤌 absolute 10/10 game
Filtered, I'm afraid
You should. It's like scarlet nexus but better in every way imo. For the record I love both games but you can't beat the platinum style and quality.
    I meant looking for this comment lol. Working on 100% Astral Chain 🙌 Great game!
        Hell yeah, I'll keep spreading the gospel elsewhere then.
Still my favorite action game
appreciate it!  nier has been on my list for a long time so I think that will move up in priority.  there was a tales and scarlet bundle on steam for the spring sale so i grabbed that.  i've heard great things about ff16.  The ffvii game that just came out looks pretty amazing, but it'll be awhile for that to be on pc.
maybe mentally but not really with time, it took me like 40 hours

like that can be a lot for some people but not so much in terms of rpgs
    Oh im happy to sink hundereds of hours into a game it’s purely down to learning the new game mechanics that 13-S will have as it seems like nothing ive ever played
        oh the gameplay isn't that deep don't worry it's kinda like baby's first rts
I got to Cysloden in Arise. It was cool. The characters are kinda dry. 

Scarlet Nexus has some interesting characters
Sure, to each their own I'm glad you enjoyed it that much.
How much is it?
    The Deluxe addition is on sale right now for $14.39 on PlayStation. Unfortunately, it's still full price $60 on Xbox & Steam but there's a free demo to try out the game on all 3 platforms. It's also less than $14 right now on Amazon.
Thanks! Yeah, it’s actually more gameplay wise that I was worried! Might give it another chance… the soundtrack was cool!
Nier Replicant, Three Hopes, and 13 Sentinels for starters.

Edit: [What is a JRPG?](https://youtu.be/f5YWOWHUNaE?si=sX8ZPcH5gBdL0t2a) TLDW: JRPGs are not "RPGs made in Japan."
    They're Japanese, and they're Role-Playing Games. Sounds like JRPGs to me.
        yep, if its japan made, an anime, and an rpg, its jrpg automatically for me
        Just because a game is japanese doesn't make it a jrpg. That's like calling The Dark souls games jrpgs. Tales of Arise, Neir, and Grandblue Relink are action rpgs. And Persona Strikes is a Musou game with persons skills and fusion added to the gameplay.
            I thought "action RPG" is a subgenre of RPG, therefore those games are at a higher level an RPG game, therefore they are JRPG?

For reference Yoko Taro himself invoked the statement that NieR "is an RPG" as the explanation for why they have progression systems lol
            I thought jrpg ate like ff games and tales games. Where as loz are just rpg. Dmc is arpg. 

Apparently anything with leveling system is an rpg of some kind. 

Doom has no leveling system, you just pick up weapons and kill shit. 

That's was always my understanding
                LOZ (legend of zelda) is not a ARPG. it is an action adventure game. excluding legend of zelda 2 links quest where thats an actual RPG because it has actual RPG elements and systems.
            Tales is most definitely a jrpg, and one of the longest running in fact. Saying it's not is like saying Final Fantasy isn't.
            lol i literally call myself a jrpg fan coz those are my main games named above so idk, idk its the same arguement as ARPGs, which i learned last year thats what dark souls actually is
            idk how to break it to you, but dark souls is a jrpg
                no the fuck its not its a souls like game which is its own genre which it created and if you wanna be that person and not use souls like its an ARPG action role playing game which most definitly it is. the whole JRPG is literally like someone had said a RPG made in japan. if you dont know what a JRPG is then you need to go culture yourself.
                    By your definition they are partly JRPGs though, From Soft is a Japanese company.
                        It's either a jrpg or not there is no such thing as a JARPG no body is using that because if it was a thing then we've been mis labeling all the tales of games which supercede dark souls.
                    You do realize that a game can fit into many different categories at once don’t you?
                    first of all, chill out, no need to go crazy. second, “Souls-like” is a shit descriptor for games, and should never have become one. it encompasses pretty much any game with exploration, leveling, and big punishing gameplay or bosses. which is super generic, “Metroidvania” is also a crap “genre”, encompassing sprawling side-scrolling maps and exploration, sequential weapon upgrades, and big, punishing bosses.

a good example of why this sucks is a game like Hollow Knight, which unsuprisingly, can have both of those applied because there is functionally no difference to them, except the 2D aspect.

sorry to everyone for the rant.
                        Bruh you chose to the first thing and not the rest. I literally explained what darksouls it I didn't stick to the whole souls-like. And there is a something that souls like games have is when you die you spawn at last checkpoint so you can run it back with the boss. Some metroidvania games depending if they have Rouge-like elements when you die you game over, there is no checkpoint. For example blood stained is a metroidvania ,why because when you die you game over restart from last save.i didn't play hollow knight because the Fandom is as cringe as undertale and Steven universe but I'm pretty sure when you die it's game over restart form last save. Hell here's a nother one in blazblue entropy effect it has metroidvania in 1 section of the game and it's a Rouge like so if you die game over restart whole game. There are better ways to explain how a game is. Here's one I'll give some genre stuff and I bet it literally labels like every game ever in the category. 2-D action adventure platformer with upgrades for the main character. Bet you didn't think I was talking about super Mario hell because I was talking about risk of rain.its OK for sub categories like metroidvania and souls like who cares if you think they are crap everyone is sick of saying 2-D action adventure platformer it's so blanket. Don't even get started with 3-d games you can't even describe games if you just say action RPG. Is it kingdom hearts, DMC, Bayonetta, or darksouls.
        The amount of genre purists here baffles me. I have been gaming aince the mid 90s and can say that yes, a lot of these games wouldn't be called jRPGs or even RPGs at that era or the 2000s even.

 The definition of what fits into a genre however is flexible and changes over time, especially with a genre as  broad as the RPG genre where anything from having customizable MCs, level/xp/perk/loot based progression and agency over plot direction via narrative choices classifies a game as an RPG. 

An honest question: if franchises like Mass Effect or The Witcher - all considered RPGs even though they are a departure from the traditional tabletop inspired turn based formula - were developed in Japan would they be considered jRPGs even though they deviate from the traditional formula of being turn based? In my opinion they would given they fit the most basic definition: a RPG made in Japan. To argue otherwise because of over 3 decades old criteria just seems like being needless pedantic to me, like if you are going to be THIS strict might aswell argue that the only true RPGs are games that adapt Tabletop rulesets like Baldur's Gate and Pathfinder Kingmaker/Wrath of The Righteous, but that would be silly wouldn't it?
            
The way I understand the difference between jrpg and rpg: 

Jrpgs are usually narrative driven games with customizable characters (lvls, skills, equipment, etc.) based on the ttrpg mechanics. There are alternative endings but usually narratives are the same across play throughs.

What makes western rpgs distinct, I believe, from Jrpgs is the fact that they usually emphasize player choices in game that affect the narrative and world state (such as your alignment good/evil, factions you side with, people you kill.) Mass Effect and Witcher both have world states that carry choices across their trilogies, which would make them rpgs even if made by a Japanese company. Similarly, Souls games by most I think would be considered rpgs and not jrpgs even though made in Japan because of the world state aspect.
        how very reductive, while they are japanese and rpgs, several of these would definitely be more accurately described in other ways.

Three Hopes is more like Hack and Slash rpgs like Hyrule Warriors in my opinion.

GB Relink plays more like a MonHun than any standard jrpg.

Nier games are also fairly hack and slash, with a splash of giant action adventure boss battling, and play very similarly to their…sister games i guess, the Drakengard series.

so i would agree with @Lord_Mikal. less jrpg than the others.
    Persona 5 strikers also isn't a jrpg. It's literally not even an rpg. The person making this meme clearly hasn't played many titles...
    Meh, they kinda are though. If it’s an RPG made in Japan I’m calling it a JRPG. All of these games are fantastic either way.
    How are they not? They’re RPG games made in Japan.
     Rpgs were easier to distinguish until they started to become action games. I remember when Zelda was  considered an action adventure game. No one ever called it an RPG until probably around the start of the PS3  era.  I still prefer to keep turn base games as rpgs and action adventure games as such.
        because thats how these lables work imagine calling 4X simulators RTS games. that makes no sense and for those who dont know what those are its like calling star craft a sid miers civ game or vice versa.
    are you PLAYING a ROLE in a story driven world?  
Are you made by the japanese?  
You are a JRPG  
Are you PLAYING a ROLE in a story driven world?  
were you made by what is considered a western power? (EU, NA)  
You are a Western RPG  
is your combat more active and not turn based?  
You are in the subgenre Action RPG  
so Scarlet. You are an "Action JRPG"
        By your definition, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is a JRPG.
            Technically yes. In the same sense that ice is technically lava, since water is a mineral-based component and in its solid form it would technically be considered a crystalline rock and in its liquid form it would be considered lava which by definition is liquid mineral.

That's why sub genres exist, technically honeypop is a western RPG because it definitely has a story element but it's also a puzzle. So it would be a puzzle Western RPG. Well also being an excellent source of smut.

The definition of RPG is broad which is why there are like 61 or so sub genres for it on steam. Japanese being it was made by the Japanese, I'm not going to have it be made by the Japanese and call it an Italian RPG, that would be stupid.

Is it an RPG, sure, was it made by the Japanese, of course it was. It is a Japanese RPG puzzle.
Just because it's not a genre that was officially recognized at the time or is very popular, that is how it will be scientifically and historically labeled. Dr robotnik's mean bean machine, if it is driven by story mechanics. And you play an active role as a character in that story not as an observer then it would be a JRPG. However Tetris is not an RPG, first you don't play a role you are an operator, you have no character, you have no thing representing you other than your input into the game directly from the pad.

Pretty sure Tetris doesn't have a story.

Except for maybe to seize the means of production and throw down the proletariat comrade!

As long as it can be categorizes as an RPG, well Bob's your uncle.

The Jurassic Park for the classic game boy, though it was produced by Nintendo and it may have even been written by the Japanese is technically a Western ARPG as you play Dr Grant, and a side scroll action adventure, cuz it is a Western IP with a Japanese development team.

The IP itself would have to be an original creation of a Japanese mind like the final fantasy series, Bayonetta would be a Japanese ARPG.

Street fighter would not because that falls underneath the genre of a fighting game and beat him up and know there can be stories you can represent multiple characters. It's subtle.

Doom would not be an RPG cuz even though you do play doom guy and there is a light story it is a first-person shooter because it is a first person viewpoint and the only form of combat is shooting your weapons or chainsaw or fists or whatever.

You don't actually interact with any other characters except enemies when playing Doom, at least the classic one. However the modern doom would be a Western RPG shooter.

You interact with civil characters, you actually have a choice during one of the DLCs. That can change the story and how it evolves though barely any at all

Ultimately it comes down to the classification of RPG. And how it can differentiate.

Whether it's Western or Japanese or Pollock, or Martian. Depends entirely on the original IPs creation and source material.

If a western developer which has happened several times with independent games. Uses the RPG Maker software to make a term base final fantasy style RPG but they are definitely not Japanese. Then the storytelling would be a Western RPG, with turn-based elements.

Japanese is not an adjective of playstyle, it is a source, it is from Japan, the IP was created in Japan, it is Japanese.

The Witcher, is from the West, it is a western RPG
    Those 3 are jrpgs
    Why are you guys so concerned with what label to put on the games just play them n be done with it simple as that
Yeah ok i guess youre right
People confuse underrated with not being popular enough

        no its definitly a musuo game but with persona elements. as per the other musuo games that are collab titles like the LOZ musuo game and even the fire emblem musuo game they have their own little charm and gameplay to draw from. sure you dont choose stages like in the normal musuo games but you choose the  palace (the stage you want to do) and roam the areas while dispatching huge hordes of enemies which is all musuo games are.

Bet you didn't think I was talking about super Mario hell because I was talking about risk of rain.its OK for sub categories like metroidvania and souls like who cares if you think they are crap everyone is sick of saying 2-D action adventure platformer it's so blanket. Don't even get started with 3-d games you can't even describe games if you just say action RPG. Is it kingdom hearts, DMC, Bayonetta, or darksouls.
    The amount of genre purists here baffles me. I have been gaming aince the mid 90s and can say that yes, a lot of these games wouldn't be called jRPGs or even RPGs at that era or the 2000s even.

 The definition of what fits into a genre however is flexible and changes over time, especially with a genre as  broad as the RPG genre where anything from having customizable MCs, level/xp/perk/loot based progression and agency over plot direction via narrative choices classifies a game as an RPG. 

An honest question: if franchises like Mass Effect or The Witcher - all considered RPGs even though they are a departure from the traditional tabletop inspired turn based formula - were developed in Japan would they be considered jRPGs even though they deviate from the traditional formula of being turn based? In my opinion they would given they fit the most basic definition: a RPG made in Japan. To argue otherwise because of over 3 decades old criteria just seems like being needless pedantic to me, like if you are going to be THIS strict might aswell argue that the only true RPGs are games that adapt Tabletop rulesets like Baldur's Gate and Pathfinder Kingmaker/Wrath of The Righteous, but that would be silly wouldn't it?
        
The way I understand the difference between jrpg and rpg: 

Jrpgs are usually narrative driven games with customizable characters (lvls, skills, equipment, etc.) based on the ttrpg mechanics. There are alternative endings but usually narratives are the same across play throughs.

What makes western rpgs distinct, I believe, from Jrpgs is the fact that they usually emphasize player choices in game that affect the narrative and world state (such as your alignment good/evil, factions you side with, people you kill.) Mass Effect and Witcher both have world states that carry choices across their trilogies, which would make them rpgs even if made by a Japanese company. Similarly, Souls games by most I think would be considered rpgs and not jrpgs even though made in Japan because of the world state aspect.
    how very reductive, while they are japanese and rpgs, several of these would definitely be more accurately described in other ways.

Three Hopes is more like Hack and Slash rpgs like Hyrule Warriors in my opinion.

GB Relink plays more like a MonHun than any standard jrpg.

Nier games are also fairly hack and slash, with a splash of giant action adventure boss battling, and play very similarly to their…sister games i guess, the Drakengard series.

so i would agree with @Lord_Mikal. less jrpg than the others.
Persona 5 strikers also isn't a jrpg. It's literally not even an rpg. The person making this meme clearly hasn't played many titles...
Meh, they kinda are though. If it’s an RPG made in Japan I’m calling it a JRPG. All of these games are fantastic either way.
How are they not? They’re RPG games made in Japan.
 Rpgs were easier to distinguish until they started to become action games. I remember when Zelda was  considered an action adventure game. No one ever called it an RPG until probably around the start of the PS3  era.  I still prefer to keep turn base games as rpgs and action adventure games as such.
    because thats how these lables work imagine calling 4X simulators RTS games. that makes no sense and for those who dont know what those are its like calling star craft a sid miers civ game or vice versa.
are you PLAYING a ROLE in a story driven world?  
Are you made by the japanese?  
You are a JRPG  
Are you PLAYING a ROLE in a story driven world?  
were you made by what is considered a western power? (EU, NA)  
You are a Western RPG  
is your combat more active and not turn based?  
You are in the subgenre Action RPG  
so Scarlet. You are an "Action JRPG"
    By your definition, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is a JRPG.
        Technically yes. In the same sense that ice is technically lava, since water is a mineral-based component and in its solid form it would technically be considered a crystalline rock and in its liquid form it would be considered lava which by definition is liquid mineral.

That's why sub genres exist, technically honeypop is a western RPG because it definitely has a story element but it's also a puzzle. So it would be a puzzle Western RPG. Well also being an excellent source of smut.

The definition of RPG is broad which is why there are like 61 or so sub genres for it on steam. Japanese being it was made by the Japanese, I'm not going to have it be made by the Japanese and call it an Italian RPG, that would be stupid.

Is it an RPG, sure, was it made by the Japanese, of course it was. It is a Japanese RPG puzzle.
Just because it's not a genre that was officially recognized at the time or is very popular, that is how it will be scientifically and historically labeled. Dr robotnik's mean bean machine, if it is driven by story mechanics. And you play an active role as a character in that story not as an observer then it would be a JRPG. However Tetris is not an RPG, first you don't play a role you are an operator, you have no character, you have no thing representing you other than your input into the game directly from the pad.

Pretty sure Tetris doesn't have a story.

Except for maybe to seize the means of production and throw down the proletariat comrade!

As long as it can be categorizes as an RPG, well Bob's your uncle.

The Jurassic Park for the classic game boy, though it was produced by Nintendo and it may have even been written by the Japanese is technically a Western ARPG as you play Dr Grant, and a side scroll action adventure, cuz it is a Western IP with a Japanese development team.

The IP itself would have to be an original creation of a Japanese mind like the final fantasy series, Bayonetta would be a Japanese ARPG.

Street fighter would not because that falls underneath the genre of a fighting game and beat him up and know there can be stories you can represent multiple characters. It's subtle.

Doom would not be an RPG cuz even though you do play doom guy and there is a light story it is a first-person shooter because it is a first person viewpoint and the only form of combat is shooting your weapons or chainsaw or fists or whatever.

You don't actually interact with any other characters except enemies when playing Doom, at least the classic one. However the modern doom would be a Western RPG shooter.

You interact with civil characters, you actually have a choice during one of the DLCs. That can change the story and how it evolves though barely any at all

Ultimately it comes down to the classification of RPG. And how it can differentiate.

Whether it's Western or Japanese or Pollock, or Martian. Depends entirely on the original IPs creation and source material.

If a western developer which has happened several times with independent games. Uses the RPG Maker software to make a term base final fantasy style RPG but they are definitely not Japanese. Then the storytelling would be a Western RPG, with turn-based elements.

Japanese is not an adjective of playstyle, it is a source, it is from Japan, the IP was created in Japan, it is Japanese.

The Witcher, is from the West, it is a western RPG
Those 3 are jrpgs
Why are you guys so concerned with what label to put on the games just play them n be done with it simple as that
It’s actually much more than that. It feels like a persona action game rather than a dynasty warriors game. It was the only warriors type game I could enjoy since it didn’t even feel like one.
    Yeh its basically persona 5 with action combat. Even the dungeons feel like persona 5 dungeons. Not just big map with strongholds you have to kill 500 soldiers to take over.
        Weird?
            Not weird, good.
        I heard somewhere that P5 was originally gonna ditch TBC  for mor Action based, but that was scrapped. I like to imagine that idea was put in to motion with Strikers.
            Maybe but PStudio didnt even make Strikers Koei Techmo did
        HOLY SHIT IS THAT A TAKE OVER REFERENCE
    no its definitly a musuo game but with persona elements. as per the other musuo games that are collab titles like the LOZ musuo game and even the fire emblem musuo game they have their own little charm and gameplay to draw from. sure you dont choose stages like in the normal musuo games but you choose the  palace (the stage you want to do) and roam the areas while dispatching huge hordes of enemies which is all musuo games are.
    I will say that I personally do like Warriors games but I also think Fire Emblem: Three Hopes & Hyrule Warriors (original, not Age of Calamity or w/e) also feel more like action spinoffs of their original franchises than warrior games. Would recommend if you're a fan of either series

Edit: both games are closer to warriors than persona 5 strikers is to be clear, but i still think they do a good job seperating themselves from the rest of the warriors game
Much like... Pretty much every game ever, the gameplay really shines once you get further in. The superbosses are peak combat design, and *IMMENSELY* satisfying to defeat.
    Yeah but the games i mentioned in my reply have way better and more satisfying combat systems that i was able to enjoy from the jump. Its one thing for the dev to not throw everything at you at once so its not overwhelming but i dont like it when im being introduced to key battle mechanics 4 or 5hrs into the game.
I like the action rpgs that have systems more like nioh or tales of berseria or ff7remake. And xenoblade 1 was not it. It felt more like an anime version of dragons age inquisition. I thought it was gonna be like tales.
Replicant and Gestalt are definitely overshadowed by Automata when it comes to public interest.  It may have done well but it still lives in Automata's shadow in regards to mainstream acknowledgement, so I understand that one there.  


Star Ocean in general is usually that series that most have heard about but haven't played as far as mainstream goes.  


Scarlet Nexus speaks for itself lol.  I've played it and liked it but yeah I hear no one ever mentioning it.
    Which is so sad because I think replicant and gestalt have a far better story and cast of characters than automata. But 2b wins because of her ass🥲
        ngl I wouldn't be surprised if a large part of why Automata gets all the attention it gets is because of how recognizable 2B is as a character.  Not even including the ass.  She's just a very cool, attractive, and stand-out as a game character in general before even getting to dat ass lol.  


Tho I think the main thing is that Automata came out with a lot of mainstream hype whereas the original Nier had more of a cult following in the first place.  That cult following probably helped carry Automata's hype but at the time you'd need to get an Xbox 360 to find out why when Automata you could just get on modern systems.  


Gestalt/Replicant walked so Automata could run, basically.
Three Hopes is a spin off game made by the people who did Dynasty Warriors so it was a third person hack and slash rather than the top down tactical turn based game that main FE games are. Rather than being a continuation of Three Houses storyline (which would’ve been nearly impossible to do) it was kinda like a big fan fiction which played with the idea of how the story would have been different if certain events had been altered. 

It definitely appealed to a pretty narrow section of the fanbase, but I personally loved it.
Hell yeah, I'll keep spreading the gospel elsewhere then.
oh the gameplay isn't that deep don't worry it's kinda like baby's first rts
yep, if its japan made, an anime, and an rpg, its jrpg automatically for me
Just because a game is japanese doesn't make it a jrpg. That's like calling The Dark souls games jrpgs. Tales of Arise, Neir, and Grandblue Relink are action rpgs. And Persona Strikes is a Musou game with persons skills and fusion added to the gameplay.
    I thought "action RPG" is a subgenre of RPG, therefore those games are at a higher level an RPG game, therefore they are JRPG?

For reference Yoko Taro himself invoked the statement that NieR "is an RPG" as the explanation for why they have progression systems lol
    I thought jrpg ate like ff games and tales games. Where as loz are just rpg. Dmc is arpg. 

Apparently anything with leveling system is an rpg of some kind. 

Doom has no leveling system, you just pick up weapons and kill shit. 

That's was always my understanding
        LOZ (legend of zelda) is not a ARPG. it is an action adventure game. excluding legend of zelda 2 links quest where thats an actual RPG because it has actual RPG elements and systems.
    Tales is most definitely a jrpg, and one of the longest running in fact. Saying it's not is like saying Final Fantasy isn't.
    lol i literally call myself a jrpg fan coz those are my main games named above so idk, idk its the same arguement as ARPGs, which i learned last year thats what dark souls actually is
    idk how to break it to you, but dark souls is a jrpg
        no the fuck its not its a souls like game which is its own genre which it created and if you wanna be that person and not use souls like its an ARPG action role playing game which most definitly it is. the whole JRPG is literally like someone had said a RPG made in japan. if you dont know what a JRPG is then you need to go culture yourself.
            By your definition they are partly JRPGs though, From Soft is a Japanese company.
                It's either a jrpg or not there is no such thing as a JARPG no body is using that because if it was a thing then we've been mis labeling all the tales of games which supercede dark souls.
            You do realize that a game can fit into many different categories at once don’t you?
            first of all, chill out, no need to go crazy. second, “Souls-like” is a shit descriptor for games, and should never have become one. it encompasses pretty much any game with exploration, leveling, and big punishing gameplay or bosses. which is super generic, “Metroidvania” is also a crap “genre”, encompassing sprawling side-scrolling maps and exploration, sequential weapon upgrades, and big, punishing bosses.

a good example of why this sucks is a game like Hollow Knight, which unsuprisingly, can have both of those applied because there is functionally no difference to them, except the 2D aspect.

sorry to everyone for the rant.
                Bruh you chose to the first thing and not the rest. I literally explained what darksouls it I didn't stick to the whole souls-like. And there is a something that souls like games have is when you die you spawn at last checkpoint so you can run it back with the boss. Some metroidvania games depending if they have Rouge-like elements when you die you game over, there is no checkpoint. For example blood stained is a metroidvania ,why because when you die you game over restart from last save.i didn't play hollow knight because the Fandom is as cringe as undertale and Steven universe but I'm pretty sure when you die it's game over restart form last save. Hell here's a nother one in blazblue entropy effect it has metroidvania in 1 section of the game and it's a Rouge like so if you die game over restart whole game. There are better ways to explain how a game is. Here's one I'll give some genre stuff and I bet it literally labels like every game ever in the category. 2-D action adventure platformer with upgrades for the main character.

ngl I wouldn't be surprised if a large part of why Automata gets all the attention it gets is because of how recognizable 2B is as a character.  Not even including the ass.  She's just a very cool, attractive, and stand-out as a game character in general before even getting to dat ass lol.  


Tho I think the main thing is that Automata came out with a lot of mainstream hype whereas the original Nier had more of a cult following in the first place.  That cult following probably helped carry Automata's hype but at the time you'd need to get an Xbox 360 to find out why when Automata you could just get on modern systems.  


Gestalt/Replicant walked so Automata could run, basically.
LOZ (legend of zelda) is not a ARPG. it is an action adventure game. excluding legend of zelda 2 links quest where thats an actual RPG because it has actual RPG elements and systems.
no the fuck its not its a souls like game which is its own genre which it created and if you wanna be that person and not use souls like its an ARPG action role playing game which most definitly it is. the whole JRPG is literally like someone had said a RPG made in japan. if you dont know what a JRPG is then you need to go culture yourself.
    By your definition they are partly JRPGs though, From Soft is a Japanese company.
        It's either a jrpg or not there is no such thing as a JARPG no body is using that because if it was a thing then we've been mis labeling all the tales of games which supercede dark souls.
    You do realize that a game can fit into many different categories at once don’t you?
    first of all, chill out, no need to go crazy. second, “Souls-like” is a shit descriptor for games, and should never have become one. it encompasses pretty much any game with exploration, leveling, and big punishing gameplay or bosses. which is super generic, “Metroidvania” is also a crap “genre”, encompassing sprawling side-scrolling maps and exploration, sequential weapon upgrades, and big, punishing bosses.

a good example of why this sucks is a game like Hollow Knight, which unsuprisingly, can have both of those applied because there is functionally no difference to them, except the 2D aspect.

sorry to everyone for the rant.
        Bruh you chose to the first thing and not the rest. I literally explained what darksouls it I didn't stick to the whole souls-like. And there is a something that souls like games have is when you die you spawn at last checkpoint so you can run it back with the boss. Some metroidvania games depending if they have Rouge-like elements when you die you game over, there is no checkpoint. For example blood stained is a metroidvania ,why because when you die you game over restart from last save.i didn't play hollow knight because the Fandom is as cringe as undertale and Steven universe but I'm pretty sure when you die it's game over restart form last save. Hell here's a nother one in blazblue entropy effect it has metroidvania in 1 section of the game and it's a Rouge like so if you die game over restart whole game. There are better ways to explain how a game is. Here's one I'll give some genre stuff and I bet it literally labels like every game ever in the category. 2-D action adventure platformer with upgrades for the main character. Bet you didn't think I was talking about super Mario hell because I was talking about risk of rain.its OK for sub categories like metroidvania and souls like who cares if you think they are crap everyone is sick of saying 2-D action adventure platformer it's so blanket. Don't even get started with 3-d games you can't even describe games if you just say action RPG. Is it kingdom hearts, DMC, Bayonetta, or darksouls.
Not weird, good.
