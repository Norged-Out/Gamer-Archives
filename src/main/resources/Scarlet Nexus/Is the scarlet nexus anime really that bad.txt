[[Is the scarlet nexus anime really that bad]]





Not *that* bad but not good either.

Pacing and animation sucked.

Also I just wanted to mention that the picture in the post is of a bootleg copy.
    the ending was pretty neat though, and showed stuff from a different angle / explained some of the things better imo.
        Right it’s not devoid of any good. The extra small bits here and there that we don’t see in the game are neat. 

However I wonder how canon the show is (besides the show kinda canonically existing in the game) as there are small changes to the game’s story.
    Also, the anime couldn't accurately follow the events of the game to save its life. 4/10 as its own thing, 1/10 as an adaptation of the game.
Scarlet Nexus as a game is saved by its fun gameplay, trippy environments, absolutely BUMPIN’ soundtrack, and the character episodes, which flesh out otherwise flat characters into beloved favorites.

The anime has none of these things, and is thus completely worthless.
It's okay but if you played the game, there is basically no reason to watch it. The more that I think about it, the more I'm like why did the anime even exist? I doubt it got many people into the game due to It's average quality
    I think the anime has subtle bonus codes hidden inside that you can input in the game, but that's it
        Yeah but you could just look those up now and even if they anime didn't exist, they could have included them in the game one way or another
    Unfortunately I was one of the poor souls that was exposed to the game because of the anime...For that, I'm grateful, sadly it robbed me of multiple twists. The anime itself was alright I guess.
        It did something good then, the game is so much better especially with the dlc taken into account.
It's mediocre. They treat brain drive as something they need in order to combat Others

If you watched the anime, I highly suggest you go play the game. So much better.

I appreciate the OST and the bonus Karen Content they give
I wouldnt say “bad”, it isnt, its just isnt “good” either

Its very, how do I put this, mediocre?

Feel free to watch it, I wont stop you, but the game is outright superior and more expansive for the world its in, anything you find in the anime could just be found in the game

Oh, and feel free to just use an article written by a game journalist that gives those codes in mutsubi’s or whatever, dont actually remember ehat its called, havent played in a year or two
Idk about bad (I’m still working my way through it) but it’s definitely worse. The anime reveals the main antagonist in the first episode which is absolutely insane to me
I didn't mind it but the awful 3d models of Others and characters in Brain Drive were unbearable
I hear what makes it so bad is the fact that it's basically just the game in animation form. You're just better off playing the game. The only real reason to watch the Anime to my understanding is if you REALLY love SN and wish to support it further, and/or for that Side Quest which I'm sure you can just find the Password Online these days instead of trying to find it yourself. On its own it's good enough and animation is far from the worst I've seen. But it's made obsolete by the far more superior game that has real fun gameplay.
It’s alright 6.5/10 the game told it way better 
The ops and endings are bangers have them in my playlist
The game is a better anime than the anime
It was good seeing the things we missed in the game itself… but for a video game that had amazing fight gameplay… the anime lacked fighting animation… like on a scale from 1 to 10 it was a 1. Not 1.5…not 1.25 not 1.1… 1
I loved it and will fucking die on that hill alone
I liked it.  It’s nice to watch when you are sick in bed.
Most of the anime that has to do with a game has always been substandard. The only one that is actually good that I have seen is shingeki no bahamat
It was okayish. I liked that it wasn’t an exact 1 to 1 with the game but I wished it was done like Night Head 2041 though that probably would’ve been too expensive
Game, as good as tales of arise. Anime, not bad.
There were some extra things, and some alternate events (with Kagero specifically, plus the ending). Other than those, I wouldn't recommend. And for those, it's only worth it if you get it under 2$.

If your memories of the game are fresh and you just watch it as a source of additional info, you may like it. But as a stand-alone thing, it's bad.
Game>>>>>anime
The anime is watchable but nothing to talk about. It’s very underwhelming in every way.
Eh.

It has a tie in with the game with secret codes.
I watched it and I personally think it’s good but the game is 10x better since it wasn’t rushed
I watched it when it aired on TV in Japan, so I paid nothing, and it was at the same time as I was playing the game, so in that sense it was decent. As an anime in and of itself? Definitely meh.

Edut: spellong, beacuase bot
    > so I *paid* nothing, and

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*
        Bad bot, thanks for making me feel inferior by reminding me of something that I already know
Nah I'd say it's better if you've played the game prior since it does cover some stuff that the game doesn't. Imo it's worth watching knowing everything from both stories after a playthrough
yes
It’s okay. If you loved the game and want another way to enjoy it I’d recommend watching the anime. Won’t wow you but some decent visuals. I’d definitely recommend the game over it though.
There’s an anime???
    Yep.  
Came out right around the same time as the game.  
Even had a simuldub since it was recorded at the same time as the game.
I wouldn't call it bad, but coming from someone who played the game first, it's missing alot. It gets the important stuff and that's it, which is understandable. It's like trying to make a movie or TV show out of a book; it will be missing alot of things in lieu of being able to get it compacted into a single season/movie runtime.
I liked it
Imagine the game but it's much worse quality and with all the fun things removed. That's basically what this anime is.
The anime turned Kasane into a damsel in distress so many times I got sick of it. What happened to the hypercompetent prodigy?
The anime is the best example of a 5/10 anime to me. Just good enough to be okay, not good enough to be really worth recommending.

You’re better off playing the game, but sometimes I liked putting on an episode to play in the background while I do something more important. Like a refresher of sorts.
Scarlet Nexus had an anime?
The Scarlet Nexus anime is good enough for Sakugabooru.com unlike the Danganronpa anime series. 

Prove me wrong.
The anime is ok I guess when It came out. The game is great though
Just play the videogame instead.
I remember playing the game and then it goes hey watch this private YouTube vid for some goodies. Like what?
If I remember correctly, if you play the game and want bonuses, you HAVE to watch the anime
Should I watch this before playing the game. The game is on my wishlist at the moment
    No.  Don't ruin the story for yourself.
        Gotcha
Yes
Still mad this got an anime but code vein never got considered for an anime...
I didn’t watch it but from what Ive heard it’s just the entirety of the games story crammed into a way to short period of time. If you played the game, it’s a pointless watch, and if you hadn’t played it, it wouldn’t make you want to play it
The anime for this is what the actual sao games do for its anime literally nothing and is worse.
the 3d models for the others made me throw up
the ending was pretty neat though, and showed stuff from a different angle / explained some of the things better imo.
