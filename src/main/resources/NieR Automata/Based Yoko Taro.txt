[[Based Yoko Taro]]





I love the fact that he posted this in January of 2017, like less than a month after the game release. Shows how much attention 2B got from everyone
    "how to make your game successful 101: give the protagonist a nice ass" - Yoko Taro, probably
        He also got a side effect which he probably likes, according to the Twitter post above: websites filled to the brim with lewd art of 2B
Someday I hope to be as funny as him
I still hope for his next game to have random censorship in game like drakengard 3 lmao
    Man, you just reminded me of how annoying the localization/“censorship” discourse is going to be whenever his next big game comes out and has a script that isn’t machine-translated.
        No no.  I'm talking about the comedic censorship that drakengard 3 has.  It's really only for the cursing and they bleep it our like a TV show for laughs.
            don't forget the ambiet music while Five is being stabbed to post-death by her disciple while the text "the following sounds were deemed offensive" (or something of that effect
                "the following sounds were deemed too graphic for public audiences"
                    Yes! That exactly one
                Exactly lol
Based, Based, Based, Based!
