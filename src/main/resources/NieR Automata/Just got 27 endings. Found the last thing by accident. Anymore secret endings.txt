[[Just got 27 endings. Found the last thing by accident. Anymore secret endings]]





If you have A-Z plus the triangular thing, that's all the endings. Congratulations!
    Hell yeah. I‚Äôve only started playing a couple of weeks ago and this game truly is one of the best experiences I‚Äôve had gaming. Ending Y was a bit of a grind. But worth it. Downloading replicant now!
        Just finished the last ending  on Replicant, forgot how nier gets you in the feels. Really makes me want to play Automata again
            Without spoiling too much does it have as many endings as automata?  Given that there‚Äôs a 22 GB difference in game size I‚Äôm worried It wont have too much longevity. (I‚Äôm going in completely blind)
                If I'm remembering correctly, I dont think there's a whole bunch. I think it's 5 in total
                    Well I‚Äôm gonna download it because the automata I think over performed with the 27 endings. And they told a brilliant story with 5 endings. Thanks will be grinding out later.
                        Of course! Enjoy the journey man!
                As far as I know it has as much story endings as Automata but no side or gag endings on top.
Also, if you're only missing the last ending you might want to look up how to get that one because I sure as shit wouldn't have found out about it without the internet
                    Thanks for the tip!
    You arent going to tell OP about the church ending?
Just wondering how to get "triangle" ending... Any ideas?
    It‚Äôs dlc someone said it earlier in the comments. You complete trial of sand, gamblers coliseum, and mysterious letter and it‚Äôll unlock mysterious invitation in the amusement park. It goes through a bunch of lore about the machines and there‚Äôs a sick music video. Not gonna spoil it too much as I recommend you try it
        Argh‚Ä¶ sand trial‚Ä¶ I keep ‚Äútouching the ground‚Äù
            üòÇ. That one was the biggest piece of shit I‚Äôve ever seen. I hated it with a passion. Needless to say I grinded to level 99 before doing that one again. Thank God for the amusement park
            Hacking enemies to stun them is the best strategy, I did it at level 70 though
                Another good option. I‚Äôll try that too
                My favorite strat was leveling to about level 50 at the spot where Adam appeared. Then if you go to the amusement park and fight the golden statue at the front of the park you level up like crazy. And you can save and reload and do it over and over again. With 9S and hacking. Chapter 7-1
                    That was my strategy too lol, but I did the park thing at level 80, when I tried beating flooded city colisseum (special rank). Man, level 99 means NOTHING there
                        Yeah. I had to put the overclock chip in to dodge the tornado guy. And I used all of the enhancement items to almost one shot him. After failing multiple times first lol
                            Which one is the tornado guy? I remember getting to the special version of Simone, but nothing else
                                In the final battle in the coliseum you fight two level 80 tall boys with axes and a lvl 85 tall boy with an axe and a cape. He does a one hit kill tornado death spin thing.
            If you get to a high enough level you can just stand in place and attack with pod + shock wave chip and they‚Äôll all just die before they get to you
        wait whaaat? i tough i 100%, but totaly forgot about this!  
Brb guys! thanks!
        There is dlc? I think i never see it on PS store. Time to search it!!
            I didn‚Äôt even know about the dlc. I just bought the become as gods edition and it was already included in the Xbox store.
                3C3C1D119440927 i only found this dlc for PS, but seems different with the one you mentioned


Edit: i think this one!!!
                    If trial of sand appeared in the dessert then it should be the right one
                        Is it very hard? The 15 nightmares dlc in replicant was truly nightmare for me in hardest mode
                            The trial of sand is a little tricky. You should play as 2B for that. I recommend a level of at least 70 or 75 for it. You can be any level for mysterious letter but you have to be 9S, and I recommend picking the short dude on the left and give him the saw. The gamblers coliseum is the hardest I‚Äôd say which you should be at least level 80 for
                                Wow.. then i need to replay the game like my first gameplay... on my 2nd gameplay, i only could reach lv 40 iirc (and suffered from enemies' hits a lot lol) because i only rushing the story
                                    There‚Äôs a lot of cool things throughout the game like trying different weapons. Or different chip set ups (I had to change it quite often for different parts of the game, different enemy battles, being able to survive wave of enemies, etc) but exp chips and drop rate chips helped me progress a lot faster. You can always change it to easy mode and install the auto attack, dodge, pick up chips and afk at the area where you first encounter Adam. I did that for a while and got a lot of free drops and exp. But my preferred grinding was with 9S at the amusement park with the golden statue
Wait, what? 27? What the heck is that thing after Z?
    I‚Äôm gonna copy paste this everytime lol It‚Äôs dlc someone said it earlier in the comments. You complete trial of sand, gamblers coliseum, and mysterious letter and it‚Äôll unlock mysterious invitation in the amusement park. It goes through a bunch of lore about the machines and there‚Äôs a sick music video. Not gonna spoil it too much as I recommend you try it
        Ah ok.
    DLC Ending I guess
There's one more in the church in the copied city
    Oh God. I‚Äôve seen the lore behind that one. I think you need the disc version on the 1.0.0 version without connection to wifi in order to get there. So I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs possible but I would like to be able to do it
        But it was day one edition on PS4, so good luck with that
the added DLC ending really was great, even more by the fact that i discovered it by myself
the triangle thing is the DLC ending and there‚Äôs only 26 letters in the English alphabet, so yeah you got all endings
I see you still have your save data...
    Not really too in the loop about this, but is it frowned upon to not delete your save file after ending E. I‚Äôve seen some people say that I should‚Äôve.  I just wanted to have them all on one save
        Nah don't do it. It doesen't change anything. Is more like a conceptual thing. I'm not even sure if you are really helping other players, anyway, there are enough ships already to help everyone at the end of the game.
        If you didn't delete your data, then you didn't understand the artistry of the game. No hate, it's a very enjoyable game either way, but there's so much more to it than some sexy androids and a cool story.
            I completely understand that. But was there a cutscene after deleting the save file or anything lore related for doing it?  I was really emotional when I got to that screen. Then I looked up if there were other endings especially the ending Y and I wanted the ability to chapter select to go back and see all of the cool things about the game I love. The other endings are all jokes, but it shows that the developers really cared about this game when most companies would‚Äôve left it after the first 5.
                I see that you're a completionist, which I completely get. But that's not the point here. You should watch some of Yoko Taro's interviews.
                    I will do that. Thank you.
Wait doesn‚Äôt a certain ending do a certain something to your save file how do you have the letter for that ending. Sorry I‚Äôm old and don‚Äôt know how to block spoilers so if this doesn‚Äôt make sense I‚Äôm sorry.
    Oh. It gives you an option to not delete your save file. If you delete it, ‚Äúit helps‚Äù someone in the future. But the games old now so there was no way I was gonna miss out on all endings to help someone when there‚Äôs been millions of people that played this game lol
        So you still get the ending even after you choose to keep your save?
            Yes you do. Otherwise ending E would be pointless cuz you can‚Äôt get all other endings without going back into the game. Unless you‚Äôre a God on your first playthrough lol
                Well I know what I‚Äôm doing later lol thanks for the info
                    No problem. Also I recommend to watch a tutorial so you can find all of the weapons. It‚Äôll help you with ending Y. Not going to elaborate further to avoid spoilers. Also upgrade all weapons to max at masamune, and complete the half wit inventor quest. You have to spend like 200,000 G. But you get meteorite shards and I think meteorites. It‚Äôll help with the upgrading
Am I too slow or is op really fast? I don't think I can do this in 48hours, I'm already reaching 40hrs and I am at the beginning of route C
    To help out with some endings where you have to die by battle damage (ending F for example) you can change the difficulty to very hard and get one shot by a lvl 1 intro boss. Even if you‚Äôre lvl 99
    You are over leveled.
        Oh alright, is that bad that I'm lvl 48 at route C?
            You can beat the game easily at that level. It doesn't matter much, but there are a couple really good boss fights that are expecting you to take a lot longer to get through the phases than you will, so you miss dialogue that happens in them.

There are 3 problems with the balancing of the game: 

1. There should be an "Exp. 0" chip.
2. Upgrading chips requires too much grinding, which makes you OP even before you get the great chips you want (Would be mitigated by #1).
2. Sidequests that feature enemies with massive HP pools should ONLY show up in Route B. You can either hack away at them with 2B for a half hour in Route A, or save them for when 9S' hacking does percentage-based damage. The first encourages grinding.
Woah I did not expect more secret endings. Imagine if it turns out to be some bug.
    Actually the special symbol ending is a DLC ending. You can read more about it here https://nier.fandom.com/wiki/3C3C1D119440927
    If you complete all the trials or arena areas you get a mysterious invitation and it shows some Lore behind some of the machines. And i don‚Äôt know If I was supposed to laugh at the music video that went with it. But it was great nonetheless
Church
    I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs real. I think since yoko taro is a very well known troll I think it‚Äôs a developer who wanted to get hype back to the community. Which is awesome. But I think they should‚Äôve released an update or something so everyone can get it. Or just make another nier game.
        It‚Äôs a joke. Idk what to say since you did all endings.
The church thing was a mod so‚Ä¶

Hmmm. I know there‚Äôs a cheat code to clear the game in the intro, a nice easter egg when you fight as 9S.

And I guess that‚Äôs it‚Ä¶

About another NieR game, there‚Äôs reincarnation with a lot of lores‚Ä¶
            I did not know about the cheat code. I‚Äôm defo gonna check that out later. And is reincarnation on Xbox?  I saw the original Nier and Replicant but it didn‚Äôt appear in the game store. I might‚Äôve done something wrong tho.  Still wish the church thing was real. Would‚Äôve been awesome
                Nope. You can emulate on PC and it‚Äôs a mobile game.

You can just watch youtube if you just want the lore‚Ä¶ :)
How could you have the Y ending in just 48hs
    A lot of resource grinding. I used exp/drop rate chips in the area where you first encounter Adam. I used a guide on how to get every weapon. I also found that if you complete half wit inventor which costs like 200,000 G then you can get meteorite shards and meteorites to make it way easier. Beating the main story endings and chapter select are a blessing for getting Y done.
How can i get the triangular ending?
    I‚Äôm gonna copy paste this everytime lol It‚Äôs dlc someone said it earlier in the comments. You complete trial of sand, gamblers coliseum, and mysterious letter and it‚Äôll unlock mysterious invitation in the amusement park. It goes through a bunch of lore about the machines and there‚Äôs a sick music video. Not gonna spoil it too much as I recommend you try it
I'm kinda surprised you got ending Y. I accidentally skipped it in my first playthrough
    Yeah it was a hell of a grind. If it wasn‚Äôt for me being a completionist I think I would‚Äôve had all of the endings except for y at hour 35 or 37
What's the triangle??

        Bruh I didn't even know there was a dlc thank you.
            No problem. If you‚Äôre on Xbox it‚Äôs the become as gods edition. Which includes the dlc
I'm amazed you got all of them in less than 50 hours. I managed to do that in  80+ hours.
    The side endings aren‚Äôt that bad if you have chapter select unlocked. It‚Äôs mainly ending Y. I made sure to upgrade all of the weapons I found naturally in my first play through all the way. And used a guide to find the rest afterwards
It truly is an amazing game. I recently went through the game and was able to get all the endings. The anime made me play this, ive been meaning to finish this a long time ago. Binge playd Automata and Replicant 1.2 back to back. Such an amazing game and story.
    I‚Äôm in the same boat. I didn‚Äôt play the game when it first came out. Then I saw the anime and I was just captivated by the world and the themes. It inspired me to play the game and I couldn‚Äôt drop it. I also started playing replicant and I was surprised at how different it was.  But I‚Äôm only about an hour in so far and I‚Äôm definitely gonna keep going
        It is a very different game but still good. Replicant however takes a little longer to pick up. But once you get further into the game it gets really good. Now I know why Emil and Kaine were impressive characters that everyone loved. I still have to say Automata is probably a better game. I enjoyed everything about Automata.
Did you do the true ending like later or during?
    I did not see this comment whoops. You can do the true ending after doing all of the other endings or you can finish the true ending and get all the other ones after. I did the second one
Their that many endings! Jesus.
    There sure are and basically all of them are jokes. But some endings I wish were real for the sake of the characters sanity. God this game gets me in the feels
[deleted]
    I commented on another post asking about this. But the games been out for a long time now. Millions of people played the game. I‚Äôm not deleting my save file to help other people when there‚Äôs plenty of other people who have pressed that button (they probably didn‚Äôt even think of the consequences when they pressed it). I wanted every ending in one save file.  I‚Äôd be happy to replay the game again tho and do that if it makes you happy lol.
        Don‚Äôt listen to others, keep the save!
Hell yeah. I‚Äôve only started playing a couple of weeks ago and this game truly is one of the best experiences I‚Äôve had gaming. Ending Y was a bit of a grind. But worth it. Downloading replicant now!
    Just finished the last ending  on Replicant, forgot how nier gets you in the feels. Really makes me want to play Automata again
        Without spoiling too much does it have as many endings as automata?  Given that there‚Äôs a 22 GB difference in game size I‚Äôm worried It wont have too much longevity. (I‚Äôm going in completely blind)
            If I'm remembering correctly, I dont think there's a whole bunch. I think it's 5 in total

                    Yeah. I had to put the overclock chip in to dodge the tornado guy. And I used all of the enhancement items to almost one shot him. After failing multiple times first lol
                        Which one is the tornado guy? I remember getting to the special version of Simone, but nothing else
                            In the final battle in the coliseum you fight two level 80 tall boys with axes and a lvl 85 tall boy with an axe and a cape. He does a one hit kill tornado death spin thing.
        If you get to a high enough level you can just stand in place and attack with pod + shock wave chip and they‚Äôll all just die before they get to you

    It is a very different game but still good. Replicant however takes a little longer to pick up. But once you get further into the game it gets really good. Now I know why Emil and Kaine were impressive characters that everyone loved. I still have to say Automata is probably a better game. I enjoyed everything about Automata.
I did not see this comment whoops. You can do the true ending after doing all of the other endings or you can finish the true ending and get all the other ones after. I did the second one
There sure are and basically all of them are jokes. But some endings I wish were real for the sake of the characters sanity. God this game gets me in the feels
I commented on another post asking about this. But the games been out for a long time now. Millions of people played the game. I‚Äôm not deleting my save file to help other people when there‚Äôs plenty of other people who have pressed that button (they probably didn‚Äôt even think of the consequences when they pressed it). I wanted every ending in one save file.  I‚Äôd be happy to replay the game again tho and do that if it makes you happy lol.
    Don‚Äôt listen to others, keep the save!
Just finished the last ending  on Replicant, forgot how nier gets you in the feels. Really makes me want to play Automata again
    Without spoiling too much does it have as many endings as automata?  Given that there‚Äôs a 22 GB difference in game size I‚Äôm worried It wont have too much longevity. (I‚Äôm going in completely blind)
        If I'm remembering correctly, I dont think there's a whole bunch. I think it's 5 in total
            Well I‚Äôm gonna download it because the automata I think over performed with the 27 endings. And they told a brilliant story with 5 endings. Thanks will be grinding out later.
                Of course! Enjoy the journey man!
        As far as I know it has as much story endings as Automata but no side or gag endings on top.
Also, if you're only missing the last ending you might want to look up how to get that one because I sure as shit wouldn't have found out about it without the internet
            Thanks for the tip!
Argh‚Ä¶ sand trial‚Ä¶ I keep ‚Äútouching the ground‚Äù
    üòÇ. That one was the biggest piece of shit I‚Äôve ever seen. I hated it with a passion. Needless to say I grinded to level 99 before doing that one again. Thank God for the amusement park
    Hacking enemies to stun them is the best strategy, I did it at level 70 though
        Another good option. I‚Äôll try that too
        My favorite strat was leveling to about level 50 at the spot where Adam appeared. Then if you go to the amusement park and fight the golden statue at the front of the park you level up like crazy. And you can save and reload and do it over and over again. With 9S and hacking. Chapter 7-1
            That was my strategy too lol, but I did the park thing at level 80, when I tried beating flooded city colisseum (special rank). Man, level 99 means NOTHING there
                Yeah. I had to put the overclock chip in to dodge the tornado guy. And I used all of the enhancement items to almost one shot him. After failing multiple times first lol
                    Which one is the tornado guy? I remember getting to the special version of Simone, but nothing else
                        In the final battle in the coliseum you fight two level 80 tall boys with axes and a lvl 85 tall boy with an axe and a cape. He does a one hit kill tornado death spin thing.
    If you get to a high enough level you can just stand in place and attack with pod + shock wave chip and they‚Äôll all just die before they get to you
wait whaaat? i tough i 100%, but totaly forgot about this!  
Brb guys! thanks!
There is dlc? I think i never see it on PS store. Time to search it!!
    I didn‚Äôt even know about the dlc. I just bought the become as gods edition and it was already included in the Xbox store.
        3C3C1D119440927 i only found this dlc for PS, but seems different with the one you mentioned


Edit: i think this one!!!
            If trial of sand appeared in the dessert then it should be the right one
                Is it very hard? The 15 nightmares dlc in replicant was truly nightmare for me in hardest mode
                    The trial of sand is a little tricky. You should play as 2B for that. I recommend a level of at least 70 or 75 for it. You can be any level for mysterious letter but you have to be 9S, and I recommend picking the short dude on the left and give him the saw. The gamblers coliseum is the hardest I‚Äôd say which you should be at least level 80 for
                        Wow.. then i need to replay the game like my first gameplay... on my 2nd gameplay, i only could reach lv 40 iirc (and suffered from enemies' hits a lot lol) because i only rushing the story
                            There‚Äôs a lot of cool things throughout the game like trying different weapons. Or different chip set ups (I had to change it quite often for different parts of the game, different enemy battles, being able to survive wave of enemies, etc) but exp chips and drop rate chips helped me progress a lot faster. You can always change it to easy mode and install the auto attack, dodge, pick up chips and afk at the area where you first encounter Adam. I did that for a while and got a lot of free drops and exp. But my preferred grinding was with 9S at the amusement park with the golden statue
Ah ok.
But it was day one edition on PS4, so good luck with that
Nah don't do it. It doesen't change anything. Is more like a conceptual thing. I'm not even sure if you are really helping other players, anyway, there are enough ships already to help everyone at the end of the game.
If you didn't delete your data, then you didn't understand the artistry of the game. No hate, it's a very enjoyable game either way, but there's so much more to it than some sexy androids and a cool story.
    I completely understand that. But was there a cutscene after deleting the save file or anything lore related for doing it?  I was really emotional when I got to that screen. Then I looked up if there were other endings especially the ending Y and I wanted the ability to chapter select to go back and see all of the cool things about the game I love. The other endings are all jokes, but it shows that the developers really cared about this game when most companies would‚Äôve left it after the first 5.
        I see that you're a completionist, which I completely get. But that's not the point here. You should watch some of Yoko Taro's interviews.
            I will do that. Thank you.
So you still get the ending even after you choose to keep your save?
    Yes you do. Otherwise ending E would be pointless cuz you can‚Äôt get all other endings without going back into the game. Unless you‚Äôre a God on your first playthrough lol
        Well I know what I‚Äôm doing later lol thanks for the info
            No problem. Also I recommend to watch a tutorial so you can find all of the weapons. It‚Äôll help you with ending Y. Not going to elaborate further to avoid spoilers. Also upgrade all weapons to max at masamune, and complete the half wit inventor quest. You have to spend like 200,000 G. But you get meteorite shards and I think meteorites. It‚Äôll help with the upgrading
Oh alright, is that bad that I'm lvl 48 at route C?
    You can beat the game easily at that level. It doesn't matter much, but there are a couple really good boss fights that are expecting you to take a lot longer to get through the phases than you will, so you miss dialogue that happens in them.

There are 3 problems with the balancing of the game: 

1. There should be an "Exp. 0" chip.
2. Upgrading chips requires too much grinding, which makes you OP even before you get the great chips you want (Would be mitigated by #1).
2. Sidequests that feature enemies with massive HP pools should ONLY show up in Route B. You can either hack away at them with 2B for a half hour in Route A, or save them for when 9S' hacking does percentage-based damage. The first encourages grinding.
It‚Äôs a joke. Idk what to say since you did all endings.
The church thing was a mod so‚Ä¶

Hmmm. I know there‚Äôs a cheat code to clear the game in the intro, a nice easter egg when you fight as 9S.

And I guess that‚Äôs it‚Ä¶

About another NieR game, there‚Äôs reincarnation with a lot of lores‚Ä¶
    I did not know about the cheat code. I‚Äôm defo gonna check that out later. And is reincarnation on Xbox?  I saw the original Nier and Replicant but it didn‚Äôt appear in the game store. I might‚Äôve done something wrong tho.  Still wish the church thing was real. Would‚Äôve been awesome
        Nope. You can emulate on PC and it‚Äôs a mobile game.

You can just watch youtube if you just want the lore‚Ä¶ :)
Bruh I didn't even know there was a dlc thank you.
    No problem. If you‚Äôre on Xbox it‚Äôs the become as gods edition. Which includes the dlc
