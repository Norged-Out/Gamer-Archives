[[NIER AUTOMATA VER. 1.1A COUR 2 CONFIRMED FOR 2024]]





I was happy seeing this then disappointed I'd have to wait till next year then felt stupid because it is already 2024.
    don't worry, it will take a year and a half for them to make 12 episodes again
        This long for a split cour is unusual. Betting they'll have more episodes done in advance this time.
        Even longer than that to get the eng dub
    No cuz sameðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
    Kinda how I feel about season 7 of mha
    made me question what year it is for a second there

This is a digest/recap video Aniplex released a few hours ago
    Good ðŸ¥¹
Let's go, here's hoping for no production issues this time
    I'm not bothered even if there are. If they need more time to get episodes right, I'll take it.
        The production issues last time was the studio having a wave of covid go through. It wasn't so they could give the anime more time in the oven. The episodes weren't more polished for the time lost.
Oh yeah.  Let's get fucky.
So season 2 would be 9S arc / ending B but with more C / D storyline? Since s1 ended at Ending A.
    Quite a lot of route B was covered during the first cour, right? I imagine this will be reaching the conclusion.
        My recollection is the anime covered practically all of Route B; I've got to assume cour 2 starts with the beginning of Route C.
        Oh my bad i kinda forgor S1 was A and B at the same time. Was a bit confused cuz in last ep, it somewhat highlighted the B ending (9S being the main charac)
    S1 seems to have covered both A and B together. S2 will most likely *sort of* cover C and D.

The big question comes from the changes. The series has been touching on all of the endings as it goes along, and in a move I wasn't expecting, they already touched Ending E. Obviously you can't gave a DrakeNier item without a big bombastic finale, but if they've already done Ending E and it *wasn't* the big bombastic finale, then what will be? At this point just about anything is possible.
    Route C/D/and whatever of E can be adapted, probably with signfiicant additions, since cour A already had significant additions, and A/B are longer than C/D
    Season 1 was ending A/B season two is going to be route [DATA NOT FOUND], because the anime is a divergent branch of reality.
    there are a less than zero chance that season 2 is going to go completely off the rails and be completely divergent from the Games events
WOO, YEAH BABY! THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR! 

Now, all that I need to make my life complete is Replicant anime
    God replicant would be amazing as an anime
        Hot take : it won't. What makes replicant so great is ending b and how you are just doing the same thing you were in ending a but now you know more and realize just how "wrong" you were for doing the things that were completely justified in a. You can't translate this to a tv show . Unless you ruin the entire "oh by the way the faceless monsters you killed to save your sister are actually human and also they do bad things for good reasons and also you "accidentally" killed the entire human race" part of the game , which is arguably the main reason for why it's so good ,  you just can't translate replicant to an anime

I would love to be wrong tho
SEASON 2 LETS FUCKIN GOOOOOO
So excited!

I wonder what in the world they are going to do for Ending E, which is pretty much impossible to adapt for a non-video game medium. Will Yoko Taro be able to come up with something just as ingenious and impactful for the different medium?
    Considering how different things played out toward cour 1's ending, I'd expect some pretty significant changes, we might get even more ties to reincarnation
        We are going to be getting for ties to drakengard more likely
YESSSSSS LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO


shit is about to go down. calling it right now: it's going to go completely different in some way. Maybe it'll tie into reincarnationÂ 
    It most definitely will tie into reincarnation somehow
        Maybe, maybe not. NierRein is shutting down at the end of April, which is potentially before the anime finishes.
Ahhh itâ€™s anime !!
    I was confused for a second too. But good I've been waiting for the anime! For some reason when I read NieR:Automata I could only think of the game.
        Same hereâ€¦. I thought itâ€™s about the gameâ€¦.
    I thought a sequel or something was announced xd
I'm ready to be heartbroken again for route C
An announcement on my birthday ðŸ¥º, I am the most special little girl ever ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º
More Nier babyyyy

I wonder what changes they'll add in this time, the adaptation's still so interesting even after playing Automata over many playthroughs
hell yeah dude
I really enjoyed the first season, despite the production issues. Hopefully it goes more smoothly for them for S2

Looking forward to it!
Here comes another wave of depression... Holy sheep
Omg it's happening,  ok nobody panic!
Guys, can somebody send me the Chanel name?

Or video link?

Do we know if they are doing a blu-ray release?
    Cour 1's Blu ray release is on March 27th, though I believe it's for the Japanese release, not sure if they have a Blu ray for the English version yet
        Hopefully they do one.
How exciting. I can't wait for the emotional shitshow that will come.
This is where it gets interesting, and they've set the bar high with it being a different timeline.
Yeeeeees
I literally just bought the game, is there any difference between this and the original
    The anime and game have differences yes. They are two different timelines. Play the game first.
        Oh I was thinking this was like nier and nier replicant oops
Is the anime dubbed in English yet?
    It's been dubbed for a while now yes
and just please remake the first episode
Did the animation of the show improve over cour 1? I love the game, but the animation in the first episodes was so bad I had to stop.
    The first episode was the worst looking, it was never that bad again. Also it wouldn't surprise me if the decision to skip 2 big action pieces in the anime were so the animation/CG wouldn't come off as bad as episode 1 did.
    Episode 1 was not even that bad, it was mid at worst, the rest of the episodes were fire.
    It is only episode 1 that was bad. All remaining episodes are top tier. Episode 1 just had the unfortunate role of adapting the intro mission.
        That is great to hear. That first episode was some of the worst I had seen, and when I watched it there was some stories about expected delays coming and I just assumed it was a trainwreck.
            Try to watch maybe up until episode 6 (pearl harbor incident). I honestly think episode 6 is one of the best episodes when it comes to cinematography, voice acting, animation, amd effects.
Do we know when in 2024?
Is this the early surprise Saito was talking about?
Wait are they going to LA again?
    No, this is for the anime
        Even better
Does anyone know if season one has been fully dubbed yet or not?
    it's been fully dubbed yes
don't worry, it will take a year and a half for them to make 12 episodes again
    This long for a split cour is unusual. Betting they'll have more episodes done in advance this time.
    Even longer than that to get the eng dub
