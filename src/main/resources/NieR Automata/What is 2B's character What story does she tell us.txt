[[What is 2B's character What story does she tell us]]


I've made yesterday a post about 2B and the truth about the last humans being long gone, and I realized that I was believing (And I was wrong apparently) that 2B knew the truth about Humanity. 

And from that, I obviously constructed all my idea of 2B. In the story, she doesn't "evolve", she doesn't have a development. But that doesn't make her boring: in my opinion, just like Emil, she also represented the message of  the game: breaking the cycle of suffering requires a pure act of kindness. 

She might say she's cold and such, she is actually very emotive and forward. 

BUT, knowing that she was still fighting, probably blinded by the YorHa project makes me feel... bad. 

Since she's a constant character, she can represent something to admire or look up to, or something to not follow (or basically with shades as well). And I don't want to believe 2B was just Blindly following the YorHa project. 

SO that being said, you now have context. I just want to ask you: who do you think 2B is? What story does she tell us? What message does she deliver to us? 

I'll watcha again some videos, it is not needed to reply to what I said before, I know I am surely wrong. Which is why I ask you this question.

Please tell me who do you think 2B is, so I can replay the game again, and finally have the warm feeling to understand a character I love.


You read those novels? Memory thorn and memory cage? And that concert?

If not then you should. 

My pet peeve with Automata is that 2B's character is not fleshed out enough in the game. Only in outside material.

At least A2 gets that terminal in the camp to show you her backstory.
    That's strange because I've first looked for the memory cage, I read it, then I wrote memory thorn and reached the same story. 

If you had links for all of these It would greatly help me
        They are very simliar but there's also some differences.

Have fun.
            So what you say is that I might actually have actually thought that the memory cage and memory thorn are the same stories and skipped the other one? 

That explains things. Thanks
                Idk, maybe?

They start similarly but the end is different.
                    AAAAAHHH I FCKING KNEW IT

I WAS SURE OF ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED 

Thank you for this lmao
                        Now read the other link.

Especially a repeating prayer part.
                            So I've read memory cages and memory thorns. 

Do you mean the memories of puppets?
                                Yes
                                    I'll go for it
                    Yeah I'm reading it, it's actually different after 5 paragraphs XD thanks a lot
                    Lmao o read the beginning and believed that this was the same thing after reading 3 paragraphs xd
                        And I wondered why you didn't say a thing about it when I asked you...
                            Because when I read it (and dozen of people talked with me, so I was getting mixed up, and it was 3 am), I believed they were both the same things. So I was confused, that's it
2B is a YoRHa model who was manufactured to execute her comrades if command ordered her to do so, no questions asked. She repeatedly got paired up with 9S to monitor him because he always stepped out of bounds. Despite her best efforts she couldn't help getting attached to him and after being ordered to kill him multiple times, she began to hate the never ending spiral of life and death. After a while 9S got suspicious and managed to catch her off guard once. They quickly realized however that no matter if 9S didn't let 2B kill him, he'd be persecuted by other type E models. And so they decided that 2B would always be the one to kill 9S because, if not, another member of YoRHa would, and even if they only had a limited amount of time before 9S got rebooted again and again, that time would be worth it because they liked each other's company. 2B promised to do so even though she of course hated to kill him so often. But 9S asked her to do so.

During the events of the game 2B gradually gets closer and closer to 9S. As usual. When YoRHa falls, she sacrifices herself to save him and records her last words hoping that 9S would find the recording and know how she really felt. Then she asks A2 to help 9S survive.

That's just what I came up with without thinking too much or doing any research. She is my favorite character in the franchise.
To me, 2B is meant to be a symbol of the struggle beneath the crushing weight of the status quo. She isn't blinded by Project YorHa as much as people today are blinded by their responsibilities and roles within our current systems (work, school, government, etc). She is bound by her duty, her circumstance, and her conditioning. She did not ask to be made, or to be part of Project YorHa, just as we humans did not ask to be born into the systems we are a part of. And she certainly doesn't know about the humans being gone or else she wouldn't be fighting... But nonetheless, she is alive and must operate within her limited understanding of the world and system she inhabits. She must obey her chain of command under threat of being outcast as a defector, and also under the misguided idea that they are capable of winning the war. But she is resolute and dutiful to her core so it comes naturally to do so. This does not mean she is blind; the first sentence we ever hear her speak is the very opening of the game:

"Everything that lives is designed to end. We are perpetually trapped in a never ending spiral of life and death. Is this a curse? Or some kind of punishment? I often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle… and wonder if we’ll ever get the chance to kill him."

2B is painfully aware of her situation, maybe due to the endless death of the war, maybe in part because of her role in keeping 9S "in check". She despises her circumstances to the point of spiting God himself, and hoping for a chance to kill him. 2B wishes to be free from the war and her duties, but lacks the agency to do it. There is too much at stake: stopping the ceaseless battle by winning the war, saving her friends from their struggles and death, maintaining hope for a brighter future. So she must play her part under the pretense that peace will be won eventually (so she can go shopping for t-shirts with 9S and stuff).

I also see her as a symbol of the absurdity in the struggle for peace. Despite her immense effort, and despite her unwavering loyalty, she still fails miserably. She did everything she was told she was supposed to do, everything she was capable of, and it still amounted to nothing... Nier uses her character as a message for the first half of its premise: Life has no certainties, no matter how hard you may try. You just have to accept that fact. Sometimes life will hand us some happiness and you must cherish it in that moment for however long it lasts. And sometimes life will hand us an insurmountable struggle and we will just have to deal with it in whatever way we can. Some of us will even die in vain of our struggles. That's just an unfortunate fact, and 2B is a prime example of that.

In terms of a plot device, 2B is a catalyst of 9S's descent towards self destruction. She is only present in the first part of the game because we are meant to build a connection with her and the relationship she has with 9S, and she is meant to be tragically ripped away so that you may feel an emptiness in how hollow her character was resolved. It sets you up emotionally for the later half of the game.
    Wow that was honestly beautifully worded. I think your explanation of 2B is very on point!
    I want to read all of that but I already read 3 big stories of NieR Automata ;_;
>breaking the cycle of suffering requires a pure act of kindness.

Agree 2B represents the free will becuse in the last loop she didn't killed 9S
    Well ofcourse she didnt kill 9s because she didnt get order from commander to do so. 2b hates killing 9s but it's not up to her to decide. She follows orders so when commander orders to kill 9s, she follows the order. At that time ingame commander was dead so obviously she wont kill 9s if she doesnt have to. And without commander to order her, she doesnt have to kill him
        but commander died because the Yorha got the virus, I don't know if that was programmed or not
            Yeah so what? Because im not sure i umderstand your point here. Also virus attack wasnt programmed. It is just the way machines decided to attack the bunker.
                If the virus wasn''t planned she died by the events caused  from the actions of 2B and 9S, but some points aren't clear to me maybe I'm wrong
                    First of all what does any of this have to do with 2b making decision herself or representing free will or breaking the cycle or whatever you wrote in that first comment?

Second of all virus wasnt planned and she didnt die from events caused by 2b&9s. Machines would attack the bunker sooner or later no matter what 2b&9s did because machines attacking the bunker was part of the project yorha itself.
        Yeah if anything, the Commander is the one who tried to follow that morale.
    Well no matter what I think I'll need to see what we can see about 2B, there are many things I apparently don't know
    >!No, but she killed him mentally!<
        This is grim but accurate in a way. I guess it kind of did end the same way as it always does.

(And to top off the tragedy... well, A2 has her face, doesn't she? 2B's face still would have been one of the last things he saw. Oof.)
That life, ultimately is what you decide it to be. Nihilism and the absurd life is not any existenial problem to lose our minds over. Make the most of what you have.
She’s not a constant character. She doesn’t change as a person but we get a lot more context of who she is. 

I’d say she has an arc that depends on us understanding her more and changing other characters, but it just happens not to involve changing herself. Some kind of “catalyst arc”.
    By development, I meant that she doesn't change. It's just that we learn more about her.

We just first thought shes a quiet and cold, but forward android, but then we see her actually caring for others, maybe cursing this system that treats them like just removable entities, but then we learnt that she was actually the one charged to do it, and we see her psychology. 


Sooo yeah, she doesn't change, she's a constant character in terms of development, but for us, at our first playthrough, we just know more and more about her.
>!Kill your homies!<
To me, if you break it down, nier automata is basically a love story. Doesn’t need to be in a romantical way. Of course, that’s up to each people how they want to interpret it.
    Well the fact the machines are interpreting Romeo and Juliet is pretty important lmao 

And the end of Plato, with "Deserving of Life", saying that anyone that follows their emotions, choosing the warmth of the heart deserves to live 

Ooor just Emil ;_; 

Yeah, the story is about Love. But I need to grasp 2Bs concept moreb
She is mostly a tool for 9S's message, so not much. Just a "endure and be sad" character. There isn't really many thing to like about 2B either imo, as in, there is not much to hate or like.
First of all, one of the most glaring shortcomings in the game is the lack of storytelling. The game does not properly explain the formation and development of 2B and 9S's relationship, nor 2B's character. This may leave her behind 9S and A2 as a character. That's why it is necessary to do research from different sources. But at least as far as I know, 2B is a character that doesn't express herself much. I don't know what she is like at heart, but I can say that she cares very much about her duty and that she is a self-sacrificing person who can give up the people she loves for this cause. This may have turned her into a pessimistic person because she killed 9S so many times. In fact, 2B is a good example of how the atmosphere of the period reflects on people

Edit:I really like discussing such topics about the Nier universe on this subreddit. So thanks.
Well I think she does change over the course of the story. Her cold demeanor is a facade because she does care about 9s. She saves him from Adam even though she doesn't need to. She is a E type, but she is the one defeating the machines like Adam and Eve. She also goes beyond her E job by passing on to A2 her memories which convinced A2 to fight for the future of everyone instead of just killing machines. Her story just ends half way through the game. She symbolizes hope more than 9s or 2A. The English version of weight of the world is her song.
She’s a soldier who has to live with the fact she kills her only friend over and over, and then at the end everything falls apart and she dies trying to save the one she had betrayed so many times.  It really is just that simple
    But she didn't realize anything ? They were forced into the situation and she didn't get any order to eliminate him.  Which leaves only the first part which is just her sad story and nothing else.
        Actually, 2B was not aware of it. Or more importantly, it eventually didn't matter. 

To make it short, eventually, 9S realized what happened, understanding she's a 2E type. And when she asked him to kill her, he ended his life himself.

And before dying, he asked 2B to not hesitate next time, so 9S will have the joy to meet her again, be with her, and die by her hand.

So eventually, she was not killing 9S purely by following orders, but she was doing it out of love.

But is the 9S she knew at first the same of the others?

That's one of the questions I'm still asking myself now, so I'm reading moreb
            This is kind of a philosophy thing, but I think if someone lived their entire lives from start to finish with new memories, same body or not, they’re a different person.
            "So eventually, she was not killing 9S purely by following orders, but she was doing it out of love."

Yes yes yes yes yes, I second the hell out of this
Hello hello welcome to the hill on which I will die:

✨2B is a hedonist.✨

(Please excuse the below wank but this *is* a discussion of a Yoko Taro game and I have a lot of thoughts.)

NieR Automata is a game that asks its players where they derive meaning--why they sit down to play the game at all (look at all these platforming challenges and all the never-explained combo tech for which there is no instruction and no reward other than the intrinsic satisfaction of having done it). It's also a game that subjects its characters to the same trial. What each of the main trio live for when faced with absurd, awful, inescapable fate--their intrinsic purposes, distinct from the ones assigned to them by YoRHa and the endless war--is core to who they are. What makes their mostly shitty existences worth living through?

A2 is basically Guts. She endures. There's an element of spite, and a lot of loneliness, and she deals with it by just going on. She worships at the altar of grief and she refuses to give up.

I feel like I understand 9S the least, but he's thirsty for knowledge and seeks to challenge assumption. Ironic and dangerous for him, but he's compelled by it constantly. He also has this streak of violence which at first he directs towards the machines, per his duty as YoRHa, but which shifts towards A2 once everyone to whom he was loyal has been killed. His curiosity results in a loss of innocence, and he redirects his rage meaninglessly at the person he decides to hold responsible, because everything sucks.

But 2B is a lot more subtle, and I see a lot of people reading her as boring or underdeveloped as a result. While I'm never opposed to more 2B content and think there could have been some more overt gestures towards her motives in the actual game, I think there's plenty to run with. I don't think it would have suited her character or the tone of Automata for everything to have been spelt out neatly and unambiguously. 2B cannot confess her reality to anyone, least of all 9S, the one person she might actually want to confide in. The game also isn't as plot-driven or as literal as a reading that encompasses all the source material from the get go would suggest. It's almost brechtian lmao, it's a whole piece of interactive absurdist theatre. It doesn't explain everything, least of all 2B, but it does give the player the tools to examine the game from every angle, mechanically and narratively. Debug mode, chapter select, forced replays, a kind of freedom to switch between mechanical genres in 9S's route via hacking, etc etc. The game demands parsing, and there's always some hidden gem to find. Same with 2B (please do not read that literally)

We don't see a lot of character development in 2B, at least in the form of an obvious shift from one motive to another, *during the course of the game*. That's because *her character development has already taken place by the time the game starts*. She's already killed 9S (or watched him kill himself, or died with him) 48 times by the end of the opening. She's committed to this cycle, which already says plenty about her, because I probably would have self-destructed on the Bunker and taken out my shitty android military overlords with me by now, if I were in her position. Remember, the Commander even plans on making more 2Bs and 9Ss as a duo. She's banking on this arrangement being able to continue indefinitely, without 2B, one of the most powerful units in existence, deciding she's done with being forced to kill her colleague/friend/lover over and over again and consigning YoRHa to an explosive or otherwise gruesome end. It's safe to assume that 2B will continue in an arrangement she actively hates rather than die (or defect, as her predecessor did), so clearly she's sticking around for something.

So why?? Why, despite the awful mental toll the 9S executions are having on her (which 9S points out at length in memory thorn or memory cage, I can't remember which)? Maybe up to a certain point I could believe she does it out of duty, because what else is she going to do? As Nyomboy already said, these androids are designed to fight and it's not like they have much choice over the system they're born into. But, to me, duty no longer explains her motives once 9S is in the picture. She's obviously not happy with her reality, and she does have options, however grim, and enough power to pursue those options. (The machines sometimes choose to die rather than go on under absurd conditions; the game suggests this option is always available to the protagonists, too.)

So here's my take. She doesn't live for duty, not after 9S, anyway. She doesn't live for the YoRHa creed or whatever. She could kill herself or destroy YoRHa or demand decommissioning, but she doesn't. There may be additional reasons--maybe other executioners aren't as compassionate as she is and would take their time killing 9S? Maybe she has a sense of possession over him and she cannot abide the thought of anyone else being the one to kill him?

But maybe the reason is as simple as the fact that she sees the suffering as worth it. Nonexistence also means no 9S. Death means no Earth and no tiny moments of splendour, which the game goes to painstaking lengths to capture from the perfect angles and with achingly beautiful music, in between the brutality. No chance for those idle animations where she's opening her arms to the sky or just taking the world in.

I read 2B as a hedonist, like the park machines who while away their final days partying and being together. There's very little hope in NieR Automata, but there's a lot of beauty. Sure, maybe 2B has to make some concessions to make her crappy situation survivable, like refusing to get too close to Nines and keeping her heart hidden. But she holds out until death is inevitable, even though it's been aiming for them forever. I cannot help but feel, since she's the first character we play as and she frames the whole experience of the game afterwards, that the game itself is meant to be an embodiment of 2B's motive--the thrill of fighting and the joy of small moments of peace. Her time with 9S. Pure light and all that.

Anyway thanks for coming to my shitty ted talk
    For the next time try to add more space in your writing XD 

I know you want to say stuffs, I'm the same so I try my best to put space in my texts

And to continue with what I started to read, I wonder if she wouldn't be happy dying and finally "leaving this", being in peace. I think that 2B would happily rest in peace at the beginning of the game, and since she survived, she really hoped 9S did too. 

Basically, any ways to leave this cycle would be good for her. 

However, she keeps going because she promised 9S to be the one to kill him everytime.
        "I think that 2B would happily rest in peace at the beginning of the game..."

If you're referring to the opening mission and the black box reaction, I 100% agree. It would have been the perfect way to go--as comrades, with no YoRHa-ordained murder, doing what they loved lol. She seems genuinely happy in that moment. It's also reversed immediately, leaving her to grapple with the same cycle and the same choice alone again.

I do think that promise is important and core to her determination to keep going. And a different person might not have made that promise. A different person might have ignored that conversation as soon as 9S could no longer remember it. It's a hard promise to keep, and 2B keeps it, despite the fact that the moment after she makes it there is no longer anyone who can bear witness to her determination but her. (Oooh and maybe Pod? The Pods are like the chorus at a tragedy, observing everything and lamenting the story's passage but never interfering... until the end, of course.)

Also thanks for the writing tip! :))
    Alright so I quickly read, and I think 2B is not really a Hedonist: she's ready to embrace this pain. She's the one believing the most in Humanity. When Adam tells her that Humanity is just about violence and Hate, she violently rejects his opinion, saying he doesn't know a thing about humans. 

She truly believed in humanity. Maybe she suspected humans to be dead, but she still was ready to do her duty. 

And the first time she killed 9S, she told herself to never get too close to someone, so she can do her duty efficiently. She killed many comrades, but 9S was the hardest. She didn't even kill him, it was a virus trap in 2Bs data that killed him: she was too clumsy and 9S understood she was about to kill him, and out of self defence, he hacked her to prevent her from doing it. And then he died.

A year later, 2B was still paired with 9S, and 2B was almost trying to get herself killed. He eventually fixed her wounds and logic virus, but learnt she's a 2E unit. She asked him to kill her, but 9S took her blade and ended his own life, asking 2B to promise him to be the one to always kill him in the future. 

And that way, 2B was still following orders, but only followed them out of love. 

She still has a deep love for Humanity and for 9S (Unlike him apparently, who, in the best case, find humans curious). And she believed probably in the YorHa project. But eventually, for us, whether of not she believed in the project doesn't matter: she loves 9S, and she has to keep her promise.

The Pods are like the chorus at a tragedy, observing everything and lamenting the story's passage but never interfering... until the end, of course.)

Also thanks for the writing tip! :))
Alright so I quickly read, and I think 2B is not really a Hedonist: she's ready to embrace this pain. She's the one believing the most in Humanity. When Adam tells her that Humanity is just about violence and Hate, she violently rejects his opinion, saying he doesn't know a thing about humans. 

She truly believed in humanity. Maybe she suspected humans to be dead, but she still was ready to do her duty. 

And the first time she killed 9S, she told herself to never get too close to someone, so she can do her duty efficiently. She killed many comrades, but 9S was the hardest. She didn't even kill him, it was a virus trap in 2Bs data that killed him: she was too clumsy and 9S understood she was about to kill him, and out of self defence, he hacked her to prevent her from doing it. And then he died.

A year later, 2B was still paired with 9S, and 2B was almost trying to get herself killed. He eventually fixed her wounds and logic virus, but learnt she's a 2E unit. She asked him to kill her, but 9S took her blade and ended his own life, asking 2B to promise him to be the one to always kill him in the future. 

And that way, 2B was still following orders, but only followed them out of love. 

She still has a deep love for Humanity and for 9S (Unlike him apparently, who, in the best case, find humans curious). And she believed probably in the YorHa project. But eventually, for us, whether of not she believed in the project doesn't matter: she loves 9S, and she has to keep her promise.
They are very simliar but there's also some differences.

Have fun.
    So what you say is that I might actually have actually thought that the memory cage and memory thorn are the same stories and skipped the other one? 

That explains things. Thanks
        Idk, maybe?

They start similarly but the end is different.
            AAAAAHHH I FCKING KNEW IT

I WAS SURE OF ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED 

Thank you for this lmao
                Now read the other link.

Especially a repeating prayer part.
                    So I've read memory cages and memory thorns. 

Do you mean the memories of puppets?
                        Yes
                            I'll go for it
            Yeah I'm reading it, it's actually different after 5 paragraphs XD thanks a lot
            Lmao o read the beginning and believed that this was the same thing after reading 3 paragraphs xd
                And I wondered why you didn't say a thing about it when I asked you...
                    Because when I read it (and dozen of people talked with me, so I was getting mixed up, and it was 3 am), I believed they were both the same things. So I was confused, that's it
but commander died because the Yorha got the virus, I don't know if that was programmed or not
    Yeah so what? Because im not sure i umderstand your point here. Also virus attack wasnt programmed. It is just the way machines decided to attack the bunker.
        If the virus wasn''t planned she died by the events caused  from the actions of 2B and 9S, but some points aren't clear to me maybe I'm wrong
            First of all what does any of this have to do with 2b making decision herself or representing free will or breaking the cycle or whatever you wrote in that first comment?

Second of all virus wasnt planned and she didnt die from events caused by 2b&9s. Machines would attack the bunker sooner or later no matter what 2b&9s did because machines attacking the bunker was part of the project yorha itself.
Yeah if anything, the Commander is the one who tried to follow that morale.
This is grim but accurate in a way. I guess it kind of did end the same way as it always does.

(And to top off the tragedy... well, A2 has her face, doesn't she? 2B's face still would have been one of the last things he saw. Oof.)
Actually, 2B was not aware of it. Or more importantly, it eventually didn't matter. 

To make it short, eventually, 9S realized what happened, understanding she's a 2E type. And when she asked him to kill her, he ended his life himself.

And before dying, he asked 2B to not hesitate next time, so 9S will have the joy to meet her again, be with her, and die by her hand.

So eventually, she was not killing 9S purely by following orders, but she was doing it out of love.

But is the 9S she knew at first the same of the others?

That's one of the questions I'm still asking myself now, so I'm reading moreb
    This is kind of a philosophy thing, but I think if someone lived their entire lives from start to finish with new memories, same body or not, they’re a different person.
    "So eventually, she was not killing 9S purely by following orders, but she was doing it out of love."

Yes yes yes yes yes, I second the hell out of this
"I think that 2B would happily rest in peace at the beginning of the game..."

If you're referring to the opening mission and the black box reaction, I 100% agree. It would have been the perfect way to go--as comrades, with no YoRHa-ordained murder, doing what they loved lol. She seems genuinely happy in that moment. It's also reversed immediately, leaving her to grapple with the same cycle and the same choice alone again.

I do think that promise is important and core to her determination to keep going. And a different person might not have made that promise. A different person might have ignored that conversation as soon as 9S could no longer remember it. It's a hard promise to keep, and 2B keeps it, despite the fact that the moment after she makes it there is no longer anyone who can bear witness to her determination but her. (Oooh and maybe Pod? The Pods are like the chorus at a tragedy, observing everything and lamenting the story's passage but never interfering... until the end, of course.)
