[[I’ve been playing nier automata the past few days and I just got to here. This game is gonna make me cry]]





Congrats on getting through the prologue.
    Played the whole thing with a friend and we were flabbergasted when we got here "Dude, all of that was just the prologue... the prologue was so long it had a prologue."
Yes it is. It's a wonderful experience. Keep on going, and try to avoid the sub for any potential spoilers
    That’s the plan. I just had to share it cuz I didn’t expect the game to take this kinda turn at all
        I don't blame you. Welcome to Nier: Automata
Just know you need to get to ending E
    I am aware thank you. I thought the only main endings were A, B, and C so when I say C and D in the same preview cutscene I googled which ones were the main endings just to be sure
        Have fun. Fantastic game I wish I could experience again for the first time .
        AFTER ending E >!check out [post ending E stuff](https://theark.wiki/w/I_just_got_Ending_E) on the ark wiki, and especially the [epilogue ](https://theark.wiki/w/Farewell) for the true ending. I also highly recommend the [reading of it](https://youtu.be/uVr_bZpj4JY?si=TqlbFiUDSA9ZvV9W) by Kira and Kyle (English VAs)!<
Ahh more tears to come..!!!
This part made me realize why this games beloved. Literally mouth agape wondering “wtf” and smiling realizing I just found one of my new favorite video games.
    The sheer balls to hide a third of the game (in playtime) behind A and B scenario… I can only imagine the conversations that went on at Square HQ… the CEO saying no, no, no and Yoko Taro just rolling on the ground with his hands over his ears… :D
That was such a "holy sh*t" moment for me.

Especially now that The Tower is actually towering over the ENTIRE map, I've never felt such scale in a video game before. Sure Jörmungandr is huge, but he isn't THE SIZE OF THE ENTIRE MAP and VISIBLE AT ALL TIMES
    You'll really dig Elden Ring's sense of scale. :P
just finished it with endings A-E

i don't even know what to say. crazy game.
No spoilers: I will leave this message from my own ending E in case u need it at some point:  
  
I'm sure you can't take it anymore. But... what if you try to go a little further?
    Jesus, just this made me tear up…
Thats the point! Yaaaaaay!
Oh, this game will break your heart over and over. And you'll love it.
“Welcome to Nier Automata” moment lol
When crumbling lies (front) and the credits start playing amidst 2B's screaming *chef's kiss*
I feel you bro. Hope you like the game. (The depression starts here)
Yeah, it's know for doing that.
Lured you with the booty, got you with the heart
Great! Now this feeling will follow you for the rest of your life :)
Yeah there nothing happy really from here on out. Stick it out get ending E and come back so we can all tell you it will be alright but all the pain was worth it.
Why yes, yes it is. Enjoy it, you'll never get that first time feeling again =\\
Yes, yes it will.
The literal meaning of depression
One of my top 3 games of All Time and it’s probably number 1!
oh no, this game is gonna break you.
Now the real main character will take over
Oh it won't make you cry at first, but once it does it won't let up.
Become as gods


moment you hear that sentence grab a box of tissues. Assuming you didnt blow through any by then
Oh how I envy people who get to play for the first time. I’d love to experience it all over again
Yes. Yes it will.
Oh man, it just gets worse (better)
yes.
Welcome to the emotional rollercoaster ride. Enjoy.
Oh, wait until you play *NieR: Replicant*, mate. 🥲
it only gets worse (better) from here bud 👍
F to those who didn't actually finished the game and thought the prologue is the ending.

\*Ending E is the ~~true~~ actual ending of the game.
You have no idea. Remember to go for ending E and good luck
Weight of the World
I feel so hollow…..
now it's gonna make you cry EVERY time\*, because you will not have a rest and only your tears are proof that you sill alive
Best delayed title card ever.
its strange how i felt a real sadness when i first finished this game years ago but felt nothing when i did the same few days ago   
character development i guess  
side note: why tf does replicant 1.22 has loading screens after every door   
im literally seeing more loadings than the actual game. automata even with all the gameplay and lod problems it had (thank god we have mods) hyped me up for playing that one and the moment i got into the game i got bombarded with loadings ruining the experience not to mention the 57fps cap which made the game feel like a blurry mess  
how do they take a masterpiece and ruin it like this?
    Replicant was a remaster. That was the loading screens the game always had. They pretty much didn't alter anything but visuals and sound.

Edit: Sorry, but I don't think it was ruined. Replicant is definitely still a masterpiece in its own right.
        they did all those loadings back then because of hardware issues but now with their amazing toylo engine i feel like we are the hardware issues  
but about the ruining youre right i probably got tired after 60 hours in nier automata and when i started playing the prequel got annoyed with the technical stuff like motion blur and those stuff  
i should try again in a few weeks and ill probably finish it again after 2 years  
but i swear to god rep1.22 didnt feel this bad the first time i played it now all i see is ghosting which special k fixed
            I played on PS originally, so the console didn't have any issues. I'm currently playing it on steam deck and haven't really seen any issues. But I just got to Kaine. Loading seems pretty fast though. Fast as in 4 to 5 seconds. But that doesn't bother me.
                you probably dont play that many fast paced games with 140+fps so you dont care but its really annoying when you see these stuff   
im at a point where 4 fps of motion blur just annoys the f out of me
                    140 FPS?! Can your eyes even keep up with that?! Jk. 4 fps motion blur? Not sure what you mean by that. Makes it sound like your trying to say multiple FPSs at once.
                        lets say you have 100 frames in a scene and 4 of them have motion blur   
those 4 frames stick out real bad
Wah wah wah. Man up already.
