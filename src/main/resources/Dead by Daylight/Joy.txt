A Michael gave me hatch just yesterday and I feel like this is him
    Maybe it was me, haha. What rank?
        4
            Too bad, it wasn't me
                I did the same thing but instead of the hatch because I accidentally stomp it I let the survivor got out of my hands and watch him open the door and went back inside and he left but I was legion.
                    Necroposter
    A Michael chased me for an eternity just to grab me once and insta kill. Fun
        RIP
        They can't insta kill if you get in a locker, it forces him to hook or slug.
            damn. good thinking
                It's the pain of playing against tombstone Myers.
                They can be complete dogshit at the game but all they need to do is catch once
            Actually... moris exist...
            How does Myers instakill?
                With an add-on, either Judith's tombstone or the tombstone piece. When he gets to tier 3 he can kill a survivor and go back to tier 2 unless he has the infinite tier 3 add-on which is the other pink add-on.
                    Holy crap that's powerful
                        It takes a lot of set up to get it to work so if you can deny him from stalking by not getting caught out in the open or letting him sneak up on you then it's a little easier. But you can jump into a locker and force him to leave you on the ground or hook.

                what the. no way.
        Were you that one Nancy from the Swamp map?
            Never been Nancy
        Sir I'm sorry sir was on PlayStation because that might have been me
    I did this yesterday, as a Michael, at rank 19
    WAS IT A MEG
    what map? cause i was a rank 4 micheal, not anymore. (fuck you rank reset)
    Same! Lol
*It's not losing a kill, it's winning with style.*
    I appreciate you
    Honestly how I feel. If I've got the last survivor in my clutches, I've already won. I can be generous in victory.
        I have a system. If I find hatch before the last one, I close it and kill them. If I find them first, free hatch.
            Yep, ditto. For me its just about ending the game at that point, i don't want to spend four minutes finding a blendette in a hatch game. If I find them i usually just walk em to a gate and let em wiggle because i jsut want the game to be over now that I've already won.
                This is literally exactly what someone did for me today...after shutting the hatch right in my face lol
            I've seen some people do that
            For me it‚Äôs if they‚Äôre the last player and are chill with me, then I‚Äôll let them go.
    Unless I'm playing killer because I was camped and tunneled every game in survivor or going for a challenge, I always let the last survivor go in what would've been a 4k. I just love when it happens to me, so I hope I make another survivors day a lil better. Especially if i notice they're obviously a rando in a 3man.
        Ya once I got my 4k achieve I just either put the final on the hatch or stare at them menacingly while they open the door
            i love having a good old staredown honestly
        me too with complimenting the killer, the amount of times ive been complimented as killer is in the single digits and i remember every one because it absolutely made my day so whenever the killer did really well or had a tough game i like to give some kindness to them. except bubba. then i just say gg and move on.
            yeah! i like to send ggs when i can (i play console)
    Ya damn right it is. Sometimes its harder to give survivors hatch than it is to fucking kill them lmao
    I'm the kinda guy that will kill 3 survivors band stand on the hatch for +40 minutes waiting for the last one to give me a clue where they're at.
    10/10
    I believe they‚Äôre called the ‚ÄúGentleman Villain‚Äù sir
Plot twist

Killer: ‚ÄúNow... where would be the best place to do the mori?‚Äù
    Yes, please.
        Got to love when the killer is considerate enough too make sure we both get a good view.
            SAME idk how many times I‚Äôve gotten mori‚Äôd in the worst possible place and a fence or bush or tree is blocking my view. Like if you‚Äôre gonna kill me I at least want to watch.
                Haha maybe I'm petty but I always try to crawl into an awkward spot that is likely to ruin the camera angle in a funny way ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
                I have a couple funny clips of some really bad moris. One i got morid through a wall on Hawkins and you couldn't even see the Trapper, it was funny
    Red Forest that center is literally the best
    This is exactly what I thought!
    Ah yes, right next to the hatch üòÇ
    I never thought of this and you just gave me new evil idea
    The only acceptable reason to take survivor to hatch.
    What does mean mori?
        There are 3 offerings, a pair of perks and 2 add-ons that allow killers to kill survivors, the ‚Äúmori‚Äù name comes from ‚Äúmemento mori‚Äù (remember that you die) that are the offerings that depending on the rarity will let the killer kill all survivors that are ‚Äúdead on hook‚Äù, just one of them or the last one in the trial no matter how many times has been hooked.
            I see so if I want to kill with my hands I need to offer an offering that allow my killer to kill
Blessed meme
I always enjoy giving the last survivor the hatch, just because they always seem happy and makes them have a good time.
    What do you do when survivors keep struggling when you're taking them to the hatch?
        If you struggle you die. You are the last one on the way to the hook, dont bother me with this nonsense, and i may show mercy.
            found the serial killer lol
                Lol, but i think im a friendly Killer.
Try to go for the one who saved, try to hook everyone equally, give hatch to the last one if he was friendly too
                    we appreciate you
                        Well usually i get teabagged for it, so its nice to hear it :)
                            What if it's a friendly crouch spam? I take it as a playful gesture when I do it lmao
                                No such thing to me. I see t-bagging, I see it as ultimate disrespect
        I usually use my M1, walk past hooks, or let them get off me and help them find it.
        I usually hit the air 2 times to get them to stop and it usually works
        I throw them on the ground a few times after downing them and flail my mouse around so they know I mean no harm. Usually they‚Äôll let me take them wherever once I do that.
        I always drop them and shake my head no, because someone did that to me once while taking me to hatch and I understood immediately
Wholesome :)
If I'm the killer and I don't give you hatch, I assure you it's not because I hate you, it's because I don't know where it is and I'm very bad at finding it and I don't want to waste your time as a survivor hunting in circles for it while somehow missing the one spot that it's at.
    Sometimes, it is because I hate you.

Thinking of you, last night's Laurie, who switched to a key at the last second and sent us to the Swamp. Guess we want a sweaty game then, huh?
        All Swamp-worshippers must perish. This from a Claud main, I'd rather get that badham bug for myself till the end of time before willingly playing on Swamp once.
            I hate the swamp as a survivor.  As a Ghostface, please send me to swamp, I'd rather take that over Haddonfield.
                Sad thing is I'd still prefer Haddonfield. At least then they can't hide the whole match.
        Yo I got a swamp game with devour hope and I destroyed the survivors it was so fun. Then hatch spawned right next to my totem. I gave the last person hatch though because they kinda got pooped on.
        See if i see a key they had better hope im not on my baby girl huntress cus then I just grab iri head and go for the 4k my thought is well you wanted to end it quickly so let me help you out with that lol
    I was playing with a spirit who gave me hatch and we literally spent about 30 minutes looking for hatch. It was hilarious though and I loved every minute. Eventually they let me wiggle off and then we looked for it together.
    I don‚Äôt give hatch because I‚Äôm trying to role play as a scary killer here üò°üò°üò°
    I wandered the whole map with the last survivor in my hands searching for hatch. After the game they said they couldn't find it either. But I got that fish back into the sea
Woody‚Äôs fucking face when he realizes he gets to live LMAO
This is the best dbd meme I've ever seen. I can't express how happy it made me.
    Agreed. This is my GOAT post for this sub and one of the few memes I‚Äôm saving.
    Aww thank you so much!
I just wanna let you know - I've never played DBD, but this just came up on my feed, and feeling as if I was missing out in some brilliant joke, I checked the wiki to see what the hatch was.

That was 3 hours ago. Since then I have been scrolling through every key mechanic page, killer page, and survivor page, with some sort of ceaseless hunger for game knowledge for a game I will realistically never play. 

Nice meme. Fun wiki dive.
    That's me with Warhammer lore.
    Glad to know I'm not the only person who does this.
    Just play. Its fun. I just jumped in recently. I had no idea the depth of this game.
I really like this meme because whenever I do play killer (I play demo btw) I always give the last person hatch :)
    Greetings my demo doggo br√∂ther. I also give last survivor hatch, unless it was a tier 3 900% immersed Claudette/survivor of your choice
        Woah how many of us demo mains that let the last go are there
            Another brother
                Now 5
                    Is there a Demogorgon sub reddit?
                        There should be 

We should call ourselves the demodoggos
                            Just made one, r/demodoggy
                                Well I‚Äôm defo joining this
                                    ayyy welcome in
            Plenty more since the Add-ons became much better. All hail Barb's Glasses.
            I played some demo games today and gave hatch in all of them, even to a toxic clicky clicky swf (I requested them to be less toxic in the post game chat) :)
                By chance was that a Meg on a Gideon map?
                    I don't remember playing meat plant yesterday, I gave hatch to a meg with object on rotten fields tho.
        That‚Äôs a bit racist
            Yes, denying hatch to an immersed 5head blendette that didn‚Äôt do anything to help her team is a bit racist. Please grow up a lil.
                And how tf do you know she didn‚Äôt do anything to help her team? A lot of blendettes I know do gens or safely unhook teammates. And how do you know if they‚Äôre not a new player? Going after one specific character just because of their skin color and they‚Äôre able to hide better is definitely code for racism.
                    In fairness, you *were* making good points until that last part. Maybe next time, don‚Äôt look into a joke so hard bro ü§®
                        Tbh I was trolling about the racist part, because you did say ‚Äúinsert other survivor name‚Äù but still you should really rethink your judgements
                    I didn‚Äôt know it was possible to reach this hard. Color me impressed
                        Thank you bro üòé
                            You always reach your target in an impressive way. Now you've done it 457 times.
                                Aww thanks
                        I see what you did there üòÜ
*if I am carrying you and have clearly missed hooks stop wiggling*


Even after dropping and shaking my head some people just don't seem to get it.


For me as killer if there is a DC and the match is quick I'll let the last survivor escape via hatch
He is going to Close it and Nod
    and wait the 3 minutes for you to bleed out
        Isn‚Äôt that just so much fun?
        The egc will kill them before that happens.

        The second I see someone use ‚Äúget good‚Äù or ‚Äúez‚Äù I instantly know two things about them:

1.) They are young.
2.) Their parents don‚Äôt spend enough time with them.

I‚Äôm a middle-aged dad. I often want to reach out to young kids like you and offer to spend some time with them. If you‚Äôre a toxic player or even a toxic person in general, it‚Äôs only partially your fault. I‚Äôm sorry your parents didn‚Äôt spend more time with you, buddy. I‚Äôm sorry you weren‚Äôt raised right. If I could give you a hug, I would. No bullshit, if you need someone to talk to or someone to play a few rounds with, send me a PM.
            Or they could just be an asshole.
                Two things can be true. Nonetheless, my experience has been that kindness and empathy goes a lot further than calling people assholes. Then again, we‚Äôre on a sub for a game where we regularly stick people on hooks and sacrifice them to a dark entity. So maybe my well-meaning nature is out of place.
                    Your sentiments are admirable. Nonetheless, we cannot ignore the possibility that some people are capricious merely by virtue of their character. No past trauma has provoked them. They exhibit hostility because they like it.
            The Rick and Morty username is also a huge indicator.
            Not true. I use it sometimes when I lose for laughs.
            User deleted comment. As a 34 yr old father myself, I hope maybe you got through to them that toxicity should not be the norm.
            You're both cunts
                Sorry you feel that way. Offer‚Äôs good for you too, buddy.
                    [deleted]
                        I don't even own this game. Just funny to see a grown man make an assumption about someone's upbringing simply because they said 'get good' and 'ez'. The superiority complex is strong with this one.

                                You know that silver is a free award ? People often just don‚Äôt give paid awards .
            Yea..im 46. (Still game everyday. Will be gaming til I die). The reason I play video games is bc I enjoy competition. I played lots of sports growing up. And played soccer and football competitively. Once you hit mid 20-s..no more sports. Get into 30s and 40s and no competition ever. No way to scratch that itch..except with your thumbs. Or fingers..im console. A large part of sports is "sportsmanship". Telling the other guy nice play when they do something amazing. Sticking out a hand to help someone up(after you just fouled the shit out of them). I never execute when I play Gears of War(unless I get executed first)-then I go out of my way to execute them. My point is, when I see the tbagging, git gud, eeezzz, standing at the exit boundary flicking flashlights on and off-Its just sad and pathetic. Play every competitive game with ethics and class. Nothing wrong with putting people on hooks. That is the killers job. Also nothing wrong with showing them the exit door after everyone else is dead. Its a lot easier to help someone up than kick them when they are down.
I did this a few times yesterday.

Went against toxic SWF groups as well so they didn‚Äôt get hatch. You tbag or flashlight spam and you‚Äôre getting hooked. Idc.
    Any tips on dealing with those fucktards? They get on my nerves and they must feel SO GOOD seeing me ragequit because I just SUCK and they remind me of it. I recently uninstalled because they were way too frequent and I can‚Äôt do anything about them, but I want to go back someday.

Also why the fuck do I still get up on the ranks if I keep ‚Äúlosing‚Äù?!
        I only play killer every once in a while (rank 17) and I get put against sweats with flashlights too. I like to do killer at night, bc if I see a 4 man with flashlights, I just leave lobby and then another lobby immediately pops up for me lol
        I also have no clue how ranks work in this game. I just try to get as many hooks and kills as I can. Put some pressure on gens. If possible I try and lead them into a 3 gen situation where I‚Äôm heavily favored. 

When against SWF teams I like running Discordance/BBQ and Chili for tracking gens or survivors, Corrupt Intervention, Surge/Ruin/Thanatophobia to slow the game down, Stridor + Sloppy Butcher (depending on what killer I‚Äôm using). I‚Äôve had the most success with Legion, Spirit, Shape, and Ghost Face. Leatherface can be extremely oppressive. I like Pyramid Head as well because he can bypass stuff like DS and BT with his cages. Sometimes you can‚Äôt do much because communication in this game is ridiculously OP mixed with the meta survivor perks.
        Use NOED lmao. Fight toxicity with more toxicity.
I like this meme because every time a killer gives me a hatch it‚Äôs always Michael
That's me cause like, YOUR INTENTIOANLLY LOSING BLOODPOINTS! Your so kind
    Killer earns way more bp on average than survivor in my experience, so I feel like it's just good to help spread the bp a bit.
        Especially for a noob Dwight that I am. You could barely tell the difference between me and a 0 hour player
thank you to all killers who give hatch. you guys make my day. recently, i‚Äôve had 0 killers like this lmao.
It‚Äôs not ‚Äú we‚Äôre not aiming for the hook‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äú..... (heavy breathing)....‚Äù
    üõ´
This subreddit honestly has the best memes when it comes to games
I always give last survivor hatch unless the team was toxic. That or I have a challenge to sacrifice survivors to the entity.
    Out of the loop what‚Äôs so good about the hatch?
        A hatch escape grants extra blood points I think. 

Additionally it lets the last survivor (or multiple survivors if a key was used) escape without all the gens being done/exit gate opened.
Underrated
Such a good meme even though it‚Äôs so simple lol
This became me when I reached rank 1. I just want to goof around now and let survivors rank up. As long as I get my BP, and challenges done, I‚Äôm fine. If the survivors want to meme, I do it with them now too. It‚Äôs nice to finally enjoy DBD
am i a bad killer if i let everyone left alive go if they get all the generators working? idk bro haha, i just don‚Äôt care to kill anyone unless they‚Äôre toxic. i usually knock them down and hook twice then let them be after, and i even open an exit gate if i canüíÄ
I was playing Ghostie the other day and I spent an embarrassing almost 10 minutes trying to find the hatch while carrying a Meg. It was on a hill but that moaning tree on that farm map
    I (among others) would not mind staring at Ghostface carrying my ass for as long as possible üò∂
        HAHAHAH but it was more that I just felt like an absolute idiot not being able to find the hatch
            Nah you shouldn‚Äôt. Map big hatch small. Most survivors are just happy getting a hatch if they had rough matches that night. That said there will thirsty comments post match following that, you and the Myers players have been warned.
I don‚Äôt get it can someone explain?
    When a killer downs a survivor when they are looking for hatch, they usually kill them, but some killers are nice enough to carry survivors to hatch
        Ohhhh ok thanks
        Why? That results in you losing the game
            You don't need a 4k to win in dbd. Just have a good enough preformance.
            If you chase enough, scare enough and generally terrify the players enough you still win if you get 1 kill. You don't need to wipe the entire team.
really, it feels like you have still won when you let one go into the hatch
*drops you ten feet away, closes it. picks you up, hooks you, face camps
Wholesome!
Honestly, as the last survivor, there's no point in struggling.
Properly the best meme I've seen on this subreddit to date.
Thank you so much for making my day with your masterpiece meme!
This meme can be reverted and still is fun
Ahahaha this is so perfect
I had this happen to me for the first time today and it was the sweetest thing. It was very obvious most of us survivors were new players.
I just did something like this but I was playing as death slinger lmao
A true hero
*You got a Friend in Me intensifies*
I just had this moment last game. He walked me to the hatch then turned and hooked me.
Top 5 memes I've seen on DBD üòÇüòÇüòÇ
This is top tier
Literally me.
r/wholesomememes with r/deadbydaylight?
This is now my favorite post of all time
If I change my name to Daddy Myers/ Daddy Oni / BigKnifeDaddy69 you know i'm giving you hatch
Kek
I usually end up arguing with every killer who tries to let me go, both of us vigorously shaking our heads yes and no at each other. I‚Äôve had a Michael down me and drop me right at the exit so i couldn‚Äôt sacrifice myself.
Have some silver XOXO Lmao I thought this was going a whole different direction... But yet it‚Äôs Sooo Wholesome <3 <3 <3
I like giving hatch but don‚Äôt do it every game, if you were nice and fun to play against then fine, if you weren‚Äôt you‚Äôre getting hooked, or if you‚Äôre my 4th bbq stack and I haven‚Äôt gotten it yet, bloodpoints come before human lives
I once played dbd mobile (while there was a bug you couldnt move, you could only crouch). Michael tried to give me hatch but i simply couldnt jump into it :((
If the survivor is BMing me all game, I always drop them a few feet away then close it right front of them. Makes me laugh every time.
Last few games I‚Äôve been last surv. Wasn‚Äôt toxic at all in the game. Never got hatch, but just had a ghost face hook me right next to the hatch when he grabbed me from opening the exit gates. ü•≤ü•≤üíî
If i give the hatch to you is because you bested me without being toxic nor stupid (which is very rare considering how many survivors can't resist the urge of t-bagging and then get camped because of it)
Just realized the part to the far right is most likely the after game lobby...

Never mind I thought this was a glitch and they were above the map... Just realized it was the hatch...
\*close the hatch\* :trollmyers:
This is so good LMFAOOOOOO
Your Michaels really give you the hatch?
I only give hatch if one survivor was pulling their weight, but got screwed over by bad teammates. Or if someone runs BPS.
i always get facecamped by michaels
Lmao I report the killer any time they do this - even if it‚Äôs *for* me.
    Way to be a buzzkill I guess?
        Buzzkill? Lmao

How do you think the 3 other sacrificed survivors feel?

There‚Äôs no point to this and it‚Äôs literally against the games rules.

        What‚Äôs the point of sacrificing 3 people and giving the 4th special treatment?

It‚Äôs literally against the game rules.
            [deleted]
                Because that‚Äôs not how the game is played.

There should be no such thing as a ‚Äúnice killer‚Äù
    to bad reporting literally does nothing üòÇ
        It‚Äôs a shame.

They definitely need to revamp it.
    not against the rules. you‚Äôre just dumb

Letting someone escape is usually more satisfying than killing them
Couldn't be me
The hero we didn't ask for but desperately needed. Respect.
I only do this if I play as a high tier killer like spirit or pyramid head. Poor babies have suffered enough
Anyone care to explain this for someone who‚Äôs only familiar with the game from let‚Äôs plays?
    Sometimes killers will give the last survivor hatch instead of killing them
        Especially moreso if the other three survivors just left without trying to heal the last one
That was honestly hilarious. Well done!
When your last alive and you stop struggling and then killer shows you mercy. Best feeling ever
Petition to make this a new meme format? Yes please!

Also, this DO be how it do.
Then they drop you a couple inches behind it, and close the hatch in front of you.. üò™
Me playing Myers. üòÑ
And then they slam it in your face
YSK: the Mike Meyers mask is ackshually a crappy Captain Kirk mask...
I love this so much <3
Replace Michael with ghost face and hatch with me and survivor frantically looking for the hatch before giving up and heading for the gate someone left open.
I do this all the time as any killer, unless I had a really bad game before and I sacrifice everyone out of frustration
UWU
Wholesome content.

This is my favorite part of being the killer.
This is so cute
The worst types of killers are the one who will slug the second to last to survivor so they can make sure the other one doesn't get hatch
Basement I
Takes *Save The Best For Last* to a whole new level.
That's right, it goes in the square hole.
I feel so bad, I give the last survivor hatch every single game
The moment you struggle as the last survivor I'm putting you on hook. Don't struggle, you might get hatch.
I thought this was gonna end with a mori.
I once gave a claud hatch infront of a bill who bullied me.
This is so good. Brilliant. Gave me a good laugh.
Lol and they always close hatch in my face
And then...he closes it
I tend to give hatch to last survivor
Just gave my first hatch up on what would have been an easy 4k to a david.

just got doctor and hes so easy, but this david played smart, made saves, worked gens, tried to kill my ruin hex, I felt it was the right thing to do.
It is a rare gem to be given the hatch and I treasure it every time
Micheal:Fly you fools 
Survivor: YESSSSSSSS
This just happened to me recently and I was very confused. It was Michael Myers too. Is this a Myers players trait or just what some people do in general?
Actually I would do that in real life too 


If nobody knows me as I killed 3 people 


Are its still worth it
I remember being a baby David when actually getting into this game and not just having it sit in my steam library.

I tried doing a shack loop and failed horribly and dead harded into a wall.

Micheal downed me and carried me to the exit gate and let me escape.

Best experience I had on DBD so far.
Anytime a killer does that, I feel immediate gratitude and wish nothing but happiness upon that player XD
Wishful thinking
Were not aiming for the hacth

*preps mori with the evil within*
I do this every game
One Michael chased me like crazy and the moment I missed the flashlight blind and he came towards me in this hallway in Badham felt very much like the movies. He never hit me or the others, he just wanted to scare us. It worked XD
By the way, if both the survivor and killer are next to the hatch before it opens and both are mashing the button to either escape or close it, does one action generally take precedence over the other or is it just whichever input the game detects first?
you got a friend in me.
I kinda feel like its sportsmanship to give the hatch. I rarely play a game and think "nah, you are not getting hatch" and those are usually because they tried to be bullies and would be butt dancing at the door if it was the other way around. That doesn't bother me but I do it for those poor clown mains.
this is me literally every match i get hatch

‚Äúalright wraith just carry me to the hook ig i wont struggle‚Äù

‚Äúare you blind you just walked past the hook‚Äù

‚Äúomg he pasted another hes going for hatch HES GOING FOR HATCH‚Äù

and thats when they close it on me
Twitch.tv/ukzerupt go check them out, he's a good laugh üòÇ
I was wondering if there were 2 people, that are at least decent that would help me create a SWF group. We always get screwed due to lack of teammate communication and we‚Äôre desperate lol. PS4 ONLY
Everytime I play Mikey smh ü§£
Mike is good people
I remember when i was playing survivor (i main killer 24/7. Don't @ me) and i got caught by the killer (Hag) and she gave me the hatch
This literally just happened to me, Michael and everything lol üòÇ
I love doing this
earlier I was playing spirit on the game and I was chasing a nea when she pre dropped a pallet. we kinda stared at each other for a few seconds when we both realized that she had palleted herself in a little area with no exits, while injured, while on deathhook. I then broke the pallet and let her run off to continue playing. she ended up being the last one I killed so I gave her hatch. very enjoyable game and the endgame chat was wholesome
This is so cute
I don't understand. Why would killers take lms to the exit
Just remember not to wiggle! I have carried many survivors that lost their chance of hatch by trying to wiggle off.
No go to hook now
I remember one Michael getting me to the Hatch, and Mori'd me as I was inches from victory...
Maybe it was me, haha. What rank?
    4
        Too bad, it wasn't me
            I did the same thing but instead of the hatch because I accidentally stomp it I let the survivor got out of my hands and watch him open the door and went back inside and he left but I was legion.
                Necroposter
A Michael chased me for an eternity just to grab me once and insta kill. Fun
    RIP
    They can't insta kill if you get in a locker, it forces him to hook or slug.
        damn. good thinking
            It's the pain of playing against tombstone Myers.
            They can be complete dogshit at the game but all they need to do is catch once
        Actually... moris exist...
        How does Myers instakill?
            With an add-on, either Judith's tombstone or the tombstone piece. When he gets to tier 3 he can kill a survivor and go back to tier 2 unless he has the infinite tier 3 add-on which is the other pink add-on.
                Holy crap that's powerful
                    It takes a lot of set up to get it to work so if you can deny him from stalking by not getting caught out in the open or letting him sneak up on you then it's a little easier. But you can jump into a locker and force him to leave you on the ground or hook.

            what the. no way.
    Were you that one Nancy from the Swamp map?
        Never been Nancy
    Sir I'm sorry sir was on PlayStation because that might have been me
I did this yesterday, as a Michael, at rank 19
WAS IT A MEG
what map? cause i was a rank 4 micheal, not anymore. (fuck you rank reset)
Same! Lol
I appreciate you
Honestly how I feel. If I've got the last survivor in my clutches, I've already won. I can be generous in victory.
    I have a system. If I find hatch before the last one, I close it and kill them. If I find them first, free hatch.
        Yep, ditto. For me its just about ending the game at that point, i don't want to spend four minutes finding a blendette in a hatch game. If I find them i usually just walk em to a gate and let em wiggle because i jsut want the game to be over now that I've already won.
            This is literally exactly what someone did for me today...after shutting the hatch right in my face lol
        I've seen some people do that
        For me it‚Äôs if they‚Äôre the last player and are chill with me, then I‚Äôll let them go.
Unless I'm playing killer because I was camped and tunneled every game in survivor or going for a challenge, I always let the last survivor go in what would've been a 4k. I just love when it happens to me, so I hope I make another survivors day a lil better. Especially if i notice they're obviously a rando in a 3man.
    Ya once I got my 4k achieve I just either put the final on the hatch or stare at them menacingly while they open the door
        i love having a good old staredown honestly
    me too with complimenting the killer, the amount of times ive been complimented as killer is in the single digits and i remember every one because it absolutely made my day so whenever the killer did really well or had a tough game i like to give some kindness to them. except bubba. then i just say gg and move on.
        yeah! i like to send ggs when i can (i play console)
Ya damn right it is. Sometimes its harder to give survivors hatch than it is to fucking kill them lmao
I'm the kinda guy that will kill 3 survivors band stand on the hatch for +40 minutes waiting for the last one to give me a clue where they're at.
10/10
I believe they‚Äôre called the ‚ÄúGentleman Villain‚Äù sir
Yes, please.
    Got to love when the killer is considerate enough too make sure we both get a good view.
        SAME idk how many times I‚Äôve gotten mori‚Äôd in the worst possible place and a fence or bush or tree is blocking my view. Like if you‚Äôre gonna kill me I at least want to watch.
            Haha maybe I'm petty but I always try to crawl into an awkward spot that is likely to ruin the camera angle in a funny way ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
            I have a couple funny clips of some really bad moris. One i got morid through a wall on Hawkins and you couldn't even see the Trapper, it was funny
Red Forest that center is literally the best
This is exactly what I thought!
Ah yes, right next to the hatch üòÇ
I never thought of this and you just gave me new evil idea
The only acceptable reason to take survivor to hatch.
What does mean mori?
    There are 3 offerings, a pair of perks and 2 add-ons that allow killers to kill survivors, the ‚Äúmori‚Äù name comes from ‚Äúmemento mori‚Äù (remember that you die) that are the offerings that depending on the rarity will let the killer kill all survivors that are ‚Äúdead on hook‚Äù, just one of them or the last one in the trial no matter how many times has been hooked.
        I see so if I want to kill with my hands I need to offer an offering that allow my killer to kill
What do you do when survivors keep struggling when you're taking them to the hatch?
    If you struggle you die. You are the last one on the way to the hook, dont bother me with this nonsense, and i may show mercy.
        found the serial killer lol
            Lol, but i think im a friendly Killer.
Try to go for the one who saved, try to hook everyone equally, give hatch to the last one if he was friendly too
                we appreciate you
                    Well usually i get teabagged for it, so its nice to hear it :)
                        What if it's a friendly crouch spam? I take it as a playful gesture when I do it lmao
                            No such thing to me. I see t-bagging, I see it as ultimate disrespect
    I usually use my M1, walk past hooks, or let them get off me and help them find it.
    I usually hit the air 2 times to get them to stop and it usually works
    I throw them on the ground a few times after downing them and flail my mouse around so they know I mean no harm. Usually they‚Äôll let me take them wherever once I do that.
    I always drop them and shake my head no, because someone did that to me once while taking me to hatch and I understood immediately
Sometimes, it is because I hate you.

Thinking of you, last night's Laurie, who switched to a key at the last second and sent us to the Swamp. Guess we want a sweaty game then, huh?
    All Swamp-worshippers must perish. This from a Claud main, I'd rather get that badham bug for myself till the end of time before willingly playing on Swamp once.
        I hate the swamp as a survivor.  As a Ghostface, please send me to swamp, I'd rather take that over Haddonfield.
            Sad thing is I'd still prefer Haddonfield. At least then they can't hide the whole match.
    Yo I got a swamp game with devour hope and I destroyed the survivors it was so fun. Then hatch spawned right next to my totem. I gave the last person hatch though because they kinda got pooped on.
    See if i see a key they had better hope im not on my baby girl huntress cus then I just grab iri head and go for the 4k my thought is well you wanted to end it quickly so let me help you out with that lol
I was playing with a spirit who gave me hatch and we literally spent about 30 minutes looking for hatch. It was hilarious though and I loved every minute. Eventually they let me wiggle off and then we looked for it together.
I don‚Äôt give hatch because I‚Äôm trying to role play as a scary killer here üò°üò°üò°
I wandered the whole map with the last survivor in my hands searching for hatch. After the game they said they couldn't find it either. But I got that fish back into the sea
Agreed. This is my GOAT post for this sub and one of the few memes I‚Äôm saving.
Aww thank you so much!
That's me with Warhammer lore.
Glad to know I'm not the only person who does this.
Just play. Its fun. I just jumped in recently. I had no idea the depth of this game.
Greetings my demo doggo br√∂ther. I also give last survivor hatch, unless it was a tier 3 900% immersed Claudette/survivor of your choice
    Woah how many of us demo mains that let the last go are there
        Another brother
            Now 5
                Is there a Demogorgon sub reddit?
                    There should be 

We should call ourselves the demodoggos
                        Just made one, r/demodoggy
                            Well I‚Äôm defo joining this
                                ayyy welcome in
        Plenty more since the Add-ons became much better. All hail Barb's Glasses.
        I played some demo games today and gave hatch in all of them, even to a toxic clicky clicky swf (I requested them to be less toxic in the post game chat) :)
            By chance was that a Meg on a Gideon map?
                I don't remember playing meat plant yesterday, I gave hatch to a meg with object on rotten fields tho.
    That‚Äôs a bit racist
        Yes, denying hatch to an immersed 5head blendette that didn‚Äôt do anything to help her team is a bit racist. Please grow up a lil.
            And how tf do you know she didn‚Äôt do anything to help her team? A lot of blendettes I know do gens or safely unhook teammates. And how do you know if they‚Äôre not a new player? Going after one specific character just because of their skin color and they‚Äôre able to hide better is definitely code for racism.
                In fairness, you *were* making good points until that last part. Maybe next time, don‚Äôt look into a joke so hard bro ü§®
                    Tbh I was trolling about the racist part, because you did say ‚Äúinsert other survivor name‚Äù but still you should really rethink your judgements
                I didn‚Äôt know it was possible to reach this hard. Color me impressed
                    Thank you bro üòé
                        You always reach your target in an impressive way. Now you've done it 457 times.
                            Aww thanks
                    I see what you did there üòÜ
and wait the 3 minutes for you to bleed out
    Isn‚Äôt that just so much fun?
    The egc will kill them before that happens.

    The second I see someone use ‚Äúget good‚Äù or ‚Äúez‚Äù I instantly know two things about them:

1.) They are young.
2.) Their parents don‚Äôt spend enough time with them.

I‚Äôm a middle-aged dad. I often want to reach out to young kids like you and offer to spend some time with them. If you‚Äôre a toxic player or even a toxic person in general, it‚Äôs only partially your fault. I‚Äôm sorry your parents didn‚Äôt spend more time with you, buddy. I‚Äôm sorry you weren‚Äôt raised right. If I could give you a hug, I would. No bullshit, if you need someone to talk to or someone to play a few rounds with, send me a PM.
        Or they could just be an asshole.
            Two things can be true. Nonetheless, my experience has been that kindness and empathy goes a lot further than calling people assholes. Then again, we‚Äôre on a sub for a game where we regularly stick people on hooks and sacrifice them to a dark entity. So maybe my well-meaning nature is out of place.
                Your sentiments are admirable. Nonetheless, we cannot ignore the possibility that some people are capricious merely by virtue of their character. No past trauma has provoked them. They exhibit hostility because they like it.
        The Rick and Morty username is also a huge indicator.
        Not true. I use it sometimes when I lose for laughs.
        User deleted comment. As a 34 yr old father myself, I hope maybe you got through to them that toxicity should not be the norm.
        You're both cunts
            Sorry you feel that way. Offer‚Äôs good for you too, buddy.
                [deleted]
                    I don't even own this game. Just funny to see a grown man make an assumption about someone's upbringing simply because they said 'get good' and 'ez'. The superiority complex is strong with this one.

                            You know that silver is a free award ? People often just don‚Äôt give paid awards .
        Yea..im 46. (Still game everyday. Will be gaming til I die). The reason I play video games is bc I enjoy competition. I played lots of sports growing up. And played soccer and football competitively. Once you hit mid 20-s..no more sports. Get into 30s and 40s and no competition ever. No way to scratch that itch..except with your thumbs. Or fingers..im console. A large part of sports is "sportsmanship". Telling the other guy nice play when they do something amazing. Sticking out a hand to help someone up(after you just fouled the shit out of them). I never execute when I play Gears of War(unless I get executed first)-then I go out of my way to execute them. My point is, when I see the tbagging, git gud, eeezzz, standing at the exit boundary flicking flashlights on and off-Its just sad and pathetic. Play every competitive game with ethics and class. Nothing wrong with putting people on hooks. That is the killers job. Also nothing wrong with showing them the exit door after everyone else is dead. Its a lot easier to help someone up than kick them when they are down.
Any tips on dealing with those fucktards? They get on my nerves and they must feel SO GOOD seeing me ragequit because I just SUCK and they remind me of it. I recently uninstalled because they were way too frequent and I can‚Äôt do anything about them, but I want to go back someday.

Also why the fuck do I still get up on the ranks if I keep ‚Äúlosing‚Äù?!
    I only play killer every once in a while (rank 17) and I get put against sweats with flashlights too. I like to do killer at night, bc if I see a 4 man with flashlights, I just leave lobby and then another lobby immediately pops up for me lol
    I also have no clue how ranks work in this game. I just try to get as many hooks and kills as I can. Put some pressure on gens. If possible I try and lead them into a 3 gen situation where I‚Äôm heavily favored. 

When against SWF teams I like running Discordance/BBQ and Chili for tracking gens or survivors, Corrupt Intervention, Surge/Ruin/Thanatophobia to slow the game down, Stridor + Sloppy Butcher (depending on what killer I‚Äôm using). I‚Äôve had the most success with Legion, Spirit, Shape, and Ghost Face. Leatherface can be extremely oppressive. I like Pyramid Head as well because he can bypass stuff like DS and BT with his cages. Sometimes you can‚Äôt do much because communication in this game is ridiculously OP mixed with the meta survivor perks.
    Use NOED lmao. Fight toxicity with more toxicity.
Killer earns way more bp on average than survivor in my experience, so I feel like it's just good to help spread the bp a bit.
    Especially for a noob Dwight that I am. You could barely tell the difference between me and a 0 hour player
üõ´
Out of the loop what‚Äôs so good about the hatch?
    A hatch escape grants extra blood points I think. 

Additionally it lets the last survivor (or multiple survivors if a key was used) escape without all the gens being done/exit gate opened.
I (among others) would not mind staring at Ghostface carrying my ass for as long as possible üò∂
    HAHAHAH but it was more that I just felt like an absolute idiot not being able to find the hatch
        Nah you shouldn‚Äôt. Map big hatch small. Most survivors are just happy getting a hatch if they had rough matches that night. That said there will thirsty comments post match following that, you and the Myers players have been warned.
When a killer downs a survivor when they are looking for hatch, they usually kill them, but some killers are nice enough to carry survivors to hatch
    Ohhhh ok thanks
    Why? That results in you losing the game
        You don't need a 4k to win in dbd. Just have a good enough preformance.
        If you chase enough, scare enough and generally terrify the players enough you still win if you get 1 kill. You don't need to wipe the entire team.
Way to be a buzzkill I guess?
    Buzzkill? Lmao

How do you think the 3 other sacrificed survivors feel?

There‚Äôs no point to this and it‚Äôs literally against the games rules.

Sometimes killers will give the last survivor hatch instead of killing them
    Especially moreso if the other three survivors just left without trying to heal the last one

    Too bad, it wasn't me
        I did the same thing but instead of the hatch because I accidentally stomp it I let the survivor got out of my hands and watch him open the door and went back inside and he left but I was legion.

They can't insta kill if you get in a locker, it forces him to hook or slug.
    damn. good thinking
        It's the pain of playing against tombstone Myers.
        They can be complete dogshit at the game but all they need to do is catch once
    Actually... moris exist...
    How does Myers instakill?
        With an add-on, either Judith's tombstone or the tombstone piece. When he gets to tier 3 he can kill a survivor and go back to tier 2 unless he has the infinite tier 3 add-on which is the other pink add-on.
            Holy crap that's powerful
                It takes a lot of set up to get it to work so if you can deny him from stalking by not getting caught out in the open or letting him sneak up on you then it's a little easier. But you can jump into a locker and force him to leave you on the ground or hook.

        Good bot
        what the. no way.
Were you that one Nancy from the Swamp map?
    Never been Nancy
Sir I'm sorry sir was on PlayStation because that might have been me
I have a system. If I find hatch before the last one, I close it and kill them. If I find them first, free hatch.
    Yep, ditto. For me its just about ending the game at that point, i don't want to spend four minutes finding a blendette in a hatch game. If I find them i usually just walk em to a gate and let em wiggle because i jsut want the game to be over now that I've already won.
        This is literally exactly what someone did for me today...after shutting the hatch right in my face lol
    I've seen some people do that
    For me it‚Äôs if they‚Äôre the last player and are chill with me, then I‚Äôll let them go.
Ya once I got my 4k achieve I just either put the final on the hatch or stare at them menacingly while they open the door
    i love having a good old staredown honestly
me too with complimenting the killer, the amount of times ive been complimented as killer is in the single digits and i remember every one because it absolutely made my day so whenever the killer did really well or had a tough game i like to give some kindness to them. except bubba. then i just say gg and move on.
    yeah! i like to send ggs when i can (i play console)
Got to love when the killer is considerate enough too make sure we both get a good view.
    SAME idk how many times I‚Äôve gotten mori‚Äôd in the worst possible place and a fence or bush or tree is blocking my view. Like if you‚Äôre gonna kill me I at least want to watch.
        Haha maybe I'm petty but I always try to crawl into an awkward spot that is likely to ruin the camera angle in a funny way ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
        I have a couple funny clips of some really bad moris. One i got morid through a wall on Hawkins and you couldn't even see the Trapper, it was funny
There are 3 offerings, a pair of perks and 2 add-ons that allow killers to kill survivors, the ‚Äúmori‚Äù name comes from ‚Äúmemento mori‚Äù (remember that you die) that are the offerings that depending on the rarity will let the killer kill all survivors that are ‚Äúdead on hook‚Äù, just one of them or the last one in the trial no matter how many times has been hooked.
    I see so if I want to kill with my hands I need to offer an offering that allow my killer to kill
If you struggle you die. You are the last one on the way to the hook, dont bother me with this nonsense, and i may show mercy.
    found the serial killer lol
        Lol, but i think im a friendly Killer.
Try to go for the one who saved, try to hook everyone equally, give hatch to the last one if he was friendly too
            we appreciate you
                Well usually i get teabagged for it, so its nice to hear it :)
                    What if it's a friendly crouch spam? I take it as a playful gesture when I do it lmao
                        No such thing to me. I see t-bagging, I see it as ultimate disrespect
I usually use my M1, walk past hooks, or let them get off me and help them find it.
I usually hit the air 2 times to get them to stop and it usually works
I throw them on the ground a few times after downing them and flail my mouse around so they know I mean no harm. Usually they‚Äôll let me take them wherever once I do that.
I always drop them and shake my head no, because someone did that to me once while taking me to hatch and I understood immediately
All Swamp-worshippers must perish. This from a Claud main, I'd rather get that badham bug for myself till the end of time before willingly playing on Swamp once.
    I hate the swamp as a survivor.  As a Ghostface, please send me to swamp, I'd rather take that over Haddonfield.
        Sad thing is I'd still prefer Haddonfield. At least then they can't hide the whole match.
Yo I got a swamp game with devour hope and I destroyed the survivors it was so fun. Then hatch spawned right next to my totem. I gave the last person hatch though because they kinda got pooped on.
See if i see a key they had better hope im not on my baby girl huntress cus then I just grab iri head and go for the 4k my thought is well you wanted to end it quickly so let me help you out with that lol
Woah how many of us demo mains that let the last go are there
    Another brother

    Plenty more since the Add-ons became much better. All hail Barb's Glasses.
    I played some demo games today and gave hatch in all of them, even to a toxic clicky clicky swf (I requested them to be less toxic in the post game chat) :)
        By chance was that a Meg on a Gideon map?
            I don't remember playing meat plant yesterday, I gave hatch to a meg with object on rotten fields tho.
That‚Äôs a bit racist
    Yes, denying hatch to an immersed 5head blendette that didn‚Äôt do anything to help her team is a bit racist. Please grow up a lil.
        And how tf do you know she didn‚Äôt do anything to help her team? A lot of blendettes I know do gens or safely unhook teammates. And how do you know if they‚Äôre not a new player? Going after one specific character just because of their skin color and they‚Äôre able to hide better is definitely code for racism.
            In fairness, you *were* making good points until that last part. Maybe next time, don‚Äôt look into a joke so hard bro ü§®
                Tbh I was trolling about the racist part, because you did say ‚Äúinsert other survivor name‚Äù but still you should really rethink your judgements
            I didn‚Äôt know it was possible to reach this hard. Color me impressed
                Thank you bro üòé
                    You always reach your target in an impressive way. Now you've done it 457 times.
                        Aww thanks
                I see what you did there üòÜ
Isn‚Äôt that just so much fun?
The egc will kill them before that happens.
The second I see someone use ‚Äúget good‚Äù or ‚Äúez‚Äù I instantly know two things about them:

1.) They are young.
2.) Their parents don‚Äôt spend enough time with them.

I‚Äôm a middle-aged dad. I often want to reach out to young kids like you and offer to spend some time with them. If you‚Äôre a toxic player or even a toxic person in general, it‚Äôs only partially your fault. I‚Äôm sorry your parents didn‚Äôt spend more time with you, buddy. I‚Äôm sorry you weren‚Äôt raised right. If I could give you a hug, I would. No bullshit, if you need someone to talk to or someone to play a few rounds with, send me a PM.
    Or they could just be an asshole.
        Two things can be true. Nonetheless, my experience has been that kindness and empathy goes a lot further than calling people assholes. Then again, we‚Äôre on a sub for a game where we regularly stick people on hooks and sacrifice them to a dark entity. So maybe my well-meaning nature is out of place.
            Your sentiments are admirable. Nonetheless, we cannot ignore the possibility that some people are capricious merely by virtue of their character. No past trauma has provoked them. They exhibit hostility because they like it.
    The Rick and Morty username is also a huge indicator.
    Not true. I use it sometimes when I lose for laughs.
    User deleted comment. As a 34 yr old father myself, I hope maybe you got through to them that toxicity should not be the norm.
    You're both cunts
        Sorry you feel that way. Offer‚Äôs good for you too, buddy.
            [deleted]
                I don't even own this game. Just funny to see a grown man make an assumption about someone's upbringing simply because they said 'get good' and 'ez'. The superiority complex is strong with this one.

Edit: Man child acts pretentious on Reddit 101

                        You know that silver is a free award ? People often just don‚Äôt give paid awards .
    Yea..im 46. (Still game everyday. Will be gaming til I die). The reason I play video games is bc I enjoy competition. I played lots of sports growing up. And played soccer and football competitively. Once you hit mid 20-s..no more sports. Get into 30s and 40s and no competition ever. No way to scratch that itch..except with your thumbs. Or fingers..im console. A large part of sports is "sportsmanship". Telling the other guy nice play when they do something amazing. Sticking out a hand to help someone up(after you just fouled the shit out of them). I never execute when I play Gears of War(unless I get executed first)-then I go out of my way to execute them. My point is, when I see the tbagging, git gud, eeezzz, standing at the exit boundary flicking flashlights on and off-Its just sad and pathetic. Play every competitive game with ethics and class. Nothing wrong with putting people on hooks. That is the killers job. Also nothing wrong with showing them the exit door after everyone else is dead. Its a lot easier to help someone up than kick them when they are down.
I only play killer every once in a while (rank 17) and I get put against sweats with flashlights too. I like to do killer at night, bc if I see a 4 man with flashlights, I just leave lobby and then another lobby immediately pops up for me lol
I also have no clue how ranks work in this game. I just try to get as many hooks and kills as I can. Put some pressure on gens. If possible I try and lead them into a 3 gen situation where I‚Äôm heavily favored. 

When against SWF teams I like running Discordance/BBQ and Chili for tracking gens or survivors, Corrupt Intervention, Surge/Ruin/Thanatophobia to slow the game down, Stridor + Sloppy Butcher (depending on what killer I‚Äôm using). I‚Äôve had the most success with Legion, Spirit, Shape, and Ghost Face. Leatherface can be extremely oppressive. I like Pyramid Head as well because he can bypass stuff like DS and BT with his cages. Sometimes you can‚Äôt do much because communication in this game is ridiculously OP mixed with the meta survivor perks.
Use NOED lmao. Fight toxicity with more toxicity.
Especially for a noob Dwight that I am. You could barely tell the difference between me and a 0 hour player
A hatch escape grants extra blood points I think. 

Additionally it lets the last survivor (or multiple survivors if a key was used) escape without all the gens being done/exit gate opened.
HAHAHAH but it was more that I just felt like an absolute idiot not being able to find the hatch
    Nah you shouldn‚Äôt. Map big hatch small. Most survivors are just happy getting a hatch if they had rough matches that night. That said there will thirsty comments post match following that, you and the Myers players have been warned.
Ohhhh ok thanks
Why? That results in you losing the game
    You don't need a 4k to win in dbd. Just have a good enough preformance.
    If you chase enough, scare enough and generally terrify the players enough you still win if you get 1 kill. You don't need to wipe the entire team.
Buzzkill? Lmao

How do you think the 3 other sacrificed survivors feel?

There‚Äôs no point to this and it‚Äôs literally against the games rules.

/thread
What‚Äôs the point of sacrificing 3 people and giving the 4th special treatment?

It‚Äôs literally against the game rules.
    [deleted]
        Because that‚Äôs not how the game is played.

There should be no such thing as a ‚Äúnice killer‚Äù
It‚Äôs a shame.

            I don't even own this game. Just funny to see a grown man make an assumption about someone's upbringing simply because they said 'get good' and 'ez'. The superiority complex is strong with this one.

Yea..im 46. (Still game everyday. Will be gaming til I die). The reason I play video games is bc I enjoy competition. I played lots of sports growing up. And played soccer and football competitively. Once you hit mid 20-s..no more sports. Get into 30s and 40s and no competition ever. No way to scratch that itch..except with your thumbs. Or fingers..im console. A large part of sports is "sportsmanship". Telling the other guy nice play when they do something amazing. Sticking out a hand to help someone up(after you just fouled the shit out of them). I never execute when I play Gears of War(unless I get executed first)-then I go out of my way to execute them. My point is, when I see the tbagging, git gud, eeezzz, standing at the exit boundary flicking flashlights on and off-Its just sad and pathetic. Play every competitive game with ethics and class. Nothing wrong with putting people on hooks. That is the killers job. Also nothing wrong with showing them the exit door after everyone else is dead. Its a lot easier to help someone up than kick them when they are down.
Nah you shouldn‚Äôt. Map big hatch small. Most survivors are just happy getting a hatch if they had rough matches that night. That said there will thirsty comments post match following that, you and the Myers players have been warned.
You don't need a 4k to win in dbd. Just have a good enough preformance.
If you chase enough, scare enough and generally terrify the players enough you still win if you get 1 kill. You don't need to wipe the entire team.

    Because that‚Äôs not how the game is played.

There should be no such thing as a ‚Äúnice killer‚Äù

I did the same thing but instead of the hatch because I accidentally stomp it I let the survivor got out of my hands and watch him open the door and went back inside and he left but I was legion.

It's the pain of playing against tombstone Myers.
They can be complete dogshit at the game but all they need to do is catch once
With an add-on, either Judith's tombstone or the tombstone piece. When he gets to tier 3 he can kill a survivor and go back to tier 2 unless he has the infinite tier 3 add-on which is the other pink add-on.
    Holy crap that's powerful
        It takes a lot of set up to get it to work so if you can deny him from stalking by not getting caught out in the open or letting him sneak up on you then it's a little easier. But you can jump into a locker and force him to leave you on the ground or hook.
Good bot
what the. no way.
This is literally exactly what someone did for me today...after shutting the hatch right in my face lol
Haha maybe I'm petty but I always try to crawl into an awkward spot that is likely to ruin the camera angle in a funny way ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I have a couple funny clips of some really bad moris. One i got morid through a wall on Hawkins and you couldn't even see the Trapper, it was funny
Lol, but i think im a friendly Killer.
Try to go for the one who saved, try to hook everyone equally, give hatch to the last one if he was friendly too
    we appreciate you
        Well usually i get teabagged for it, so its nice to hear it :)
            What if it's a friendly crouch spam? I take it as a playful gesture when I do it lmao
                No such thing to me. I see t-bagging, I see it as ultimate disrespect
Sad thing is I'd still prefer Haddonfield. At least then they can't hide the whole match.
Now 5
    Is there a Demogorgon sub reddit?
        There should be 

We should call ourselves the demodoggos
            Just made one, r/demodoggy
                Well I‚Äôm defo joining this
                    ayyy welcome in
By chance was that a Meg on a Gideon map?
    I don't remember playing meat plant yesterday, I gave hatch to a meg with object on rotten fields tho.
And how tf do you know she didn‚Äôt do anything to help her team? A lot of blendettes I know do gens or safely unhook teammates. And how do you know if they‚Äôre not a new player? Going after one specific character just because of their skin color and they‚Äôre able to hide better is definitely code for racism.
    In fairness, you *were* making good points until that last part. Maybe next time, don‚Äôt look into a joke so hard bro ü§®
        Tbh I was trolling about the racist part, because you did say ‚Äúinsert other survivor name‚Äù but still you should really rethink your judgements
    I didn‚Äôt know it was possible to reach this hard. Color me impressed
        Thank you bro üòé
            You always reach your target in an impressive way. Now you've done it 457 times.
                Aww thanks
        I see what you did there üòÜ
Two things can be true. Nonetheless, my experience has been that kindness and empathy goes a lot further than calling people assholes. Then again, we‚Äôre on a sub for a game where we regularly stick people on hooks and sacrifice them to a dark entity. So maybe my well-meaning nature is out of place.
    Your sentiments are admirable. Nonetheless, we cannot ignore the possibility that some people are capricious merely by virtue of their character. No past trauma has provoked them. They exhibit hostility because they like it.
