[[Which survivor has the most annoying wiggle sounds]]





Either her or Yun Jin, otherwise I don't pay attention. The fact that those two make me notice though shows how annoying they are
    Not nearly as bad as when you stick yin jun on the hook.. jeez my ear drums always need 6 years of therapy after
        The sounds she makes when she's falling always make up for the ear piercing screams in my opinion
        No wonder her perks are about letting her team die to give her bonuses, she can‚Äôt take pain whatsoever
        Hitting a survivor on hook makes them stop their scream
            And then you‚Äôll get teabagged at exit gate for bm.
                You'll get teabagged at the exit gate for literally just being there, may as well minimise your annoyance as much as you can
                    Was just about to say the same thing, lol
                Not if it‚Äôs just the one hit to stop the scream. That‚Äôs common practice. Though toxic survivors will always be toxic no matter what you do.
                As if you don't always get teabagged anyway
                ROFL. You get teabagged and BMed at the exit gates for the simple skin of "queueing up to play as Killer." I'd love to live in your world, where you actually have to do something that could potentially be seen as BM in order for Survivors to treat you like garbage. ![img](emote|t5_3cb2g|2067)
                I just bleed every survivor out to avoid being toxic
        Part of why I main Jane Romero is her sounds aren‚Äôt hella annoying. After several years of playing Feng Min and having several Feng‚Äôs a lobby, she was still annoying
            We all know the second part.

    Yun Jin sounds like she‚Äôs gargling balls.
    On the other hand, Ashes incidental sounds are amazing. From his wiggle groan that sounds like he‚Äôs lifting weights to his scream that sounds like a chicken squawking. Steve is up there as well with his goober scream.
    I forget, is Yun Jin the one that goes "Uh uh!" When you pick her up
        Nope, that would be good ole Claudette!
Jane sounds like she's dry heaving, I hate it.
    My friends say Jane sounds like a horse and now I can't unhear it
        what
    What does dry heaving mean ?
        Sounds like you're going to throw up but nothing comes out.
    sounds of heaven
Going against the grain, because I love Bill's wiggle sounds. Every time he says "Whyy?" It gets me!
    I love when he gets downed and says something like ‚Äúeeeeehhhh!!!!‚Äù.
    The little "yes!" is great
        Bill speaks?
            not really. 

https://youtu.be/bTHnWfVmhys?si=GrW46UPjlMDllaga

at 4:43 he wiggles and sounds like hes saying ‚Äúwhy‚Äù but i doubt it was intentional.
    Every time I'm killer and carrying him, and bill says "why?" It makes me feel a bit bad for him lol
Cybil
Yunjin by a landslide
    # DUAHEEHA OOEH EREEOO DOOIP EHHH
        You have won the Yun-Jin Karaoke Contest! ![img](emote|t5_3cb2g|2212)
    duuuuEEEEh DEEuuuEEh
        #KYAAAAAAA!!!!!!!
    She sounds like Banjo from Banjo Kazooie
I played Left 4 Dead for years with Bill on my side, everytme he says "Why?" It cuts deep..

I'm sorry man..
    TIL Bill is not original from DBD ![img](emote|t5_3cb2g|2214)
        Wtf neeko
            I've been discovered

I agree with Rebecca. I would say Yoichi sounds pretty obnoxious as well.
I swear if i play with headphones off my family would think i'm watching a porno if i carry a Feng around
    Mikaela‚Äôs wiggle sounds isn‚Äôt annoying to me, but boy does it sound suggestive.
        Claire would like a word
            I, unfortunately, rarely play with or against Claire to have ever realized.
Definetly Rebecca, she sounds like a 4 yo baby crying
    Just carried my 4yo and put her on a hook. Can confirm

    And now me made a build based of that sounds.

She just don't like to be carried. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|slightly_smiling)
IMO feng min but that‚Äôs just cause I play her
    The injured and wiggle sounds of Feng, it's like someone scraping a plate with a fork
        She sounds like a dog toy that squeaks nonstop
    From another feng enjoyer, she has some really cute mouse noises but also these glass shattering banshee screams lmao
    Shut yo mouth üò°üíî
    Yeah I was gonna say ace for the same reason, but tbh he‚Äôs really not thaat annoying, I think it‚Äôs just me
Rebecca: "EH--EEEEeeehhhh!!!!"
Mikaela makes me want to tear my ears off won‚Äôt lie.
    Heeeeee Haaaaaaa Heeeeeee
        I can hear this
    Honestly her wiggle sounds are funny. It sound like a cartoon character trying to lift a comically heavy object.
Adam
    Man sounds like he's scraping his throat
        accurate af
Leon sounds straight out of a porno! I hate playing with any Leon for this reason.
    When I played the RE2 remake the sounds of him getting punched by Mr x were funny to hear.
Jake. He‚Äôs so loud and whiney
Jake. I say this as a Jake main, man really gotta stfu üò≠
    EEEEYUUUUUUU
People who live in the house with me have told me to lower the volume countless times because of Fengs wiggle noi- actually just Feng all around
    I heard someone refer to her as a squeaky toy once and now that's what I call her too
        I Always felt Like her Downing Scream is that of a quinea pig..![img](emote|t5_3cb2g|2070)
        Wouldn't happen to be Coconut would it?
    I started playing with the sound through my headphones, mostly because the loud moaning sounds the girls make.
Bro doesnt know about Yoichi
    As a killer main I see more Rebecca's than yoichi's.
    I've never seen a Yoichi
Yun-Jin sounds like something trying to sound like a human after reading about how they sound

gyap-gywup-gyag-gwop-gwoo-gye-gye, but the voice is trying to swallow the G
imagine if this appeared in someone's feed who has no idea what dbd is.
Yun Jin sounds like she‚Äôs deepthroating while trying to wiggle out
    https://preview.redd.it/k1so8eywp2xc1.jpeg?width=204&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23c414896de41fd07bcf33f0865df3c06138e64a
All of them i mute my sound when hooking and picking up i really dont want the become deaf bc of someone moaning in my ears
    Perhaps don‚Äôt sound whore to the point of hearing damage then.
        I dont i have just enough sound to hear if a survivor is running next to me
Claire. Literally sounds like porn.
I hate the sound of Steve getting downed but not so much being carried. Yun Jin is the worst imo. Btw does anyone remember the original elodie hook scream? It was like they cranked the volume to 450%
As a survivor main, I HATE Rebecca and her awful sounds. Adept on her killed me
Not annoying but definitely the most amusing is Ash
Mikaela, I can't play her cause of it.
    I fucking hate Mikaela screaming too.
Rebecca for sure its not even close.
Meg. I can't stand it. It's like she's having trouble lifting a couch or something
Rebecca, Yunjin, Mikaela and Yoichi are all awful.
Mikaela Reid
Ashley anyone?
    ‚ÄúOH YA‚Äù

JAKE has this one sound that my fiance and i both hate where he goes "NEEEEUGH" and i hear it in my nightmares
Jake!
Maria for obvious reasons btw
Claire.
Mikaela and even though I don‚Äôt want to throw my main under the bus‚Ä¶Yun Jin
Ash is the one that comes to mind
Jane and Claudette annoy me sometimes lol
You say "most annoying", I say "hottest".
i love spamming the wiggle as rebecca when im going against nemmy or wesker lmao
Yun Jin hands down, Jane comes close.
Feng min maybe, probably because I hear it a least once a match
David. Idk something about his voice and his screams just irritate me to no end. Like calm down it can't hurt THAT bad
    I've taken hooks and harpoons through the body, David's being a chump
The most erotic Leon or Steve
I can‚Äôt remember who‚Ä¶ but one of the survivors sounds like they are having a full mental break when struggling.  I think it‚Äôs Jake.
Jeff. No one comes even remotely close, at least for me.
DWOOUGHUUHH
