[[And generators are hook states]]





This is one of the takes.
    It's absolutely a take. It completely exists. Undeniably.
    [deleted]
        Any actual examples?
            CoH
                CoH was never a useless perk it was a very strong perk and still continues to be, and to be fair they didn't actually listen to us killers we didn't give a shot about the speed, we cared that it can be placed indefinitely and it still can be so ot is still a very viable perk that a killer can't get rid of without wasting one of their valuable perk slots.

So no CoH is not a good example for a useless perk that was parroted to be OP till it was nerfed it was and still is an OP(albeit to a lesser extent now) perk.
                    I don't even remember most of the comment I replied to. The comment read something about OP perks being nerfed. CoH was very op and now it isn't. Despite these claims, killers maintain a 60%+ winrate. I don't think CoH is the sole reason behind the other 40%.
                        We're not arguing win rates, we're arguing if CoH is a useless perk. It's not and never was it is still a very very strong perk. A useless perk would be like pharmaceutical, no one said that CoH is the sole reason survivors win. It is one of the biggest reasons killer is difficult. 

I hit a survivor they run away from my three Gen to their CoH heal and come back, I will not chase to a dead side of the map and let them repair the three Gen I have. "Then just snuff it out!" I already did that 10 times in the match they just rebless the totem. "Then run the perk to break totems" I shouldn't have to run agoof? To counter a perk that shouldn't be infinite. 

It's like making survivors have to run a perk to break totems, it wouldn't be fair to a survivor to waste a perk slot to break a totem. Just like killers shouldn't have to restomp the same totem 10 times. It's like how ruin got nerfed to deactivate after a survivor dies. Makes no sense. Just do bones and you can get rid of ruin already why deactivate it when a survivor dies? Why punish a killer for doing good?

Edit: spelling error
                            I think the best way to look at it would be the time spent healing is less time on generators. There's more ways than one to look at the overall impact of a perk and its usefulness. Utilize the time wasted on healing. If you know where the boon is then you know where to find injured survivors? It's not entirely difficult. If you nerf CoH too much then people go back to running self care. Infinite healing, one just isn't teamwide, and we all know why self care was nerfed years ago. Do you just not want survivors to heal themselves at all? People already complain about medkits enough too.

Edit: Killer is difficult but they have 60%+ kill rates? Something isn't adding up here.
                                Where you're right yes but here's the thing of they are constantly running to a dead side if the map I am wasting time over there. Yes there's one injured survivor there, but there is 2 or 3 survivors on gens. 

Gens which I have to protect in order to win, let them run self care then it requires the other survivors to find each other to heal or run self care themselves, rather than one survivor on the team runs CoH and now everyone has self care on the team plus their 4 other perks. 

Idk why people complain about medkits I get the frustration of survivors using anti hemmorage, and septic needle(or whatever the add-ons are called)  mid-chase but it's not common enough to worry about.

Yes killer is difficult because it requires the survivors to make mistakes to catch them unless you catch them in the open which is a mistake in and of itself, if you run into a survivor who runs an optimal loop you will waste 25+ seconds and time is not on the killers side. 

Winrates are skewed because MMR is a joke and sticks people who have 2 hrs in the game with people like me who have 2.2k hours in the game. In terms of difficulty ascending order it would be SWF>Killer>Solo-Queue. It's why you see a lot of blights, and nurses at higher MMR because those are strong killers.
                CoH WAS op. It is no longer imo but a better change would’ve been to keep it stronger and cap how many times you can bless/rebless. Bhvr didn’t do that change. But tons of people here are actually reasonable with perk changes. The majority seems to be. The way it was needed a change.
                    Keep it 100%, increase the amount of time it takes to bless a totem by 100% for each blessing.  Put a boon up 5 times?  Takes 5X longer than the first time.
                        Honestly the perfect balance to me is keep it at 150%, hell even 200%, but give 2 tokens. You can move it infinitely but when the killer stomps it out one token is removed. If the killer finds it twice and stomps it out then it’s disabled for the rest of the match.

It’s more like older hexes. There’s a good risk/reward balance. It’s extremely powerful, but if you use it incorrectly you risk losing the perk for the whole game. It’d still be stronger than hexes too since you can move it to a better place and you get two chances which killer gets neither of but it adds an actual counter to it other than bandaiding the problem with a killer perk that crushes the totem.

                As someone who used to play both sides equally for years then slowly gravitated to survivor main, I honestly find killer to be pretty difficult (And not fun in the slightest) now compared to what it used to be.  I’m not exactly sure why that is either.
                    I personally find killer more fun than survivor lol even though it can be frustrating sometimes, especially when playing weaker killers or using meme builds... 

I think the reason you and others are finding killer to be more difficult is because mmr used to actually do something back then(at times), so you were mostly just going against people with roughly the same amount of hours as you. Now that the mmr system changed, newer players are now going against 5000 hour players once they reach that mmr soft cap.
                    Killer is rarely fun for me, it's either an easy 4k where you feel like a bully or seal team 6 and neither match is very fun.
                    Killer is fucking stressful. Trying to manage gens, totems if you bring them, juggle hook states so you don't get accused of tunneling, keep track of where each survivor is, keep track of items, try to guess perks and addons, and bouncing all of that around in your head while trying to mindgame a survivor that's currently looping you, then trying to keep track of how long you've been chasing for and when to drop chase so you don't get gen rushed quite as hard
                        Imagine trying to not be accused of tunneling. If its a death hook then you should always take it
                            What if it's a relatively new survivor and they're the only survivor you've managed to spot so far, and nobody else has been hooked? What if you're having a really good game and survivors are doing really badly to begin with? There's not much to gain from ending the game quickly, both you and survivors get more bloodpoints and xp if the game is longer
                                Id slug em
                                    Same. Then go hard vs the rest. What shitty teammates hide from the killer all game while a lone survivor is on death hook and they don’t even try to take the heat off? They don’t deserve to escape.
                                I’d they’re the only survivor you’ve seen and they get 3 hooked you get just as many points the survivor just doesn’t.
                            Nah, that's boring
                    I used to be almost exclusively a killer player, but now I'm almost exclusively a survivor player. I completely agree with this, killer just is not fun to play and it's gotten a lot more difficult in the last couple years. I used to get 4Ks almost every game, not even playing top tier killers, now I'm lucky to get 1k.
                    I play both. Used to be main killer. Switched to survior main. Killer is sooooooo much easier.
                Still no examples, i main survivor now but used to be killer. Killer is too stressful
                You sound like someone who's never played killer at high rank...
            There's some clown killers out there that think having the team spend 90 seconds on 5 different objectives, and being rewarded for it with a one heal and a short speed boost, is massively overpowered.
                I don't think ALL clown mains have that opinion, but whatever I guess
                    Clown mains just want to inhale piss and get on with the game
                    Literally said "some" not "all"
                adrenaline is literally one of if not the strongest survivor perk in the game. i run it every game no matter the build
                The strength in adrenaline lies in the ability to loop a killer for the last gen then get away almost free, as well as countering a killer slugging you to find the hatch before carrying in case you have DS, Boil Over, whatever
                    > loop a killer for the last gen then get away almost free

The entire phrasing here is just assuming "the last gen" to be a foregone conclusion. That, in itself, is why it appears so strong - because killers are stupidly ignoring one of their main objectives.

No matter how you frame it, completing 5 generators is not routinely "easy" - unless the killer is just handing them to you.
                        It... kinda is tho. First 2 gens are basically free, too many gens for the killer to patrol. Third is also very fast. Fourth potentially could be a bit of a struggle if the killer is having a good game, but otherwise it's also fairly quick. Fifth is obviously the hardest, but it's still incredibly easy if survivors have half a brain and don't three gen themselves.
                            my man here just casting aside the entire video game.

Go home killers, it's over, survivors won Dead by Daylight for good.
                                Killers are tour guides

Entity created Disneyland confirmed
Therefore, tunneling and camping are simply gen rushing
    HES CAMPINg 3 GENERATORS AND A HOOK!!
        This is why you don't just mindlessly do gens, you gotta plan the final 3gen situation
            This. It is absolutely your responsibility to attempt to prevent 3-gens. If you assume everyone else will do it, then odds are do will they, and nobody will try to prevent a 3gen. Could still prevent it by sheer accident but any killer with more than one braincell will start plotting to make one once they start losing gens.
        Legit possible with some gen spawns on some Maps like rpd lol
            Crotus too when 3 gens are all like two feet away from each other in the carnival
                Haddonfield is the best one, with the Strode gen, a gen in the corner and a gen in the street.

Literal massive deadzone around the rear two gens, all you have to do is sit at Strode house gen and watch the back two.  As soon as someone goes back there its a free hit.
            RPD is easily one of the worst. I forget which setup it is, but if you get RPD setup with a gen in either in the evidence room or the upstairs office, it is *so* incredibly easy to 3 gen. I've seen some killers straight up start patrolling those 3 gens as soon as the game starts. As long as you have like 2 gen regression perks then even a 4 man rotation is going to have a very hard time pulling it off. And if the killer gets even 1 catch-out, they are getting hooked in the mid hook and they're stuck.

If you're willing to lame it out and tunnel really fucking hard, soloq can get absolutely demolished by these types of strats as the coordination required to counter it is really high without comms.

Medkits don't take up a perk slot.
    And aren’t required to win
        Thaaaaats a bit debatable but I see your point
            It’s not.
                It is.
                    Not if your good
                        No, even then it still is debatable. Bringing a medkit is bringing one or more health states that don't require another survivor to get off of gens for you. Time gained when compared to not bringing it is pretty big. 

Items aren't needed to win, but the game itself is killer-sided so anything you can do to help your own survival is pretty huge and medkits are quite a lot.
                            That was his point, it’s not needed to win.
                                And that's debatable. Again it's a killer-sided game.
                                    I don’t think you understand the definition of necessity.

You can still escape without needing a Medkit, it’s not a requirement that you hold a Medkit to be a be able to escape.
                If you have a toolbox it's not
        Neither are depending on map, killer, survivors' skill and your own skill.
            Its weird that this gets downvoted. 

Its entirely possible on Haddonfield with most of the killer roster and you lose for free, same on Badham or Gideons, likewise you can get shelter woods and just lose as shrvivor

Part of the issue I currently have with the game is the maps, I think both sides are fairly balanced at the moment, but spawning into these maps bhvr sets up to have far too many resources and inversely far too few and you're fighting up hill from the jump.
            They are in an even match up
                Gen regression is not required outside of possibly top 1% of playerbase. I obviously don't know my MMR but I think I'm pretty avredge atleast since I can make it to red ranks without much "effort" even before the MMR system was added.

Running a full chase build can help you finnish chases so fast that unhooking becomes your generator slowdown. Obviously gens will fly but so will the survivors. The game isn't over when the gens are done, only when they leave.
                    Not even close to true. Not everything is some extreme case. You probably don’t even know what 1% is. The average player needs them. You just probably aren’t in an even match up lol.
                        You imply that the matchmaking is so bad that I have been getting matched with people severly bellow my skill level for hundreds of games?
                            Nope. Solo is just below killer in terms of strength and a large majority of players are solo. Another large majority of players are just bad.
                                That still doesn't explain how I can maintain good kill numbers while using no generator slowdown perks.
                                    You’re a good killer

Tenha um bom dia meu chapa.
Be honest fam. What the fuck does this mean
    Its yet another "medkits op" post disguised as a "survivors do x so killer can do x"
Some gen regression perks are a little obnoxious but nothing compares to watching a survivor you’re currently chasing heal in the middle of fucking running
    I mean as a survivor watching the gen you were working on get exploded into oblivion because of the jolt+pain resonance combo the killer is running is pretty similar in my opinion
        You have to fully down and hook someone (on a scourge) to get 23% gen regression (from total progress). No it’s not similar at all
            200% regression from call of the brine is though lol 🤣🤣
                It’s still slower every second than a survivor repairing it. If you can pressure the gen it’s great
            gens take 90 seconds. chases shouldnt take anywhere near 90 seconds. it’s pretty similar
                But three gems can be completed simultaneously
                    a lot of gen regression perks can affect multiple gens
                        What’s that even supposed to mean
                            your rebuttal to my argument is saying that gen regression isnt similar to medkits, because multiple gens can be done at the same time. what you fail to realize is that multiple gens can also be regressed at the same time
                                My point was more so that you can have three players doing actions simultaneously while one is being chased, by the nature of the game the killers time is more valuable then an individual survivors, 30 seconds of chase is worth 90 seconds of gen work, so even though a chase isn’t 90 seconds long it comparatively is worth the time of one gen
                                    incredibly good point actually
                                    You can still pressure more than 1 survivor
            That's 20.7 seconds of gen repair compared to 16 seconds heal time.
            Fully healing mid-chase is also really hard to do unless you have a syringe.
                Right. A syringe doesn’t take a perk slot tho
                Get a normal purple medkit hell even green and you can heal mid chase normally
                    Green heals yourself much faster than purple lol
        What do you mean you don't like constantly working on a gen that was supposed to be done an hour ago?
        So you are saying that two perks slots using two meta perks is similar to using a single item that you can get with 20k blood points?
I'm not sure this is the balance you think it is
Hard disagree a killer can only have 4 perks and has to bring enough counters to fight back against survivors 16 perks, if you bring the wrong counter you have a useless perk. Killers know survivors will Always have to do gens so bringing gen regression perks is killers safest bet. Say I bring anti boons perks and survivors bring 0 boons now I have a dead perk slot not worth the risk.

Medkits on the other hand let you undo killers effort to injure you. If the killer took longer then 16 seconds to injure you, then you just invalidated killer efforts if they hit you then switched targets. Medkits are the main reason why stealth killers are not meta along side COH

Comparing an item slot to a killers perk slot is basicly admitting items are equal or greater in power to killers perks. Killers slots in that area are largely useless the last thing they have to affect gameplay is mori offering and that’s going away soon.
    Don't forget that items have varying degrees of strength as well and perks can improve them. Someone bringing a Grey medkit isn't such a big deal. Someone bringing a purple medkit with top tier add ons can be devastating.

Items are better compared to Killer add ons if anything. Super strong killer add ons can make an already good killer downright impossible to deal with. Just like 4 strong med kits can be impossible to deal with for most killers.
    This is the biggest problem regarding the base game.  Killers who can pressure any gen quickly will be on the better end (Nurse, Blight, Wesker, etc) because they don't have to rely gen pressure perks so can be more flexible.

With the need for new perks every chapter it will only exasperated the problem more because they are moving on with fixing the past.
    Don't forget basekit BT and soon to be basekit Unbreakable!
24 perks Vs 4 😍😍😍 multiplied even further when you factor boons into the mix
        But killers 😡😡😡😡 got base-kit 😡😡😡😡 Pop! 🤡😡😡😡😡😡😡
            Basekit pop OP every time I see the gen get reduced by 2% I cry shit and piss why do behaviour hate survivors
                I have to spend (literally) 2 seconds more on a gen nooo 😡😡😡😡😡😡😭😭😭😭😭
                "I cry shit and piss" made me audibly laugh lol.
            The killers also got 10 extra second for each gen beyond the basekit pop.
                And it was necessary for the health of the game. Also stop calling it "Basekit pop" its literally 2 seconds of progress.
                    >And it was necessary for the health of the game.

Yeah, but my point was that they received more than just 2% kick. Basekit BT was also necessary for the health of the game, just like the extra time on gens.

>Also stop calling it "Basekit pop" its literally 2 seconds of progress.

I just used his term, call him out, not me, dood.
                        You're right, there was nothing wrong with survivors getting basekit bt.

But there absolutely is something wrong with survivors getting medkits that can heal mid-chase, basekit bt AND basekit unbreakable.
                            My first comment was a reply to someone implying that killers received the basekit 2% kick buff as a compensation to the basekit bt, ignoring the extra 10s per gen in the same patch which is a lot more impactful than the kick buff. 

I didn't say anything about whether the change was good or not, only that it existed alongside the kick changes. The fact that people downvoted me and upvoted him tell a lot about this community. 

>survivors getting medkits that can heal mid-chase

Good, remove anything beyond brown medkit/brown toolbox. These items make balancing BHVR a nightmare (also, killers have a similar issue, some killers with addons are way stronger than addonless killers).

>basekit bt

Funny thing about basekit bt: It was 5 seconds. The only reason why it was buffed was because tunneling and camping got out of control.

>basekit unbreakable

I do agree that 22.5s is too dumb, but slugging for 4k is an annoying tactic that should go. BHVR should either remove every perk that buff recovery speed and make it always take 45s (or 60s) OR they should rework the hatch conditions to make slugging for 4k more risky.
                    They aren't talking about the health of the game ,just what is and isn't basekit
        >and soon to be basekit Unbreakable!

If they actually put this in the game, kill rates are going to plummet again.  Top killers will leave the game, causing top survivors to get matched against average killers, causing them to leave the game too.

Basekit Unbreakable would be the single worst thing they could do to this game, period.
        All of that and still nearly a 60% kill rate
            Get out of here with your facts!
                I mean, it'd also be a fact to point out that 60% is BHVR's desired kill rate, which would actually mean killers are balanced, if not weaker than they should be since only 11 of them meet or beat this criteria*?

*Across all MMRs. Yes, this is including those trash teammates you get every game giving the killer free 4ks.
                    >I mean, it'd also be a fact to point out that 60% is BHVR's desired kill rate, which would actually mean killers are balanced, if not weaker than they should be since only 11 of them meet or beat this criteria*?

No, they aren't weaker than they should. From BHVR itself: "As stated in our most recent stats post , *we did achieve that goal* and as you’ll see in the below graphs, the kill rate continues to hover around the 59% to 61% range"

If we follow this logic, Freddy and sadako are stronger than they should.

>*Across all MMRs. Yes, this is including those trash teammates you get every game giving the killer free 4ks.

Top 5% MMR is 61.3%, it's better than across all MMRs (59.1%).
                        >No. From BHVR itself: "As stated in our most recent stats post , we did achieve that goal and as you’ll see in the below graphs, the kill rate continues to hover around the 59% to 61% range"

.... So yes, they were aiming for a higher kill rate, which they achieved, aiming for perferably around [sixty](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/2DZ2UICUC4QZ/screenshot-20220714-125338-418.png) [percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHRAMxiGNxg&t=1110s), and have done so with 11 (10 i we include 59% and exclude those above 61%) of the killers, thus meaning that with most killers falling below those expectations they're still overall slightly weaker than intended?

> Top 5% MMR is 61.3%, it's better than across all MMRs (59.1%).

Yes. Correct. Which is why I clarified that I was talking about all MMRs.

My post wasn't to say 'Oh, killers still need buffs' it was to point out that just pulling numbers without context is very dumb, and the original commenters up there are talking like killers having around a 60% kill rate is somehow unintended.
                            It's weird whenever people say that s a justification for survivors having the most busted shit ever.

I swear people think that the 60% means killers 4k 60% of the time or something.
            it's kill rate, not win rate, you can have 60% kill rate, but have 51% win rate.
        More like 7 or 8 with the stuff they put into killer basekit over the years, atleast try to be realistic lol

                I'm a killer main and have been since 2016, I have absolutely been part of the victim complex crew, avid supporter of StRaTEgiC tunneling and camping, every group I went up against was an evil overpowered SWF out to get me etc. etc.

Now though? I can't imagine associating with these people, they've become unbearable to the point I don't even bother arguing with them anymore besides quick callouts, the way they're completely blinded by their bias and unable to reason at all is exhausting and the second they have nothing left to say you must be some sort of secret agent survivor main sent to spy on them for big SWF

They don't know how good they have it now, the ones who do and still want more probably won't be happy until they have a 100% killrate despite the garbage play that is usual from their sort
                Anything, any little thing at all, is acceptable justification for maximum retaliation, past, present, and future.
    I’ve been running Franklins Demise a lot more since med kits have been an abundance lately. It’s more reliable in my opinion than that anti boon perk (forgot the name) since you can see survivors what item they’re bringing to the trial.
        Can’t survivors just pick up the items that you drop with franklins though? Feels like thats just a pretty minor inconvenience compared to other perks that killers can run
            They can but it’s about the charges they lose and playing someone like Hag or Trapper to make picking their items back up a risk. It’s still very much a situational perk but it’s value has seen some significant use.
            Still alot of slowdown as the survivor has to run back to wherever the itemwas dropped wasting time.
    “Bringing gen regression perks is killers safest bet”

The irony is you proved the memes post with that line. Bringing a med kit is a survivors safest play. A survivor will likely get injured. But say 4 survivors bring a med kit and they play against legion or worse, plague their item is a lot less effective—usually useless against plague. If you play against an insta down killer or starstruck nurse, the time you spent healing can also be useless too because you’re exposed & now fully healed.

The comparison works when you view that med kits can be a single use “slowdown death” item and for example hex: ruin can also be a single use gen slowdown if the (hex gets cleansed right away). But to say they’re equal in comparison is so dumb—Killer perks are obviously better. Med kits have finite charges. Jolt, Eruption work forever and the others after cooldown. 

Killers complain, “oh wtf they’re already fully healed !?” Just like survivors complain “omg this generator is completely regressed”
        Items aren’t perks this post is comparing survivor items to killer perks, items can be found and changed during the trial perks cannot

You could could bring perks that also let you heal but don’t need to because you have the medkit, items for survivors most times are more powerful version of survivors perks but with the risk that if you die you lose it

To be clear I am disputing the gen regression perks are like items not that survivors shouldn’t be using medkits but killer is fine with gen perks use both they are both fine
            Items aren’t killer perks, but you’re missing the fact that they offer incredibly similar risk/reward benefits to the user. Items are better than survivor perks like how Killer perks are better than survivor perks. Killer perks can be hit or miss just like items. Gen regression is the least risk, highest benefit play—just like med kits.
                To be honest toolboxes are the least risk and highest benefit for survivors. Med kits help 70%-80% of the time. Toolboxes help 100% of the time. The only issue is if a killer focus on a survivor with the toolbox. However if more than one brings them you guarantee quicker gen times. The only way that isn’t true is playing the strongest killers and ending chases under 20 seconds. However that also makes medkits redundant as well but they will still buy you 5 to 10 extra seconds. 

Finishing gens will always be more important though. Medkits only help extend time to a degree. Where as toolboxes can really shorten the time of a match.
                    It’s simply not true. I’ve been chased off of a gen while using Brand New Part so many times.  If they kick the gen, that toolbox is now useless. The amount of killers running lethal pursuer is wild, and if you decide to hold your charges for a later generator, that’s still one generator at best. Sabotaging hooks isn’t always effective either. 

A survivor is more likely going to get injured & being healed 1-4 times (assuming the medkit with addons) is going to help you survive waay more than one single generator.
                        I explained that if it’s only one survivor than yes it won’t matter if the killer chases after them. It’s when more than one survivor brings a toolboxes that you get way more than what a medkit can give you. Also no one should be wasting toolboxes on a hook unless the gates are powered. 

I don’t know why you skipped over that part.
                            It’s a hard, but interesting argument. Assuming the best case scenario—4 toolboxes with brand new part & each survivor is on separate generators and the killer is bad at chase & finding survivors—that’s 3 maybe 4 generators done. If we’re arguing the chances of the team survivability, then 100% you’re right.  The teamwork based reward that 4 toolboxes bring are much better. 

I didn’t skip over using toolboxes for sabo in that way. Sabotaging sucks a lot of the time without proper coordination. 

I still think medkits are better because of reliability. The longer you’re alive the longer the team has to do gens and survive. Hitting a syringe midchase can also be more devastating than the 20s a toolbox takes off a single gen.
                        *laughs in Built to Last*
                            don’t forget Streetwise + Stake out + Hyper focus 

*chefs kiss*
                                Stake Out is amazing for noobs like me lmao
        >But to say they’re equal in comparison is so dumb—Killer perks are obviously better. 

It's almost like one side gets 4 perks and the other gets 16....
            Lol I can’t tell if you’re trolling. I wish it was as simple as 4 vs 16. Most killer arguments are moot if you play solo q. It’s literally a free for all. With your logic that’d be a 4v4v4v4v4? Also obviously, & rightly so—killer perks are usually much more useful.

A better comparison would be net utility. You could play deliverance, unbreakable, adrenaline, and never use any of those perks if you get tunneled out the game. The game is structured like a team game, but it doesn’t play out that way a lot of the time outside of swfs.
                If none of the Survivors are good individually, sure. I play strictly solo-q simply because my friends hate this game and you absolutely get into games where every Survivor is playing as a functional unit and the Killer can't do anything about it.

>deliverance, unbreakable, adrenaline,  and never use any of those perks if you get tunneled out the game.

And you can use Pop, Devour Hope, and Pain Resonance and never get any use out of those perks if you don't get a down. The usability isn't the issue, the fact that you can't give Survivor perks the same power level as Killer perks is because the sheer amount of times a Survivor perk can be used in comparison.
    Ah yes, a man with intelligence
    Should killers get more perk slots? Or do their unique abilities and addons that boost them make up for that?
    Why are Mori offerings going away? Just learned they existed for them to be snuffed out apparently Lol
        They are being phased out because if the last survivor goes down in a trial you and the other person get teleported to a fixed spot for a finishing mori (no offering needed).
Edit note: the moris new function is basicly a bonus BP bonus if you 2/3/4k in a trial with a yellow/green/red mori if i remember correct
            Ahh I gotcha now, thank you for explaining that
    “Killers only get 4 perks to survivors 16” is such a non take.
        It is.. accurate. You know there's 4 survivors? Each with 4 perks? 4x4 = 16. And how many perks does the killer have? 4.

Edit: Yikes he hopped on an alt account 💀 wonder how long until he deletes his comment
            I like that you clicked a block button after posting that comment LMFAO

Edit: No deleted comments, just find it funny that you would block rather than have the minerals to respond and prove your non point 🤣
    Oh no, how dare they make the chase longer when you can just down them
Maybe it's the fact that you can't compare items to perks. Anyway your comparison is just disturbingly awful all around.
    Might not be a good take, not sure why you would consider it disturbing?
        Probably because it disturbs them to realize people think this way as some odd justification or denouncement.
            But why? It’s just a video game. The only thing that should be disturbing about it is the fact that some people think other people should take their own lives because they won or lost a match.
    I've... Read this post four times, I genuinely don't see a single point of comparison that can be made. It's baffling.
    This so much. He took a swing and smacked himself in the face with this comparison.
    yeah bc medkits are stronger then any killer perk
    It’s actually somewhat accurate
        Easy for a blight main to say.
            Ah yes, blight is my favorite character so therefore I’m unable to play other killers. Genius counter argument.
                Tbf regression isn't a problem for Blight.
                    ok and? what does that have to do with anything I said?
                        A Blight player and a Myers player will have a completely different opinion on regression perks. A good Blight doesn't necessarily *need* regression but Myers is so outclassed by a killer like Blight that he needs regression or slow down.

Point being that while you can say whatever you like understand that your experience is vastly different from everyone else as you play one of the strongest killers currently in the game.
                            The comment I made was sarcasm… I switch killers every few games.
                Not a counter argument. I’m just saying that is easy for a blight main to say.
    >disturbingly awful

Found the Eruption + Call Of Brine + Overcharge user
        One doesn’t have to sweat out four gen regression perks to see why it’s a bad comparison. Maybe it’s more analogous to a toolbox since they both directly effect gens, but even then it’s a stretch
        Oh, killers need to bring three perks to match the amount of time lost they get whenever a survivor heals in 10 seconds mid chase using an item they have 20 off.
-___-
If you want to compare Killer and survivor builds i would say Addons are closer to Items(with add-ons in them) than perks. Even then it's a weird comparison
Could you at least elaborate on this??? Give anyone anything to work with here? I can think of so much wrong with this and I don't even feel right criticizing it because I have no idea what you're on about.
I think they’re more comparable to second chance perks
    An actually good take regardless of if they exactly balance in strength, both extend the game for either side by delaying either sides primary objective
i would say generators are kills and gen regression is like bodyblocks. Once you complete a gen there's no way you can bring it back and for each gen completed it adds 20%  progress to survivors objective. It's insane to think that survivors can complete 60% of their objective in less than 2 minutes
All you had to say was "toolboxes" instead of "medkits".

So close!
you're just saying words
    So are you!
I always when I play DBD with my friends, remind them of the "Hook to Gen ratio" and that it gets to a certain point and the game is pretty much over.
So you're saying killers need to give up perk slots in order to mimic an item? Sounds like medkits need a nerf, according to OP.
medkits and addons dont take perk slots tho
Yeah, sure. I have one medkit for my killer, you guys have four.
So a regression perk means that you lose sight of the gen and its 0?

Sure
Survivors can use 4 perks and still have a medkit, and use it to heal in chase.

A killer cannot kick a gen and chase, if they leave to kick a gen they're giving up the chase. 

And even in situations where the gen-regress perks are strong such as 3-gen situations, survivors can avoid those by pacing different gens and targeting specific ones. At the end of the day killer is micromanaging 4 people and survivors can use that to their advantage. It entirely depends on map too, as some maps aren't as prone to 3-gens anyways. 

To add onto the first part, survivors can each have like 4 separate oppressive perks that the killer will have to worry about or factor in, and they can still just bring a purple medkit and get great value. A killer has to use at least 2 dedicated perks to make kicking gens feel "oppressive".
Nah Addons are medkit a for killers fight me
Disagree, gen regression perks are essentially killers' second chance perks, or realistically with how often they can be triggered in a match I guess we should say multiple chance perks

Some slowdown is fine, some regression is fine, I do that too but all these killers stacking 4x regresh/slowdown? Basically a case of ''Tell me you aren't confident in your gameplay without telling me you aren't confident in your gameplay'', bonus points for the ones among them that constantly bitch about survivor chance perks
    I agree that running 4 regression perks is ridiculous, but running none? That's a guaranteed 5 minute game if I've ever seen one, unless the survivors are braindead.
        > That's a guaranteed 5 minute game if I've ever seen one

This is 100% false. There are so many builds you can run that apply enough pressure fast enough. If you can chain downs back to back its so much better than having regression perks. 

I will add a * that certain killers will do better with regression as they need setup time.
They really do need to nerf gen speed up perks
    I see you want role queue bonus at 100% for survivors even at peak survivor times huh
        It's always at 100% anyway.
            Only deep in the night or early in the day.  
During peak times 19-23h it is either no bonus or killer.
    If you restrict killers to 1 regression perk then sure you can nerf gen speed again.

Killers can stack 4 regression perks, many do. Killer is a fucking joke right now and people still feel the need to do that.

I run 0-1 regression perks and I don't remember the last time I didn't win a game I was actually trying to win.

I'm on a 127 3k+ streak on Pig (148 heads popped too!). That's Pig, not Nurse or Blight. Fucking Pig.
        > Killers can stack 4 regression perks, many do. Killer is a fucking joke right now and people still feel the need to do that.

This so much. If you want the easiest games of your life, run 4 regression perks. Its so overkill and boring but you'll win every game you play.
            > This so much. If you want the easiest games of your life, run 4 regression perks. Its so overkill and boring but you'll win every game you play.

How often do you play killer?
        If you’re getting 148 head pops in 127 games, you’re playing in some nasty ways lmao. You don’t get that many head pops just by chasing survivors as they come. But yeah I agree with your point
        Found the killer main who plays at wood elo
            I'm assuming you're joking but just in case.

127 wins in a row (on one killer, this is ignoring all my others) means that I'm about as high MMR as you can get.
    Immediately after the gen speed nerf I only ran 1 gen slowdown perk sometimes 0. Sometime after the wesker patch I found myself running 2-3 gen slowdown perks again because the games were just ending almost 5-6 minutes after the start again. IDK what would actually fix the problem but without any gen slowdown perks on an M1 killer you're getting 4-5 minutes most games where survivors are playing seriously.
        >Be me    
>Play Trapper with no slowdown    
>Set up traps just like any other day    
>They found my traps and are disarming it    
>Four gens pop by the time I'm done    
>They're doing 2 of my 3-gen setup    
>They run far away from my traps before I even get to them    
>They'll just hop back on the gen if I go away    
>fuck.exe    

Basically I'm *required* to have gen slowdown since I  literally *cannot* apply pressure in any other way. Not hooks, not map pressure (since they can always run to the opposite end of the map where I have nothing). Just pain.
        Yeah, DBD is widly unbalanced when it comes to swf/competitive plays. 

Thing is if game was balanced for it, soloQ would disappear from existence. Imagine baby Meg loading in for a first match and gens take 150sec, where is 4 TL walls, few junglegyms and a shack in a map. Probably all the looping spots most competitive players would need to buy enough time for their team to finish gens.

Let's be glad BHVR aren't balancing the game around competitive plays.
        The ideal slowdown should be pushing people off of generators. I know there's derp survivors that unhook in the killer's face and ask "Why tunnel", but this is the corollary: Killers that target one survivor, stop using their power and tunnel-vision them for 5 generators, and ask "Why genrush".

There is no such thing as an M1 killer. All of them have some power - be it stealth to go after unexpecting victims, or anti-loop to end chases faster. If that power isn't working out for you, switch killer.
            Trapper is *right there* 

If you're super unlucky with traps and setup you're literally reduced to being an m1 killer at least for that chase
    Gen perks need to be nerfed across the board. Both speed up and slow down. They both contribute to stale gameplay
        I think there should be a cap to either side, so if you slow down gens by 30% or so it is capped and the same for gen speed up perks
        Gen slowdown do not contribute to stake gameplay, they contribute to not loose two gens in one chase. As a "free to play" huntress, who didn't spend any extra money on the game and has no gen regression perks, even if I keep 2 people busy at all times, gens still go super fast, especially when you end up facing hyperfocus + stake out (hyperfocus needs a nerf asap)
    Outside of prove thyself and hyperfocus, most gen speed up perks are ass. Like what is there to even nerf in them? Bringing the 6% bonus speed from dark sense down to 3%?
        Wouldn’t hurt
    Hyperfocus and maybe prove*,aslong as they nerf eruption
    No?

            Playing killer is easier in my opinion. If you suck at playing killer I feel sorry for you.
                Yep.

People here complaining about speed up perks acting like slown-downs are not strong as fuck, or how the Killer role has received nothing but buffs and is pretty much the strongest role.
                    I know you are, I just wanted to say that playing killer is easier than playing as a survivor.
Maybe its me but for example I feel like as a survivor you get way more penalties for playing sloppy than you do as the killer
This is a take
So survivors are the bad guys then?
It should be clarified “strong Gen regression perks”
Quick, lemme go into the corner with my Medkit.

Those Pallets hurt!
Gen speed perks are just anti-regression perks for survivors
What?
Look at what you did OP. This entire thread is a massive killer circlejerk
    It's fucking great drama though!! Thanks OP!
    Til a circle jerk is to point out a flaw in logic and criticize one of the most OP things in the game

Also let's not pretend like every other post isn't a survivor circlejerk complaining about how killers are so OP. It feels like exclusively survivor players complain about killer so much and how OP killer is that they must think the kill rate is 99% or something.
Man..
That's really dumb
I watched a dude finish a gen in 30 seconds by himself.... If they gad 4 people on the gen doing the same thing, it would have been like 10-15 seconds and the gen would be done....
    Better with all 4 on separate gens

That would be at least 60% of the game done in 30 seconds
        That whole match was 3 mins long.... and he did 3 of the gens
    Yeah that's the problem. You watched the dude do it, feeding him Stakeout stacks. Next time interrupt it and the perk goes away.
    Gen regression perks are sadly necessary nowdays if you wanna have decent win rate but what you talk about are super staged scenarios which will never happen irl in any way and aren't representative of normal survivor experience
        Yea but its not hard to use the perks he had. Litterally spend like $30 and you have all the survivors that have those perks
            It's not just about using those perks. Those perks are super situational. You can theoretically fix gen by yourself in 30 seconds if your teammates and killer are having perks to support you. 
In real game most you can do to cut gen times is you brand new parts and good toolbox. Out of perks to use overzealous and prove thyself
I mean...Franklin's is my answer to three-four items in a lobby. I savor every dc when people get that upset over losing their item mid-chase.
When u have at least 24 gens to do lmk
Did you think about this more than 6 seconds?
    Yes
Disagree. Those perks can be applied infinitely. Items exhaust.
    Considering perks take up a perk slot, I think that's fine.  Medkits, for how much they effect the game, don't even require the survivor to spend a perk slot.
    Built to last would like to talk to you about that
        Built to last almost triples your item's total charges over it's lifespan
            I’m sorry, but what are you all on about? BTL refills 99% of item charges on the first use. If I have a Commodious Toolbox with Wire Spool and Scraps (52 charges), then the first BTL will give me 51 charges back.
                Every subsequent BTL proc has 33% less effectiveness

Except for the small amount of lost charges each activation, you get a 99% fill the first time, making it a double, then you get a 66% refill, then a 33% refill, that's almost tripling the lifespan of an item except for the 2% lost
                    Oh I see.
            Yes which is as far as toolboxes can be about 2 and a half gens if you have 3 people with that the game is mostly over before it’s started
                SoloQ who runs BtL. I have never seen it on another surv, and trust, with this event pushing gen repair I have looked.
                    Tbh when I play survivor I use small game with clairvoyance lightweight and inner healing and just expect my teamates to kill themselves first hook
        You get 2 full refills, and even then it's not "full" as it's 198% out of 200% and they're unusable after BTL is used.
            You still get vastly more use out of the item than you would've otherwise.
                But the original comment said items exhaust,which they do, as its impossible to have an item usable again and again for infinite uses (hacking not included because then everything's unfair)
                    Yeah, I never said items don't exhaust? BTL still vastly extends their life which can make or break a game sometimes.
                        And I never said BTL didn't change the outcome of a match so what's your point? My whole comment was about them running out of charges
                            Reddit moment: violently disagreeing while saying the same thing

As a doctor who loves nothing more than to torture survivors, yall all fuckin wrong. This shit is completely true. Its the decisive strike dead hard bt of killer perks. I dont use overcharge, pop goes the weasel, and that storm perk from Onryo because it takes skill, i kick a gen and leave. It takes just as little skill as Second chance perks or medkits. Stop coping and downvoting this guy cause hes right

            Ah yes you totally don't have any ego about your skill when you literally tried to flex "yeah I don't use that stuff it takes no skill." Like stfu DBD is a party game at best lmao
    Tell me you play against bad (inefficient) survivors without telling me you play against bad (inefficient) survivors
        They werent selected at random to get those red ranks. If they were tell me what that raffles called, i wanna be part of it
            Rank has nothing to do with matchmaking anymore
                wacky
I mean. It's ok to be wrong 🤔
This game would be much less toxic if everyone played both sides so everyone knew how it felt and it would stop the whiny arguments about each side being op
    Nah, a lot of people would still have the hottest takes ever lmao
That makes Rookie Spirit = Nurse’s Calling

Gens slow perks are not even about winning imo, killers need them just so games can actually last more than 5minutes.
They're actually giving an opportunity to survs to do something more than hold M1 for a few minutes.

Survivor objective should be reworked entirely imo.
    > Survivor objective should be reworked entirely imo.

I saw the best suggestion ever:, give us Among Us type tasks to do throughout the map. They could be varied mini games and would be a lot more engaging in the map.
        Exactly. Find gen parts, connect cables, have some pallets needing setup. Repairs could be different mini games, even small puzzles may be.
More fun for surv, more movement, less M1. A whole new world of perks.
And you can balance the winning/duration on different aspects, other than adding 10sec of holding M1 yet still needing anti-gen perks.
It’s the kronk meme of 
No no
He’s gotta point
Killers should be allowed to have five perks.
    Skill issue
I think exhaustion perks is probably a better comparison, at least more of an apples to apples comparison.
I wonder how many times this particular picture was posted and saved
God damn people love to complain.
???

Except it takes perk slots
Healing perks and gen regression perks...I guess? This is dumb
Gen regression perks are just gen regression perks for killers
I wish they were as useful as a medkit.
Except medkits aren’t required to win
Jokes on you, I don't have to deal with medkits because I play legion with his green pin.
If my grandmother had wheels she would have been a bike
This is definitely an opinion
It's like one medkit versus four medkits.
The comments on here make it seem like you all lose to medkits every game lmao.
Wow yes let me use my fifth perk slot plus addons for these "medkits for killers"
Except they last forever
this is definitely a take on dead by daylight
It's absolutely a take. It completely exists. Undeniably.

    Any actual examples?
        CoH
            CoH was never a useless perk it was a very strong perk and still continues to be, and to be fair they didn't actually listen to us killers we didn't give a shot about the speed, we cared that it can be placed indefinitely and it still can be so ot is still a very viable perk that a killer can't get rid of without wasting one of their valuable perk slots.

So no CoH is not a good example for a useless perk that was parroted to be OP till it was nerfed it was and still is an OP(albeit to a lesser extent now) perk.
                I don't even remember most of the comment I replied to. The comment read something about OP perks being nerfed. CoH was very op and now it isn't. Despite these claims, killers maintain a 60%+ winrate. I don't think CoH is the sole reason behind the other 40%.
                    We're not arguing win rates, we're arguing if CoH is a useless perk. It's not and never was it is still a very very strong perk. A useless perk would be like pharmaceutical, no one said that CoH is the sole reason survivors win. It is one of the biggest reasons killer is difficult. 

I hit a survivor they run away from my three Gen to their CoH heal and come back, I will not chase to a dead side of the map and let them repair the three Gen I have. "Then just snuff it out!" I already did that 10 times in the match they just rebless the totem. "Then run the perk to break totems" I shouldn't have to run agoof? To counter a perk that shouldn't be infinite. 

It's like making survivors have to run a perk to break totems, it wouldn't be fair to a survivor to waste a perk slot to break a totem. Just like killers shouldn't have to restomp the same totem 10 times. It's like how ruin got nerfed to deactivate after a survivor dies. Makes no sense. Just do bones and you can get rid of ruin already why deactivate it when a survivor dies? Why punish a killer for doing good?

Edit: spelling error
                        I think the best way to look at it would be the time spent healing is less time on generators. There's more ways than one to look at the overall impact of a perk and its usefulness. Utilize the time wasted on healing. If you know where the boon is then you know where to find injured survivors? It's not entirely difficult. If you nerf CoH too much then people go back to running self care. Infinite healing, one just isn't teamwide, and we all know why self care was nerfed years ago. Do you just not want survivors to heal themselves at all? People already complain about medkits enough too.

Edit: Killer is difficult but they have 60%+ kill rates? Something isn't adding up here.
                            Where you're right yes but here's the thing of they are constantly running to a dead side if the map I am wasting time over there. Yes there's one injured survivor there, but there is 2 or 3 survivors on gens. 

Gens which I have to protect in order to win, let them run self care then it requires the other survivors to find each other to heal or run self care themselves, rather than one survivor on the team runs CoH and now everyone has self care on the team plus their 4 other perks. 

Idk why people complain about medkits I get the frustration of survivors using anti hemmorage, and septic needle(or whatever the add-ons are called)  mid-chase but it's not common enough to worry about.

Yes killer is difficult because it requires the survivors to make mistakes to catch them unless you catch them in the open which is a mistake in and of itself, if you run into a survivor who runs an optimal loop you will waste 25+ seconds and time is not on the killers side. 

Winrates are skewed because MMR is a joke and sticks people who have 2 hrs in the game with people like me who have 2.2k hours in the game. In terms of difficulty ascending order it would be SWF>Killer>Solo-Queue. It's why you see a lot of blights, and nurses at higher MMR because those are strong killers.
            CoH WAS op. It is no longer imo but a better change would’ve been to keep it stronger and cap how many times you can bless/rebless. Bhvr didn’t do that change. But tons of people here are actually reasonable with perk changes. The majority seems to be. The way it was needed a change.
                Keep it 100%, increase the amount of time it takes to bless a totem by 100% for each blessing.  Put a boon up 5 times?  Takes 5X longer than the first time.
                    Honestly the perfect balance to me is keep it at 150%, hell even 200%, but give 2 tokens. You can move it infinitely but when the killer stomps it out one token is removed. If the killer finds it twice and stomps it out then it’s disabled for the rest of the match.

It’s more like older hexes. There’s a good risk/reward balance. It’s extremely powerful, but if you use it incorrectly you risk losing the perk for the whole game. It’d still be stronger than hexes too since you can move it to a better place and you get two chances which killer gets neither of but it adds an actual counter to it other than bandaiding the problem with a killer perk that crushes the totem.

            As someone who used to play both sides equally for years then slowly gravitated to survivor main, I honestly find killer to be pretty difficult (And not fun in the slightest) now compared to what it used to be.  I’m not exactly sure why that is either.
                I personally find killer more fun than survivor lol even though it can be frustrating sometimes, especially when playing weaker killers or using meme builds... 

I think the reason you and others are finding killer to be more difficult is because mmr used to actually do something back then(at times), so you were mostly just going against people with roughly the same amount of hours as you. Now that the mmr system changed, newer players are now going against 5000 hour players once they reach that mmr soft cap.
                Killer is rarely fun for me, it's either an easy 4k where you feel like a bully or seal team 6 and neither match is very fun.
                Killer is fucking stressful. Trying to manage gens, totems if you bring them, juggle hook states so you don't get accused of tunneling, keep track of where each survivor is, keep track of items, try to guess perks and addons, and bouncing all of that around in your head while trying to mindgame a survivor that's currently looping you, then trying to keep track of how long you've been chasing for and when to drop chase so you don't get gen rushed quite as hard
                    Imagine trying to not be accused of tunneling. If its a death hook then you should always take it
                        What if it's a relatively new survivor and they're the only survivor you've managed to spot so far, and nobody else has been hooked? What if you're having a really good game and survivors are doing really badly to begin with? There's not much to gain from ending the game quickly, both you and survivors get more bloodpoints and xp if the game is longer
                            Id slug em
                                Same. Then go hard vs the rest. What shitty teammates hide from the killer all game while a lone survivor is on death hook and they don’t even try to take the heat off? They don’t deserve to escape.
                            I’d they’re the only survivor you’ve seen and they get 3 hooked you get just as many points the survivor just doesn’t.
                        Nah, that's boring
                I used to be almost exclusively a killer player, but now I'm almost exclusively a survivor player. I completely agree with this, killer just is not fun to play and it's gotten a lot more difficult in the last couple years. I used to get 4Ks almost every game, not even playing top tier killers, now I'm lucky to get 1k.
                I play both. Used to be main killer. Switched to survior main. Killer is sooooooo much easier.
            Still no examples, i main survivor now but used to be killer. Killer is too stressful
            You sound like someone who's never played killer at high rank...
        There's some clown killers out there that think having the team spend 90 seconds on 5 different objectives, and being rewarded for it with a one heal and a short speed boost, is massively overpowered.
            I don't think ALL clown mains have that opinion, but whatever I guess
                Clown mains just want to inhale piss and get on with the game
                Literally said "some" not "all"
            adrenaline is literally one of if not the strongest survivor perk in the game. i run it every game no matter the build
            The strength in adrenaline lies in the ability to loop a killer for the last gen then get away almost free, as well as countering a killer slugging you to find the hatch before carrying in case you have DS, Boil Over, whatever
                > loop a killer for the last gen then get away almost free

The entire phrasing here is just assuming "the last gen" to be a foregone conclusion. That, in itself, is why it appears so strong - because killers are stupidly ignoring one of their main objectives.

No matter how you frame it, completing 5 generators is not routinely "easy" - unless the killer is just handing them to you.
                    It... kinda is tho. First 2 gens are basically free, too many gens for the killer to patrol. Third is also very fast. Fourth potentially could be a bit of a struggle if the killer is having a good game, but otherwise it's also fairly quick. Fifth is obviously the hardest, but it's still incredibly easy if survivors have half a brain and don't three gen themselves.
                        my man here just casting aside the entire video game.

Go home killers, it's over, survivors won Dead by Daylight for good.
                            Killers are tour guides

Entity created Disneyland confirmed
HES CAMPINg 3 GENERATORS AND A HOOK!!
    This is why you don't just mindlessly do gens, you gotta plan the final 3gen situation
        This. It is absolutely your responsibility to attempt to prevent 3-gens. If you assume everyone else will do it, then odds are do will they, and nobody will try to prevent a 3gen. Could still prevent it by sheer accident but any killer with more than one braincell will start plotting to make one once they start losing gens.
    Legit possible with some gen spawns on some Maps like rpd lol
        Crotus too when 3 gens are all like two feet away from each other in the carnival
            Haddonfield is the best one, with the Strode gen, a gen in the corner and a gen in the street.

Literal massive deadzone around the rear two gens, all you have to do is sit at Strode house gen and watch the back two.  As soon as someone goes back there its a free hit.
        RPD is easily one of the worst. I forget which setup it is, but if you get RPD setup with a gen in either in the evidence room or the upstairs office, it is *so* incredibly easy to 3 gen. I've seen some killers straight up start patrolling those 3 gens as soon as the game starts. As long as you have like 2 gen regression perks then even a 4 man rotation is going to have a very hard time pulling it off. And if the killer gets even 1 catch-out, they are getting hooked in the mid hook and they're stuck.

If you're willing to lame it out and tunnel really fucking hard, soloq can get absolutely demolished by these types of strats as the coordination required to counter it is really high without comms.

        One of the swamp maps (not good at names) can be easy to watch like 4 gens pretty easily
And aren’t required to win
    Thaaaaats a bit debatable but I see your point
        It’s not.
            It is.
                Not if your good
                    No, even then it still is debatable. Bringing a medkit is bringing one or more health states that don't require another survivor to get off of gens for you. Time gained when compared to not bringing it is pretty big. 

Items aren't needed to win, but the game itself is killer-sided so anything you can do to help your own survival is pretty huge and medkits are quite a lot.
                        That was his point, it’s not needed to win.
                            And that's debatable. Again it's a killer-sided game.
                                I don’t think you understand the definition of necessity.

You can still escape without needing a Medkit, it’s not a requirement that you hold a Medkit to be a be able to escape.
            If you have a toolbox it's not
    Neither are depending on map, killer, survivors' skill and your own skill.
        Its weird that this gets downvoted. 

Its entirely possible on Haddonfield with most of the killer roster and you lose for free, same on Badham or Gideons, likewise you can get shelter woods and just lose as shrvivor

Part of the issue I currently have with the game is the maps, I think both sides are fairly balanced at the moment, but spawning into these maps bhvr sets up to have far too many resources and inversely far too few and you're fighting up hill from the jump.
        They are in an even match up
            Gen regression is not required outside of possibly top 1% of playerbase. I obviously don't know my MMR but I think I'm pretty avredge atleast since I can make it to red ranks without much "effort" even before the MMR system was added.

Running a full chase build can help you finnish chases so fast that unhooking becomes your generator slowdown. Obviously gens will fly but so will the survivors. The game isn't over when the gens are done, only when they leave.
                Not even close to true. Not everything is some extreme case. You probably don’t even know what 1% is. The average player needs them. You just probably aren’t in an even match up lol.
                    You imply that the matchmaking is so bad that I have been getting matched with people severly bellow my skill level for hundreds of games?
                        Nope. Solo is just below killer in terms of strength and a large majority of players are solo. Another large majority of players are just bad.
                            That still doesn't explain how I can maintain good kill numbers while using no generator slowdown perks.
                                You’re a good killer

Tenha um bom dia meu chapa.
Its yet another "medkits op" post disguised as a "survivors do x so killer can do x"
I mean as a survivor watching the gen you were working on get exploded into oblivion because of the jolt+pain resonance combo the killer is running is pretty similar in my opinion
    You have to fully down and hook someone (on a scourge) to get 23% gen regression (from total progress). No it’s not similar at all
        200% regression from call of the brine is though lol 🤣🤣
            It’s still slower every second than a survivor repairing it. If you can pressure the gen it’s great
        gens take 90 seconds. chases shouldnt take anywhere near 90 seconds. it’s pretty similar
            But three gems can be completed simultaneously
                a lot of gen regression perks can affect multiple gens
                    What’s that even supposed to mean
                        your rebuttal to my argument is saying that gen regression isnt similar to medkits, because multiple gens can be done at the same time. what you fail to realize is that multiple gens can also be regressed at the same time
                            My point was more so that you can have three players doing actions simultaneously while one is being chased, by the nature of the game the killers time is more valuable then an individual survivors, 30 seconds of chase is worth 90 seconds of gen work, so even though a chase isn’t 90 seconds long it comparatively is worth the time of one gen
                                incredibly good point actually
                                You can still pressure more than 1 survivor
        That's 20.7 seconds of gen repair compared to 16 seconds heal time.
        Fully healing mid-chase is also really hard to do unless you have a syringe.
            Right. A syringe doesn’t take a perk slot tho
            Get a normal purple medkit hell even green and you can heal mid chase normally
                Green heals yourself much faster than purple lol
    What do you mean you don't like constantly working on a gen that was supposed to be done an hour ago?
    So you are saying that two perks slots using two meta perks is similar to using a single item that you can get with 20k blood points?
I'm not sure this is the balance you think it is
Don't forget that items have varying degrees of strength as well and perks can improve them. Someone bringing a Grey medkit isn't such a big deal. Someone bringing a purple medkit with top tier add ons can be devastating.

Items are better compared to Killer add ons if anything. Super strong killer add ons can make an already good killer downright impossible to deal with. Just like 4 strong med kits can be impossible to deal with for most killers.
This is the biggest problem regarding the base game.  Killers who can pressure any gen quickly will be on the better end (Nurse, Blight, Wesker, etc) because they don't have to rely gen pressure perks so can be more flexible.

With the need for new perks every chapter it will only exasperated the problem more because they are moving on with fixing the past.
Don't forget basekit BT and soon to be basekit Unbreakable!
24 perks Vs 4 😍😍😍 multiplied even further when you factor boons into the mix
    But killers 😡😡😡😡 got base-kit 😡😡😡😡 Pop! 🤡😡😡😡😡😡😡
        Basekit pop OP every time I see the gen get reduced by 2% I cry shit and piss why do behaviour hate survivors
            I have to spend (literally) 2 seconds more on a gen nooo 😡😡😡😡😡😡😭😭😭😭😭
            "I cry shit and piss" made me audibly laugh lol.
        The killers also got 10 extra second for each gen beyond the basekit pop.
            And it was necessary for the health of the game. Also stop calling it "Basekit pop" its literally 2 seconds of progress.
                >And it was necessary for the health of the game.

Yeah, but my point was that they received more than just 2% kick. Basekit BT was also necessary for the health of the game, just like the extra time on gens.

>Also stop calling it "Basekit pop" its literally 2 seconds of progress.

I just used his term, call him out, not me, dood.
                    You're right, there was nothing wrong with survivors getting basekit bt.

But there absolutely is something wrong with survivors getting medkits that can heal mid-chase, basekit bt AND basekit unbreakable.
                        My first comment was a reply to someone implying that killers received the basekit 2% kick buff as a compensation to the basekit bt, ignoring the extra 10s per gen in the same patch which is a lot more impactful than the kick buff. 

I didn't say anything about whether the change was good or not, only that it existed alongside the kick changes. The fact that people downvoted me and upvoted him tell a lot about this community. 

>survivors getting medkits that can heal mid-chase

Good, remove anything beyond brown medkit/brown toolbox. These items make balancing BHVR a nightmare (also, killers have a similar issue, some killers with addons are way stronger than addonless killers).

>basekit bt

Funny thing about basekit bt: It was 5 seconds. The only reason why it was buffed was because tunneling and camping got out of control.

>basekit unbreakable

I do agree that 22.5s is too dumb, but slugging for 4k is an annoying tactic that should go. BHVR should either remove every perk that buff recovery speed and make it always take 45s (or 60s) OR they should rework the hatch conditions to make slugging for 4k more risky.
                They aren't talking about the health of the game ,just what is and isn't basekit
    >and soon to be basekit Unbreakable!

If they actually put this in the game, kill rates are going to plummet again.  Top killers will leave the game, causing top survivors to get matched against average killers, causing them to leave the game too.

Basekit Unbreakable would be the single worst thing they could do to this game, period.
    All of that and still nearly a 60% kill rate
        Get out of here with your facts!
            I mean, it'd also be a fact to point out that 60% is BHVR's desired kill rate, which would actually mean killers are balanced, if not weaker than they should be since only 11 of them meet or beat this criteria*?

*Across all MMRs. Yes, this is including those trash teammates you get every game giving the killer free 4ks.
                >I mean, it'd also be a fact to point out that 60% is BHVR's desired kill rate, which would actually mean killers are balanced, if not weaker than they should be since only 11 of them meet or beat this criteria*?

No, they aren't weaker than they should. From BHVR itself: "As stated in our most recent stats post , *we did achieve that goal* and as you’ll see in the below graphs, the kill rate continues to hover around the 59% to 61% range"

If we follow this logic, Freddy and sadako are stronger than they should.

>*Across all MMRs. Yes, this is including those trash teammates you get every game giving the killer free 4ks.

Top 5% MMR is 61.3%, it's better than across all MMRs (59.1%).
                    >No. From BHVR itself: "As stated in our most recent stats post , we did achieve that goal and as you’ll see in the below graphs, the kill rate continues to hover around the 59% to 61% range"

.... So yes, they were aiming for a higher kill rate, which they achieved, aiming for perferably around [sixty](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/2DZ2UICUC4QZ/screenshot-20220714-125338-418.png) [percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHRAMxiGNxg&t=1110s), and have done so with 11 (10 i we include 59% and exclude those above 61%) of the killers, thus meaning that with most killers falling below those expectations they're still overall slightly weaker than intended?

> Top 5% MMR is 61.3%, it's better than across all MMRs (59.1%).

Yes. Correct. Which is why I clarified that I was talking about all MMRs.

My post wasn't to say 'Oh, killers still need buffs' it was to point out that just pulling numbers without context is very dumb, and the original commenters up there are talking like killers having around a 60% kill rate is somehow unintended.
                        It's weird whenever people say that s a justification for survivors having the most busted shit ever.

I swear people think that the 60% means killers 4k 60% of the time or something.
        it's kill rate, not win rate, you can have 60% kill rate, but have 51% win rate.
    More like 7 or 8 with the stuff they put into killer basekit over the years, atleast try to be realistic lol

            I'm a killer main and have been since 2016, I have absolutely been part of the victim complex crew, avid supporter of StRaTEgiC tunneling and camping, every group I went up against was an evil overpowered SWF out to get me etc. etc.

Now though? I can't imagine associating with these people, they've become unbearable to the point I don't even bother arguing with them anymore besides quick callouts, the way they're completely blinded by their bias and unable to reason at all is exhausting and the second they have nothing left to say you must be some sort of secret agent survivor main sent to spy on them for big SWF

They don't know how good they have it now, the ones who do and still want more probably won't be happy until they have a 100% killrate despite the garbage play that is usual from their sort
            Anything, any little thing at all, is acceptable justification for maximum retaliation, past, present, and future.
I’ve been running Franklins Demise a lot more since med kits have been an abundance lately. It’s more reliable in my opinion than that anti boon perk (forgot the name) since you can see survivors what item they’re bringing to the trial.
    Can’t survivors just pick up the items that you drop with franklins though? Feels like thats just a pretty minor inconvenience compared to other perks that killers can run
        They can but it’s about the charges they lose and playing someone like Hag or Trapper to make picking their items back up a risk. It’s still very much a situational perk but it’s value has seen some significant use.
        Still alot of slowdown as the survivor has to run back to wherever the itemwas dropped wasting time.
“Bringing gen regression perks is killers safest bet”

The irony is you proved the memes post with that line. Bringing a med kit is a survivors safest play. A survivor will likely get injured. But say 4 survivors bring a med kit and they play against legion or worse, plague their item is a lot less effective—usually useless against plague. If you play against an insta down killer or starstruck nurse, the time you spent healing can also be useless too because you’re exposed & now fully healed.

The comparison works when you view that med kits can be a single use “slowdown death” item and for example hex: ruin can also be a single use gen slowdown if the (hex gets cleansed right away). But to say they’re equal in comparison is so dumb—Killer perks are obviously better. Med kits have finite charges. Jolt, Eruption work forever and the others after cooldown. 

Killers complain, “oh wtf they’re already fully healed !?” Just like survivors complain “omg this generator is completely regressed”
    Items aren’t perks this post is comparing survivor items to killer perks, items can be found and changed during the trial perks cannot

You could could bring perks that also let you heal but don’t need to because you have the medkit, items for survivors most times are more powerful version of survivors perks but with the risk that if you die you lose it

To be clear I am disputing the gen regression perks are like items not that survivors shouldn’t be using medkits but killer is fine with gen perks use both they are both fine
        Items aren’t killer perks, but you’re missing the fact that they offer incredibly similar risk/reward benefits to the user. Items are better than survivor perks like how Killer perks are better than survivor perks. Killer perks can be hit or miss just like items. Gen regression is the least risk, highest benefit play—just like med kits.
            To be honest toolboxes are the least risk and highest benefit for survivors. Med kits help 70%-80% of the time. Toolboxes help 100% of the time. The only issue is if a killer focus on a survivor with the toolbox. However if more than one brings them you guarantee quicker gen times. The only way that isn’t true is playing the strongest killers and ending chases under 20 seconds. However that also makes medkits redundant as well but they will still buy you 5 to 10 extra seconds. 

Finishing gens will always be more important though. Medkits only help extend time to a degree. Where as toolboxes can really shorten the time of a match.
                It’s simply not true. I’ve been chased off of a gen while using Brand New Part so many times.  If they kick the gen, that toolbox is now useless. The amount of killers running lethal pursuer is wild, and if you decide to hold your charges for a later generator, that’s still one generator at best. Sabotaging hooks isn’t always effective either. 

A survivor is more likely going to get injured & being healed 1-4 times (assuming the medkit with addons) is going to help you survive waay more than one single generator.
                    I explained that if it’s only one survivor than yes it won’t matter if the killer chases after them. It’s when more than one survivor brings a toolboxes that you get way more than what a medkit can give you. Also no one should be wasting toolboxes on a hook unless the gates are powered. 

I don’t know why you skipped over that part.
                        It’s a hard, but interesting argument. Assuming the best case scenario—4 toolboxes with brand new part & each survivor is on separate generators and the killer is bad at chase & finding survivors—that’s 3 maybe 4 generators done. If we’re arguing the chances of the team survivability, then 100% you’re right.  The teamwork based reward that 4 toolboxes bring are much better. 

I didn’t skip over using toolboxes for sabo in that way. Sabotaging sucks a lot of the time without proper coordination. 

I still think medkits are better because of reliability. The longer you’re alive the longer the team has to do gens and survive. Hitting a syringe midchase can also be more devastating than the 20s a toolbox takes off a single gen.
                    *laughs in Built to Last*
                        don’t forget Streetwise + Stake out + Hyper focus 

*chefs kiss*
                            Stake Out is amazing for noobs like me lmao
    >But to say they’re equal in comparison is so dumb—Killer perks are obviously better. 

It's almost like one side gets 4 perks and the other gets 16....
        Lol I can’t tell if you’re trolling. I wish it was as simple as 4 vs 16. Most killer arguments are moot if you play solo q. It’s literally a free for all. With your logic that’d be a 4v4v4v4v4? Also obviously, & rightly so—killer perks are usually much more useful.

A better comparison would be net utility. You could play deliverance, unbreakable, adrenaline, and never use any of those perks if you get tunneled out the game. The game is structured like a team game, but it doesn’t play out that way a lot of the time outside of swfs.
            If none of the Survivors are good individually, sure. I play strictly solo-q simply because my friends hate this game and you absolutely get into games where every Survivor is playing as a functional unit and the Killer can't do anything about it.

>deliverance, unbreakable, adrenaline,  and never use any of those perks if you get tunneled out the game.

And you can use Pop, Devour Hope, and Pain Resonance and never get any use out of those perks if you don't get a down. The usability isn't the issue, the fact that you can't give Survivor perks the same power level as Killer perks is because the sheer amount of times a Survivor perk can be used in comparison.
Ah yes, a man with intelligence
Should killers get more perk slots? Or do their unique abilities and addons that boost them make up for that?
Why are Mori offerings going away? Just learned they existed for them to be snuffed out apparently Lol
    They are being phased out because if the last survivor goes down in a trial you and the other person get teleported to a fixed spot for a finishing mori (no offering needed).
Edit note: the moris new function is basicly a bonus BP bonus if you 2/3/4k in a trial with a yellow/green/red mori if i remember correct
        Ahh I gotcha now, thank you for explaining that
“Killers only get 4 perks to survivors 16” is such a non take.
    It is.. accurate. You know there's 4 survivors? Each with 4 perks? 4x4 = 16. And how many perks does the killer have? 4.

Edit: Yikes he hopped on an alt account 💀 wonder how long until he deletes his comment
        I like that you clicked a block button after posting that comment LMFAO

Edit: No deleted comments, just find it funny that you would block rather than have the minerals to respond and prove your non point 🤣
Oh no, how dare they make the chase longer when you can just down them
Might not be a good take, not sure why you would consider it disturbing?
    Probably because it disturbs them to realize people think this way as some odd justification or denouncement.
        But why? It’s just a video game. The only thing that should be disturbing about it is the fact that some people think other people should take their own lives because they won or lost a match.
I've... Read this post four times, I genuinely don't see a single point of comparison that can be made. It's baffling.
This so much. He took a swing and smacked himself in the face with this comparison.
yeah bc medkits are stronger then any killer perk
It’s actually somewhat accurate
    Easy for a blight main to say.
        Ah yes, blight is my favorite character so therefore I’m unable to play other killers. Genius counter argument.
            Tbf regression isn't a problem for Blight.
                ok and? what does that have to do with anything I said?
                    A Blight player and a Myers player will have a completely different opinion on regression perks. A good Blight doesn't necessarily *need* regression but Myers is so outclassed by a killer like Blight that he needs regression or slow down.

Point being that while you can say whatever you like understand that your experience is vastly different from everyone else as you play one of the strongest killers currently in the game.
                        The comment I made was sarcasm… I switch killers every few games.
            Not a counter argument. I’m just saying that is easy for a blight main to say.
>disturbingly awful

Found the Eruption + Call Of Brine + Overcharge user
    One doesn’t have to sweat out four gen regression perks to see why it’s a bad comparison. Maybe it’s more analogous to a toolbox since they both directly effect gens, but even then it’s a stretch
    Oh, killers need to bring three perks to match the amount of time lost they get whenever a survivor heals in 10 seconds mid chase using an item they have 20 off.
-___-
An actually good take regardless of if they exactly balance in strength, both extend the game for either side by delaying either sides primary objective
So are you!
I agree that running 4 regression perks is ridiculous, but running none? That's a guaranteed 5 minute game if I've ever seen one, unless the survivors are braindead.
    > That's a guaranteed 5 minute game if I've ever seen one

This is 100% false. There are so many builds you can run that apply enough pressure fast enough. If you can chain downs back to back its so much better than having regression perks. 

I will add a * that certain killers will do better with regression as they need setup time.
I see you want role queue bonus at 100% for survivors even at peak survivor times huh
    It's always at 100% anyway.
        Only deep in the night or early in the day.  
During peak times 19-23h it is either no bonus or killer.
If you restrict killers to 1 regression perk then sure you can nerf gen speed again.

Killers can stack 4 regression perks, many do. Killer is a fucking joke right now and people still feel the need to do that.

I run 0-1 regression perks and I don't remember the last time I didn't win a game I was actually trying to win.

I'm on a 127 3k+ streak on Pig (148 heads popped too!). That's Pig, not Nurse or Blight. Fucking Pig.
    > Killers can stack 4 regression perks, many do. Killer is a fucking joke right now and people still feel the need to do that.

This so much. If you want the easiest games of your life, run 4 regression perks. Its so overkill and boring but you'll win every game you play.
        > This so much. If you want the easiest games of your life, run 4 regression perks. Its so overkill and boring but you'll win every game you play.

How often do you play killer?
    If you’re getting 148 head pops in 127 games, you’re playing in some nasty ways lmao. You don’t get that many head pops just by chasing survivors as they come. But yeah I agree with your point
    Found the killer main who plays at wood elo
        I'm assuming you're joking but just in case.

127 wins in a row (on one killer, this is ignoring all my others) means that I'm about as high MMR as you can get.
Immediately after the gen speed nerf I only ran 1 gen slowdown perk sometimes 0. Sometime after the wesker patch I found myself running 2-3 gen slowdown perks again because the games were just ending almost 5-6 minutes after the start again. IDK what would actually fix the problem but without any gen slowdown perks on an M1 killer you're getting 4-5 minutes most games where survivors are playing seriously.
    >Be me    
>Play Trapper with no slowdown    
>Set up traps just like any other day    
>They found my traps and are disarming it    
>Four gens pop by the time I'm done    
>They're doing 2 of my 3-gen setup    
>They run far away from my traps before I even get to them    
>They'll just hop back on the gen if I go away    
>fuck.exe    

Basically I'm *required* to have gen slowdown since I  literally *cannot* apply pressure in any other way. Not hooks, not map pressure (since they can always run to the opposite end of the map where I have nothing). Just pain.
    Yeah, DBD is widly unbalanced when it comes to swf/competitive plays. 

Thing is if game was balanced for it, soloQ would disappear from existence. Imagine baby Meg loading in for a first match and gens take 150sec, where is 4 TL walls, few junglegyms and a shack in a map. Probably all the looping spots most competitive players would need to buy enough time for their team to finish gens.

Let's be glad BHVR aren't balancing the game around competitive plays.
    The ideal slowdown should be pushing people off of generators. I know there's derp survivors that unhook in the killer's face and ask "Why tunnel", but this is the corollary: Killers that target one survivor, stop using their power and tunnel-vision them for 5 generators, and ask "Why genrush".

There is no such thing as an M1 killer. All of them have some power - be it stealth to go after unexpecting victims, or anti-loop to end chases faster. If that power isn't working out for you, switch killer.
        Trapper is *right there* 

If you're super unlucky with traps and setup you're literally reduced to being an m1 killer at least for that chase
Gen perks need to be nerfed across the board. Both speed up and slow down. They both contribute to stale gameplay
    I think there should be a cap to either side, so if you slow down gens by 30% or so it is capped and the same for gen speed up perks
    Gen slowdown do not contribute to stake gameplay, they contribute to not loose two gens in one chase. As a "free to play" huntress, who didn't spend any extra money on the game and has no gen regression perks, even if I keep 2 people busy at all times, gens still go super fast, especially when you end up facing hyperfocus + stake out (hyperfocus needs a nerf asap)
Outside of prove thyself and hyperfocus, most gen speed up perks are ass. Like what is there to even nerf in them? Bringing the 6% bonus speed from dark sense down to 3%?
    Wouldn’t hurt
Hyperfocus and maybe prove*,aslong as they nerf eruption
No?

        Playing killer is easier in my opinion. If you suck at playing killer I feel sorry for you.
            Yep.

People here complaining about speed up perks acting like slown-downs are not strong as fuck, or how the Killer role has received nothing but buffs and is pretty much the strongest role.
                I know you are, I just wanted to say that playing killer is easier than playing as a survivor.
Maybe its me but for example I feel like as a survivor you get way more penalties for playing sloppy than you do as the killer
It's fucking great drama though!! Thanks OP!
Til a circle jerk is to point out a flaw in logic and criticize one of the most OP things in the game

Also let's not pretend like every other post isn't a survivor circlejerk complaining about how killers are so OP. It feels like exclusively survivor players complain about killer so much and how OP killer is that they must think the kill rate is 99% or something.
Better with all 4 on separate gens

That would be at least 60% of the game done in 30 seconds
    That whole match was 3 mins long.... and he did 3 of the gens
Yeah that's the problem. You watched the dude do it, feeding him Stakeout stacks. Next time interrupt it and the perk goes away.
Gen regression perks are sadly necessary nowdays if you wanna have decent win rate but what you talk about are super staged scenarios which will never happen irl in any way and aren't representative of normal survivor experience
    Yea but its not hard to use the perks he had. Litterally spend like $30 and you have all the survivors that have those perks
        It's not just about using those perks. Those perks are super situational. You can theoretically fix gen by yourself in 30 seconds if your teammates and killer are having perks to support you. 
In real game most you can do to cut gen times is you brand new parts and good toolbox. Out of perks to use overzealous and prove thyself
Yes
Considering perks take up a perk slot, I think that's fine.  Medkits, for how much they effect the game, don't even require the survivor to spend a perk slot.
Built to last would like to talk to you about that
    Built to last almost triples your item's total charges over it's lifespan
        I’m sorry, but what are you all on about? BTL refills 99% of item charges on the first use. If I have a Commodious Toolbox with Wire Spool and Scraps (52 charges), then the first BTL will give me 51 charges back.
            Every subsequent BTL proc has 33% less effectiveness

Except for the small amount of lost charges each activation, you get a 99% fill the first time, making it a double, then you get a 66% refill, then a 33% refill, that's almost tripling the lifespan of an item except for the 2% lost
                Oh I see.
        Yes which is as far as toolboxes can be about 2 and a half gens if you have 3 people with that the game is mostly over before it’s started
            SoloQ who runs BtL. I have never seen it on another surv, and trust, with this event pushing gen repair I have looked.
                Tbh when I play survivor I use small game with clairvoyance lightweight and inner healing and just expect my teamates to kill themselves first hook
    You get 2 full refills, and even then it's not "full" as it's 198% out of 200% and they're unusable after BTL is used.
        You still get vastly more use out of the item than you would've otherwise.
            But the original comment said items exhaust,which they do, as its impossible to have an item usable again and again for infinite uses (hacking not included because then everything's unfair)
                Yeah, I never said items don't exhaust? BTL still vastly extends their life which can make or break a game sometimes.
                    And I never said BTL didn't change the outcome of a match so what's your point? My whole comment was about them running out of charges
                        Reddit moment: violently disagreeing while saying the same thing

As a doctor who loves nothing more than to torture survivors, yall all fuckin wrong. This shit is completely true. Its the decisive strike dead hard bt of killer perks. I dont use overcharge, pop goes the weasel, and that storm perk from Onryo because it takes skill, i kick a gen and leave. It takes just as little skill as Second chance perks or medkits. Stop coping and downvoting this guy cause hes right

> Survivor objective should be reworked entirely imo.

I saw the best suggestion ever:, give us Among Us type tasks to do throughout the map. They could be varied mini games and would be a lot more engaging in the map.
    Exactly. Find gen parts, connect cables, have some pallets needing setup. Repairs could be different mini games, even small puzzles may be.
More fun for surv, more movement, less M1. A whole new world of perks.
And you can balance the winning/duration on different aspects, other than adding 10sec of holding M1 yet still needing anti-gen perks.
Skill issue
Any actual examples?
    CoH
        CoH was never a useless perk it was a very strong perk and still continues to be, and to be fair they didn't actually listen to us killers we didn't give a shot about the speed, we cared that it can be placed indefinitely and it still can be so ot is still a very viable perk that a killer can't get rid of without wasting one of their valuable perk slots.

So no CoH is not a good example for a useless perk that was parroted to be OP till it was nerfed it was and still is an OP(albeit to a lesser extent now) perk.
            I don't even remember most of the comment I replied to. The comment read something about OP perks being nerfed. CoH was very op and now it isn't. Despite these claims, killers maintain a 60%+ winrate. I don't think CoH is the sole reason behind the other 40%.
                We're not arguing win rates, we're arguing if CoH is a useless perk. It's not and never was it is still a very very strong perk. A useless perk would be like pharmaceutical, no one said that CoH is the sole reason survivors win. It is one of the biggest reasons killer is difficult. 

I hit a survivor they run away from my three Gen to their CoH heal and come back, I will not chase to a dead side of the map and let them repair the three Gen I have. "Then just snuff it out!" I already did that 10 times in the match they just rebless the totem. "Then run the perk to break totems" I shouldn't have to run agoof? To counter a perk that shouldn't be infinite. 

It's like making survivors have to run a perk to break totems, it wouldn't be fair to a survivor to waste a perk slot to break a totem. Just like killers shouldn't have to restomp the same totem 10 times. It's like how ruin got nerfed to deactivate after a survivor dies. Makes no sense. Just do bones and you can get rid of ruin already why deactivate it when a survivor dies? Why punish a killer for doing good?

Edit: spelling error
                    I think the best way to look at it would be the time spent healing is less time on generators. There's more ways than one to look at the overall impact of a perk and its usefulness. Utilize the time wasted on healing. If you know where the boon is then you know where to find injured survivors? It's not entirely difficult. If you nerf CoH too much then people go back to running self care. Infinite healing, one just isn't teamwide, and we all know why self care was nerfed years ago. Do you just not want survivors to heal themselves at all? People already complain about medkits enough too.

Edit: Killer is difficult but they have 60%+ kill rates? Something isn't adding up here.
                        Where you're right yes but here's the thing of they are constantly running to a dead side if the map I am wasting time over there. Yes there's one injured survivor there, but there is 2 or 3 survivors on gens. 

Gens which I have to protect in order to win, let them run self care then it requires the other survivors to find each other to heal or run self care themselves, rather than one survivor on the team runs CoH and now everyone has self care on the team plus their 4 other perks. 

Idk why people complain about medkits I get the frustration of survivors using anti hemmorage, and septic needle(or whatever the add-ons are called)  mid-chase but it's not common enough to worry about.

Yes killer is difficult because it requires the survivors to make mistakes to catch them unless you catch them in the open which is a mistake in and of itself, if you run into a survivor who runs an optimal loop you will waste 25+ seconds and time is not on the killers side. 

Winrates are skewed because MMR is a joke and sticks people who have 2 hrs in the game with people like me who have 2.2k hours in the game. In terms of difficulty ascending order it would be SWF>Killer>Solo-Queue. It's why you see a lot of blights, and nurses at higher MMR because those are strong killers.
        CoH WAS op. It is no longer imo but a better change would’ve been to keep it stronger and cap how many times you can bless/rebless. Bhvr didn’t do that change. But tons of people here are actually reasonable with perk changes. The majority seems to be. The way it was needed a change.
            Keep it 100%, increase the amount of time it takes to bless a totem by 100% for each blessing.  Put a boon up 5 times?  Takes 5X longer than the first time.
                Honestly the perfect balance to me is keep it at 150%, hell even 200%, but give 2 tokens. You can move it infinitely but when the killer stomps it out one token is removed. If the killer finds it twice and stomps it out then it’s disabled for the rest of the match.

It’s more like older hexes. There’s a good risk/reward balance. It’s extremely powerful, but if you use it incorrectly you risk losing the perk for the whole game. It’d still be stronger than hexes too since you can move it to a better place and you get two chances which killer gets neither of but it adds an actual counter to it other than bandaiding the problem with a killer perk that crushes the totem.

        As someone who used to play both sides equally for years then slowly gravitated to survivor main, I honestly find killer to be pretty difficult (And not fun in the slightest) now compared to what it used to be.  I’m not exactly sure why that is either.
            I personally find killer more fun than survivor lol even though it can be frustrating sometimes, especially when playing weaker killers or using meme builds... 

I think the reason you and others are finding killer to be more difficult is because mmr used to actually do something back then(at times), so you were mostly just going against people with roughly the same amount of hours as you. Now that the mmr system changed, newer players are now going against 5000 hour players once they reach that mmr soft cap.
            Killer is rarely fun for me, it's either an easy 4k where you feel like a bully or seal team 6 and neither match is very fun.
            Killer is fucking stressful. Trying to manage gens, totems if you bring them, juggle hook states so you don't get accused of tunneling, keep track of where each survivor is, keep track of items, try to guess perks and addons, and bouncing all of that around in your head while trying to mindgame a survivor that's currently looping you, then trying to keep track of how long you've been chasing for and when to drop chase so you don't get gen rushed quite as hard
                Imagine trying to not be accused of tunneling. If its a death hook then you should always take it
                    What if it's a relatively new survivor and they're the only survivor you've managed to spot so far, and nobody else has been hooked? What if you're having a really good game and survivors are doing really badly to begin with? There's not much to gain from ending the game quickly, both you and survivors get more bloodpoints and xp if the game is longer
                        Id slug em
                            Same. Then go hard vs the rest. What shitty teammates hide from the killer all game while a lone survivor is on death hook and they don’t even try to take the heat off? They don’t deserve to escape.
                        I’d they’re the only survivor you’ve seen and they get 3 hooked you get just as many points the survivor just doesn’t.
                    Nah, that's boring
            I used to be almost exclusively a killer player, but now I'm almost exclusively a survivor player. I completely agree with this, killer just is not fun to play and it's gotten a lot more difficult in the last couple years. I used to get 4Ks almost every game, not even playing top tier killers, now I'm lucky to get 1k.
            I play both. Used to be main killer. Switched to survior main. Killer is sooooooo much easier.
        Still no examples, i main survivor now but used to be killer. Killer is too stressful
        You sound like someone who's never played killer at high rank...
    There's some clown killers out there that think having the team spend 90 seconds on 5 different objectives, and being rewarded for it with a one heal and a short speed boost, is massively overpowered.
        I don't think ALL clown mains have that opinion, but whatever I guess
            Clown mains just want to inhale piss and get on with the game
            Literally said "some" not "all"
        adrenaline is literally one of if not the strongest survivor perk in the game. i run it every game no matter the build
        The strength in adrenaline lies in the ability to loop a killer for the last gen then get away almost free, as well as countering a killer slugging you to find the hatch before carrying in case you have DS, Boil Over, whatever
            > loop a killer for the last gen then get away almost free

The entire phrasing here is just assuming "the last gen" to be a foregone conclusion. That, in itself, is why it appears so strong - because killers are stupidly ignoring one of their main objectives.

No matter how you frame it, completing 5 generators is not routinely "easy" - unless the killer is just handing them to you.
                It... kinda is tho. First 2 gens are basically free, too many gens for the killer to patrol. Third is also very fast. Fourth potentially could be a bit of a struggle if the killer is having a good game, but otherwise it's also fairly quick. Fifth is obviously the hardest, but it's still incredibly easy if survivors have half a brain and don't three gen themselves.
                    my man here just casting aside the entire video game.

Go home killers, it's over, survivors won Dead by Daylight for good.
                        Killers are tour guides

Entity created Disneyland confirmed
This is why you don't just mindlessly do gens, you gotta plan the final 3gen situation
    This. It is absolutely your responsibility to attempt to prevent 3-gens. If you assume everyone else will do it, then odds are do will they, and nobody will try to prevent a 3gen. Could still prevent it by sheer accident but any killer with more than one braincell will start plotting to make one once they start losing gens.
Legit possible with some gen spawns on some Maps like rpd lol
    Crotus too when 3 gens are all like two feet away from each other in the carnival
        Haddonfield is the best one, with the Strode gen, a gen in the corner and a gen in the street.

Literal massive deadzone around the rear two gens, all you have to do is sit at Strode house gen and watch the back two.  As soon as someone goes back there its a free hit.
    RPD is easily one of the worst. I forget which setup it is, but if you get RPD setup with a gen in either in the evidence room or the upstairs office, it is *so* incredibly easy to 3 gen. I've seen some killers straight up start patrolling those 3 gens as soon as the game starts. As long as you have like 2 gen regression perks then even a 4 man rotation is going to have a very hard time pulling it off. And if the killer gets even 1 catch-out, they are getting hooked in the mid hook and they're stuck.

If you're willing to lame it out and tunnel really fucking hard, soloq can get absolutely demolished by these types of strats as the coordination required to counter it is really high without comms.

    One of the swamp maps (not good at names) can be easy to watch like 4 gens pretty easily
Thaaaaats a bit debatable but I see your point
    It’s not.
        It is.
            Not if your good
                No, even then it still is debatable. Bringing a medkit is bringing one or more health states that don't require another survivor to get off of gens for you. Time gained when compared to not bringing it is pretty big. 

Items aren't needed to win, but the game itself is killer-sided so anything you can do to help your own survival is pretty huge and medkits are quite a lot.
                    That was his point, it’s not needed to win.
                        And that's debatable. Again it's a killer-sided game.
                            I don’t think you understand the definition of necessity.

You can still escape without needing a Medkit, it’s not a requirement that you hold a Medkit to be a be able to escape.
        If you have a toolbox it's not
Neither are depending on map, killer, survivors' skill and your own skill.
    Its weird that this gets downvoted. 

Its entirely possible on Haddonfield with most of the killer roster and you lose for free, same on Badham or Gideons, likewise you can get shelter woods and just lose as shrvivor

Part of the issue I currently have with the game is the maps, I think both sides are fairly balanced at the moment, but spawning into these maps bhvr sets up to have far too many resources and inversely far too few and you're fighting up hill from the jump.
    They are in an even match up
        Gen regression is not required outside of possibly top 1% of playerbase. I obviously don't know my MMR but I think I'm pretty avredge atleast since I can make it to red ranks without much "effort" even before the MMR system was added.

Running a full chase build can help you finnish chases so fast that unhooking becomes your generator slowdown. Obviously gens will fly but so will the survivors. The game isn't over when the gens are done, only when they leave.
            Not even close to true. Not everything is some extreme case. You probably don’t even know what 1% is. The average player needs them. You just probably aren’t in an even match up lol.
                You imply that the matchmaking is so bad that I have been getting matched with people severly bellow my skill level for hundreds of games?
                    Nope. Solo is just below killer in terms of strength and a large majority of players are solo. Another large majority of players are just bad.
                        That still doesn't explain how I can maintain good kill numbers while using no generator slowdown perks.
                            You’re a good killer
I still don't even have an inkling of an idea of what he meant by that

Tenha um bom dia meu chapa.
You have to fully down and hook someone (on a scourge) to get 23% gen regression (from total progress). No it’s not similar at all
    200% regression from call of the brine is though lol 🤣🤣
        It’s still slower every second than a survivor repairing it. If you can pressure the gen it’s great
    gens take 90 seconds. chases shouldnt take anywhere near 90 seconds. it’s pretty similar
        But three gems can be completed simultaneously
            a lot of gen regression perks can affect multiple gens
                What’s that even supposed to mean
                    your rebuttal to my argument is saying that gen regression isnt similar to medkits, because multiple gens can be done at the same time. what you fail to realize is that multiple gens can also be regressed at the same time
                        My point was more so that you can have three players doing actions simultaneously while one is being chased, by the nature of the game the killers time is more valuable then an individual survivors, 30 seconds of chase is worth 90 seconds of gen work, so even though a chase isn’t 90 seconds long it comparatively is worth the time of one gen
                            incredibly good point actually
                            You can still pressure more than 1 survivor
    That's 20.7 seconds of gen repair compared to 16 seconds heal time.
    Fully healing mid-chase is also really hard to do unless you have a syringe.
        Right. A syringe doesn’t take a perk slot tho
        Get a normal purple medkit hell even green and you can heal mid chase normally
            Green heals yourself much faster than purple lol
What do you mean you don't like constantly working on a gen that was supposed to be done an hour ago?
So you are saying that two perks slots using two meta perks is similar to using a single item that you can get with 20k blood points?
I'm not sure this is the balance you think it is
But killers 😡😡😡😡 got base-kit 😡😡😡😡 Pop! 🤡😡😡😡😡😡😡
    Basekit pop OP every time I see the gen get reduced by 2% I cry shit and piss why do behaviour hate survivors
        I have to spend (literally) 2 seconds more on a gen nooo 😡😡😡😡😡😡😭😭😭😭😭
        "I cry shit and piss" made me audibly laugh lol.
    The killers also got 10 extra second for each gen beyond the basekit pop.
        And it was necessary for the health of the game. Also stop calling it "Basekit pop" its literally 2 seconds of progress.
            >And it was necessary for the health of the game.

Yeah, but my point was that they received more than just 2% kick. Basekit BT was also necessary for the health of the game, just like the extra time on gens.

>Also stop calling it "Basekit pop" its literally 2 seconds of progress.

I just used his term, call him out, not me, dood.
                You're right, there was nothing wrong with survivors getting basekit bt.

But there absolutely is something wrong with survivors getting medkits that can heal mid-chase, basekit bt AND basekit unbreakable.
                    My first comment was a reply to someone implying that killers received the basekit 2% kick buff as a compensation to the basekit bt, ignoring the extra 10s per gen in the same patch which is a lot more impactful than the kick buff. 

I didn't say anything about whether the change was good or not, only that it existed alongside the kick changes. The fact that people downvoted me and upvoted him tell a lot about this community. 

>survivors getting medkits that can heal mid-chase

Good, remove anything beyond brown medkit/brown toolbox. These items make balancing BHVR a nightmare (also, killers have a similar issue, some killers with addons are way stronger than addonless killers).

>basekit bt

Funny thing about basekit bt: It was 5 seconds. The only reason why it was buffed was because tunneling and camping got out of control.

>basekit unbreakable

I do agree that 22.5s is too dumb, but slugging for 4k is an annoying tactic that should go. BHVR should either remove every perk that buff recovery speed and make it always take 45s (or 60s) OR they should rework the hatch conditions to make slugging for 4k more risky.
            They aren't talking about the health of the game ,just what is and isn't basekit
>and soon to be basekit Unbreakable!

If they actually put this in the game, kill rates are going to plummet again.  Top killers will leave the game, causing top survivors to get matched against average killers, causing them to leave the game too.

Basekit Unbreakable would be the single worst thing they could do to this game, period.
All of that and still nearly a 60% kill rate
    Get out of here with your facts!
        I mean, it'd also be a fact to point out that 60% is BHVR's desired kill rate, which would actually mean killers are balanced, if not weaker than they should be since only 11 of them meet or beat this criteria*?

*Across all MMRs. Yes, this is including those trash teammates you get every game giving the killer free 4ks.
            >I mean, it'd also be a fact to point out that 60% is BHVR's desired kill rate, which would actually mean killers are balanced, if not weaker than they should be since only 11 of them meet or beat this criteria*?

No, they aren't weaker than they should. From BHVR itself: "As stated in our most recent stats post , *we did achieve that goal* and as you’ll see in the below graphs, the kill rate continues to hover around the 59% to 61% range"

If we follow this logic, Freddy and sadako are stronger than they should.

>*Across all MMRs. Yes, this is including those trash teammates you get every game giving the killer free 4ks.

Top 5% MMR is 61.3%, it's better than across all MMRs (59.1%).
                >No. From BHVR itself: "As stated in our most recent stats post , we did achieve that goal and as you’ll see in the below graphs, the kill rate continues to hover around the 59% to 61% range"

.... So yes, they were aiming for a higher kill rate, which they achieved, aiming for perferably around [sixty](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/2DZ2UICUC4QZ/screenshot-20220714-125338-418.png) [percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHRAMxiGNxg&t=1110s), and have done so with 11 (10 i we include 59% and exclude those above 61%) of the killers, thus meaning that with most killers falling below those expectations they're still overall slightly weaker than intended?

> Top 5% MMR is 61.3%, it's better than across all MMRs (59.1%).

Yes. Correct. Which is why I clarified that I was talking about all MMRs.

My post wasn't to say 'Oh, killers still need buffs' it was to point out that just pulling numbers without context is very dumb, and the original commenters up there are talking like killers having around a 60% kill rate is somehow unintended.
                    It's weird whenever people say that s a justification for survivors having the most busted shit ever.

I swear people think that the 60% means killers 4k 60% of the time or something.
    it's kill rate, not win rate, you can have 60% kill rate, but have 51% win rate.
More like 7 or 8 with the stuff they put into killer basekit over the years, atleast try to be realistic lol

        I'm a killer main and have been since 2016, I have absolutely been part of the victim complex crew, avid supporter of StRaTEgiC tunneling and camping, every group I went up against was an evil overpowered SWF out to get me etc. etc.

Now though? I can't imagine associating with these people, they've become unbearable to the point I don't even bother arguing with them anymore besides quick callouts, the way they're completely blinded by their bias and unable to reason at all is exhausting and the second they have nothing left to say you must be some sort of secret agent survivor main sent to spy on them for big SWF

They don't know how good they have it now, the ones who do and still want more probably won't be happy until they have a 100% killrate despite the garbage play that is usual from their sort
        Anything, any little thing at all, is acceptable justification for maximum retaliation, past, present, and future.
Can’t survivors just pick up the items that you drop with franklins though? Feels like thats just a pretty minor inconvenience compared to other perks that killers can run
    They can but it’s about the charges they lose and playing someone like Hag or Trapper to make picking their items back up a risk. It’s still very much a situational perk but it’s value has seen some significant use.
    Still alot of slowdown as the survivor has to run back to wherever the itemwas dropped wasting time.
Items aren’t perks this post is comparing survivor items to killer perks, items can be found and changed during the trial perks cannot

You could could bring perks that also let you heal but don’t need to because you have the medkit, items for survivors most times are more powerful version of survivors perks but with the risk that if you die you lose it

To be clear I am disputing the gen regression perks are like items not that survivors shouldn’t be using medkits but killer is fine with gen perks use both they are both fine
    Items aren’t killer perks, but you’re missing the fact that they offer incredibly similar risk/reward benefits to the user. Items are better than survivor perks like how Killer perks are better than survivor perks. Killer perks can be hit or miss just like items. Gen regression is the least risk, highest benefit play—just like med kits.
        To be honest toolboxes are the least risk and highest benefit for survivors. Med kits help 70%-80% of the time. Toolboxes help 100% of the time. The only issue is if a killer focus on a survivor with the toolbox. However if more than one brings them you guarantee quicker gen times. The only way that isn’t true is playing the strongest killers and ending chases under 20 seconds. However that also makes medkits redundant as well but they will still buy you 5 to 10 extra seconds. 

Finishing gens will always be more important though. Medkits only help extend time to a degree. Where as toolboxes can really shorten the time of a match.
            It’s simply not true. I’ve been chased off of a gen while using Brand New Part so many times.  If they kick the gen, that toolbox is now useless. The amount of killers running lethal pursuer is wild, and if you decide to hold your charges for a later generator, that’s still one generator at best. Sabotaging hooks isn’t always effective either. 

A survivor is more likely going to get injured & being healed 1-4 times (assuming the medkit with addons) is going to help you survive waay more than one single generator.
                I explained that if it’s only one survivor than yes it won’t matter if the killer chases after them. It’s when more than one survivor brings a toolboxes that you get way more than what a medkit can give you. Also no one should be wasting toolboxes on a hook unless the gates are powered. 

I don’t know why you skipped over that part.
                    It’s a hard, but interesting argument. Assuming the best case scenario—4 toolboxes with brand new part & each survivor is on separate generators and the killer is bad at chase & finding survivors—that’s 3 maybe 4 generators done. If we’re arguing the chances of the team survivability, then 100% you’re right.  The teamwork based reward that 4 toolboxes bring are much better. 

I didn’t skip over using toolboxes for sabo in that way. Sabotaging sucks a lot of the time without proper coordination. 

I still think medkits are better because of reliability. The longer you’re alive the longer the team has to do gens and survive. Hitting a syringe midchase can also be more devastating than the 20s a toolbox takes off a single gen.
                *laughs in Built to Last*
                    don’t forget Streetwise + Stake out + Hyper focus 

*chefs kiss*
                        Stake Out is amazing for noobs like me lmao
>But to say they’re equal in comparison is so dumb—Killer perks are obviously better. 

It's almost like one side gets 4 perks and the other gets 16....
    Lol I can’t tell if you’re trolling. I wish it was as simple as 4 vs 16. Most killer arguments are moot if you play solo q. It’s literally a free for all. With your logic that’d be a 4v4v4v4v4? Also obviously, & rightly so—killer perks are usually much more useful.

A better comparison would be net utility. You could play deliverance, unbreakable, adrenaline, and never use any of those perks if you get tunneled out the game. The game is structured like a team game, but it doesn’t play out that way a lot of the time outside of swfs.
        If none of the Survivors are good individually, sure. I play strictly solo-q simply because my friends hate this game and you absolutely get into games where every Survivor is playing as a functional unit and the Killer can't do anything about it.

>deliverance, unbreakable, adrenaline,  and never use any of those perks if you get tunneled out the game.

And you can use Pop, Devour Hope, and Pain Resonance and never get any use out of those perks if you don't get a down. The usability isn't the issue, the fact that you can't give Survivor perks the same power level as Killer perks is because the sheer amount of times a Survivor perk can be used in comparison.
They are being phased out because if the last survivor goes down in a trial you and the other person get teleported to a fixed spot for a finishing mori (no offering needed).
Edit note: the moris new function is basicly a bonus BP bonus if you 2/3/4k in a trial with a yellow/green/red mori if i remember correct
    Ahh I gotcha now, thank you for explaining that
It is.. accurate. You know there's 4 survivors? Each with 4 perks? 4x4 = 16. And how many perks does the killer have? 4.

Edit: Yikes he hopped on an alt account 💀 wonder how long until he deletes his comment
    I like that you clicked a block button after posting that comment LMFAO

Edit: No deleted comments, just find it funny that you would block rather than have the minerals to respond and prove your non point 🤣
Probably because it disturbs them to realize people think this way as some odd justification or denouncement.
    But why? It’s just a video game. The only thing that should be disturbing about it is the fact that some people think other people should take their own lives because they won or lost a match.
Easy for a blight main to say.
    Ah yes, blight is my favorite character so therefore I’m unable to play other killers. Genius counter argument.
        Tbf regression isn't a problem for Blight.
            ok and? what does that have to do with anything I said?
                A Blight player and a Myers player will have a completely different opinion on regression perks. A good Blight doesn't necessarily *need* regression but Myers is so outclassed by a killer like Blight that he needs regression or slow down.

Point being that while you can say whatever you like understand that your experience is vastly different from everyone else as you play one of the strongest killers currently in the game.
                    The comment I made was sarcasm… I switch killers every few games.
        Not a counter argument. I’m just saying that is easy for a blight main to say.
One doesn’t have to sweat out four gen regression perks to see why it’s a bad comparison. Maybe it’s more analogous to a toolbox since they both directly effect gens, but even then it’s a stretch
Oh, killers need to bring three perks to match the amount of time lost they get whenever a survivor heals in 10 seconds mid chase using an item they have 20 off.
-___-
> That's a guaranteed 5 minute game if I've ever seen one

This is 100% false. There are so many builds you can run that apply enough pressure fast enough. If you can chain downs back to back its so much better than having regression perks. 

I will add a * that certain killers will do better with regression as they need setup time.
It's always at 100% anyway.
    Only deep in the night or early in the day.  
During peak times 19-23h it is either no bonus or killer.
> Killers can stack 4 regression perks, many do. Killer is a fucking joke right now and people still feel the need to do that.

This so much. If you want the easiest games of your life, run 4 regression perks. Its so overkill and boring but you'll win every game you play.
    > This so much. If you want the easiest games of your life, run 4 regression perks. Its so overkill and boring but you'll win every game you play.

How often do you play killer?
If you’re getting 148 head pops in 127 games, you’re playing in some nasty ways lmao. You don’t get that many head pops just by chasing survivors as they come. But yeah I agree with your point
Found the killer main who plays at wood elo
    I'm assuming you're joking but just in case.

127 wins in a row (on one killer, this is ignoring all my others) means that I'm about as high MMR as you can get.
>Be me    
>Play Trapper with no slowdown    
>Set up traps just like any other day    
>They found my traps and are disarming it    
>Four gens pop by the time I'm done    
>They're doing 2 of my 3-gen setup    
>They run far away from my traps before I even get to them    
>They'll just hop back on the gen if I go away    
>fuck.exe    

Basically I'm *required* to have gen slowdown since I  literally *cannot* apply pressure in any other way. Not hooks, not map pressure (since they can always run to the opposite end of the map where I have nothing). Just pain.
Yeah, DBD is widly unbalanced when it comes to swf/competitive plays. 

Thing is if game was balanced for it, soloQ would disappear from existence. Imagine baby Meg loading in for a first match and gens take 150sec, where is 4 TL walls, few junglegyms and a shack in a map. Probably all the looping spots most competitive players would need to buy enough time for their team to finish gens.

Let's be glad BHVR aren't balancing the game around competitive plays.
The ideal slowdown should be pushing people off of generators. I know there's derp survivors that unhook in the killer's face and ask "Why tunnel", but this is the corollary: Killers that target one survivor, stop using their power and tunnel-vision them for 5 generators, and ask "Why genrush".

There is no such thing as an M1 killer. All of them have some power - be it stealth to go after unexpecting victims, or anti-loop to end chases faster. If that power isn't working out for you, switch killer.
    Trapper is *right there* 

If you're super unlucky with traps and setup you're literally reduced to being an m1 killer at least for that chase
I think there should be a cap to either side, so if you slow down gens by 30% or so it is capped and the same for gen speed up perks
Gen slowdown do not contribute to stake gameplay, they contribute to not loose two gens in one chase. As a "free to play" huntress, who didn't spend any extra money on the game and has no gen regression perks, even if I keep 2 people busy at all times, gens still go super fast, especially when you end up facing hyperfocus + stake out (hyperfocus needs a nerf asap)
Wouldn’t hurt

    Playing killer is easier in my opinion. If you suck at playing killer I feel sorry for you.
        Yep.

People here complaining about speed up perks acting like slown-downs are not strong as fuck, or how the Killer role has received nothing but buffs and is pretty much the strongest role.
            I know you are, I just wanted to say that playing killer is easier than playing as a survivor.
Maybe its me but for example I feel like as a survivor you get way more penalties for playing sloppy than you do as the killer
That whole match was 3 mins long.... and he did 3 of the gens
Yea but its not hard to use the perks he had. Litterally spend like $30 and you have all the survivors that have those perks
    It's not just about using those perks. Those perks are super situational. You can theoretically fix gen by yourself in 30 seconds if your teammates and killer are having perks to support you. 
In real game most you can do to cut gen times is you brand new parts and good toolbox. Out of perks to use overzealous and prove thyself
Built to last almost triples your item's total charges over it's lifespan
    I’m sorry, but what are you all on about? BTL refills 99% of item charges on the first use. If I have a Commodious Toolbox with Wire Spool and Scraps (52 charges), then the first BTL will give me 51 charges back.
        Every subsequent BTL proc has 33% less effectiveness

Except for the small amount of lost charges each activation, you get a 99% fill the first time, making it a double, then you get a 66% refill, then a 33% refill, that's almost tripling the lifespan of an item except for the 2% lost
            Oh I see.
    Yes which is as far as toolboxes can be about 2 and a half gens if you have 3 people with that the game is mostly over before it’s started
        SoloQ who runs BtL. I have never seen it on another surv, and trust, with this event pushing gen repair I have looked.
            Tbh when I play survivor I use small game with clairvoyance lightweight and inner healing and just expect my teamates to kill themselves first hook
You get 2 full refills, and even then it's not "full" as it's 198% out of 200% and they're unusable after BTL is used.
    You still get vastly more use out of the item than you would've otherwise.
        But the original comment said items exhaust,which they do, as its impossible to have an item usable again and again for infinite uses (hacking not included because then everything's unfair)
            Yeah, I never said items don't exhaust? BTL still vastly extends their life which can make or break a game sometimes.
                And I never said BTL didn't change the outcome of a match so what's your point? My whole comment was about them running out of charges
                    Reddit moment: violently disagreeing while saying the same thing

As a doctor who loves nothing more than to torture survivors, yall all fuckin wrong. This shit is completely true. Its the decisive strike dead hard bt of killer perks. I dont use overcharge, pop goes the weasel, and that storm perk from Onryo because it takes skill, i kick a gen and leave. It takes just as little skill as Second chance perks or medkits. Stop coping and downvoting this guy cause hes right

                    I am poking fun at the pettiness of your complaint. The fact that you can't see it makes the novelty even grander.

Exactly. Find gen parts, connect cables, have some pallets needing setup. Repairs could be different mini games, even small puzzles may be.
More fun for surv, more movement, less M1. A whole new world of perks.
And you can balance the winning/duration on different aspects, other than adding 10sec of holding M1 yet still needing anti-gen perks.
CoH
    CoH was never a useless perk it was a very strong perk and still continues to be, and to be fair they didn't actually listen to us killers we didn't give a shot about the speed, we cared that it can be placed indefinitely and it still can be so ot is still a very viable perk that a killer can't get rid of without wasting one of their valuable perk slots.

So no CoH is not a good example for a useless perk that was parroted to be OP till it was nerfed it was and still is an OP(albeit to a lesser extent now) perk.
        I don't even remember most of the comment I replied to. The comment read something about OP perks being nerfed. CoH was very op and now it isn't. Despite these claims, killers maintain a 60%+ winrate. I don't think CoH is the sole reason behind the other 40%.
            We're not arguing win rates, we're arguing if CoH is a useless perk. It's not and never was it is still a very very strong perk. A useless perk would be like pharmaceutical, no one said that CoH is the sole reason survivors win. It is one of the biggest reasons killer is difficult. 

I hit a survivor they run away from my three Gen to their CoH heal and come back, I will not chase to a dead side of the map and let them repair the three Gen I have. "Then just snuff it out!" I already did that 10 times in the match they just rebless the totem. "Then run the perk to break totems" I shouldn't have to run agoof? To counter a perk that shouldn't be infinite. 

It's like making survivors have to run a perk to break totems, it wouldn't be fair to a survivor to waste a perk slot to break a totem. Just like killers shouldn't have to restomp the same totem 10 times. It's like how ruin got nerfed to deactivate after a survivor dies. Makes no sense. Just do bones and you can get rid of ruin already why deactivate it when a survivor dies? Why punish a killer for doing good?

Edit: spelling error
                I think the best way to look at it would be the time spent healing is less time on generators. There's more ways than one to look at the overall impact of a perk and its usefulness. Utilize the time wasted on healing. If you know where the boon is then you know where to find injured survivors? It's not entirely difficult. If you nerf CoH too much then people go back to running self care. Infinite healing, one just isn't teamwide, and we all know why self care was nerfed years ago. Do you just not want survivors to heal themselves at all? People already complain about medkits enough too.

Edit: Killer is difficult but they have 60%+ kill rates? Something isn't adding up here.
                    Where you're right yes but here's the thing of they are constantly running to a dead side if the map I am wasting time over there. Yes there's one injured survivor there, but there is 2 or 3 survivors on gens. 

Gens which I have to protect in order to win, let them run self care then it requires the other survivors to find each other to heal or run self care themselves, rather than one survivor on the team runs CoH and now everyone has self care on the team plus their 4 other perks. 

Idk why people complain about medkits I get the frustration of survivors using anti hemmorage, and septic needle(or whatever the add-ons are called)  mid-chase but it's not common enough to worry about.

Yes killer is difficult because it requires the survivors to make mistakes to catch them unless you catch them in the open which is a mistake in and of itself, if you run into a survivor who runs an optimal loop you will waste 25+ seconds and time is not on the killers side. 

Winrates are skewed because MMR is a joke and sticks people who have 2 hrs in the game with people like me who have 2.2k hours in the game. In terms of difficulty ascending order it would be SWF>Killer>Solo-Queue. It's why you see a lot of blights, and nurses at higher MMR because those are strong killers.
    CoH WAS op. It is no longer imo but a better change would’ve been to keep it stronger and cap how many times you can bless/rebless. Bhvr didn’t do that change. But tons of people here are actually reasonable with perk changes. The majority seems to be. The way it was needed a change.
        Keep it 100%, increase the amount of time it takes to bless a totem by 100% for each blessing.  Put a boon up 5 times?  Takes 5X longer than the first time.
            Honestly the perfect balance to me is keep it at 150%, hell even 200%, but give 2 tokens. You can move it infinitely but when the killer stomps it out one token is removed. If the killer finds it twice and stomps it out then it’s disabled for the rest of the match.

It’s more like older hexes. There’s a good risk/reward balance. It’s extremely powerful, but if you use it incorrectly you risk losing the perk for the whole game. It’d still be stronger than hexes too since you can move it to a better place and you get two chances which killer gets neither of but it adds an actual counter to it other than bandaiding the problem with a killer perk that crushes the totem.

    As someone who used to play both sides equally for years then slowly gravitated to survivor main, I honestly find killer to be pretty difficult (And not fun in the slightest) now compared to what it used to be.  I’m not exactly sure why that is either.
        I personally find killer more fun than survivor lol even though it can be frustrating sometimes, especially when playing weaker killers or using meme builds... 

I think the reason you and others are finding killer to be more difficult is because mmr used to actually do something back then(at times), so you were mostly just going against people with roughly the same amount of hours as you. Now that the mmr system changed, newer players are now going against 5000 hour players once they reach that mmr soft cap.
        Killer is rarely fun for me, it's either an easy 4k where you feel like a bully or seal team 6 and neither match is very fun.
        Killer is fucking stressful. Trying to manage gens, totems if you bring them, juggle hook states so you don't get accused of tunneling, keep track of where each survivor is, keep track of items, try to guess perks and addons, and bouncing all of that around in your head while trying to mindgame a survivor that's currently looping you, then trying to keep track of how long you've been chasing for and when to drop chase so you don't get gen rushed quite as hard
            Imagine trying to not be accused of tunneling. If its a death hook then you should always take it
                What if it's a relatively new survivor and they're the only survivor you've managed to spot so far, and nobody else has been hooked? What if you're having a really good game and survivors are doing really badly to begin with? There's not much to gain from ending the game quickly, both you and survivors get more bloodpoints and xp if the game is longer
                    Id slug em
                        Same. Then go hard vs the rest. What shitty teammates hide from the killer all game while a lone survivor is on death hook and they don’t even try to take the heat off? They don’t deserve to escape.
                    I’d they’re the only survivor you’ve seen and they get 3 hooked you get just as many points the survivor just doesn’t.
                Nah, that's boring
        I used to be almost exclusively a killer player, but now I'm almost exclusively a survivor player. I completely agree with this, killer just is not fun to play and it's gotten a lot more difficult in the last couple years. I used to get 4Ks almost every game, not even playing top tier killers, now I'm lucky to get 1k.
        I play both. Used to be main killer. Switched to survior main. Killer is sooooooo much easier.
    Still no examples, i main survivor now but used to be killer. Killer is too stressful
    You sound like someone who's never played killer at high rank...
There's some clown killers out there that think having the team spend 90 seconds on 5 different objectives, and being rewarded for it with a one heal and a short speed boost, is massively overpowered.
    I don't think ALL clown mains have that opinion, but whatever I guess
        Clown mains just want to inhale piss and get on with the game
        Literally said "some" not "all"
    adrenaline is literally one of if not the strongest survivor perk in the game. i run it every game no matter the build
    The strength in adrenaline lies in the ability to loop a killer for the last gen then get away almost free, as well as countering a killer slugging you to find the hatch before carrying in case you have DS, Boil Over, whatever
        > loop a killer for the last gen then get away almost free

The entire phrasing here is just assuming "the last gen" to be a foregone conclusion. That, in itself, is why it appears so strong - because killers are stupidly ignoring one of their main objectives.

No matter how you frame it, completing 5 generators is not routinely "easy" - unless the killer is just handing them to you.
            It... kinda is tho. First 2 gens are basically free, too many gens for the killer to patrol. Third is also very fast. Fourth potentially could be a bit of a struggle if the killer is having a good game, but otherwise it's also fairly quick. Fifth is obviously the hardest, but it's still incredibly easy if survivors have half a brain and don't three gen themselves.
                my man here just casting aside the entire video game.

Go home killers, it's over, survivors won Dead by Daylight for good.
                    Killers are tour guides

Entity created Disneyland confirmed
This. It is absolutely your responsibility to attempt to prevent 3-gens. If you assume everyone else will do it, then odds are do will they, and nobody will try to prevent a 3gen. Could still prevent it by sheer accident but any killer with more than one braincell will start plotting to make one once they start losing gens.
Crotus too when 3 gens are all like two feet away from each other in the carnival
    Haddonfield is the best one, with the Strode gen, a gen in the corner and a gen in the street.

Literal massive deadzone around the rear two gens, all you have to do is sit at Strode house gen and watch the back two.  As soon as someone goes back there its a free hit.
RPD is easily one of the worst. I forget which setup it is, but if you get RPD setup with a gen in either in the evidence room or the upstairs office, it is *so* incredibly easy to 3 gen. I've seen some killers straight up start patrolling those 3 gens as soon as the game starts. As long as you have like 2 gen regression perks then even a 4 man rotation is going to have a very hard time pulling it off. And if the killer gets even 1 catch-out, they are getting hooked in the mid hook and they're stuck.

If you're willing to lame it out and tunnel really fucking hard, soloq can get absolutely demolished by these types of strats as the coordination required to counter it is really high without comms.

It’s not.
    It is.
        Not if your good
            No, even then it still is debatable. Bringing a medkit is bringing one or more health states that don't require another survivor to get off of gens for you. Time gained when compared to not bringing it is pretty big. 

Items aren't needed to win, but the game itself is killer-sided so anything you can do to help your own survival is pretty huge and medkits are quite a lot.
                That was his point, it’s not needed to win.
                    And that's debatable. Again it's a killer-sided game.
                        I don’t think you understand the definition of necessity.

You can still escape without needing a Medkit, it’s not a requirement that you hold a Medkit to be a be able to escape.
    If you have a toolbox it's not
Its weird that this gets downvoted. 

Its entirely possible on Haddonfield with most of the killer roster and you lose for free, same on Badham or Gideons, likewise you can get shelter woods and just lose as shrvivor

Part of the issue I currently have with the game is the maps, I think both sides are fairly balanced at the moment, but spawning into these maps bhvr sets up to have far too many resources and inversely far too few and you're fighting up hill from the jump.
They are in an even match up
    Gen regression is not required outside of possibly top 1% of playerbase. I obviously don't know my MMR but I think I'm pretty avredge atleast since I can make it to red ranks without much "effort" even before the MMR system was added.

Running a full chase build can help you finnish chases so fast that unhooking becomes your generator slowdown. Obviously gens will fly but so will the survivors. The game isn't over when the gens are done, only when they leave.
        Not even close to true. Not everything is some extreme case. You probably don’t even know what 1% is. The average player needs them. You just probably aren’t in an even match up lol.
            You imply that the matchmaking is so bad that I have been getting matched with people severly bellow my skill level for hundreds of games?
                Nope. Solo is just below killer in terms of strength and a large majority of players are solo. Another large majority of players are just bad.
                    That still doesn't explain how I can maintain good kill numbers while using no generator slowdown perks.
                        You’re a good killer
"Vibeo gane"   
\-Musk
200% regression from call of the brine is though lol 🤣🤣
    It’s still slower every second than a survivor repairing it. If you can pressure the gen it’s great
gens take 90 seconds. chases shouldnt take anywhere near 90 seconds. it’s pretty similar
    But three gems can be completed simultaneously
        a lot of gen regression perks can affect multiple gens
            What’s that even supposed to mean
                your rebuttal to my argument is saying that gen regression isnt similar to medkits, because multiple gens can be done at the same time. what you fail to realize is that multiple gens can also be regressed at the same time
                    My point was more so that you can have three players doing actions simultaneously while one is being chased, by the nature of the game the killers time is more valuable then an individual survivors, 30 seconds of chase is worth 90 seconds of gen work, so even though a chase isn’t 90 seconds long it comparatively is worth the time of one gen
                        incredibly good point actually
                        You can still pressure more than 1 survivor
That's 20.7 seconds of gen repair compared to 16 seconds heal time.
Fully healing mid-chase is also really hard to do unless you have a syringe.
    Right. A syringe doesn’t take a perk slot tho
    Get a normal purple medkit hell even green and you can heal mid chase normally
        Green heals yourself much faster than purple lol
Basekit pop OP every time I see the gen get reduced by 2% I cry shit and piss why do behaviour hate survivors
    I have to spend (literally) 2 seconds more on a gen nooo 😡😡😡😡😡😡😭😭😭😭😭
    "I cry shit and piss" made me audibly laugh lol.
The killers also got 10 extra second for each gen beyond the basekit pop.
    And it was necessary for the health of the game. Also stop calling it "Basekit pop" its literally 2 seconds of progress.
        >And it was necessary for the health of the game.

Yeah, but my point was that they received more than just 2% kick. Basekit BT was also necessary for the health of the game, just like the extra time on gens.

>Also stop calling it "Basekit pop" its literally 2 seconds of progress.

I just used his term, call him out, not me, dood.
            You're right, there was nothing wrong with survivors getting basekit bt.

But there absolutely is something wrong with survivors getting medkits that can heal mid-chase, basekit bt AND basekit unbreakable.
                My first comment was a reply to someone implying that killers received the basekit 2% kick buff as a compensation to the basekit bt, ignoring the extra 10s per gen in the same patch which is a lot more impactful than the kick buff. 

I didn't say anything about whether the change was good or not, only that it existed alongside the kick changes. The fact that people downvoted me and upvoted him tell a lot about this community. 

>survivors getting medkits that can heal mid-chase

Good, remove anything beyond brown medkit/brown toolbox. These items make balancing BHVR a nightmare (also, killers have a similar issue, some killers with addons are way stronger than addonless killers).

>basekit bt

Funny thing about basekit bt: It was 5 seconds. The only reason why it was buffed was because tunneling and camping got out of control.

>basekit unbreakable

I do agree that 22.5s is too dumb, but slugging for 4k is an annoying tactic that should go. BHVR should either remove every perk that buff recovery speed and make it always take 45s (or 60s) OR they should rework the hatch conditions to make slugging for 4k more risky.
        They aren't talking about the health of the game ,just what is and isn't basekit
Get out of here with your facts!
    I mean, it'd also be a fact to point out that 60% is BHVR's desired kill rate, which would actually mean killers are balanced, if not weaker than they should be since only 11 of them meet or beat this criteria*?

*Across all MMRs. Yes, this is including those trash teammates you get every game giving the killer free 4ks.
        >I mean, it'd also be a fact to point out that 60% is BHVR's desired kill rate, which would actually mean killers are balanced, if not weaker than they should be since only 11 of them meet or beat this criteria*?

No, they aren't weaker than they should. From BHVR itself: "As stated in our most recent stats post , *we did achieve that goal* and as you’ll see in the below graphs, the kill rate continues to hover around the 59% to 61% range"

If we follow this logic, Freddy and sadako are stronger than they should.

>*Across all MMRs. Yes, this is including those trash teammates you get every game giving the killer free 4ks.

Top 5% MMR is 61.3%, it's better than across all MMRs (59.1%).
            >No. From BHVR itself: "As stated in our most recent stats post , we did achieve that goal and as you’ll see in the below graphs, the kill rate continues to hover around the 59% to 61% range"

.... So yes, they were aiming for a higher kill rate, which they achieved, aiming for perferably around [sixty](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/2DZ2UICUC4QZ/screenshot-20220714-125338-418.png) [percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHRAMxiGNxg&t=1110s), and have done so with 11 (10 i we include 59% and exclude those above 61%) of the killers, thus meaning that with most killers falling below those expectations they're still overall slightly weaker than intended?

> Top 5% MMR is 61.3%, it's better than across all MMRs (59.1%).

Yes. Correct. Which is why I clarified that I was talking about all MMRs.

My post wasn't to say 'Oh, killers still need buffs' it was to point out that just pulling numbers without context is very dumb, and the original commenters up there are talking like killers having around a 60% kill rate is somehow unintended.
                It's weird whenever people say that s a justification for survivors having the most busted shit ever.

I swear people think that the 60% means killers 4k 60% of the time or something.
it's kill rate, not win rate, you can have 60% kill rate, but have 51% win rate.

    I'm a killer main and have been since 2016, I have absolutely been part of the victim complex crew, avid supporter of StRaTEgiC tunneling and camping, every group I went up against was an evil overpowered SWF out to get me etc. etc.

Now though? I can't imagine associating with these people, they've become unbearable to the point I don't even bother arguing with them anymore besides quick callouts, the way they're completely blinded by their bias and unable to reason at all is exhausting and the second they have nothing left to say you must be some sort of secret agent survivor main sent to spy on them for big SWF

They don't know how good they have it now, the ones who do and still want more probably won't be happy until they have a 100% killrate despite the garbage play that is usual from their sort
    Anything, any little thing at all, is acceptable justification for maximum retaliation, past, present, and future.
They can but it’s about the charges they lose and playing someone like Hag or Trapper to make picking their items back up a risk. It’s still very much a situational perk but it’s value has seen some significant use.
Still alot of slowdown as the survivor has to run back to wherever the itemwas dropped wasting time.
Items aren’t killer perks, but you’re missing the fact that they offer incredibly similar risk/reward benefits to the user. Items are better than survivor perks like how Killer perks are better than survivor perks. Killer perks can be hit or miss just like items. Gen regression is the least risk, highest benefit play—just like med kits.
    To be honest toolboxes are the least risk and highest benefit for survivors. Med kits help 70%-80% of the time. Toolboxes help 100% of the time. The only issue is if a killer focus on a survivor with the toolbox. However if more than one brings them you guarantee quicker gen times. The only way that isn’t true is playing the strongest killers and ending chases under 20 seconds. However that also makes medkits redundant as well but they will still buy you 5 to 10 extra seconds. 

Finishing gens will always be more important though. Medkits only help extend time to a degree. Where as toolboxes can really shorten the time of a match.
        It’s simply not true. I’ve been chased off of a gen while using Brand New Part so many times.  If they kick the gen, that toolbox is now useless. The amount of killers running lethal pursuer is wild, and if you decide to hold your charges for a later generator, that’s still one generator at best. Sabotaging hooks isn’t always effective either. 

A survivor is more likely going to get injured & being healed 1-4 times (assuming the medkit with addons) is going to help you survive waay more than one single generator.
            I explained that if it’s only one survivor than yes it won’t matter if the killer chases after them. It’s when more than one survivor brings a toolboxes that you get way more than what a medkit can give you. Also no one should be wasting toolboxes on a hook unless the gates are powered. 

I don’t know why you skipped over that part.
                It’s a hard, but interesting argument. Assuming the best case scenario—4 toolboxes with brand new part & each survivor is on separate generators and the killer is bad at chase & finding survivors—that’s 3 maybe 4 generators done. If we’re arguing the chances of the team survivability, then 100% you’re right.  The teamwork based reward that 4 toolboxes bring are much better. 

I didn’t skip over using toolboxes for sabo in that way. Sabotaging sucks a lot of the time without proper coordination. 

I still think medkits are better because of reliability. The longer you’re alive the longer the team has to do gens and survive. Hitting a syringe midchase can also be more devastating than the 20s a toolbox takes off a single gen.
            *laughs in Built to Last*
                don’t forget Streetwise + Stake out + Hyper focus 

*chefs kiss*
                    Stake Out is amazing for noobs like me lmao
Lol I can’t tell if you’re trolling. I wish it was as simple as 4 vs 16. Most killer arguments are moot if you play solo q. It’s literally a free for all. With your logic that’d be a 4v4v4v4v4? Also obviously, & rightly so—killer perks are usually much more useful.

A better comparison would be net utility. You could play deliverance, unbreakable, adrenaline, and never use any of those perks if you get tunneled out the game. The game is structured like a team game, but it doesn’t play out that way a lot of the time outside of swfs.
    If none of the Survivors are good individually, sure. I play strictly solo-q simply because my friends hate this game and you absolutely get into games where every Survivor is playing as a functional unit and the Killer can't do anything about it.

>deliverance, unbreakable, adrenaline,  and never use any of those perks if you get tunneled out the game.

And you can use Pop, Devour Hope, and Pain Resonance and never get any use out of those perks if you don't get a down. The usability isn't the issue, the fact that you can't give Survivor perks the same power level as Killer perks is because the sheer amount of times a Survivor perk can be used in comparison.
Ahh I gotcha now, thank you for explaining that
I like that you clicked a block button after posting that comment LMFAO

Edit: No deleted comments, just find it funny that you would block rather than have the minerals to respond and prove your non point 🤣
But why? It’s just a video game. The only thing that should be disturbing about it is the fact that some people think other people should take their own lives because they won or lost a match.
Ah yes, blight is my favorite character so therefore I’m unable to play other killers. Genius counter argument.
    Tbf regression isn't a problem for Blight.
        ok and? what does that have to do with anything I said?
            A Blight player and a Myers player will have a completely different opinion on regression perks. A good Blight doesn't necessarily *need* regression but Myers is so outclassed by a killer like Blight that he needs regression or slow down.

Point being that while you can say whatever you like understand that your experience is vastly different from everyone else as you play one of the strongest killers currently in the game.
                The comment I made was sarcasm… I switch killers every few games.
    Not a counter argument. I’m just saying that is easy for a blight main to say.
Only deep in the night or early in the day.  
During peak times 19-23h it is either no bonus or killer.
> This so much. If you want the easiest games of your life, run 4 regression perks. Its so overkill and boring but you'll win every game you play.

How often do you play killer?
I'm assuming you're joking but just in case.

127 wins in a row (on one killer, this is ignoring all my others) means that I'm about as high MMR as you can get.
Trapper is *right there* 

If you're super unlucky with traps and setup you're literally reduced to being an m1 killer at least for that chase
Playing killer is easier in my opinion. If you suck at playing killer I feel sorry for you.
    Yep.

People here complaining about speed up perks acting like slown-downs are not strong as fuck, or how the Killer role has received nothing but buffs and is pretty much the strongest role.
        I know you are, I just wanted to say that playing killer is easier than playing as a survivor.
Maybe its me but for example I feel like as a survivor you get way more penalties for playing sloppy than you do as the killer
It's not just about using those perks. Those perks are super situational. You can theoretically fix gen by yourself in 30 seconds if your teammates and killer are having perks to support you. 
In real game most you can do to cut gen times is you brand new parts and good toolbox. Out of perks to use overzealous and prove thyself
I’m sorry, but what are you all on about? BTL refills 99% of item charges on the first use. If I have a Commodious Toolbox with Wire Spool and Scraps (52 charges), then the first BTL will give me 51 charges back.
    Every subsequent BTL proc has 33% less effectiveness

Except for the small amount of lost charges each activation, you get a 99% fill the first time, making it a double, then you get a 66% refill, then a 33% refill, that's almost tripling the lifespan of an item except for the 2% lost
        Oh I see.
Yes which is as far as toolboxes can be about 2 and a half gens if you have 3 people with that the game is mostly over before it’s started
    SoloQ who runs BtL. I have never seen it on another surv, and trust, with this event pushing gen repair I have looked.
        Tbh when I play survivor I use small game with clairvoyance lightweight and inner healing and just expect my teamates to kill themselves first hook
You still get vastly more use out of the item than you would've otherwise.
    But the original comment said items exhaust,which they do, as its impossible to have an item usable again and again for infinite uses (hacking not included because then everything's unfair)
        Yeah, I never said items don't exhaust? BTL still vastly extends their life which can make or break a game sometimes.
            And I never said BTL didn't change the outcome of a match so what's your point? My whole comment was about them running out of charges

I dont use overcharge, pop goes the weasel, and that storm perk from Onryo because it takes skill, i kick a gen and leave. It takes just as little skill as Second chance perks or medkits.

CoH was never a useless perk it was a very strong perk and still continues to be, and to be fair they didn't actually listen to us killers we didn't give a shot about the speed, we cared that it can be placed indefinitely and it still can be so ot is still a very viable perk that a killer can't get rid of without wasting one of their valuable perk slots.

So no CoH is not a good example for a useless perk that was parroted to be OP till it was nerfed it was and still is an OP(albeit to a lesser extent now) perk.
    I don't even remember most of the comment I replied to. The comment read something about OP perks being nerfed. CoH was very op and now it isn't. Despite these claims, killers maintain a 60%+ winrate. I don't think CoH is the sole reason behind the other 40%.
        We're not arguing win rates, we're arguing if CoH is a useless perk. It's not and never was it is still a very very strong perk. A useless perk would be like pharmaceutical, no one said that CoH is the sole reason survivors win. It is one of the biggest reasons killer is difficult. 

I hit a survivor they run away from my three Gen to their CoH heal and come back, I will not chase to a dead side of the map and let them repair the three Gen I have. "Then just snuff it out!" I already did that 10 times in the match they just rebless the totem. "Then run the perk to break totems" I shouldn't have to run agoof? To counter a perk that shouldn't be infinite. 

It's like making survivors have to run a perk to break totems, it wouldn't be fair to a survivor to waste a perk slot to break a totem. Just like killers shouldn't have to restomp the same totem 10 times. It's like how ruin got nerfed to deactivate after a survivor dies. Makes no sense. Just do bones and you can get rid of ruin already why deactivate it when a survivor dies? Why punish a killer for doing good?

Edit: spelling error
            I think the best way to look at it would be the time spent healing is less time on generators. There's more ways than one to look at the overall impact of a perk and its usefulness. Utilize the time wasted on healing. If you know where the boon is then you know where to find injured survivors? It's not entirely difficult. If you nerf CoH too much then people go back to running self care. Infinite healing, one just isn't teamwide, and we all know why self care was nerfed years ago. Do you just not want survivors to heal themselves at all? People already complain about medkits enough too.

Edit: Killer is difficult but they have 60%+ kill rates? Something isn't adding up here.
                Where you're right yes but here's the thing of they are constantly running to a dead side if the map I am wasting time over there. Yes there's one injured survivor there, but there is 2 or 3 survivors on gens. 

Gens which I have to protect in order to win, let them run self care then it requires the other survivors to find each other to heal or run self care themselves, rather than one survivor on the team runs CoH and now everyone has self care on the team plus their 4 other perks. 

Idk why people complain about medkits I get the frustration of survivors using anti hemmorage, and septic needle(or whatever the add-ons are called)  mid-chase but it's not common enough to worry about.

Yes killer is difficult because it requires the survivors to make mistakes to catch them unless you catch them in the open which is a mistake in and of itself, if you run into a survivor who runs an optimal loop you will waste 25+ seconds and time is not on the killers side. 

Winrates are skewed because MMR is a joke and sticks people who have 2 hrs in the game with people like me who have 2.2k hours in the game. In terms of difficulty ascending order it would be SWF>Killer>Solo-Queue. It's why you see a lot of blights, and nurses at higher MMR because those are strong killers.
CoH WAS op. It is no longer imo but a better change would’ve been to keep it stronger and cap how many times you can bless/rebless. Bhvr didn’t do that change. But tons of people here are actually reasonable with perk changes. The majority seems to be. The way it was needed a change.
    Keep it 100%, increase the amount of time it takes to bless a totem by 100% for each blessing.  Put a boon up 5 times?  Takes 5X longer than the first time.
        Honestly the perfect balance to me is keep it at 150%, hell even 200%, but give 2 tokens. You can move it infinitely but when the killer stomps it out one token is removed. If the killer finds it twice and stomps it out then it’s disabled for the rest of the match.

It’s more like older hexes. There’s a good risk/reward balance. It’s extremely powerful, but if you use it incorrectly you risk losing the perk for the whole game. It’d still be stronger than hexes too since you can move it to a better place and you get two chances which killer gets neither of but it adds an actual counter to it other than bandaiding the problem with a killer perk that crushes the totem.
As someone who used to play both sides equally for years then slowly gravitated to survivor main, I honestly find killer to be pretty difficult (And not fun in the slightest) now compared to what it used to be.  I’m not exactly sure why that is either.
    I personally find killer more fun than survivor lol even though it can be frustrating sometimes, especially when playing weaker killers or using meme builds... 

I think the reason you and others are finding killer to be more difficult is because mmr used to actually do something back then(at times), so you were mostly just going against people with roughly the same amount of hours as you. Now that the mmr system changed, newer players are now going against 5000 hour players once they reach that mmr soft cap.
    Killer is rarely fun for me, it's either an easy 4k where you feel like a bully or seal team 6 and neither match is very fun.
    Killer is fucking stressful. Trying to manage gens, totems if you bring them, juggle hook states so you don't get accused of tunneling, keep track of where each survivor is, keep track of items, try to guess perks and addons, and bouncing all of that around in your head while trying to mindgame a survivor that's currently looping you, then trying to keep track of how long you've been chasing for and when to drop chase so you don't get gen rushed quite as hard
        Imagine trying to not be accused of tunneling. If its a death hook then you should always take it
            What if it's a relatively new survivor and they're the only survivor you've managed to spot so far, and nobody else has been hooked? What if you're having a really good game and survivors are doing really badly to begin with? There's not much to gain from ending the game quickly, both you and survivors get more bloodpoints and xp if the game is longer
                Id slug em
                    Same. Then go hard vs the rest. What shitty teammates hide from the killer all game while a lone survivor is on death hook and they don’t even try to take the heat off? They don’t deserve to escape.
                I’d they’re the only survivor you’ve seen and they get 3 hooked you get just as many points the survivor just doesn’t.
            Nah, that's boring
    I used to be almost exclusively a killer player, but now I'm almost exclusively a survivor player. I completely agree with this, killer just is not fun to play and it's gotten a lot more difficult in the last couple years. I used to get 4Ks almost every game, not even playing top tier killers, now I'm lucky to get 1k.
    I play both. Used to be main killer. Switched to survior main. Killer is sooooooo much easier.
Still no examples, i main survivor now but used to be killer. Killer is too stressful
You sound like someone who's never played killer at high rank...
I don't think ALL clown mains have that opinion, but whatever I guess
    Clown mains just want to inhale piss and get on with the game
    Literally said "some" not "all"
adrenaline is literally one of if not the strongest survivor perk in the game. i run it every game no matter the build
The strength in adrenaline lies in the ability to loop a killer for the last gen then get away almost free, as well as countering a killer slugging you to find the hatch before carrying in case you have DS, Boil Over, whatever
    > loop a killer for the last gen then get away almost free

The entire phrasing here is just assuming "the last gen" to be a foregone conclusion. That, in itself, is why it appears so strong - because killers are stupidly ignoring one of their main objectives.

No matter how you frame it, completing 5 generators is not routinely "easy" - unless the killer is just handing them to you.
        It... kinda is tho. First 2 gens are basically free, too many gens for the killer to patrol. Third is also very fast. Fourth potentially could be a bit of a struggle if the killer is having a good game, but otherwise it's also fairly quick. Fifth is obviously the hardest, but it's still incredibly easy if survivors have half a brain and don't three gen themselves.
            my man here just casting aside the entire video game.

Go home killers, it's over, survivors won Dead by Daylight for good.
                Killers are tour guides

Entity created Disneyland confirmed
Haddonfield is the best one, with the Strode gen, a gen in the corner and a gen in the street.

Literal massive deadzone around the rear two gens, all you have to do is sit at Strode house gen and watch the back two.  As soon as someone goes back there its a free hit.

It is.
    Not if your good
        No, even then it still is debatable. Bringing a medkit is bringing one or more health states that don't require another survivor to get off of gens for you. Time gained when compared to not bringing it is pretty big. 

Items aren't needed to win, but the game itself is killer-sided so anything you can do to help your own survival is pretty huge and medkits are quite a lot.
            That was his point, it’s not needed to win.
                And that's debatable. Again it's a killer-sided game.
                    I don’t think you understand the definition of necessity.

You can still escape without needing a Medkit, it’s not a requirement that you hold a Medkit to be a be able to escape.
If you have a toolbox it's not
Gen regression is not required outside of possibly top 1% of playerbase. I obviously don't know my MMR but I think I'm pretty avredge atleast since I can make it to red ranks without much "effort" even before the MMR system was added.

Running a full chase build can help you finnish chases so fast that unhooking becomes your generator slowdown. Obviously gens will fly but so will the survivors. The game isn't over when the gens are done, only when they leave.
    Not even close to true. Not everything is some extreme case. You probably don’t even know what 1% is. The average player needs them. You just probably aren’t in an even match up lol.
        You imply that the matchmaking is so bad that I have been getting matched with people severly bellow my skill level for hundreds of games?
            Nope. Solo is just below killer in terms of strength and a large majority of players are solo. Another large majority of players are just bad.
                That still doesn't explain how I can maintain good kill numbers while using no generator slowdown perks.
                    You’re a good killer
It’s still slower every second than a survivor repairing it. If you can pressure the gen it’s great
But three gems can be completed simultaneously
    a lot of gen regression perks can affect multiple gens
        What’s that even supposed to mean
            your rebuttal to my argument is saying that gen regression isnt similar to medkits, because multiple gens can be done at the same time. what you fail to realize is that multiple gens can also be regressed at the same time
                My point was more so that you can have three players doing actions simultaneously while one is being chased, by the nature of the game the killers time is more valuable then an individual survivors, 30 seconds of chase is worth 90 seconds of gen work, so even though a chase isn’t 90 seconds long it comparatively is worth the time of one gen
                    incredibly good point actually
                    You can still pressure more than 1 survivor
Right. A syringe doesn’t take a perk slot tho
Get a normal purple medkit hell even green and you can heal mid chase normally
    Green heals yourself much faster than purple lol
I have to spend (literally) 2 seconds more on a gen nooo 😡😡😡😡😡😡😭😭😭😭😭
"I cry shit and piss" made me audibly laugh lol.
And it was necessary for the health of the game. Also stop calling it "Basekit pop" its literally 2 seconds of progress.
    >And it was necessary for the health of the game.

Yeah, but my point was that they received more than just 2% kick. Basekit BT was also necessary for the health of the game, just like the extra time on gens.

>Also stop calling it "Basekit pop" its literally 2 seconds of progress.

I just used his term, call him out, not me, dood.
        You're right, there was nothing wrong with survivors getting basekit bt.

But there absolutely is something wrong with survivors getting medkits that can heal mid-chase, basekit bt AND basekit unbreakable.
            My first comment was a reply to someone implying that killers received the basekit 2% kick buff as a compensation to the basekit bt, ignoring the extra 10s per gen in the same patch which is a lot more impactful than the kick buff. 

I didn't say anything about whether the change was good or not, only that it existed alongside the kick changes. The fact that people downvoted me and upvoted him tell a lot about this community. 

>survivors getting medkits that can heal mid-chase

Good, remove anything beyond brown medkit/brown toolbox. These items make balancing BHVR a nightmare (also, killers have a similar issue, some killers with addons are way stronger than addonless killers).

>basekit bt

Funny thing about basekit bt: It was 5 seconds. The only reason why it was buffed was because tunneling and camping got out of control.

>basekit unbreakable

I do agree that 22.5s is too dumb, but slugging for 4k is an annoying tactic that should go. BHVR should either remove every perk that buff recovery speed and make it always take 45s (or 60s) OR they should rework the hatch conditions to make slugging for 4k more risky.
    They aren't talking about the health of the game ,just what is and isn't basekit
I mean, it'd also be a fact to point out that 60% is BHVR's desired kill rate, which would actually mean killers are balanced, if not weaker than they should be since only 11 of them meet or beat this criteria*?

*Across all MMRs. Yes, this is including those trash teammates you get every game giving the killer free 4ks.
    >I mean, it'd also be a fact to point out that 60% is BHVR's desired kill rate, which would actually mean killers are balanced, if not weaker than they should be since only 11 of them meet or beat this criteria*?

No, they aren't weaker than they should. From BHVR itself: "As stated in our most recent stats post , *we did achieve that goal* and as you’ll see in the below graphs, the kill rate continues to hover around the 59% to 61% range"

If we follow this logic, Freddy and sadako are stronger than they should.

>*Across all MMRs. Yes, this is including those trash teammates you get every game giving the killer free 4ks.

Top 5% MMR is 61.3%, it's better than across all MMRs (59.1%).
        >No. From BHVR itself: "As stated in our most recent stats post , we did achieve that goal and as you’ll see in the below graphs, the kill rate continues to hover around the 59% to 61% range"

.... So yes, they were aiming for a higher kill rate, which they achieved, aiming for perferably around [sixty](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/2DZ2UICUC4QZ/screenshot-20220714-125338-418.png) [percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHRAMxiGNxg&t=1110s), and have done so with 11 (10 i we include 59% and exclude those above 61%) of the killers, thus meaning that with most killers falling below those expectations they're still overall slightly weaker than intended?

> Top 5% MMR is 61.3%, it's better than across all MMRs (59.1%).

Yes. Correct. Which is why I clarified that I was talking about all MMRs.

My post wasn't to say 'Oh, killers still need buffs' it was to point out that just pulling numbers without context is very dumb, and the original commenters up there are talking like killers having around a 60% kill rate is somehow unintended.
            It's weird whenever people say that s a justification for survivors having the most busted shit ever.

I swear people think that the 60% means killers 4k 60% of the time or something.
I'm a killer main and have been since 2016, I have absolutely been part of the victim complex crew, avid supporter of StRaTEgiC tunneling and camping, every group I went up against was an evil overpowered SWF out to get me etc. etc.

Now though? I can't imagine associating with these people, they've become unbearable to the point I don't even bother arguing with them anymore besides quick callouts, the way they're completely blinded by their bias and unable to reason at all is exhausting and the second they have nothing left to say you must be some sort of secret agent survivor main sent to spy on them for big SWF

They don't know how good they have it now, the ones who do and still want more probably won't be happy until they have a 100% killrate despite the garbage play that is usual from their sort
Anything, any little thing at all, is acceptable justification for maximum retaliation, past, present, and future.
To be honest toolboxes are the least risk and highest benefit for survivors. Med kits help 70%-80% of the time. Toolboxes help 100% of the time. The only issue is if a killer focus on a survivor with the toolbox. However if more than one brings them you guarantee quicker gen times. The only way that isn’t true is playing the strongest killers and ending chases under 20 seconds. However that also makes medkits redundant as well but they will still buy you 5 to 10 extra seconds. 

Finishing gens will always be more important though. Medkits only help extend time to a degree. Where as toolboxes can really shorten the time of a match.
    It’s simply not true. I’ve been chased off of a gen while using Brand New Part so many times.  If they kick the gen, that toolbox is now useless. The amount of killers running lethal pursuer is wild, and if you decide to hold your charges for a later generator, that’s still one generator at best. Sabotaging hooks isn’t always effective either. 

A survivor is more likely going to get injured & being healed 1-4 times (assuming the medkit with addons) is going to help you survive waay more than one single generator.
        I explained that if it’s only one survivor than yes it won’t matter if the killer chases after them. It’s when more than one survivor brings a toolboxes that you get way more than what a medkit can give you. Also no one should be wasting toolboxes on a hook unless the gates are powered. 

I don’t know why you skipped over that part.
            It’s a hard, but interesting argument. Assuming the best case scenario—4 toolboxes with brand new part & each survivor is on separate generators and the killer is bad at chase & finding survivors—that’s 3 maybe 4 generators done. If we’re arguing the chances of the team survivability, then 100% you’re right.  The teamwork based reward that 4 toolboxes bring are much better. 

I didn’t skip over using toolboxes for sabo in that way. Sabotaging sucks a lot of the time without proper coordination. 

I still think medkits are better because of reliability. The longer you’re alive the longer the team has to do gens and survive. Hitting a syringe midchase can also be more devastating than the 20s a toolbox takes off a single gen.
        *laughs in Built to Last*
            don’t forget Streetwise + Stake out + Hyper focus 

*chefs kiss*
                Stake Out is amazing for noobs like me lmao
If none of the Survivors are good individually, sure. I play strictly solo-q simply because my friends hate this game and you absolutely get into games where every Survivor is playing as a functional unit and the Killer can't do anything about it.

>deliverance, unbreakable, adrenaline,  and never use any of those perks if you get tunneled out the game.

And you can use Pop, Devour Hope, and Pain Resonance and never get any use out of those perks if you don't get a down. The usability isn't the issue, the fact that you can't give Survivor perks the same power level as Killer perks is because the sheer amount of times a Survivor perk can be used in comparison.
Tbf regression isn't a problem for Blight.
    ok and? what does that have to do with anything I said?
        A Blight player and a Myers player will have a completely different opinion on regression perks. A good Blight doesn't necessarily *need* regression but Myers is so outclassed by a killer like Blight that he needs regression or slow down.

Point being that while you can say whatever you like understand that your experience is vastly different from everyone else as you play one of the strongest killers currently in the game.
            The comment I made was sarcasm… I switch killers every few games.
Not a counter argument. I’m just saying that is easy for a blight main to say.
Yep.

People here complaining about speed up perks acting like slown-downs are not strong as fuck, or how the Killer role has received nothing but buffs and is pretty much the strongest role.
    I know you are, I just wanted to say that playing killer is easier than playing as a survivor.
Maybe its me but for example I feel like as a survivor you get way more penalties for playing sloppy than you do as the killer
Every subsequent BTL proc has 33% less effectiveness

Except for the small amount of lost charges each activation, you get a 99% fill the first time, making it a double, then you get a 66% refill, then a 33% refill, that's almost tripling the lifespan of an item except for the 2% lost
    Oh I see.

    Yeah, I never said items don't exhaust? BTL still vastly extends their life which can make or break a game sometimes.

In terms of difficulty ascending order it would be SWF>Killer>Solo-Queue. It's why you see a lot of blights, and nurses at higher MMR because those are strong killers.
Keep it 100%, increase the amount of time it takes to bless a totem by 100% for each blessing.  Put a boon up 5 times?  Takes 5X longer than the first time.
    Honestly the perfect balance to me is keep it at 150%, hell even 200%, but give 2 tokens. You can move it infinitely but when the killer stomps it out one token is removed. If the killer finds it twice and stomps it out then it’s disabled for the rest of the match.

It’s more like older hexes. There’s a good risk/reward balance. It’s extremely powerful, but if you use it incorrectly you risk losing the perk for the whole game. It’d still be stronger than hexes too since you can move it to a better place and you get two chances which killer gets neither of but it adds an actual counter to it other than bandaiding the problem with a killer perk that crushes the totem.
I personally find killer more fun than survivor lol even though it can be frustrating sometimes, especially when playing weaker killers or using meme builds... 

I think the reason you and others are finding killer to be more difficult is because mmr used to actually do something back then(at times), so you were mostly just going against people with roughly the same amount of hours as you. Now that the mmr system changed, newer players are now going against 5000 hour players once they reach that mmr soft cap.
Killer is rarely fun for me, it's either an easy 4k where you feel like a bully or seal team 6 and neither match is very fun.
Killer is fucking stressful. Trying to manage gens, totems if you bring them, juggle hook states so you don't get accused of tunneling, keep track of where each survivor is, keep track of items, try to guess perks and addons, and bouncing all of that around in your head while trying to mindgame a survivor that's currently looping you, then trying to keep track of how long you've been chasing for and when to drop chase so you don't get gen rushed quite as hard
    Imagine trying to not be accused of tunneling. If its a death hook then you should always take it
        What if it's a relatively new survivor and they're the only survivor you've managed to spot so far, and nobody else has been hooked? What if you're having a really good game and survivors are doing really badly to begin with? There's not much to gain from ending the game quickly, both you and survivors get more bloodpoints and xp if the game is longer
            Id slug em
                Same. Then go hard vs the rest. What shitty teammates hide from the killer all game while a lone survivor is on death hook and they don’t even try to take the heat off? They don’t deserve to escape.
            I’d they’re the only survivor you’ve seen and they get 3 hooked you get just as many points the survivor just doesn’t.
        Nah, that's boring
I used to be almost exclusively a killer player, but now I'm almost exclusively a survivor player. I completely agree with this, killer just is not fun to play and it's gotten a lot more difficult in the last couple years. I used to get 4Ks almost every game, not even playing top tier killers, now I'm lucky to get 1k.
I play both. Used to be main killer. Switched to survior main. Killer is sooooooo much easier.
Clown mains just want to inhale piss and get on with the game
Literally said "some" not "all"
> loop a killer for the last gen then get away almost free

The entire phrasing here is just assuming "the last gen" to be a foregone conclusion. That, in itself, is why it appears so strong - because killers are stupidly ignoring one of their main objectives.

No matter how you frame it, completing 5 generators is not routinely "easy" - unless the killer is just handing them to you.
    It... kinda is tho. First 2 gens are basically free, too many gens for the killer to patrol. Third is also very fast. Fourth potentially could be a bit of a struggle if the killer is having a good game, but otherwise it's also fairly quick. Fifth is obviously the hardest, but it's still incredibly easy if survivors have half a brain and don't three gen themselves.
        my man here just casting aside the entire video game.

Go home killers, it's over, survivors won Dead by Daylight for good.
            Killers are tour guides

Entity created Disneyland confirmed
Not if your good
    No, even then it still is debatable. Bringing a medkit is bringing one or more health states that don't require another survivor to get off of gens for you. Time gained when compared to not bringing it is pretty big. 

Items aren't needed to win, but the game itself is killer-sided so anything you can do to help your own survival is pretty huge and medkits are quite a lot.
        That was his point, it’s not needed to win.
            And that's debatable. Again it's a killer-sided game.
                I don’t think you understand the definition of necessity.

You can still escape without needing a Medkit, it’s not a requirement that you hold a Medkit to be a be able to escape.
Not even close to true. Not everything is some extreme case. You probably don’t even know what 1% is. The average player needs them. You just probably aren’t in an even match up lol.
    You imply that the matchmaking is so bad that I have been getting matched with people severly bellow my skill level for hundreds of games?
        Nope. Solo is just below killer in terms of strength and a large majority of players are solo. Another large majority of players are just bad.
            That still doesn't explain how I can maintain good kill numbers while using no generator slowdown perks.
                You’re a good killer
a lot of gen regression perks can affect multiple gens
    What’s that even supposed to mean
        your rebuttal to my argument is saying that gen regression isnt similar to medkits, because multiple gens can be done at the same time. what you fail to realize is that multiple gens can also be regressed at the same time
            My point was more so that you can have three players doing actions simultaneously while one is being chased, by the nature of the game the killers time is more valuable then an individual survivors, 30 seconds of chase is worth 90 seconds of gen work, so even though a chase isn’t 90 seconds long it comparatively is worth the time of one gen
                incredibly good point actually
                You can still pressure more than 1 survivor
Green heals yourself much faster than purple lol
>And it was necessary for the health of the game.

Yeah, but my point was that they received more than just 2% kick. Basekit BT was also necessary for the health of the game, just like the extra time on gens.

>Also stop calling it "Basekit pop" its literally 2 seconds of progress.

I just used his term, call him out, not me, dood.
    You're right, there was nothing wrong with survivors getting basekit bt.

But there absolutely is something wrong with survivors getting medkits that can heal mid-chase, basekit bt AND basekit unbreakable.
        My first comment was a reply to someone implying that killers received the basekit 2% kick buff as a compensation to the basekit bt, ignoring the extra 10s per gen in the same patch which is a lot more impactful than the kick buff. 

I didn't say anything about whether the change was good or not, only that it existed alongside the kick changes. The fact that people downvoted me and upvoted him tell a lot about this community. 

>survivors getting medkits that can heal mid-chase

Good, remove anything beyond brown medkit/brown toolbox. These items make balancing BHVR a nightmare (also, killers have a similar issue, some killers with addons are way stronger than addonless killers).

>basekit bt

Funny thing about basekit bt: It was 5 seconds. The only reason why it was buffed was because tunneling and camping got out of control.

>basekit unbreakable

I do agree that 22.5s is too dumb, but slugging for 4k is an annoying tactic that should go. BHVR should either remove every perk that buff recovery speed and make it always take 45s (or 60s) OR they should rework the hatch conditions to make slugging for 4k more risky.
They aren't talking about the health of the game ,just what is and isn't basekit
>I mean, it'd also be a fact to point out that 60% is BHVR's desired kill rate, which would actually mean killers are balanced, if not weaker than they should be since only 11 of them meet or beat this criteria*?

No, they aren't weaker than they should. From BHVR itself: "As stated in our most recent stats post , *we did achieve that goal* and as you’ll see in the below graphs, the kill rate continues to hover around the 59% to 61% range"

If we follow this logic, Freddy and sadako are stronger than they should.

>*Across all MMRs. Yes, this is including those trash teammates you get every game giving the killer free 4ks.

Top 5% MMR is 61.3%, it's better than across all MMRs (59.1%).
    >No. From BHVR itself: "As stated in our most recent stats post , we did achieve that goal and as you’ll see in the below graphs, the kill rate continues to hover around the 59% to 61% range"

.... So yes, they were aiming for a higher kill rate, which they achieved, aiming for perferably around [sixty](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/2DZ2UICUC4QZ/screenshot-20220714-125338-418.png) [percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHRAMxiGNxg&t=1110s), and have done so with 11 (10 i we include 59% and exclude those above 61%) of the killers, thus meaning that with most killers falling below those expectations they're still overall slightly weaker than intended?

> Top 5% MMR is 61.3%, it's better than across all MMRs (59.1%).

Yes. Correct. Which is why I clarified that I was talking about all MMRs.

My post wasn't to say 'Oh, killers still need buffs' it was to point out that just pulling numbers without context is very dumb, and the original commenters up there are talking like killers having around a 60% kill rate is somehow unintended.
        It's weird whenever people say that s a justification for survivors having the most busted shit ever.

I swear people think that the 60% means killers 4k 60% of the time or something.
It’s simply not true. I’ve been chased off of a gen while using Brand New Part so many times.  If they kick the gen, that toolbox is now useless. The amount of killers running lethal pursuer is wild, and if you decide to hold your charges for a later generator, that’s still one generator at best. Sabotaging hooks isn’t always effective either. 

A survivor is more likely going to get injured & being healed 1-4 times (assuming the medkit with addons) is going to help you survive waay more than one single generator.
    I explained that if it’s only one survivor than yes it won’t matter if the killer chases after them. It’s when more than one survivor brings a toolboxes that you get way more than what a medkit can give you. Also no one should be wasting toolboxes on a hook unless the gates are powered. 

I don’t know why you skipped over that part.
        It’s a hard, but interesting argument. Assuming the best case scenario—4 toolboxes with brand new part & each survivor is on separate generators and the killer is bad at chase & finding survivors—that’s 3 maybe 4 generators done. If we’re arguing the chances of the team survivability, then 100% you’re right.  The teamwork based reward that 4 toolboxes bring are much better. 

I didn’t skip over using toolboxes for sabo in that way. Sabotaging sucks a lot of the time without proper coordination. 

I still think medkits are better because of reliability. The longer you’re alive the longer the team has to do gens and survive. Hitting a syringe midchase can also be more devastating than the 20s a toolbox takes off a single gen.
    *laughs in Built to Last*
        don’t forget Streetwise + Stake out + Hyper focus 

*chefs kiss*
            Stake Out is amazing for noobs like me lmao
ok and? what does that have to do with anything I said?
    A Blight player and a Myers player will have a completely different opinion on regression perks. A good Blight doesn't necessarily *need* regression but Myers is so outclassed by a killer like Blight that he needs regression or slow down.

Point being that while you can say whatever you like understand that your experience is vastly different from everyone else as you play one of the strongest killers currently in the game.
        The comment I made was sarcasm… I switch killers every few games.
I know you are, I just wanted to say that playing killer is easier than playing as a survivor.
Maybe its me but for example I feel like as a survivor you get way more penalties for playing sloppy than you do as the killer
Oh I see.
Tbh when I play survivor I use small game with clairvoyance lightweight and inner healing and just expect my teamates to kill themselves first hook
Yeah, I never said items don't exhaust? BTL still vastly extends their life which can make or break a game sometimes.
    And I never said BTL didn't change the outcome of a match so what's your point? My whole comment was about them running out of charges

We're not arguing win rates, we're arguing if CoH is a useless perk. It's not and never was it is still a very very strong perk. A useless perk would be like pharmaceutical, no one said that CoH is the sole reason survivors win. It is one of the biggest reasons killer is difficult. 

I hit a survivor they run away from my three Gen to their CoH heal and come back, I will not chase to a dead side of the map and let them repair the three Gen I have. "Then just snuff it out!" I already did that 10 times in the match they just rebless the totem. "Then run the perk to break totems" I shouldn't have to run agoof? To counter a perk that shouldn't be infinite. 

It's like making survivors have to run a perk to break totems, it wouldn't be fair to a survivor to waste a perk slot to break a totem. Just like killers shouldn't have to restomp the same totem 10 times. It's like how ruin got nerfed to deactivate after a survivor dies. Makes no sense. Just do bones and you can get rid of ruin already why deactivate it when a survivor dies? Why punish a killer for doing good?

Edit: spelling error
    I think the best way to look at it would be the time spent healing is less time on generators. There's more ways than one to look at the overall impact of a perk and its usefulness. Utilize the time wasted on healing. If you know where the boon is then you know where to find injured survivors? It's not entirely difficult. If you nerf CoH too much then people go back to running self care. Infinite healing, one just isn't teamwide, and we all know why self care was nerfed years ago. Do you just not want survivors to heal themselves at all? People already complain about medkits enough too.

Edit: Killer is difficult but they have 60%+ kill rates? Something isn't adding up here.
        Where you're right yes but here's the thing of they are constantly running to a dead side if the map I am wasting time over there. Yes there's one injured survivor there, but there is 2 or 3 survivors on gens. 

Gens which I have to protect in order to win, let them run self care then it requires the other survivors to find each other to heal or run self care themselves, rather than one survivor on the team runs CoH and now everyone has self care on the team plus their 4 other perks. 

Idk why people complain about medkits I get the frustration of survivors using anti hemmorage, and septic needle(or whatever the add-ons are called)  mid-chase but it's not common enough to worry about.

Yes killer is difficult because it requires the survivors to make mistakes to catch them unless you catch them in the open which is a mistake in and of itself, if you run into a survivor who runs an optimal loop you will waste 25+ seconds and time is not on the killers side.

Honestly the perfect balance to me is keep it at 150%, hell even 200%, but give 2 tokens. You can move it infinitely but when the killer stomps it out one token is removed. If the killer finds it twice and stomps it out then it’s disabled for the rest of the match.

It’s more like older hexes. There’s a good risk/reward balance. It’s extremely powerful, but if you use it incorrectly you risk losing the perk for the whole game. It’d still be stronger than hexes too since you can move it to a better place and you get two chances which killer gets neither of but it adds an actual counter to it other than bandaiding the problem with a killer perk that crushes the totem.

I do agree that 22.5s is too dumb, but slugging for 4k is an annoying tactic that should go. BHVR should either remove every perk that buff recovery speed and make it always take 45s (or 60s) OR they should rework the hatch conditions to make slugging for 4k more risky.
It's weird whenever people say that s a justification for survivors having the most busted shit ever.

I swear people think that the 60% means killers 4k 60% of the time or something.
It’s a hard, but interesting argument. Assuming the best case scenario—4 toolboxes with brand new part & each survivor is on separate generators and the killer is bad at chase & finding survivors—that’s 3 maybe 4 generators done. If we’re arguing the chances of the team survivability, then 100% you’re right.  The teamwork based reward that 4 toolboxes bring are much better. 

I didn’t skip over using toolboxes for sabo in that way. Sabotaging sucks a lot of the time without proper coordination. 

I still think medkits are better because of reliability. The longer you’re alive the longer the team has to do gens and survive. Hitting a syringe midchase can also be more devastating than the 20s a toolbox takes off a single gen.
don’t forget Streetwise + Stake out + Hyper focus 

*chefs kiss*
    Stake Out is amazing for noobs like me lmao
The comment I made was sarcasm… I switch killers every few games.
Reddit moment: violently disagreeing while saying the same thing
    How on earth is that violent I'm asking you a question
        I was joking ffs 🤦‍♀️
I am poking fun at the pettiness of your complaint. The fact that you can't see it makes the novelty even grander.

Where you're right yes but here's the thing of they are constantly running to a dead side if the map I am wasting time over there. Yes there's one injured survivor there, but there is 2 or 3 survivors on gens. 

Gens which I have to protect in order to win, let them run self care then it requires the other survivors to find each other to heal or run self care themselves, rather than one survivor on the team runs CoH and now everyone has self care on the team plus their 4 other perks. 

Idk why people complain about medkits I get the frustration of survivors using anti hemmorage, and septic needle(or whatever the add-ons are called)  mid-chase but it's not common enough to worry about.

Yes killer is difficult because it requires the survivors to make mistakes to catch them unless you catch them in the open which is a mistake in and of itself, if you run into a survivor who runs an optimal loop you will waste 25+ seconds and time is not on the killers side. 

Winrates are skewed because MMR is a joke and sticks people who have 2 hrs in the game with people like me who have 2.2k hours in the game. In terms of difficulty ascending order it would be SWF>Killer>Solo-Queue. It's why you see a lot of blights, and nurses at higher MMR because those are strong killers.
Id slug em
    Same. Then go hard vs the rest. What shitty teammates hide from the killer all game while a lone survivor is on death hook and they don’t even try to take the heat off? They don’t deserve to escape.
I’d they’re the only survivor you’ve seen and they get 3 hooked you get just as many points the survivor just doesn’t.
Killers are tour guides

Entity created Disneyland confirmed
And that's debatable. Again it's a killer-sided game.
    I don’t think you understand the definition of necessity.

You can still escape without needing a Medkit, it’s not a requirement that you hold a Medkit to be a be able to escape.
That still doesn't explain how I can maintain good kill numbers while using no generator slowdown perks.
    You’re a good killer
My point was more so that you can have three players doing actions simultaneously while one is being chased, by the nature of the game the killers time is more valuable then an individual survivors, 30 seconds of chase is worth 90 seconds of gen work, so even though a chase isn’t 90 seconds long it comparatively is worth the time of one gen
    incredibly good point actually
    You can still pressure more than 1 survivor
Stake Out is amazing for noobs like me lmao
