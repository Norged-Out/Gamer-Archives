    I've grown to love FarmerJohn & his memes <3
    Wow, posting the sauce? You are a true legend!
    Thank you for being amazing providing credit!
    Finally person who gives credit to original maker
    I did this exact thing in one of my videos a couple of months ago. Funny to see John do it too, ~~great~~ meme minds think alike.
Alex Jones memes will just never not be funny.
    "I will eat your ass like corn on the cob"
        https://youtu.be/o5EKuIus-oE
            Ah yes, LEFTIST ass. Of course.
            That's incredible lol
    Anything Alex Jones will neber not be funny.
        Only old memes. Hes been headed into “sad” territory since hes started drinking again. Hes so bloated and it really feels like his age and stress is catching up to him. He legit looks like a hobo
            Don’t get wrong he’s a piece of shit, but that recent meme with him having llamas on the set is pretty fucking funny

Edit for Link [Alex Jones Brings Llamas to the Studio for no apparent reason](https://youtu.be/rojTeUeeuAs)
                Holy shit I thought you were fucking with me and that those llamas were photoshopped in. I straight lost it when he said, "But now that I have *llamas*..."
                [deleted]
                    Which he is neither lol, just a vitamin salesman
            Came here to say I don't feel bad for him but after typing out a whole "lol fuck him" kinda thing I'm conflicted. On one hand, he's brainwashed countless people, including my mom, into believing actual fascist propaganda so they'd buy his snake oil bullshit and make him rich. On the other, humans are complex beings and I'd stop short of saying I *hate* him, because that's a very harsh judgement and I don't know him, and nobody deserves to go through alcoholism. I don't want to feel bad for the guy because of all the harm he's caused the US (and the world), but I don't know what made him this way. I miss when people just weren't assholes so you didn't have to think about this.

edit: a word
                Considering he's probably the biggest pusher of the Sandy Hook conspiracy and has actually cause people to go after the victims parents i'd safely say it's ok to hate him.
                People have always been assholes. Having to decide how to feel about it is part of being an adult.
                    True :/
                It's okay to feel sympathy for horrible people. In the end it's human nature to care about other humans, even ones we despise.
        Gotta disagree. Harassment of dead children's parents is categorically not funny.
            But it is
                What’s funny about it
                    Ofc nothing about it is funny I was joking
                        Lol epic
                            But ngl you did ruin the original meme
        Totally. Alex Jones is hilarious, he says crazy things and acts insane but occasionally moments where he actually makes sense. Despite the hate he gets i like him, i assume he isn't genuinely insane and just plays a character for the camera most of the time.
            Yeah who doesn’t love good ol’ fashioned anti-semitism and homophobia. Truly a hilarious guy /s
    he's not a great guy, but man can his rants be absurd sometimes
    I’ve always thought he could’ve had a pretty successful comedy career if he wasn’t an actual crazy person.
    I hate that fake guy
“You are not an intellectual” gets me everytime
    The little teabag she's doing is just the cherry on top I'm laughing like an idiot
    I thought he said electrical?
One of my fav memes.

Turn the freaking dwights gay!
    Head by Gay Dwight
        Ah, a classic.
            an all time classic
    r/dbdgonewild says Dwight's are already gay
        /r/DBDGoneGay says everyone is gay. Except Freddy. No Freddy allowed. Creep.
    Canon is Dwight is gay and David crushes his little boipussy every time they meet at the campfire
        This reminds me of a video I watched recently! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The fact that the camera turns to face where he would be standing realistically is impressive
I like be these memes. Is there a green screen of this?
     [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4buPMavjFM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4buPMavjFM)
        Thank you kind stranger.
What do I do, Entity? Destroy the Survivor. Corrupt Purge them all! This is their plan, people. These are demons.
    _THEY'RE PUTTIN' META PERKS IN THE BLOODWEB TO TURN THE FRICKIN' DWIGHTS GAY!_
        ARE YOU TRYING TO SWF WITH ME?
I don't play this game but this sub is a treasure trove of hilarious memes.
    Give it a go, if you are able! The memes are written by the gameplay, friend. 

And it’s occasionally really fun to play.
        The 150$ tag of additional content puts me off. Seems like a successful version of Evolve.

I don't do multiplayer games anyway. I'll have to appreciate this one from afar. Looks like a bunch of fun with friends.
            That’s perfectly fair. I could see the Evolve comparison - though I’d argue it is quite different - but the prices for the DLC are a bit asinine. 

My one DBD apologetic point I would make is, in my own opinion, I think it’s a lot more fun without friends. Being unable to communicate is a HUGE immersion factor for me, personally. 

But... I get it. I usually prefer single player games myself. Don’t want to push it. But if you ever see it for sale at a price you find acceptable, I honestly highly, highly recommend it.
            Ive bought the game and all dlc on sale, I've spent less than 40 bucks on this game.
                Same.
            You can unlock all the characters just by playing
                Not any of the licensed killers or survivors, unless they've changed it in the past month.

Edit: a word
                    Yea but that’s not 150$ worth of stuff, you can honestly get the best killer and survivor perks from non licensed stuff anyway. Most of the game is available, you just have to grind.
                        If you wait for their perks to come in the shrine I suppose it wouldn't be as bad, I just can't imagine not playing spoopy myers, or basement bubba.

Edit: Words are tough for me today.
                            The game was just on sale for like $8. 

And the DLC was on sale too, like Bubba was only a few bucks
                                He's always only a few bucks, though, right?
            Play on mobile, it's great and it's free
    If you have a phone mobile is free
This is why Deathslinger is my favorite killer
    literally!Noed with deathslinger is a direct counter to toxic Teabaggers at the exit gate
    Don't forget PH with NOED, M&A, and range upgrades
        NOED doesn't work with abilities.
The lil run at the end when they have already left <3
Alex would always 4 man and close hatch. He's Op from all the enhancements he takes.
    Blight is actually injecting himself with Info Wars Super Male Vitality
    He wouldn't even need crutch perks like monstrous shrine or fire up either
**NEW WORLD ORDER DISPLEASED**

New killer reveal?
My EnTITTIES are displeased with me..
God this subreddit is such a gem
This is way to accurate it's scary
I have never played this game in my life and I can't stop laughing.
LMFAOOOOOOO

Fucking Hell, I got Alex Jones'ed this morning.  


Escape door was open, Pyramid Head killer.

3 teammates still haven't escaped

Me: hehehehe I'll throw down this pallet to distract him from my anon buds ;)

\-nothing happens-

\-travels 4 feet further from door-

Me: heheheheheheh I'll throw down \*THIS\* pallet. Yeah. That'll do it. >:)

\-spine chill immediately lights up-  
"OHFUCKOHFUCKOHFUCKOHFUCK"

Pyramid Head: ;)

Me: ;(

Pyramid Head: ... ;)

\-hits me, NOED activated!"

\-downed, gets hooked-

\-sees aura of my teammates at other exit door, teabagging and pointing directly at me from across the entire map-

\-dies inside-
Yeah, whilst crying
Deathslinger mains rise up.
I fucking love this meme
This meme is an instant classic
IQ 1 billion to who made this.
Amazing
https://youtu.be/6sl1YZ_0_ro been done before , timestamp 9:10
    Not saying he pliagarized btw , but it's the same meme done before so I think this video also deserves some credit . And it is a funny vid 😉
Holy shit top 3 of all time!!!
Love him or hate'em, Alex Jones is a gift from God himself.
Holy shit😂
Ima let FarmerJohn finish but I did it first. Just sayin

Top tier comedy
It's always the toxic neas that get away from me 😪 they're too powerful and I'm too bad
Got damn this is the best meme I’ve seen on here lmao
this is pure art :D
“You’re a fake and a fraud!”

*Loads harpoon gun with malicious intent*
This is amazing
Perfection lol
True
The running at the end kills me because I try so hard not to chase them. 
Also would love to draw this with Evan in place of Alex Jones
lmfaooo
This was literally me last game with a Steve, but he didn’t Tbag, he just saw me and made a run for it.

On a side note, I killed a 3 man SWF that match with just a level 5 Pyramid head. The sheer luck was ridiculous.
Just play myers, save up tombstones and then when you see a what looks like a 4man swf use it, as soon. As they do thst just casually walk up, pretend you are shaking your head or something and then free kill
This is the funniest DBD meme so far

As long as I don’t play on underground laboratory I usually do fine. I suck as the survivor tho
Should’ve used Clown’s power icon instead of Wraith’s
This was amazing 🤣🤣🤣
I'm going to tell my kids this is what shitposting is
This might be my favorite Alex Jones meme now lmfao
Lmao sounds about right. Damn survivor taking away my 4k!!

I would love for anyone to tbag at the exit gate I got something that's called no one escapes death and I main deathslinger
    Deathslinger buddies
        Eyyyyyy
The best feeling when this happens is when you play Deathslinger with Iridescent Coin and you just insta down them before they leave.
God I am still laughing at this lol. As a killer main, this meme hits home more than any meme that exist in 2020 💀😂
That’s it, my vote for next Dbd Killer DLC is Alex Jones.

See this isn’t a problem for me as a demogorgon

This is ridiculously well done.
Yes
Gg ez baby killer
Imagine winning in a game that is completely survivor sided and bragging about it. I fucking hate the skill gap in this game. Like holy fuck.
    Why do you think this game is survivor sided? Do you have an actual arguments, or did you just had a bad killer game?
        Because you can mess up many times in a game as survivor and get second chances out the ass. But if you fuck up once as killer the game is over
so many awards, some shit is really fuckey about this.

Fuck off, CCP.

    /r/DBDGoneGay says everyone is gay. Except Freddy. No Freddy allowed. Creep.
Canon is Dwight is gay and David crushes his little boipussy every time they meet at the campfire
    This reminds me of a video I watched recently! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

    Thank you kind stranger.
_THEY'RE PUTTIN' META PERKS IN THE BLOODWEB TO TURN THE FRICKIN' DWIGHTS GAY!_
    ARE YOU TRYING TO SWF WITH ME?
Give it a go, if you are able! The memes are written by the gameplay, friend. 

And it’s occasionally really fun to play.
    The 150$ tag of additional content puts me off. Seems like a successful version of Evolve.

I don't do multiplayer games anyway. I'll have to appreciate this one from afar. Looks like a bunch of fun with friends.
        That’s perfectly fair. I could see the Evolve comparison - though I’d argue it is quite different - but the prices for the DLC are a bit asinine. 

My one DBD apologetic point I would make is, in my own opinion, I think it’s a lot more fun without friends. Being unable to communicate is a HUGE immersion factor for me, personally. 

But... I get it. I usually prefer single player games myself. Don’t want to push it. But if you ever see it for sale at a price you find acceptable, I honestly highly, highly recommend it.
        Ive bought the game and all dlc on sale, I've spent less than 40 bucks on this game.
            Same.
        You can unlock all the characters just by playing
            Not any of the licensed killers or survivors, unless they've changed it in the past month.

Edit: a word
                Yea but that’s not 150$ worth of stuff, you can honestly get the best killer and survivor perks from non licensed stuff anyway. Most of the game is available, you just have to grind.
                    If you wait for their perks to come in the shrine I suppose it wouldn't be as bad, I just can't imagine not playing spoopy myers, or basement bubba.

Edit: Words are tough for me today.
                        The game was just on sale for like $8. 

And the DLC was on sale too, like Bubba was only a few bucks
                            He's always only a few bucks, though, right?
        Play on mobile, it's great and it's free
If you have a phone mobile is free
literally!Noed with deathslinger is a direct counter to toxic Teabaggers at the exit gate
Don't forget PH with NOED, M&A, and range upgrades
    NOED doesn't work with abilities.
Blight is actually injecting himself with Info Wars Super Male Vitality
He wouldn't even need crutch perks like monstrous shrine or fire up either

Why do you think this game is survivor sided? Do you have an actual arguments, or did you just had a bad killer game?
    Because you can mess up many times in a game as survivor and get second chances out the ass. But if you fuck up once as killer the game is over
''Certified Cock Pleaser''? man stop using acronyms no one understands.
    No I was calling you a communist, duh.
https://youtu.be/o5EKuIus-oE
    Ah yes, LEFTIST ass. Of course.
    That's incredible lol
Only old memes. Hes been headed into “sad” territory since hes started drinking again. Hes so bloated and it really feels like his age and stress is catching up to him. He legit looks like a hobo
    Don’t get wrong he’s a piece of shit, but that recent meme with him having llamas on the set is pretty fucking funny

Edit for Link [Alex Jones Brings Llamas to the Studio for no apparent reason](https://youtu.be/rojTeUeeuAs)
        Holy shit I thought you were fucking with me and that those llamas were photoshopped in. I straight lost it when he said, "But now that I have *llamas*..."
        [deleted]
            Which he is neither lol, just a vitamin salesman
    Came here to say I don't feel bad for him but after typing out a whole "lol fuck him" kinda thing I'm conflicted. On one hand, he's brainwashed countless people, including my mom, into believing actual fascist propaganda so they'd buy his snake oil bullshit and make him rich. On the other, humans are complex beings and I'd stop short of saying I *hate* him, because that's a very harsh judgement and I don't know him, and nobody deserves to go through alcoholism. I don't want to feel bad for the guy because of all the harm he's caused the US (and the world), but I don't know what made him this way. I miss when people just weren't assholes so you didn't have to think about this.

edit: a word
        Considering he's probably the biggest pusher of the Sandy Hook conspiracy and has actually cause people to go after the victims parents i'd safely say it's ok to hate him.
        People have always been assholes. Having to decide how to feel about it is part of being an adult.
            True :/
        It's okay to feel sympathy for horrible people. In the end it's human nature to care about other humans, even ones we despise.
Gotta disagree. Harassment of dead children's parents is categorically not funny.
    But it is
        What’s funny about it
            Ofc nothing about it is funny I was joking
                Lol epic
                    But ngl you did ruin the original meme
Totally. Alex Jones is hilarious, he says crazy things and acts insane but occasionally moments where he actually makes sense. Despite the hate he gets i like him, i assume he isn't genuinely insane and just plays a character for the camera most of the time.
    Yeah who doesn’t love good ol’ fashioned anti-semitism and homophobia. Truly a hilarious guy /s
Ah, a classic.

Thank you kind stranger.
ARE YOU TRYING TO SWF WITH ME?
The 150$ tag of additional content puts me off. Seems like a successful version of Evolve.

I don't do multiplayer games anyway. I'll have to appreciate this one from afar. Looks like a bunch of fun with friends.
    That’s perfectly fair. I could see the Evolve comparison - though I’d argue it is quite different - but the prices for the DLC are a bit asinine. 

My one DBD apologetic point I would make is, in my own opinion, I think it’s a lot more fun without friends. Being unable to communicate is a HUGE immersion factor for me, personally. 

But... I get it. I usually prefer single player games myself. Don’t want to push it. But if you ever see it for sale at a price you find acceptable, I honestly highly, highly recommend it.
    Ive bought the game and all dlc on sale, I've spent less than 40 bucks on this game.

    You can unlock all the characters just by playing
        Not any of the licensed killers or survivors, unless they've changed it in the past month.
