[[You can, in fact, break every pallet in the map with ONE chainsaw sprint]]





Now on The Game.
    Lost
        Lost or not 4k?
            *didn‚Äôt get 12 hooks
                *Huuks
                    He did that in a custom match....
    I just lost the game
        by lost the game i mean literally cant find the dbd icon on my pc anymore
        Same.
        Its been years!!! Why must you do this to me? I was winning! But now I've lost the game...
            Winning the game is accepting the fact that losing is inevitable. It teaches us that even if we lose something, we can still keep going.
        Shit.
        Sunuvabitch
Only took 3 hours, not even a real challenge.
    But can you chainsaw through every pallet and end your sprint with a reverse chainsaw into a quentin hiding in the corner?
        Of course he can, that's Otzdarva (or at least his library card says so)
            You can never be too sure, that not Otzdarva guy looks really similar
                Yes, but the other guy is NOT otzdarva. They just happen to be similar. Maybe close relatives?
                Nah, Not Otzdarva killed the real one years ago and took his place.
            According to a peer reviewed study with no citations.
            (And his tinder verified profile)
        I sure hope you can‚Äôt :o
    Now do it on Lery‚Äôs. I dare you.
        Do it on the game. The new one
            Yes pls
    When is the DS2 All Pallets No Hit Run? Knowing DS2, there are probably 41 pallets.
    Is this why you went over your stream schedule XD
    you beautiful, beautiful bastard
    Oh shit Otz is the OP
    I know your lies, that was NotOtzdarva that was controlling the billy! Tell the people the truth!
    Otz, I love your videos and the content you make. You literally beat DS2 no hit and there's literally nothing you can't do in any game.
    Ok now play a game of wraith without letting survivors vault windows or drop pallets in chase by body blocking them every time. A win scenario is a 4K (or 3k with hatch) and no dropped pallets or vaulted windows in chase.

‚ÄúIn chase‚Äù being defined as ‚Äúwhile actively pursuing a specific survivor while cloaked or uncloaked‚Äù. You can choose to break a chase after a hit by saying ‚Äúbreaking the chase‚Äù then going for another survivor, or pausing for 10 seconds then going after the survivor you hit.

    love you Otz
    love you man, keep up the amazing work
    1000 bucks if you do it on lery's. Dead ass
    How come the chainsaws cooling reset itself?
    I‚Äôm only commenting because of your username. That fucker was hard to beat 1v1.
    Oh hai Otz!
    Now do it on The Game
    Now do the game bottom floor
    Haven't played much HB since the rework. How are you not overheating?
    You took so long that Billy‚Äôs face started melting lmao
    Now you just need to pull it off in a real game.
    Callao retrasao üòé
    Hello Otz, this is friends!
I'm more stunned that there are apparently only eleven pallets on the map.
    It's my most hated map. So many bad pallets as well and big open spaces with no where to hide
        They sent all the pallets to the Game map.
        That‚Äôs what bhvr does with reworked maps. Just totally guts them all
            Map was like that anyways tbh
                Yeah, when they announced the rework I was hoping they would add some kind of shelter to *Shelter* Woods, but it was only a graphical update.

In fact, the only change I noticed is that you can't use balanced landing on the giant tree anymore.
                    Yeah I was using balanced on this map the other day and I never use balanced so I don‚Äôt really know where I need to go on each map to make it work. Realized there were no hills or anything so I had to settle for the basement which wasn‚Äôt exactly helpful
            Except with The Game. That map is pallet city now lol
                Pallet City, yet they managed to make it equally cancer for both survivors and killers
                    How so?
                        As a survivor there can be tons of dead ends if the killer doesn't break any doors.
                            There's a corner of the Game on the top floor where if you get a hook and leave the door blocked it's a ridiculous choke, godly for trapper but even on any killer you can get 2-3 basic attacks in succession
                        All those doors for survivors, and all those pallets for the killer
                And still cancer for survivors and killers alike.
                Always was.
                It was like that even before the rework. It had 20 pallets back then and most of them were very safe
            Shelter woods has been dogshit for survivors since launch. It used to be even worse, but it's improved *slightly* over time.
                It used to hardly have any trees so it was basically a cornfield map without any corn, structure, or pallets
                The reason it's so bad is because there are three jungle gyms, shack and the only other safety net is pallets which is limited, and once they're gone, nearly the entire map becomes unsafe. The entire center of the map is also a dead zone. It's coldwind farm if coldwind farm was mostly dead zones
                That's not at all true. There was a time it was the most pallet dense map in the game. I believe that changed when they reworked pallet distance to remove double pallets.
                    You sure you're not confusing this with old-old Autohaven? There was an insane number of tiles with double pallets, ie the entire area around Blood Lodge (aka Pallet Town) was just low-wall tiles with double pallets.  Shelter woods never had that density.

Shelter woods has always been pretty killer-favorable, between a complete lack of infinites, a lack of god-loops and honestly a lack of many good loops and pallets in general.
                        Definitely not. The joke around the time is that the pallets sheltered the survivors.
                            Yeah, no. [Shelter woods has been killer friendly since forever, distinctly because of a lack of pallets and juke spots.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/4udegg/whats_the_worst_map_in_the_game/).  It's always been a miserable map to survive on.
                                Not sure an old reddit thread is a good indicator. Survivors today think the game is a good killer map. There are many videos of 20+ pallet shelter woods.
                                    >Not sure an old reddit thread is a good indicator. Survivors today think the game is a good killer map.

I mean, the Game did have a relatively high kill rate prior to the rework.  The update shifted things in survivor's favor for sure.

> There are many videos of 20+ pallet shelter woods.

Yeah, and Autohaven would have had well over 30 pallets in comparison.  We're talking relatively here. Old-old Shelter woods would have been a little more survivor-favorable by today's standards, but it was still really killer-favorable in comparison to the other maps (like Pallet-haven) back then. It's still killer-favorable today.
            It was like that even before the rework.
            I mean, the game has like 24 pallets? Of which like 6-10 are god pallets. They dont always gut them
            *insert Gideon Meat Plant joke here*
            Theres literally double pallets like its 2016 again lmfao
        Worst map I feel a d/c coming on
        I used to hate it from the Nurse's point of view since I was learning Nurse (so I was by no means good, key word "learning") and this map has tons of LoS breakers.
    This map either has 5 jungle gyms or 4 TL‚Äôs and a C wall pallets with a few rock loops and huge deadzones. The RNG is fucking crazy on shelter woods.
        I swear if someone loops for 2 minutes using 3 pallets they render half the map unplayable. It‚Äôs so bad I wish it just got removed because the entire map is 1 big donut with a void in the middle
            Except the map is so big that a killer can't even pressure the other half of the map. Getting a somewhat decent 3gen is very difficult without some form of good mobility.
                What? I didnt think Shelter Woods was actually that big.
                    It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs basically 3 rings Inner ring is a dead zone. Middle ring is half deadzone half tiles. Outer circle is just empty.  

it‚Äôs a shame cus the tree honestly looks so cool but the only reason to go near it as survivor is when your team used all 4 pallets on the map and now holding W is the most effective ‚Äúloop‚Äù
                        [deleted]
                            I'm talking about the playable region of the map, most of the map is a dead zone, making it very very killer sided, the middle of the map is mostly a killer free zone for mobility and the outskirts are pretty empty too.
                This is not true at all. Regardless, even if it was big I'd much rather have windows and pallets than map size. The map is terribly designed at the moment.
                    It's literally the second largest map...
                Only actual size is big. Since there is nothing on the edges of the map, unlike Rotten Fields, it is easy for killer to pressure the map.
                It's not that big. It's very open too. You can see survivors from any point in the map and it has a ton of mobility. No middle gen means you can easily get gen trapped. It even has no pallets.
        I'd be ecstatic to get 4 L-T walls. Sometimes all you get on that map are shitty pallet gyms
    [deleted]
    The best part is...they just reworked this map. 

Imagine being back in high school.  You‚Äôre teacher gives you your project back with an opportunity to get a higher grade.  You redo the entire look of it, and it just looks a lot different.  Not necessarily ‚Äúbetter‚Äù but it at least looks like it‚Äôs made with higher quality parts.  However, you somehow failed the crux of the redo.  Your teacher stares at you blankly; thinks many, many things about you.  But in the end, hands you back your project, passes you, and then tells you they are eagerly awaiting your next project.  

This is us and bhvr folks
        Honestly I feel most of the reworks have been for the worse, especially the fucking breakable wall spam. The new The Game is one of the worst examples IMO. Probably the only rework I actually like is Ormond because it at least feels smaller compared to the near impossibility of killer there before.
    Ahhh... Shelter Woods.
    Gideon meat plant stole all of mac millin estates pallets
    The attempt before this one had 8.
    Only? That's a high number for Shelter Woods. Once had one half of the map be nothing but LT loops and the other had another one or two as well.
    haha ‚Äústunned‚Äù, I see what you did there
    On our first attempt we were lucky, only 8 pallets spawned
How the hell is there only 11 pallets on that map
    Attempt before this one the map had 8.
        Yep! üòÇ Our first Shelter Woods had only 8.
            Love you otz, this was such a fun idea and I love that it just came from the chat. Had a blast watching you figure this out!
    The minimum amount of pallets on every map is 8
        coldwind house map?
    actually there are 12. number 4 is counted dubble.
    Are*

And yeah that map is so killer friendly
        Yes and no even though it is low in resources it is a gaint map. Which is  always bad for killer.  It depends on what the pallets spawn next two. I have seen 5 jungle gyms and I have seen versions with all l wall t walls. It also depends what your teammates do with the resources they are given. If you have a teamate that runs and camps pallets it's. GG
            Not really. Despite being one of the biggest maps in the game, there is almost nothing around the edges and the center of the map, unlike Rotten Fields or Swamp maps, which makes it easy for killer to pressure as there is no reason to patrol nearly half of the map. Even Otz talked about it in his map tier list.
                Nothing to patrol except the gens that are on different sides of the map.......
                    That's... every map in a nutshell. Like I said, there is no gens and good tiles on the edges of the map and depending on RNG, a generator will or won't be spawned in the middle, making patrolling nearly half of the map pointless. Since survivors don't have gens to repair and tiles to run in those places, killers have no reason patrol and survivors have no reason to take a chase there, making actual playing area so small.

For comparision, take Coal Tower. The map's actual size is much smaller but since the edge's of the map have stuff for players to interact with, making actual playable area nearly equal to Shelter Wood's.
                        It's not just every map it's the secound largest map in the game. Which if your three gen gets busted your prob done.  And the point about nothing on the outside I discussed by saying I have seen 5 jungle gyms  with rock loops, and pallet gyms connecting them. That certainly is not nothing. Even though I have also seen is spawn with basically nothing, got love a game with this much rng. Lol The middle is definitely a dead zone though. Im not saying the map is survior sided I'm saying you can beat good killers by doing the right gens. Just cause of the size of the map. I think it should be smaller and have a few more loops personally.
                            Aside from our traditional shack, there are 2 tiles* on one side of the shack, 2 tiles* on other side, 1 tile* on the side that is far from shack with some shitty rock loops and huge deadzones in the middle and the side that is near shack side. That's only 5 tiles at max that barely connect to each other. I think loop count is fine in general. The problem is there is nothing in most of the map and most loops can't be connected.

Like I said 2 times previously, the map's playable area is smaller than actual size. Survivor or killer, people have no reason to use the half of the map. Like, it shouldn't take you so long to patrol the map. Survivors don't have anything to do in edges or center. 

*Tiles can be TL Walls, Jungle Gyms and Pallet Gyms.
                        Just seen the secound part. I'd rather have things that lead to killer survior Interaction then me taking my ass across the map and it taking 30 secounds or surviors just dieing cause a Meg throw all the pallets.
            I think the middle of the nap is pretty barren. If survivors are caught anywhere around there then there isn‚Äôt much to work with. Also helps that the map is pretty small
                At least they added a pallet to the middle of the map. It used to be even more empty.
                Its actually one of the bigger maps it's bigger then haddonfield
                    Oh seriously? It feels so small. Maybe because of all the open space, especially around the edges
                        Yeah a  lot of the gens are around the outside of the map so if everyone splits up and you guys do not three gen it's hard to win on without slowdown. But once shit gone it goes very much in the favor of the killer, but if the gens are on opposite side of the map no way killer can defend them all.
                            Why does this sub downvote so much lol

If it‚Äôs not a corny joke or a ‚Äúwholesome‚Äù thing then i see downvotes/insults for no reason
        No, "is" is the correct word to use in that sentence.

The "is" in the sentence is not referring to the boxes, it is referring to the unwritten fact that presently there are 11 things existing. Thus, "how the hell is there only 11 pallets on the map" is correct.
            ‚Äúis‚Äù corresponds to ‚Äúamount‚Äù, which is singular (though it should really be ‚Äúnumber‚Äù because pallets are countable).
                But it doesnt matter if it corresponds to amount. Because "is" in the sentence isnt referencing the boxes. It is referring to the state of existence of the boxes. It is a question asking "How IS there 20 things there?" You are asking how the things exist, not stating that there are 20 things there.
                    This does not sound right to me, but I'm not English major.
                        Let me explain a different way. The OP was asking how we are in a reality where there are 11 pallets. It is because the order of the words is "how the hell is this (a thing)" rather than "there are (X things)." It is a question about the existence of a thing rather than the number of things so "is" refers to the situation or reality rather than the items themselves.

                    > please, stfu, you are making yourself look stupid. 

I'm a native English speaker and "How are there only 11 pallets on this map" sounds absolutely right to me. This stuff really can be confusing and particular.

Also I don't see how "the map still has those 11 pallets" is relevant, since the issue is plural vs singular and both "is" and "are" are present tense.
            Okay dude, explain me the rule for it. Read through this and the other thread, didnt explain much about it
        F
Watched you do this live, I don't know how you kept at it, I would've got mad and given up after 10 minutes üòÇ
    Dude he has probably 5k hrs killing survivors every match does get boring I guess
    Wait till you hear what he did in dark souls 2
        [deleted]
            Yes. He has the moves
    Same. I‚Äôm now rich in strange fruits though!
        Hell yeah, believers prosper.
        I was away from my computer when that happened and did not get in on it. I am super upset since I was there for the entire 9 hours XD
    He is the guy that beat Dark Souls (on stream!) in a hitless run after a million attempts. This guy is fucked.
F Billy's getting nerfed again
    I hope so.

Why the hell can he now keep going after breaking a pallet? What did I miss?
        It's an addon and it makes it so your chainsaw only does 1 health state of damage after going through a pallet.
        I was thinking the same thing but apparently it‚Äôs just an add on.
BHVR: ok, so the goal of the game is...

Dbd community: fuck you *undeads your Daylight*
    Nice , 69 upvotes
Am I stupid or did he break 12 pallets not eleven? The counter didn't go up after 4 for one pallet...
    There is indeed 12 pallets!
Haven't play the game in a couple months.

Since when could billy boi break pallets with 0 punishment?
    Its an addon.
        what‚Äôs it called?
            Lopro Chains
            LoPro chains is a purple addon for billy that allows him to continue chainsaw sprinting through pallets but if you hit a survivor within 5 seconds they only take 1 health state of damage, not insta-down
                That still sounds like a *really* good Billy addon.

I don't know. Haven't played Billy. Can't freaking stand Billy.
    There is a punishment, instead of insta down after pallet break, you get a normal injure.
        So when someone's injured their only hope is a window? That's God awful.
            no? Just don't stand behind a pallet when you see Billy charging his saw.
            No, just don't stand near the pallet when you see billy revving
                Gosh, why didn't I think of that?! Sometimes the only thing you can do to avoid a Billy or Bubba is drop a pallet and find a safer location. If he's not stopping you're just screwed.
                    nah, the addon isn't strong
                    But he can no longer one shot with his chainsaw. You no longer have any need to fear the saw so you don't have to predrop a pallet. All of Billy's chases are going to last way longer because you have to either M1 twice or saw twice. Add on is kind of a meme
                        It only does less damage if he breaks a pallet, if you don't drop the pallet and end up getting sawed because of that you're gonna be insta downed
                            Oh i didn't realize it got changed recently. Damn it actually kinda useful now
                                IIRC, it got changed immediately when it hit the live servers. It was only different during the PTB (where Lopro Chains were also Ultra Rare instead of Very Rare).
                            The damage debuff also only lasts a short time, so if you get chainsawed from 20 feet away after he breaks the pallet, you're still going down.
                        Now that I'm thinking about it yeah, it does seem terrible since you lose your instadown. Also because only a good Billy can effectively uses his chainsaw well enough to get you into those terrible situations.
                    You should almost never just stand behind a pallet. Just drop the pallet and run away. If he's literally revving his chainsaw waiting for you to throw the pallet, then either don't throw the pallet so you can continue the loop or stun him. There are many counterplay options if you're good at the game.
                        https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/lzi31m/you_can_in_fact_break_every_pallet_in_the_map/gq2vere?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3

Yall are just playing stupid at this point.
                            Like I said in my post, you can pallet stun the Billy. I didn't assume you were camping the pallet, but I laid out the scenario as well as your good options and bad options.  

Did you even read my post or did you just call stupid the second you realized I didn't agree with you?
                                >Just drop the pallet and run away.

And if I didn't drop the pallet and run away what would I be doing? I'd be camping the pallet like an idiot. 

>If he's literally revving his chainsaw waiting for you to throw the pallet, then either don't throw the pallet so you can continue the loop or stun him.

If he's revving his chainsaw while I'm standing next to a pallet what would I be doing? I'd be camping the pallet like an idiot. 

You don't have to explicitly say something to say it. And if you bothered to read my other comment you'd see I'm clearly talking about those moments where your only option to avoid being downed is dropping the pallet.
                                    Yeah and if you're in that situation you can time it well and still stun him. And even if there was no way to stop him getting you there, wouldn't that be ok for a purple add-on? It's not like every Billy is running lopro chains because it's so op
                                    How often are these moments for you? I very rarely get into scenarios on the pallet where I need to drop it. (Not to say I'm a god and never get outplayed, I mean scenarios in the sense of "if Billy had this add-on then I'd certainly get hit after dropping the pallet")

Charging the chainsaw takes so long and makes you move so much slower, you almost always have enough time to move out of the way before he can chainsaw through the pallet. And for those few times where it actually does happen, is it really that bad for a purple add-on that no one runs to actually be useful?
                                    If your only option is to drop the pallet, then you can stun him with that pallet. That is ALWAYS an option when throwing a pallet. It's up to you to time it right though. If you don't time it right and he downs you well then he outplayed you by getting you into a situation where 1) you're already injured, 2) you were forced to drop the pallet, 3) you mis-timed the pallet drop, and 4) he used a very niche addon to get a single health state on a survivor in this exact situation. I said niche, but of course you still think OP.
                    drop a pallet and keep going. or drop a pallet and wait for either revving or the breaking sound
                        Why is everyone assuming I'm camping pallets? You've never had those close calls where your only option is to drop the pallet to avoid getting hit with the chainsaw?
    Ye, I just felt old seing that video.
    The add-on has the downside that if you chainsaw someone after breaking a pallet/door (in the same sprint), it only does one health-state of damage.
I love how the chainsaw cools down even though he‚Äôs still using it. TIL
    I think that's just a visual bug. It should hit max heat and only go down when you stop sprinting.
There‚Äôs no way I could do this (PS4) I run into everything lol
    Lol a lot of PC players can‚Äôt do this either.
        They probably haven't bound q and e to turn. But of course this is hard it took him a few hours.
    Hillbilly is not that hard to control on PS4, especially with maneuvering around the map like this.

Edit: Source I have hundreds of hours of Billy on PS4 and could do what Otz just did. The hard part is figuring out the path, remembering exactly what to do after each pallet, and dealing with the weird movement during the pallet breaking. I watched the entire stream and Otz was practicing his pathing with the pallets up with ease because not pallet breaking jank, and it would be just as easy with a controller.
        Yeah I don‚Äôt think pathing is too hard as Billy on controller, my issue is when I‚Äôm right up against a survivor and they‚Äôre spinning around to avoid my chainsaw. Sometimes I can‚Äôt move the joystick fast enough to keep up with them and I miss my chainsaw
            I agree that this is definitely the hardest part! I have my sensitivity either maxed out or at least very high to help account for this. But then there's the framerate issues which make it harder to react since survivors do mini teleports from side to side.  

The only things you can do is to get very used to "99ing" your chainsaw so you can dully charge it the second you have them locked on. Or you can try what Otz does - he keeps his eye on the charge bar while the corner of his eye is looking at the survivor. It makes it easier to hold it at "99", and then when you see an opportunity to hit the survivor you go for it. Regardless it's not easy.
        I don't know why you're getting downvoted lol
            Who knows lol. I used to traverse the map multiple times weaving in and out of stuff as a console Billy, but maybe people don't want to believe it's possible. After I learned how to space Billy, I learned that anything is possible though.
                Well DBD and R6 players are known to give so much shit and make fun of the console side of the playerbase so there's that
                    Most likely. I'm way better than most PC players (at DBD) so it's funny to me when they think console players can't do anything.
                        COnSolE pLaYeRs Be LiKe. But fr though I play crossplay and there are tons of both trash console and trash pc players (same with seeing good players on both side), but it annoys me when streamers/players will crap on console players specifically like bruh.
                            I'm sure on average console players aren't as good. It is harder to control, especially certain killers like Nurse, Blight, Deathslinger, Huntress, etc. But a lot of streamers defend console players too which is cool. In the end, just like you said,  there's both good and bad players on both platforms.
u/Otzdarva Could You tell me why the counter didn't go up while breaking "5th" pallet at 0:21 in the video?
    Ooops.

Just me or when i play this map it feels like there are 5 more?
    Am survivor main and 11 pallets seems about right
        Ik i was joking cause there is something about this map that makes it feel like there are way more
Ahh yes, just before his controversial opinion
    [deleted]
        What?
    what was it?
        "I think music these days is not as good as it used to be"

*immediately ends stream*
            This is why we love Otz.
    What did he do?
    what did he say?
    Got a link to the vod?
You are truly more than the mortal man!
Making all 4 survivors dc in one match speed run (WORLD RECORD)
The Chasaw just reset its heat tf
    I‚Äôm confused about that too, even before that how did it last that long?
        It cant overheat you while using it, just while charging it
            TIL
            r/ihadastroke
        I've only played Hillbilly once so I can only assume there's a perk or item that makes it last forever and tear through pallets and survivors like tissue paper, of course.
            No someone else explained it above it can‚Äôt overheat if it‚Äôs in motion, he was using an addon to go through pallets and his second one was to help steering
Oh yeah? Do this on The Game, and then give me a call to my personal cell phone.
    He does have a video on his (second) channel where he tries to break every pallet on the map with Wraith.
This is what driving school should be like.

Screw a shift-stick, drift-saw is where it‚Äôs at.
How is there only 11 pallets on this map? There are 11 pallets per corridor downstairs in the new meat plant
    Because this map is garbage.
        The Game is also garbage. 
The fact that 2 god pallets can spawn in several corridors is bullshit
Otz is a perfect blend of the highest level competitive gamer and just a fuck-around memer.
    And dead eyes.
How did the chainsaw not overheat wtf
    [deleted]
        The chainsaw did overheat. Overheating doesnt cancel a sprint though
Otz just successfully did a terrible meme he‚Äôd been joking about doing on stream for a few years. With only seconds remaining his wife said it was the worst thing she‚Äôd ever seen
There‚Äôs only 11? I swear it feels like 100 when I play killer.
    I once had a game as Ghostface where I chased a Nea one gen long around the map. The pallets where litteraly gone in the first two minutes of the game and the survivors had no chance to win after that
        ya but it depends I have had a meg drop EVERY pallet INSTANDLY and then going to the next and they completed all gens before i was done. Like the new game map that has 27 pallets and all are god pallets, and this one has only 12*

*two were counted as one (4 & 5)
        Lol love to see it.
    On Shelter Wood? Really? That map is crazy ridiculously killer sided.
        Maybe I‚Äôm just a pallet magnet.
        It can feel like a lot if there's a bunch of BNPs. Getting 5 out of one chase is a ton, but with a few brand new parts. Especially if it took you a bit to find the first survivor. You could be looking at 2-3 gens popping over a 5 pallet chase relatively easily. And if you see 2-3 gens pop 5 can sometimes feel like 500.
    You're just bad?
        Go fuck yourself.
            No
The pallets and the furious
Who would win? Infinite pallet break Billy, or 1 Yui?
Fun fact, when Billy tried this the first time, the chainsaw got so hot it melted his face into his arm
    so thats why he looks like his face has melten! /s
Early footage of the upcoming Daylight Kart game mode.
wait, since when does billy not have to stop after breaking a pallet with his chainsaw?
    he‚Äôs using Lopro Chains, purple addon
        i see, is it a new or reworked addon? I only use drift billy (speed and turn addons) because its the most fun way to play him
            it was added back when he was reworked in July, replaced one of the chain addons I believe.
                HE got a rework? Man havent touvhed dbd in a long time
                    basically he's still the same except he has a limited meter so you can't charge or rev forever anymore without being put on a cooldown, also he has no charge addons anymore unless you want to move at 110% 4.4 m/s
    He‚Äôs using an add-on (forgot what it‚Äôs called)
    Lopro Chains. It allows you to continue a chainsaw charge after breaking a pallet, but after doing so, the chainsaw's insta-down becomes a normal injure for a short time.
I WAS THERE PogU
Now break every breakable wall in one go
that motor must‚Äôve gotten VERY hot
That was 12 not 11.
No Otz, YOU can break every pallet in the map with one sprint. 

I miss the first one and run into a rock.
Otz is the pallets god worst nightmare
Imagine not otz pulling this off
The man, the myth, the legend himself. I've gone to this man's videos for everything from DBD to learning to stream better. Awesome guy
[deleted]
    That's how it should be, right? When I see someone else said the same thing I was going to say, I just don't post it. Although I did see more than one comment.
        [deleted]
            My main point was the first part, but fair enough.
    ya I saw it too. pallet 4 and 5 are counted as one.
me: ‚Äúoh something intressting being done in dbd, who owns the honor?‚Äù
me: sees otz
me: ‚Äúafcourse its otz...who else?‚Äù

Good job otz! almost as inpressive as winning a chess and dbd match at the same time.
I was in the stream, wondering if he would give up, but I gave up first.

Glad he made it all pay off here and now.

Fucking. Legend.
At 0:22 you missed a pallet in the count
This maneuver will cost us 20 years!
I love you Otz
Give credit to u/otzdarva wtf

Damn some of y‚Äôall can‚Äôt take a joke
    You dropped this, king: /s
        I can‚Äôt believe I actually have to write it lol, was pretty obviously a joke
            Reddit gonna Reddit lol
    Its posted by otz himself
    bruh watch who posted it: Posted by u/Otzdarva
    It‚Äôs himself
Can‚Äôt wait to see someone speedrun this
Fucking. Madman.
Good! Now do that with reworked Game!
song please?
    DJ Fresh - X Project, from the Escape From Planet Monday EP
        Damnit I came here to say this. Instantly recognized this. Loved that album
            Yeah! I first found Fresh on the Breakbeat Kaos mixtapes, it's cool to see all that stuff on spotify.
        thank you so much!
    I need it as well!
only 11 pallets total on this map, but on the game there's 25 pallets and they're all god pallets KEKW
    actually there are twelve. 4 and 5 are counted as one. and the game as at least 25 it has had 27 and they are all very strong indeed.

it is indeed stupid how one map has at least dubble the pallets that are stronger as well.
Now this is real billy content
God bless otz what would we do without him
Imagine the Survivors watching him just sprinting around for three minutes
Is there anything this man cannot do in DbD?
do the game next!
At some point in the future scientists will study NotOtzdarva's brain to try and figure out the secrets to his megamind.
u/_Yeeter_
And in the mean time the survivers got all necessary gens and are out through the exit gate..
lmao the the whole thing is so great. 10/10 meme value
Ok, let's be honest, Otz just somehow discovered a fun new minigame. xD
Imagine running around doing gens then all you see is an adrenaline fueled hillbilly sawing every pallet your rank 20 Dwight threw down
Oof imagine this as a rift mission "Destroy 5 pallets with one chainsaw sprint \*Must complete in one trial\*" Awesome job btw
    If it has to be done in a single sprint there would be no need to add must complete in a single trial
Me:

Oh shit someone posted an otzdarva clip nice

*looks at name*

Oh shit otzdarva according to reddit posted an otzdarva clip
Level 4 Tome Killer challenges be like
How did Otz run chainsaw so long? 

Also I didnt known chainsaws plow through pallets like that!
At least 2 stacks of wood
I like how the pallets get shredded instantly. Barely an animation
That was Amazing otz!!
You always come up with crazy stuff
Lol I can just picture a SWF watching this go down, completely terrified
Why does this remind me of Spyro?ü§î
    Supercharge challenges
that was epic üëç. Subscribed
    you should see the vid where he beats survivors while winning a chess game.
Well damn zanshin actually has a use.
Hello friends, this is Otz, the name that all pallets fear.
Congratulations otz! I had to step away before you finished, but you put so much effort into this!
Now do it on the game
Shelter woods? This is ez. I did this a few times on Hawkins and lampkin lane üòÖ
    Oh wheres your video?
        It was meant sarcastic. It would be difficult to chainsaw through two pallets in a row on these two maps.
Someone:Zanshim tatics is trash
Me, an intellectual:
The KING
Quit the game a while back so out of the loop. Are killers able to run Survivor perks again or something? Cause I swear that's Windows of Opportunity on a Billy.
    It's a perk from The Oni called Zanshin Tactics. It's let's killers see the aura of all pallets and windows within 24 metres. It goes on cool down for 30 seconds after you hit a survivor.
        Oh weird. I was actually still playing when Oni came out but never noticed that as one of his perks. Either I forgot or didn't pay attention. Thank you for answering.
What a goat, love you otz
Hexy needs to find a new game, lol.
    IdentityV baby
Tru3: This doesn‚Äôt count as a win.
Were you using add-ons?
    hillbilly only keeps the sprint after breaking a pallet with an addon (I *think* its the iridescent brick)
        lopro chains
        that‚Äôd be the purple addon, lopro chains

Only 11 pallets?
    Yes, Shelter Woods is a barren wasteland when it comes to structures
[removed]
    It‚Äôs an addon?????? Hillbilly is fine the way he is right now
    He does though he didn‚Äôt deserve that nerf of a rework
Leave it to Otz ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
So why does he get to sprint for almost 2 minutes. Seems way too long for a game mechanic.
    Because sprinting for 2 minutes straight is in no way benefitial to yourself
    He's clearly op. We should nerf him again and send him back to his farm prison
    I believe it‚Äôs and add on that let‚Äôs you keep sprinting after breaking a pallet.
    Have you ever played DBD before?
        Nope, that‚Äôs why I was confused. Weird to comment on a post so long ago.
            What makes that weird?
Imagine thinking this trick could solve pallet looping, by the time your done they are out that gate
    pretty sure he just did it for fun, buzzkillington
        Bruh idk why their comments getting downvotes. How are they a buzz kill? They are literally making a joke, the only buzzkill is y'all not getting a very obvious joke
        I'm not talking about him smartington
            well i don't think a single serious player would ever sincerely try this in game. and if they did and succeeded i would be very afraid of them lol
    No this is the new meta
    Found the negative Nancy
        But they are obviously making a joke and not even being that negative
This happened today. I was excited to watch it live!
Wait why did it just cooldown instead of overheating?
    Maxing out the overheat meter while chainsaw sprinting will not end the sprint, but will render it unable to rev once the sprint ends until it's completely cooled. I assume the "heat" resetting on the saw is a visual bug caused from chainsawing for an extremely long time.
        Thank you, I play Billy enough to know about the overheat but not that it doesn't end a sprint, I just assumed it would end the sprint like it does a rev
Did his chainsaw like overheat while he was sprinting and then start reheating?
Otzdarva you‚Äôre a man‚Äôs man
Oh shit its otz. At least, according to your girlfriend.
New game mode for you, behavior
What the fuck kind of add-ons are those?
I was there for the stream. And then for otz to aubruptly go offline with the chosen music ü§ì
This gave me acual anxiety...
Sick bro
As a billy main, I will vow to destroy all pallets in this way.
Meanwhile, hillbilly‚Äôs chainsaw is fucking melting
Playing DBD as God intended
3 gens later.
How did you not overheat?
    after it over heats you can keep sprinting. after ending the sprint it locks it into cooldown.
        I see. Thanks for the clarification.
This might be a really stupid question but.. Why no overheat? ü§î
    after it over heats you can keep sprinting. after ending the sprint it locks it into cooldown.
I haven't played this game in a while but HOW LONG DOES CHAINSAW LAST
    It will last as long as you don't stop/hit the obstacle which can't be destroyed
If the God Pallet exists Otz is Satan.
Now I want DBD to have mini games like this be put into the game XD
Great now there will be a break all pallet any% speedrun
Ok wtf, since when can billy do this.
This feels illegal.
Wait I thought you'd stop if it overheated?
    if you overheat during your sprint then the overheat will only take effect after the sprint ends
        Oh I see, does it affect the overheat duration if you keep sprinting after the bar is filled? Or does the time stays the same.
            The overheat cooldown will always be the same. Sprinting while it's at 100% will not make the cooldown last any longer
                TY for the explanation, have a nice day
fair and balanced
Wow man, you got some real drifting skills!
Nice job
Only 11 pallets, it feels like there‚Äôs more? üò©
HillBilly racing spin off when??
next they'll nerf billy
LMAO otz u mad, love it
This should speedrunning category
u/Bloodreina2005
When she says she‚Äôs alone at home:
Casate conmigo Otzdarva senpai
Otz you're actually insane.
Wait what about the overheat mechanic why did it get disabled
    It never interrupts a sprint, only prevents you from revving to start a new one
Where is he from?
I watched you for hours yesterday! Good job buddy
TF2 gave us Rocket Jumping
CS Source gave us Surf

Boys we now have Chainsaw Drifting
Totally offtopic: Did any of you see the video where he blindfolded played with Spirit and won?   


I still don't belive that was real.
Why
This needs some DEJA VU
No no no. Otz can. We can‚Äôt.
That‚Äôs Vegas baby
Try doing this on gideon
There‚Äôs way too many pallets in the game
Haven't played dbd in ages, you can now keep running after destroying a pallet with billy?
    i'd guess it's an addon, but who knows
    It's an addon. Trade the ability to basically ignore pallets for only 1 damage chainsaw iirc.
is this a new speedrun category?
Otzdarva is one of my favorite youtubers, and it was actually him i learned abt the new update
Chainsaw was on life support
Yo what song did you use for the background music? I swear it's from my childhood but can't put my finger on it!
Otz you're a fucking legend dude! ü§£
I love his complete focus.
So I take it there‚Äôs 11 pallets in a game
    Depends on map and rng
Me: *breaks a pallet in the Hillbilly head*
The Hillbilly:
Scott Jund clearly already unmasked this streamer as being a robot. There's no more room to hide, 'Not Otzdarva'. You're going to have to face the truth at some point.
Wait I‚Äôve missed something does hillbilly go through pallets now?
    There's an addonnthat lets him smaah through pallets without stopping, but it removes the 1-hit-down
OTZ!!
Fucking legend
Who's gonna tell me how he didn't over heat that whole time tf
How do you have this much mouse control on him? Do you up your mouse sensitivity?
Theres only 11 pallets on that map üò≥
all i wanna know is how his chainsaw lasted so long-
    what do you mean? he didnt hit a wall or survivor.
I was really hoping for some Mario Kart music in the background.
Watched it on stream, it was beautiful
Lol I legit did this by accident once. üòÇüòÇ
The pallets are playing Chainsawed By Daylight. This time the killer got an 11K.
Nothing is impossible for Otz :3
HillbillyTF2
Otz's reaction reminds me of that speedrun guy meme lmao
The mad lad actually fkng did it
no matter how hard it is, Otz will manage to do it!!
But why
is this a mod?
I wonder if the anti pallet wraith is quicker?
Science isn‚Äôt about why, it‚Äôs about why not!
You've heard of Drift King Billy, now get ready for God Emperor Billy
There should be a perk that lets you destroy them while they are up
Imagine patrolling gens this way lmao
Only 11 pallets in that map?
Ummm. Why? ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Billy chainsawKart racing
That's actually quite impressive
I do this all the time in my basement, also what is dead by daylight?
How did it not over heat wtf?
Is this the guy claiming to have 50 wins straight but doesn't pip all of em lmao
u/savevideo
Lmfao i cant even run with the chainsaw for 3 seconds
Pallet number 4 was counted twice
Sadly the hatch was right around the corner AND invisible so Otz unfortunately lost
You can, in fact, .....

let me correct something real quick

YOU WERE
Now try it on auto wreckers
I know this perk is pretty much useless if it is a thing. But how does he see all of the pallets and windows. Like how does otz have windows of opportunity on billy
    It's Zenshin Tactics from the Oni
        What's the point of this perk. Why would a killer need to see windows and pallets. Maybe to get to the pallet before the survivor? Maybe literally only for otz billy vid from the other day?
Love otz lmao
Now try it on rpd
No, no... YOU can, I cannot even turn it on and break one lol
Bruh stop posting Otz clips‚Ä¶ who do you think you are?
DEJA VU!
Lost
    Lost or not 4k?
        *didn‚Äôt get 12 hooks
            *Huuks
                He did that in a custom match....
I just lost the game
    by lost the game i mean literally cant find the dbd icon on my pc anymore
    Same.
    Its been years!!! Why must you do this to me? I was winning! But now I've lost the game...
        Winning the game is accepting the fact that losing is inevitable. It teaches us that even if we lose something, we can still keep going.
    Shit.
    Sunuvabitch
But can you chainsaw through every pallet and end your sprint with a reverse chainsaw into a quentin hiding in the corner?
    Of course he can, that's Otzdarva (or at least his library card says so)
        You can never be too sure, that not Otzdarva guy looks really similar
            Yes, but the other guy is NOT otzdarva. They just happen to be similar. Maybe close relatives?
            Nah, Not Otzdarva killed the real one years ago and took his place.
        According to a peer reviewed study with no citations.
        (And his tinder verified profile)
    I sure hope you can‚Äôt :o
Now do it on Lery‚Äôs. I dare you.
    Do it on the game. The new one
        Yes pls
When is the DS2 All Pallets No Hit Run? Knowing DS2, there are probably 41 pallets.
Is this why you went over your stream schedule XD
you beautiful, beautiful bastard
Oh shit Otz is the OP
I know your lies, that was NotOtzdarva that was controlling the billy! Tell the people the truth!
Otz, I love your videos and the content you make. You literally beat DS2 no hit and there's literally nothing you can't do in any game.
Ok now play a game of wraith without letting survivors vault windows or drop pallets in chase by body blocking them every time. A win scenario is a 4K (or 3k with hatch) and no dropped pallets or vaulted windows in chase.

‚ÄúIn chase‚Äù being defined as ‚Äúwhile actively pursuing a specific survivor while cloaked or uncloaked‚Äù. You can choose to break a chase after a hit by saying ‚Äúbreaking the chase‚Äù then going for another survivor, or pausing for 10 seconds then going after the survivor you hit.

How come the chainsaws cooling reset itself?
I‚Äôm only commenting because of your username. That fucker was hard to beat 1v1.
Oh hai Otz!
Now do it on The Game
Now do the game bottom floor
Haven't played much HB since the rework. How are you not overheating?
You took so long that Billy‚Äôs face started melting lmao
Now you just need to pull it off in a real game.
Callao retrasao üòé
Hello Otz, this is friends!
It's my most hated map. So many bad pallets as well and big open spaces with no where to hide
    They sent all the pallets to the Game map.
    That‚Äôs what bhvr does with reworked maps. Just totally guts them all
        Map was like that anyways tbh
            Yeah, when they announced the rework I was hoping they would add some kind of shelter to *Shelter* Woods, but it was only a graphical update.

In fact, the only change I noticed is that you can't use balanced landing on the giant tree anymore.
                Yeah I was using balanced on this map the other day and I never use balanced so I don‚Äôt really know where I need to go on each map to make it work. Realized there were no hills or anything so I had to settle for the basement which wasn‚Äôt exactly helpful
        Except with The Game. That map is pallet city now lol
            Pallet City, yet they managed to make it equally cancer for both survivors and killers
                How so?
                    As a survivor there can be tons of dead ends if the killer doesn't break any doors.
                        There's a corner of the Game on the top floor where if you get a hook and leave the door blocked it's a ridiculous choke, godly for trapper but even on any killer you can get 2-3 basic attacks in succession
                    All those doors for survivors, and all those pallets for the killer
            And still cancer for survivors and killers alike.
            Always was.
            It was like that even before the rework. It had 20 pallets back then and most of them were very safe
        Shelter woods has been dogshit for survivors since launch. It used to be even worse, but it's improved *slightly* over time.
            It used to hardly have any trees so it was basically a cornfield map without any corn, structure, or pallets
            The reason it's so bad is because there are three jungle gyms, shack and the only other safety net is pallets which is limited, and once they're gone, nearly the entire map becomes unsafe. The entire center of the map is also a dead zone. It's coldwind farm if coldwind farm was mostly dead zones
            That's not at all true. There was a time it was the most pallet dense map in the game. I believe that changed when they reworked pallet distance to remove double pallets.
                You sure you're not confusing this with old-old Autohaven? There was an insane number of tiles with double pallets, ie the entire area around Blood Lodge (aka Pallet Town) was just low-wall tiles with double pallets.  Shelter woods never had that density.

Shelter woods has always been pretty killer-favorable, between a complete lack of infinites, a lack of god-loops and honestly a lack of many good loops and pallets in general.
                    Definitely not. The joke around the time is that the pallets sheltered the survivors.
                        Yeah, no. [Shelter woods has been killer friendly since forever, distinctly because of a lack of pallets and juke spots.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/4udegg/whats_the_worst_map_in_the_game/).  It's always been a miserable map to survive on.
                            Not sure an old reddit thread is a good indicator. Survivors today think the game is a good killer map. There are many videos of 20+ pallet shelter woods.
                                >Not sure an old reddit thread is a good indicator. Survivors today think the game is a good killer map.

I mean, the Game did have a relatively high kill rate prior to the rework.  The update shifted things in survivor's favor for sure.

> There are many videos of 20+ pallet shelter woods.

Yeah, and Autohaven would have had well over 30 pallets in comparison.  We're talking relatively here. Old-old Shelter woods would have been a little more survivor-favorable by today's standards, but it was still really killer-favorable in comparison to the other maps (like Pallet-haven) back then. It's still killer-favorable today.
        It was like that even before the rework.
        I mean, the game has like 24 pallets? Of which like 6-10 are god pallets. They dont always gut them
        *insert Gideon Meat Plant joke here*
        Theres literally double pallets like its 2016 again lmfao
    Worst map I feel a d/c coming on
    I used to hate it from the Nurse's point of view since I was learning Nurse (so I was by no means good, key word "learning") and this map has tons of LoS breakers.
This map either has 5 jungle gyms or 4 TL‚Äôs and a C wall pallets with a few rock loops and huge deadzones. The RNG is fucking crazy on shelter woods.
    I swear if someone loops for 2 minutes using 3 pallets they render half the map unplayable. It‚Äôs so bad I wish it just got removed because the entire map is 1 big donut with a void in the middle
        Except the map is so big that a killer can't even pressure the other half of the map. Getting a somewhat decent 3gen is very difficult without some form of good mobility.
            What? I didnt think Shelter Woods was actually that big.
                It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs basically 3 rings Inner ring is a dead zone. Middle ring is half deadzone half tiles. Outer circle is just empty.  

it‚Äôs a shame cus the tree honestly looks so cool but the only reason to go near it as survivor is when your team used all 4 pallets on the map and now holding W is the most effective ‚Äúloop‚Äù
                    [deleted]
                        I'm talking about the playable region of the map, most of the map is a dead zone, making it very very killer sided, the middle of the map is mostly a killer free zone for mobility and the outskirts are pretty empty too.
            This is not true at all. Regardless, even if it was big I'd much rather have windows and pallets than map size. The map is terribly designed at the moment.
                It's literally the second largest map...
            Only actual size is big. Since there is nothing on the edges of the map, unlike Rotten Fields, it is easy for killer to pressure the map.
            It's not that big. It's very open too. You can see survivors from any point in the map and it has a ton of mobility. No middle gen means you can easily get gen trapped. It even has no pallets.
    I'd be ecstatic to get 4 L-T walls. Sometimes all you get on that map are shitty pallet gyms

The best part is...they just reworked this map. 

Imagine being back in high school.  You‚Äôre teacher gives you your project back with an opportunity to get a higher grade.  You redo the entire look of it, and it just looks a lot different.  Not necessarily ‚Äúbetter‚Äù but it at least looks like it‚Äôs made with higher quality parts.  However, you somehow failed the crux of the redo.  Your teacher stares at you blankly; thinks many, many things about you.  But in the end, hands you back your project, passes you, and then tells you they are eagerly awaiting your next project.  

This is us and bhvr folks
    Honestly I feel most of the reworks have been for the worse, especially the fucking breakable wall spam. The new The Game is one of the worst examples IMO. Probably the only rework I actually like is Ormond because it at least feels smaller compared to the near impossibility of killer there before.
Ahhh... Shelter Woods.
Gideon meat plant stole all of mac millin estates pallets
The attempt before this one had 8.
Only? That's a high number for Shelter Woods. Once had one half of the map be nothing but LT loops and the other had another one or two as well.
haha ‚Äústunned‚Äù, I see what you did there
On our first attempt we were lucky, only 8 pallets spawned
Attempt before this one the map had 8.
    Yep! üòÇ Our first Shelter Woods had only 8.
        Love you otz, this was such a fun idea and I love that it just came from the chat. Had a blast watching you figure this out!
The minimum amount of pallets on every map is 8
    coldwind house map?
actually there are 12. number 4 is counted dubble.
Are*

And yeah that map is so killer friendly
    Yes and no even though it is low in resources it is a gaint map. Which is  always bad for killer.  It depends on what the pallets spawn next two. I have seen 5 jungle gyms and I have seen versions with all l wall t walls. It also depends what your teammates do with the resources they are given. If you have a teamate that runs and camps pallets it's. GG
        Not really. Despite being one of the biggest maps in the game, there is almost nothing around the edges and the center of the map, unlike Rotten Fields or Swamp maps, which makes it easy for killer to pressure as there is no reason to patrol nearly half of the map. Even Otz talked about it in his map tier list.
            Nothing to patrol except the gens that are on different sides of the map.......
                That's... every map in a nutshell. Like I said, there is no gens and good tiles on the edges of the map and depending on RNG, a generator will or won't be spawned in the middle, making patrolling nearly half of the map pointless. Since survivors don't have gens to repair and tiles to run in those places, killers have no reason patrol and survivors have no reason to take a chase there, making actual playing area so small.

For comparision, take Coal Tower. The map's actual size is much smaller but since the edge's of the map have stuff for players to interact with, making actual playable area nearly equal to Shelter Wood's.
                    It's not just every map it's the secound largest map in the game. Which if your three gen gets busted your prob done.  And the point about nothing on the outside I discussed by saying I have seen 5 jungle gyms  with rock loops, and pallet gyms connecting them. That certainly is not nothing. Even though I have also seen is spawn with basically nothing, got love a game with this much rng. Lol The middle is definitely a dead zone though. Im not saying the map is survior sided I'm saying you can beat good killers by doing the right gens. Just cause of the size of the map. I think it should be smaller and have a few more loops personally.
                        Aside from our traditional shack, there are 2 tiles* on one side of the shack, 2 tiles* on other side, 1 tile* on the side that is far from shack with some shitty rock loops and huge deadzones in the middle and the side that is near shack side. That's only 5 tiles at max that barely connect to each other. I think loop count is fine in general. The problem is there is nothing in most of the map and most loops can't be connected.

Like I said 2 times previously, the map's playable area is smaller than actual size. Survivor or killer, people have no reason to use the half of the map. Like, it shouldn't take you so long to patrol the map. Survivors don't have anything to do in edges or center. 

*Tiles can be TL Walls, Jungle Gyms and Pallet Gyms.
                    Just seen the secound part. I'd rather have things that lead to killer survior Interaction then me taking my ass across the map and it taking 30 secounds or surviors just dieing cause a Meg throw all the pallets.
        I think the middle of the nap is pretty barren. If survivors are caught anywhere around there then there isn‚Äôt much to work with. Also helps that the map is pretty small
            At least they added a pallet to the middle of the map. It used to be even more empty.
            Its actually one of the bigger maps it's bigger then haddonfield
                Oh seriously? It feels so small. Maybe because of all the open space, especially around the edges
                    Yeah a  lot of the gens are around the outside of the map so if everyone splits up and you guys do not three gen it's hard to win on without slowdown. But once shit gone it goes very much in the favor of the killer, but if the gens are on opposite side of the map no way killer can defend them all.
                        Why does this sub downvote so much lol

If it‚Äôs not a corny joke or a ‚Äúwholesome‚Äù thing then i see downvotes/insults for no reason
    No, "is" is the correct word to use in that sentence.

The "is" in the sentence is not referring to the boxes, it is referring to the unwritten fact that presently there are 11 things existing. Thus, "how the hell is there only 11 pallets on the map" is correct.
        ‚Äúis‚Äù corresponds to ‚Äúamount‚Äù, which is singular (though it should really be ‚Äúnumber‚Äù because pallets are countable).
            But it doesnt matter if it corresponds to amount. Because "is" in the sentence isnt referencing the boxes. It is referring to the state of existence of the boxes. It is a question asking "How IS there 20 things there?" You are asking how the things exist, not stating that there are 20 things there.
                This does not sound right to me, but I'm not English major.
                    Let me explain a different way. The OP was asking how we are in a reality where there are 11 pallets. It is because the order of the words is "how the hell is this (a thing)" rather than "there are (X things)." It is a question about the existence of a thing rather than the number of things so "is" refers to the situation or reality rather than the items themselves.

        You‚Äôd say ‚Äúthe pallets are‚Äù not ‚Äúthe pallets is‚Äù

You‚Äôd say ‚Äúthere are pallets‚Äù not ‚Äúthere is pallets‚Äù
            [removed]
                > please, stfu, you are making yourself look stupid. 

I'm a native English speaker and "How are there only 11 pallets on this map" sounds absolutely right to me. This stuff really can be confusing and particular.

Also I don't see how "the map still has those 11 pallets" is relevant, since the issue is plural vs singular and both "is" and "are" are present tense.
        Okay dude, explain me the rule for it. Read through this and the other thread, didnt explain much about it
    F
Dude he has probably 5k hrs killing survivors every match does get boring I guess
Wait till you hear what he did in dark souls 2
    [deleted]
        Yes. He has the moves
Same. I‚Äôm now rich in strange fruits though!
    Hell yeah, believers prosper.
    I was away from my computer when that happened and did not get in on it. I am super upset since I was there for the entire 9 hours XD
He is the guy that beat Dark Souls (on stream!) in a hitless run after a million attempts. This guy is fucked.
I hope so.

Why the hell can he now keep going after breaking a pallet? What did I miss?
    It's an addon and it makes it so your chainsaw only does 1 health state of damage after going through a pallet.
    I was thinking the same thing but apparently it‚Äôs just an add on.
Nice , 69 upvotes
There is indeed 12 pallets!
Its an addon.
    what‚Äôs it called?
        Lopro Chains
        LoPro chains is a purple addon for billy that allows him to continue chainsaw sprinting through pallets but if you hit a survivor within 5 seconds they only take 1 health state of damage, not insta-down
            That still sounds like a *really* good Billy addon.

I don't know. Haven't played Billy. Can't freaking stand Billy.
There is a punishment, instead of insta down after pallet break, you get a normal injure.
    So when someone's injured their only hope is a window? That's God awful.
        no? Just don't stand behind a pallet when you see Billy charging his saw.
        No, just don't stand near the pallet when you see billy revving
            Gosh, why didn't I think of that?! Sometimes the only thing you can do to avoid a Billy or Bubba is drop a pallet and find a safer location. If he's not stopping you're just screwed.
                nah, the addon isn't strong
                But he can no longer one shot with his chainsaw. You no longer have any need to fear the saw so you don't have to predrop a pallet. All of Billy's chases are going to last way longer because you have to either M1 twice or saw twice. Add on is kind of a meme
                    It only does less damage if he breaks a pallet, if you don't drop the pallet and end up getting sawed because of that you're gonna be insta downed
                        Oh i didn't realize it got changed recently. Damn it actually kinda useful now
                            IIRC, it got changed immediately when it hit the live servers. It was only different during the PTB (where Lopro Chains were also Ultra Rare instead of Very Rare).
                        The damage debuff also only lasts a short time, so if you get chainsawed from 20 feet away after he breaks the pallet, you're still going down.
                    Now that I'm thinking about it yeah, it does seem terrible since you lose your instadown. Also because only a good Billy can effectively uses his chainsaw well enough to get you into those terrible situations.
                You should almost never just stand behind a pallet. Just drop the pallet and run away. If he's literally revving his chainsaw waiting for you to throw the pallet, then either don't throw the pallet so you can continue the loop or stun him. There are many counterplay options if you're good at the game.
                    https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/lzi31m/you_can_in_fact_break_every_pallet_in_the_map/gq2vere?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3

Yall are just playing stupid at this point.
                        Like I said in my post, you can pallet stun the Billy. I didn't assume you were camping the pallet, but I laid out the scenario as well as your good options and bad options.  

Did you even read my post or did you just call stupid the second you realized I didn't agree with you?
                            >Just drop the pallet and run away.

And if I didn't drop the pallet and run away what would I be doing? I'd be camping the pallet like an idiot. 

>If he's literally revving his chainsaw waiting for you to throw the pallet, then either don't throw the pallet so you can continue the loop or stun him.

If he's revving his chainsaw while I'm standing next to a pallet what would I be doing? I'd be camping the pallet like an idiot. 

You don't have to explicitly say something to say it. And if you bothered to read my other comment you'd see I'm clearly talking about those moments where your only option to avoid being downed is dropping the pallet.
                                Yeah and if you're in that situation you can time it well and still stun him. And even if there was no way to stop him getting you there, wouldn't that be ok for a purple add-on? It's not like every Billy is running lopro chains because it's so op
                                How often are these moments for you? I very rarely get into scenarios on the pallet where I need to drop it. (Not to say I'm a god and never get outplayed, I mean scenarios in the sense of "if Billy had this add-on then I'd certainly get hit after dropping the pallet")

Charging the chainsaw takes so long and makes you move so much slower, you almost always have enough time to move out of the way before he can chainsaw through the pallet. And for those few times where it actually does happen, is it really that bad for a purple add-on that no one runs to actually be useful?
                                If your only option is to drop the pallet, then you can stun him with that pallet. That is ALWAYS an option when throwing a pallet. It's up to you to time it right though. If you don't time it right and he downs you well then he outplayed you by getting you into a situation where 1) you're already injured, 2) you were forced to drop the pallet, 3) you mis-timed the pallet drop, and 4) he used a very niche addon to get a single health state on a survivor in this exact situation. I said niche, but of course you still think OP.
                drop a pallet and keep going. or drop a pallet and wait for either revving or the breaking sound
                    Why is everyone assuming I'm camping pallets? You've never had those close calls where your only option is to drop the pallet to avoid getting hit with the chainsaw?
Ye, I just felt old seing that video.
The add-on has the downside that if you chainsaw someone after breaking a pallet/door (in the same sprint), it only does one health-state of damage.
I think that's just a visual bug. It should hit max heat and only go down when you stop sprinting.
Lol a lot of PC players can‚Äôt do this either.
    They probably haven't bound q and e to turn. But of course this is hard it took him a few hours.
Hillbilly is not that hard to control on PS4, especially with maneuvering around the map like this.

Edit: Source I have hundreds of hours of Billy on PS4 and could do what Otz just did. The hard part is figuring out the path, remembering exactly what to do after each pallet, and dealing with the weird movement during the pallet breaking. I watched the entire stream and Otz was practicing his pathing with the pallets up with ease because not pallet breaking jank, and it would be just as easy with a controller.
    Yeah I don‚Äôt think pathing is too hard as Billy on controller, my issue is when I‚Äôm right up against a survivor and they‚Äôre spinning around to avoid my chainsaw. Sometimes I can‚Äôt move the joystick fast enough to keep up with them and I miss my chainsaw
        I agree that this is definitely the hardest part! I have my sensitivity either maxed out or at least very high to help account for this. But then there's the framerate issues which make it harder to react since survivors do mini teleports from side to side.  

The only things you can do is to get very used to "99ing" your chainsaw so you can dully charge it the second you have them locked on. Or you can try what Otz does - he keeps his eye on the charge bar while the corner of his eye is looking at the survivor. It makes it easier to hold it at "99", and then when you see an opportunity to hit the survivor you go for it. Regardless it's not easy.
    I don't know why you're getting downvoted lol
        Who knows lol. I used to traverse the map multiple times weaving in and out of stuff as a console Billy, but maybe people don't want to believe it's possible. After I learned how to space Billy, I learned that anything is possible though.
            Well DBD and R6 players are known to give so much shit and make fun of the console side of the playerbase so there's that
                Most likely. I'm way better than most PC players (at DBD) so it's funny to me when they think console players can't do anything.
                    COnSolE pLaYeRs Be LiKe. But fr though I play crossplay and there are tons of both trash console and trash pc players (same with seeing good players on both side), but it annoys me when streamers/players will crap on console players specifically like bruh.
                        I'm sure on average console players aren't as good. It is harder to control, especially certain killers like Nurse, Blight, Deathslinger, Huntress, etc. But a lot of streamers defend console players too which is cool. In the end, just like you said,  there's both good and bad players on both platforms.
Ooops.
Am survivor main and 11 pallets seems about right
    Ik i was joking cause there is something about this map that makes it feel like there are way more
[deleted]
    What?
what was it?
    "I think music these days is not as good as it used to be"

*immediately ends stream*
        This is why we love Otz.
What did he do?
what did he say?
Got a link to the vod?
I‚Äôm confused about that too, even before that how did it last that long?
    It cant overheat you while using it, just while charging it
        TIL
        r/ihadastroke
    I've only played Hillbilly once so I can only assume there's a perk or item that makes it last forever and tear through pallets and survivors like tissue paper, of course.
        No someone else explained it above it can‚Äôt overheat if it‚Äôs in motion, he was using an addon to go through pallets and his second one was to help steering
He does have a video on his (second) channel where he tries to break every pallet on the map with Wraith.
Because this map is garbage.
    The Game is also garbage. 
The fact that 2 god pallets can spawn in several corridors is bullshit
And dead eyes.
[deleted]
    The chainsaw did overheat. Overheating doesnt cancel a sprint though
I once had a game as Ghostface where I chased a Nea one gen long around the map. The pallets where litteraly gone in the first two minutes of the game and the survivors had no chance to win after that
    ya but it depends I have had a meg drop EVERY pallet INSTANDLY and then going to the next and they completed all gens before i was done. Like the new game map that has 27 pallets and all are god pallets, and this one has only 12*

*two were counted as one (4 & 5)
    Lol love to see it.
On Shelter Wood? Really? That map is crazy ridiculously killer sided.
    Maybe I‚Äôm just a pallet magnet.
    It can feel like a lot if there's a bunch of BNPs. Getting 5 out of one chase is a ton, but with a few brand new parts. Especially if it took you a bit to find the first survivor. You could be looking at 2-3 gens popping over a 5 pallet chase relatively easily. And if you see 2-3 gens pop 5 can sometimes feel like 500.
You're just bad?
    Go fuck yourself.
        No
so thats why he looks like his face has melten! /s
he‚Äôs using Lopro Chains, purple addon
    i see, is it a new or reworked addon? I only use drift billy (speed and turn addons) because its the most fun way to play him
        it was added back when he was reworked in July, replaced one of the chain addons I believe.
            HE got a rework? Man havent touvhed dbd in a long time
                basically he's still the same except he has a limited meter so you can't charge or rev forever anymore without being put on a cooldown, also he has no charge addons anymore unless you want to move at 110% 4.4 m/s
He‚Äôs using an add-on (forgot what it‚Äôs called)
Lopro Chains. It allows you to continue a chainsaw charge after breaking a pallet, but after doing so, the chainsaw's insta-down becomes a normal injure for a short time.
That's how it should be, right? When I see someone else said the same thing I was going to say, I just don't post it. Although I did see more than one comment.
    [deleted]
        My main point was the first part, but fair enough.
ya I saw it too. pallet 4 and 5 are counted as one.
You dropped this, king: /s
    I can‚Äôt believe I actually have to write it lol, was pretty obviously a joke
        Reddit gonna Reddit lol
Its posted by otz himself
bruh watch who posted it: Posted by u/Otzdarva
It‚Äôs himself
DJ Fresh - X Project, from the Escape From Planet Monday EP
    Damnit I came here to say this. Instantly recognized this. Loved that album
        Yeah! I first found Fresh on the Breakbeat Kaos mixtapes, it's cool to see all that stuff on spotify.
    thank you so much!
I need it as well!
actually there are twelve. 4 and 5 are counted as one. and the game as at least 25 it has had 27 and they are all very strong indeed.

it is indeed stupid how one map has at least dubble the pallets that are stronger as well.
If it has to be done in a single sprint there would be no need to add must complete in a single trial
Supercharge challenges
you should see the vid where he beats survivors while winning a chess game.
Oh wheres your video?
    It was meant sarcastic. It would be difficult to chainsaw through two pallets in a row on these two maps.
It's a perk from The Oni called Zanshin Tactics. It's let's killers see the aura of all pallets and windows within 24 metres. It goes on cool down for 30 seconds after you hit a survivor.
    Oh weird. I was actually still playing when Oni came out but never noticed that as one of his perks. Either I forgot or didn't pay attention. Thank you for answering.
IdentityV baby
hillbilly only keeps the sprint after breaking a pallet with an addon (I *think* its the iridescent brick)
    lopro chains
    that‚Äôd be the purple addon, lopro chains

Yes, Shelter Woods is a barren wasteland when it comes to structures
It‚Äôs an addon?????? Hillbilly is fine the way he is right now
He does though he didn‚Äôt deserve that nerf of a rework
Because sprinting for 2 minutes straight is in no way benefitial to yourself
He's clearly op. We should nerf him again and send him back to his farm prison
I believe it‚Äôs and add on that let‚Äôs you keep sprinting after breaking a pallet.
Have you ever played DBD before?
    Nope, that‚Äôs why I was confused. Weird to comment on a post so long ago.
        What makes that weird?
pretty sure he just did it for fun, buzzkillington
    Bruh idk why their comments getting downvotes. How are they a buzz kill? They are literally making a joke, the only buzzkill is y'all not getting a very obvious joke
    I'm not talking about him smartington
        well i don't think a single serious player would ever sincerely try this in game. and if they did and succeeded i would be very afraid of them lol
No this is the new meta
Found the negative Nancy
    But they are obviously making a joke and not even being that negative
Maxing out the overheat meter while chainsaw sprinting will not end the sprint, but will render it unable to rev once the sprint ends until it's completely cooled. I assume the "heat" resetting on the saw is a visual bug caused from chainsawing for an extremely long time.
    Thank you, I play Billy enough to know about the overheat but not that it doesn't end a sprint, I just assumed it would end the sprint like it does a rev
after it over heats you can keep sprinting. after ending the sprint it locks it into cooldown.
    I see. Thanks for the clarification.
after it over heats you can keep sprinting. after ending the sprint it locks it into cooldown.
It will last as long as you don't stop/hit the obstacle which can't be destroyed
if you overheat during your sprint then the overheat will only take effect after the sprint ends
    Oh I see, does it affect the overheat duration if you keep sprinting after the bar is filled? Or does the time stays the same.
        The overheat cooldown will always be the same. Sprinting while it's at 100% will not make the cooldown last any longer
            TY for the explanation, have a nice day
It never interrupts a sprint, only prevents you from revving to start a new one
i'd guess it's an addon, but who knows
It's an addon. Trade the ability to basically ignore pallets for only 1 damage chainsaw iirc.
Depends on map and rng
There's an addonnthat lets him smaah through pallets without stopping, but it removes the 1-hit-down
what do you mean? he didnt hit a wall or survivor.
It's Zenshin Tactics from the Oni
    What's the point of this perk. Why would a killer need to see windows and pallets. Maybe to get to the pallet before the survivor? Maybe literally only for otz billy vid from the other day?
Lost or not 4k?
    *didn‚Äôt get 12 hooks
        *Huuks
            He did that in a custom match....
by lost the game i mean literally cant find the dbd icon on my pc anymore
Same.
Its been years!!! Why must you do this to me? I was winning! But now I've lost the game...
    Winning the game is accepting the fact that losing is inevitable. It teaches us that even if we lose something, we can still keep going.
Shit.
Sunuvabitch
Of course he can, that's Otzdarva (or at least his library card says so)
    You can never be too sure, that not Otzdarva guy looks really similar
        Yes, but the other guy is NOT otzdarva. They just happen to be similar. Maybe close relatives?
        Nah, Not Otzdarva killed the real one years ago and took his place.

Obvious troll is obvious

        u/Bipolar-Gamer , he's one of the most talented DBD players. That's why I'm saying you're a troll.
They sent all the pallets to the Game map.
That‚Äôs what bhvr does with reworked maps. Just totally guts them all
    Map was like that anyways tbh
        Yeah, when they announced the rework I was hoping they would add some kind of shelter to *Shelter* Woods, but it was only a graphical update.

In fact, the only change I noticed is that you can't use balanced landing on the giant tree anymore.
            Yeah I was using balanced on this map the other day and I never use balanced so I don‚Äôt really know where I need to go on each map to make it work. Realized there were no hills or anything so I had to settle for the basement which wasn‚Äôt exactly helpful
    Except with The Game. That map is pallet city now lol
        Pallet City, yet they managed to make it equally cancer for both survivors and killers
            How so?
                As a survivor there can be tons of dead ends if the killer doesn't break any doors.
                    There's a corner of the Game on the top floor where if you get a hook and leave the door blocked it's a ridiculous choke, godly for trapper but even on any killer you can get 2-3 basic attacks in succession
                All those doors for survivors, and all those pallets for the killer
        And still cancer for survivors and killers alike.
        Always was.
        It was like that even before the rework. It had 20 pallets back then and most of them were very safe
    Shelter woods has been dogshit for survivors since launch. It used to be even worse, but it's improved *slightly* over time.
        It used to hardly have any trees so it was basically a cornfield map without any corn, structure, or pallets
        The reason it's so bad is because there are three jungle gyms, shack and the only other safety net is pallets which is limited, and once they're gone, nearly the entire map becomes unsafe. The entire center of the map is also a dead zone. It's coldwind farm if coldwind farm was mostly dead zones
        That's not at all true. There was a time it was the most pallet dense map in the game. I believe that changed when they reworked pallet distance to remove double pallets.
            You sure you're not confusing this with old-old Autohaven? There was an insane number of tiles with double pallets, ie the entire area around Blood Lodge (aka Pallet Town) was just low-wall tiles with double pallets.  Shelter woods never had that density.

Shelter woods has always been pretty killer-favorable, between a complete lack of infinites, a lack of god-loops and honestly a lack of many good loops and pallets in general.
                Definitely not. The joke around the time is that the pallets sheltered the survivors.
                    Yeah, no. [Shelter woods has been killer friendly since forever, distinctly because of a lack of pallets and juke spots.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/4udegg/whats_the_worst_map_in_the_game/).  It's always been a miserable map to survive on.
                        Not sure an old reddit thread is a good indicator. Survivors today think the game is a good killer map. There are many videos of 20+ pallet shelter woods.
                            >Not sure an old reddit thread is a good indicator. Survivors today think the game is a good killer map.

I mean, the Game did have a relatively high kill rate prior to the rework.  The update shifted things in survivor's favor for sure.

> There are many videos of 20+ pallet shelter woods.

Yeah, and Autohaven would have had well over 30 pallets in comparison.  We're talking relatively here. Old-old Shelter woods would have been a little more survivor-favorable by today's standards, but it was still really killer-favorable in comparison to the other maps (like Pallet-haven) back then. It's still killer-favorable today.
    It was like that even before the rework.
    I mean, the game has like 24 pallets? Of which like 6-10 are god pallets. They dont always gut them
    *insert Gideon Meat Plant joke here*
    Theres literally double pallets like its 2016 again lmfao
Worst map I feel a d/c coming on
I used to hate it from the Nurse's point of view since I was learning Nurse (so I was by no means good, key word "learning") and this map has tons of LoS breakers.
I swear if someone loops for 2 minutes using 3 pallets they render half the map unplayable. It‚Äôs so bad I wish it just got removed because the entire map is 1 big donut with a void in the middle
    Except the map is so big that a killer can't even pressure the other half of the map. Getting a somewhat decent 3gen is very difficult without some form of good mobility.
        What? I didnt think Shelter Woods was actually that big.
            It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs basically 3 rings Inner ring is a dead zone. Middle ring is half deadzone half tiles. Outer circle is just empty.  

it‚Äôs a shame cus the tree honestly looks so cool but the only reason to go near it as survivor is when your team used all 4 pallets on the map and now holding W is the most effective ‚Äúloop‚Äù
                [deleted]
                    I'm talking about the playable region of the map, most of the map is a dead zone, making it very very killer sided, the middle of the map is mostly a killer free zone for mobility and the outskirts are pretty empty too.
        This is not true at all. Regardless, even if it was big I'd much rather have windows and pallets than map size. The map is terribly designed at the moment.
            It's literally the second largest map...
        Only actual size is big. Since there is nothing on the edges of the map, unlike Rotten Fields, it is easy for killer to pressure the map.
        It's not that big. It's very open too. You can see survivors from any point in the map and it has a ton of mobility. No middle gen means you can easily get gen trapped. It even has no pallets.
I'd be ecstatic to get 4 L-T walls. Sometimes all you get on that map are shitty pallet gyms
Honestly I feel most of the reworks have been for the worse, especially the fucking breakable wall spam. The new The Game is one of the worst examples IMO. Probably the only rework I actually like is Ormond because it at least feels smaller compared to the near impossibility of killer there before.
Yep! üòÇ Our first Shelter Woods had only 8.
    Love you otz, this was such a fun idea and I love that it just came from the chat. Had a blast watching you figure this out!
coldwind house map?
Yes and no even though it is low in resources it is a gaint map. Which is  always bad for killer.  It depends on what the pallets spawn next two. I have seen 5 jungle gyms and I have seen versions with all l wall t walls. It also depends what your teammates do with the resources they are given. If you have a teamate that runs and camps pallets it's. GG
    Not really. Despite being one of the biggest maps in the game, there is almost nothing around the edges and the center of the map, unlike Rotten Fields or Swamp maps, which makes it easy for killer to pressure as there is no reason to patrol nearly half of the map. Even Otz talked about it in his map tier list.
        Nothing to patrol except the gens that are on different sides of the map.......
            That's... every map in a nutshell. Like I said, there is no gens and good tiles on the edges of the map and depending on RNG, a generator will or won't be spawned in the middle, making patrolling nearly half of the map pointless. Since survivors don't have gens to repair and tiles to run in those places, killers have no reason patrol and survivors have no reason to take a chase there, making actual playing area so small.

For comparision, take Coal Tower. The map's actual size is much smaller but since the edge's of the map have stuff for players to interact with, making actual playable area nearly equal to Shelter Wood's.
                It's not just every map it's the secound largest map in the game. Which if your three gen gets busted your prob done.  And the point about nothing on the outside I discussed by saying I have seen 5 jungle gyms  with rock loops, and pallet gyms connecting them. That certainly is not nothing. Even though I have also seen is spawn with basically nothing, got love a game with this much rng. Lol The middle is definitely a dead zone though. Im not saying the map is survior sided I'm saying you can beat good killers by doing the right gens. Just cause of the size of the map. I think it should be smaller and have a few more loops personally.
                    Aside from our traditional shack, there are 2 tiles* on one side of the shack, 2 tiles* on other side, 1 tile* on the side that is far from shack with some shitty rock loops and huge deadzones in the middle and the side that is near shack side. That's only 5 tiles at max that barely connect to each other. I think loop count is fine in general. The problem is there is nothing in most of the map and most loops can't be connected.

Like I said 2 times previously, the map's playable area is smaller than actual size. Survivor or killer, people have no reason to use the half of the map. Like, it shouldn't take you so long to patrol the map. Survivors don't have anything to do in edges or center. 

*Tiles can be TL Walls, Jungle Gyms and Pallet Gyms.
                Just seen the secound part. I'd rather have things that lead to killer survior Interaction then me taking my ass across the map and it taking 30 secounds or surviors just dieing cause a Meg throw all the pallets.
    I think the middle of the nap is pretty barren. If survivors are caught anywhere around there then there isn‚Äôt much to work with. Also helps that the map is pretty small
        At least they added a pallet to the middle of the map. It used to be even more empty.
        Its actually one of the bigger maps it's bigger then haddonfield
            Oh seriously? It feels so small. Maybe because of all the open space, especially around the edges
                Yeah a  lot of the gens are around the outside of the map so if everyone splits up and you guys do not three gen it's hard to win on without slowdown. But once shit gone it goes very much in the favor of the killer, but if the gens are on opposite side of the map no way killer can defend them all.
                    Why does this sub downvote so much lol

If it‚Äôs not a corny joke or a ‚Äúwholesome‚Äù thing then i see downvotes/insults for no reason
No, "is" is the correct word to use in that sentence.

The "is" in the sentence is not referring to the boxes, it is referring to the unwritten fact that presently there are 11 things existing. Thus, "how the hell is there only 11 pallets on the map" is correct.
    ‚Äúis‚Äù corresponds to ‚Äúamount‚Äù, which is singular (though it should really be ‚Äúnumber‚Äù because pallets are countable).
        But it doesnt matter if it corresponds to amount. Because "is" in the sentence isnt referencing the boxes. It is referring to the state of existence of the boxes. It is a question asking "How IS there 20 things there?" You are asking how the things exist, not stating that there are 20 things there.
            This does not sound right to me, but I'm not English major.
                Let me explain a different way. The OP was asking how we are in a reality where there are 11 pallets. It is because the order of the words is "how the hell is this (a thing)" rather than "there are (X things)." It is a question about the existence of a thing rather than the number of things so "is" refers to the situation or reality rather than the items themselves.

    You‚Äôd say ‚Äúthe pallets are‚Äù not ‚Äúthe pallets is‚Äù

You‚Äôd say ‚Äúthere are pallets‚Äù not ‚Äúthere is pallets‚Äù
        [removed]
            > please, stfu, you are making yourself look stupid. 

I'm a native English speaker and "How are there only 11 pallets on this map" sounds absolutely right to me. This stuff really can be confusing and particular.

Also I don't see how "the map still has those 11 pallets" is relevant, since the issue is plural vs singular and both "is" and "are" are present tense.
    Okay dude, explain me the rule for it. Read through this and the other thread, didnt explain much about it

    Yes. He has the moves
Hell yeah, believers prosper.
I was away from my computer when that happened and did not get in on it. I am super upset since I was there for the entire 9 hours XD
It's an addon and it makes it so your chainsaw only does 1 health state of damage after going through a pallet.
I was thinking the same thing but apparently it‚Äôs just an add on.
what‚Äôs it called?
    Lopro Chains
    LoPro chains is a purple addon for billy that allows him to continue chainsaw sprinting through pallets but if you hit a survivor within 5 seconds they only take 1 health state of damage, not insta-down
        That still sounds like a *really* good Billy addon.

I don't know. Haven't played Billy. Can't freaking stand Billy.
So when someone's injured their only hope is a window? That's God awful.
    no? Just don't stand behind a pallet when you see Billy charging his saw.
    No, just don't stand near the pallet when you see billy revving
        Gosh, why didn't I think of that?! Sometimes the only thing you can do to avoid a Billy or Bubba is drop a pallet and find a safer location. If he's not stopping you're just screwed.
            nah, the addon isn't strong
            But he can no longer one shot with his chainsaw. You no longer have any need to fear the saw so you don't have to predrop a pallet. All of Billy's chases are going to last way longer because you have to either M1 twice or saw twice. Add on is kind of a meme
                It only does less damage if he breaks a pallet, if you don't drop the pallet and end up getting sawed because of that you're gonna be insta downed
                    Oh i didn't realize it got changed recently. Damn it actually kinda useful now
                        IIRC, it got changed immediately when it hit the live servers. It was only different during the PTB (where Lopro Chains were also Ultra Rare instead of Very Rare).
                    The damage debuff also only lasts a short time, so if you get chainsawed from 20 feet away after he breaks the pallet, you're still going down.
                Now that I'm thinking about it yeah, it does seem terrible since you lose your instadown. Also because only a good Billy can effectively uses his chainsaw well enough to get you into those terrible situations.
            You should almost never just stand behind a pallet. Just drop the pallet and run away. If he's literally revving his chainsaw waiting for you to throw the pallet, then either don't throw the pallet so you can continue the loop or stun him. There are many counterplay options if you're good at the game.
                https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/lzi31m/you_can_in_fact_break_every_pallet_in_the_map/gq2vere?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3

Yall are just playing stupid at this point.
                    Like I said in my post, you can pallet stun the Billy. I didn't assume you were camping the pallet, but I laid out the scenario as well as your good options and bad options.  

Did you even read my post or did you just call stupid the second you realized I didn't agree with you?
                        >Just drop the pallet and run away.

And if I didn't drop the pallet and run away what would I be doing? I'd be camping the pallet like an idiot. 

>If he's literally revving his chainsaw waiting for you to throw the pallet, then either don't throw the pallet so you can continue the loop or stun him.

If he's revving his chainsaw while I'm standing next to a pallet what would I be doing? I'd be camping the pallet like an idiot. 

You don't have to explicitly say something to say it. And if you bothered to read my other comment you'd see I'm clearly talking about those moments where your only option to avoid being downed is dropping the pallet.
                            Yeah and if you're in that situation you can time it well and still stun him. And even if there was no way to stop him getting you there, wouldn't that be ok for a purple add-on? It's not like every Billy is running lopro chains because it's so op
                            How often are these moments for you? I very rarely get into scenarios on the pallet where I need to drop it. (Not to say I'm a god and never get outplayed, I mean scenarios in the sense of "if Billy had this add-on then I'd certainly get hit after dropping the pallet")

Charging the chainsaw takes so long and makes you move so much slower, you almost always have enough time to move out of the way before he can chainsaw through the pallet. And for those few times where it actually does happen, is it really that bad for a purple add-on that no one runs to actually be useful?
                            If your only option is to drop the pallet, then you can stun him with that pallet. That is ALWAYS an option when throwing a pallet. It's up to you to time it right though. If you don't time it right and he downs you well then he outplayed you by getting you into a situation where 1) you're already injured, 2) you were forced to drop the pallet, 3) you mis-timed the pallet drop, and 4) he used a very niche addon to get a single health state on a survivor in this exact situation. I said niche, but of course you still think OP.
            drop a pallet and keep going. or drop a pallet and wait for either revving or the breaking sound
                Why is everyone assuming I'm camping pallets? You've never had those close calls where your only option is to drop the pallet to avoid getting hit with the chainsaw?
They probably haven't bound q and e to turn. But of course this is hard it took him a few hours.
Yeah I don‚Äôt think pathing is too hard as Billy on controller, my issue is when I‚Äôm right up against a survivor and they‚Äôre spinning around to avoid my chainsaw. Sometimes I can‚Äôt move the joystick fast enough to keep up with them and I miss my chainsaw
    I agree that this is definitely the hardest part! I have my sensitivity either maxed out or at least very high to help account for this. But then there's the framerate issues which make it harder to react since survivors do mini teleports from side to side.  

The only things you can do is to get very used to "99ing" your chainsaw so you can dully charge it the second you have them locked on. Or you can try what Otz does - he keeps his eye on the charge bar while the corner of his eye is looking at the survivor. It makes it easier to hold it at "99", and then when you see an opportunity to hit the survivor you go for it. Regardless it's not easy.
I don't know why you're getting downvoted lol
    Who knows lol. I used to traverse the map multiple times weaving in and out of stuff as a console Billy, but maybe people don't want to believe it's possible. After I learned how to space Billy, I learned that anything is possible though.
        Well DBD and R6 players are known to give so much shit and make fun of the console side of the playerbase so there's that
            Most likely. I'm way better than most PC players (at DBD) so it's funny to me when they think console players can't do anything.
                COnSolE pLaYeRs Be LiKe. But fr though I play crossplay and there are tons of both trash console and trash pc players (same with seeing good players on both side), but it annoys me when streamers/players will crap on console players specifically like bruh.
                    I'm sure on average console players aren't as good. It is harder to control, especially certain killers like Nurse, Blight, Deathslinger, Huntress, etc. But a lot of streamers defend console players too which is cool. In the end, just like you said,  there's both good and bad players on both platforms.
Ik i was joking cause there is something about this map that makes it feel like there are way more
What?
"I think music these days is not as good as it used to be"

*immediately ends stream*
    This is why we love Otz.
It cant overheat you while using it, just while charging it
    TIL
    r/ihadastroke
I've only played Hillbilly once so I can only assume there's a perk or item that makes it last forever and tear through pallets and survivors like tissue paper, of course.
    No someone else explained it above it can‚Äôt overheat if it‚Äôs in motion, he was using an addon to go through pallets and his second one was to help steering
The Game is also garbage. 
The fact that 2 god pallets can spawn in several corridors is bullshit
The chainsaw did overheat. Overheating doesnt cancel a sprint though
ya but it depends I have had a meg drop EVERY pallet INSTANDLY and then going to the next and they completed all gens before i was done. Like the new game map that has 27 pallets and all are god pallets, and this one has only 12*

*two were counted as one (4 & 5)
Lol love to see it.
Maybe I‚Äôm just a pallet magnet.
It can feel like a lot if there's a bunch of BNPs. Getting 5 out of one chase is a ton, but with a few brand new parts. Especially if it took you a bit to find the first survivor. You could be looking at 2-3 gens popping over a 5 pallet chase relatively easily. And if you see 2-3 gens pop 5 can sometimes feel like 500.
Go fuck yourself.
    No
i see, is it a new or reworked addon? I only use drift billy (speed and turn addons) because its the most fun way to play him
    it was added back when he was reworked in July, replaced one of the chain addons I believe.
        HE got a rework? Man havent touvhed dbd in a long time
            basically he's still the same except he has a limited meter so you can't charge or rev forever anymore without being put on a cooldown, also he has no charge addons anymore unless you want to move at 110% 4.4 m/s
[deleted]
    My main point was the first part, but fair enough.
I can‚Äôt believe I actually have to write it lol, was pretty obviously a joke
    Reddit gonna Reddit lol
Damnit I came here to say this. Instantly recognized this. Loved that album
    Yeah! I first found Fresh on the Breakbeat Kaos mixtapes, it's cool to see all that stuff on spotify.
thank you so much!
It was meant sarcastic. It would be difficult to chainsaw through two pallets in a row on these two maps.
Oh weird. I was actually still playing when Oni came out but never noticed that as one of his perks. Either I forgot or didn't pay attention. Thank you for answering.
lopro chains
that‚Äôd be the purple addon, lopro chains
Nope, that‚Äôs why I was confused. Weird to comment on a post so long ago.
    What makes that weird?
Bruh idk why their comments getting downvotes. How are they a buzz kill? They are literally making a joke, the only buzzkill is y'all not getting a very obvious joke
I'm not talking about him smartington
    well i don't think a single serious player would ever sincerely try this in game. and if they did and succeeded i would be very afraid of them lol
But they are obviously making a joke and not even being that negative
Thank you, I play Billy enough to know about the overheat but not that it doesn't end a sprint, I just assumed it would end the sprint like it does a rev
I see. Thanks for the clarification.
Oh I see, does it affect the overheat duration if you keep sprinting after the bar is filled? Or does the time stays the same.
    The overheat cooldown will always be the same. Sprinting while it's at 100% will not make the cooldown last any longer
        TY for the explanation, have a nice day
What's the point of this perk. Why would a killer need to see windows and pallets. Maybe to get to the pallet before the survivor? Maybe literally only for otz billy vid from the other day?
*didn‚Äôt get 12 hooks
    *Huuks
        He did that in a custom match....
Winning the game is accepting the fact that losing is inevitable. It teaches us that even if we lose something, we can still keep going.
You can never be too sure, that not Otzdarva guy looks really similar
    Yes, but the other guy is NOT otzdarva. They just happen to be similar. Maybe close relatives?

            As a survivor there can be tons of dead ends if the killer doesn't break any doors.
                There's a corner of the Game on the top floor where if you get a hook and leave the door blocked it's a ridiculous choke, godly for trapper but even on any killer you can get 2-3 basic attacks in succession
            All those doors for survivors, and all those pallets for the killer
    And still cancer for survivors and killers alike.
    Always was.
    It was like that even before the rework. It had 20 pallets back then and most of them were very safe
Shelter woods has been dogshit for survivors since launch. It used to be even worse, but it's improved *slightly* over time.
    It used to hardly have any trees so it was basically a cornfield map without any corn, structure, or pallets
    The reason it's so bad is because there are three jungle gyms, shack and the only other safety net is pallets which is limited, and once they're gone, nearly the entire map becomes unsafe. The entire center of the map is also a dead zone. It's coldwind farm if coldwind farm was mostly dead zones
    That's not at all true. There was a time it was the most pallet dense map in the game. I believe that changed when they reworked pallet distance to remove double pallets.
        You sure you're not confusing this with old-old Autohaven? There was an insane number of tiles with double pallets, ie the entire area around Blood Lodge (aka Pallet Town) was just low-wall tiles with double pallets.  Shelter woods never had that density.

Shelter woods has always been pretty killer-favorable, between a complete lack of infinites, a lack of god-loops and honestly a lack of many good loops and pallets in general.
            Definitely not. The joke around the time is that the pallets sheltered the survivors.
                Yeah, no. [Shelter woods has been killer friendly since forever, distinctly because of a lack of pallets and juke spots.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/4udegg/whats_the_worst_map_in_the_game/).  It's always been a miserable map to survive on.
                    Not sure an old reddit thread is a good indicator. Survivors today think the game is a good killer map. There are many videos of 20+ pallet shelter woods.
                        >Not sure an old reddit thread is a good indicator. Survivors today think the game is a good killer map.

I mean, the Game did have a relatively high kill rate prior to the rework.  The update shifted things in survivor's favor for sure.

> There are many videos of 20+ pallet shelter woods.

Yeah, and Autohaven would have had well over 30 pallets in comparison.  We're talking relatively here. Old-old Shelter woods would have been a little more survivor-favorable by today's standards, but it was still really killer-favorable in comparison to the other maps (like Pallet-haven) back then. It's still killer-favorable today.
It was like that even before the rework.
I mean, the game has like 24 pallets? Of which like 6-10 are god pallets. They dont always gut them
*insert Gideon Meat Plant joke here*
Theres literally double pallets like its 2016 again lmfao
Except the map is so big that a killer can't even pressure the other half of the map. Getting a somewhat decent 3gen is very difficult without some form of good mobility.
    What? I didnt think Shelter Woods was actually that big.
        It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs basically 3 rings Inner ring is a dead zone. Middle ring is half deadzone half tiles. Outer circle is just empty.  

it‚Äôs a shame cus the tree honestly looks so cool but the only reason to go near it as survivor is when your team used all 4 pallets on the map and now holding W is the most effective ‚Äúloop‚Äù
            [deleted]
                I'm talking about the playable region of the map, most of the map is a dead zone, making it very very killer sided, the middle of the map is mostly a killer free zone for mobility and the outskirts are pretty empty too.
    This is not true at all. Regardless, even if it was big I'd much rather have windows and pallets than map size. The map is terribly designed at the moment.
        It's literally the second largest map...
    Only actual size is big. Since there is nothing on the edges of the map, unlike Rotten Fields, it is easy for killer to pressure the map.
    It's not that big. It's very open too. You can see survivors from any point in the map and it has a ton of mobility. No middle gen means you can easily get gen trapped. It even has no pallets.
Love you otz, this was such a fun idea and I love that it just came from the chat. Had a blast watching you figure this out!
Not really. Despite being one of the biggest maps in the game, there is almost nothing around the edges and the center of the map, unlike Rotten Fields or Swamp maps, which makes it easy for killer to pressure as there is no reason to patrol nearly half of the map. Even Otz talked about it in his map tier list.
    Nothing to patrol except the gens that are on different sides of the map.......
        That's... every map in a nutshell. Like I said, there is no gens and good tiles on the edges of the map and depending on RNG, a generator will or won't be spawned in the middle, making patrolling nearly half of the map pointless. Since survivors don't have gens to repair and tiles to run in those places, killers have no reason patrol and survivors have no reason to take a chase there, making actual playing area so small.

For comparision, take Coal Tower. The map's actual size is much smaller but since the edge's of the map have stuff for players to interact with, making actual playable area nearly equal to Shelter Wood's.
            It's not just every map it's the secound largest map in the game. Which if your three gen gets busted your prob done.  And the point about nothing on the outside I discussed by saying I have seen 5 jungle gyms  with rock loops, and pallet gyms connecting them. That certainly is not nothing. Even though I have also seen is spawn with basically nothing, got love a game with this much rng. Lol The middle is definitely a dead zone though. Im not saying the map is survior sided I'm saying you can beat good killers by doing the right gens. Just cause of the size of the map. I think it should be smaller and have a few more loops personally.
                Aside from our traditional shack, there are 2 tiles* on one side of the shack, 2 tiles* on other side, 1 tile* on the side that is far from shack with some shitty rock loops and huge deadzones in the middle and the side that is near shack side. That's only 5 tiles at max that barely connect to each other. I think loop count is fine in general. The problem is there is nothing in most of the map and most loops can't be connected.

Like I said 2 times previously, the map's playable area is smaller than actual size. Survivor or killer, people have no reason to use the half of the map. Like, it shouldn't take you so long to patrol the map. Survivors don't have anything to do in edges or center. 

*Tiles can be TL Walls, Jungle Gyms and Pallet Gyms.
            Just seen the secound part. I'd rather have things that lead to killer survior Interaction then me taking my ass across the map and it taking 30 secounds or surviors just dieing cause a Meg throw all the pallets.
I think the middle of the nap is pretty barren. If survivors are caught anywhere around there then there isn‚Äôt much to work with. Also helps that the map is pretty small
    At least they added a pallet to the middle of the map. It used to be even more empty.
    Its actually one of the bigger maps it's bigger then haddonfield
        Oh seriously? It feels so small. Maybe because of all the open space, especially around the edges
            Yeah a  lot of the gens are around the outside of the map so if everyone splits up and you guys do not three gen it's hard to win on without slowdown. But once shit gone it goes very much in the favor of the killer, but if the gens are on opposite side of the map no way killer can defend them all.
                Why does this sub downvote so much lol

If it‚Äôs not a corny joke or a ‚Äúwholesome‚Äù thing then i see downvotes/insults for no reason
‚Äúis‚Äù corresponds to ‚Äúamount‚Äù, which is singular (though it should really be ‚Äúnumber‚Äù because pallets are countable).
    But it doesnt matter if it corresponds to amount. Because "is" in the sentence isnt referencing the boxes. It is referring to the state of existence of the boxes. It is a question asking "How IS there 20 things there?" You are asking how the things exist, not stating that there are 20 things there.
        This does not sound right to me, but I'm not English major.
            Let me explain a different way. The OP was asking how we are in a reality where there are 11 pallets. It is because the order of the words is "how the hell is this (a thing)" rather than "there are (X things)." It is a question about the existence of a thing rather than the number of things so "is" refers to the situation or reality rather than the items themselves.
You‚Äôd say ‚Äúthe pallets are‚Äù not ‚Äúthe pallets is‚Äù

You‚Äôd say ‚Äúthere are pallets‚Äù not ‚Äúthere is pallets‚Äù
    [removed]
        > please, stfu, you are making yourself look stupid. 

I'm a native English speaker and "How are there only 11 pallets on this map" sounds absolutely right to me. This stuff really can be confusing and particular.

Also I don't see how "the map still has those 11 pallets" is relevant, since the issue is plural vs singular and both "is" and "are" are present tense.
Okay dude, explain me the rule for it. Read through this and the other thread, didnt explain much about it
Yes. He has the moves
Lopro Chains
LoPro chains is a purple addon for billy that allows him to continue chainsaw sprinting through pallets but if you hit a survivor within 5 seconds they only take 1 health state of damage, not insta-down
    That still sounds like a *really* good Billy addon.

I don't know. Haven't played Billy. Can't freaking stand Billy.
no? Just don't stand behind a pallet when you see Billy charging his saw.
No, just don't stand near the pallet when you see billy revving
    Gosh, why didn't I think of that?! Sometimes the only thing you can do to avoid a Billy or Bubba is drop a pallet and find a safer location. If he's not stopping you're just screwed.
        nah, the addon isn't strong
        But he can no longer one shot with his chainsaw. You no longer have any need to fear the saw so you don't have to predrop a pallet. All of Billy's chases are going to last way longer because you have to either M1 twice or saw twice. Add on is kind of a meme
            It only does less damage if he breaks a pallet, if you don't drop the pallet and end up getting sawed because of that you're gonna be insta downed
                Oh i didn't realize it got changed recently. Damn it actually kinda useful now
                    IIRC, it got changed immediately when it hit the live servers. It was only different during the PTB (where Lopro Chains were also Ultra Rare instead of Very Rare).
                The damage debuff also only lasts a short time, so if you get chainsawed from 20 feet away after he breaks the pallet, you're still going down.
            Now that I'm thinking about it yeah, it does seem terrible since you lose your instadown. Also because only a good Billy can effectively uses his chainsaw well enough to get you into those terrible situations.
        You should almost never just stand behind a pallet. Just drop the pallet and run away. If he's literally revving his chainsaw waiting for you to throw the pallet, then either don't throw the pallet so you can continue the loop or stun him. There are many counterplay options if you're good at the game.
            https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/lzi31m/you_can_in_fact_break_every_pallet_in_the_map/gq2vere?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3

Yall are just playing stupid at this point.
                Like I said in my post, you can pallet stun the Billy. I didn't assume you were camping the pallet, but I laid out the scenario as well as your good options and bad options.  

Did you even read my post or did you just call stupid the second you realized I didn't agree with you?
                    >Just drop the pallet and run away.

And if I didn't drop the pallet and run away what would I be doing? I'd be camping the pallet like an idiot. 

>If he's literally revving his chainsaw waiting for you to throw the pallet, then either don't throw the pallet so you can continue the loop or stun him.

If he's revving his chainsaw while I'm standing next to a pallet what would I be doing? I'd be camping the pallet like an idiot. 

You don't have to explicitly say something to say it. And if you bothered to read my other comment you'd see I'm clearly talking about those moments where your only option to avoid being downed is dropping the pallet.
                        Yeah and if you're in that situation you can time it well and still stun him. And even if there was no way to stop him getting you there, wouldn't that be ok for a purple add-on? It's not like every Billy is running lopro chains because it's so op
                        How often are these moments for you? I very rarely get into scenarios on the pallet where I need to drop it. (Not to say I'm a god and never get outplayed, I mean scenarios in the sense of "if Billy had this add-on then I'd certainly get hit after dropping the pallet")

Charging the chainsaw takes so long and makes you move so much slower, you almost always have enough time to move out of the way before he can chainsaw through the pallet. And for those few times where it actually does happen, is it really that bad for a purple add-on that no one runs to actually be useful?
                        If your only option is to drop the pallet, then you can stun him with that pallet. That is ALWAYS an option when throwing a pallet. It's up to you to time it right though. If you don't time it right and he downs you well then he outplayed you by getting you into a situation where 1) you're already injured, 2) you were forced to drop the pallet, 3) you mis-timed the pallet drop, and 4) he used a very niche addon to get a single health state on a survivor in this exact situation. I said niche, but of course you still think OP.
        drop a pallet and keep going. or drop a pallet and wait for either revving or the breaking sound
            Why is everyone assuming I'm camping pallets? You've never had those close calls where your only option is to drop the pallet to avoid getting hit with the chainsaw?
I agree that this is definitely the hardest part! I have my sensitivity either maxed out or at least very high to help account for this. But then there's the framerate issues which make it harder to react since survivors do mini teleports from side to side.  

The only things you can do is to get very used to "99ing" your chainsaw so you can dully charge it the second you have them locked on. Or you can try what Otz does - he keeps his eye on the charge bar while the corner of his eye is looking at the survivor. It makes it easier to hold it at "99", and then when you see an opportunity to hit the survivor you go for it. Regardless it's not easy.
Who knows lol. I used to traverse the map multiple times weaving in and out of stuff as a console Billy, but maybe people don't want to believe it's possible. After I learned how to space Billy, I learned that anything is possible though.
    Well DBD and R6 players are known to give so much shit and make fun of the console side of the playerbase so there's that
        Most likely. I'm way better than most PC players (at DBD) so it's funny to me when they think console players can't do anything.
            COnSolE pLaYeRs Be LiKe. But fr though I play crossplay and there are tons of both trash console and trash pc players (same with seeing good players on both side), but it annoys me when streamers/players will crap on console players specifically like bruh.
                I'm sure on average console players aren't as good. It is harder to control, especially certain killers like Nurse, Blight, Deathslinger, Huntress, etc. But a lot of streamers defend console players too which is cool. In the end, just like you said,  there's both good and bad players on both platforms.
This is why we love Otz.
TIL
r/ihadastroke
No someone else explained it above it can‚Äôt overheat if it‚Äôs in motion, he was using an addon to go through pallets and his second one was to help steering
No
it was added back when he was reworked in July, replaced one of the chain addons I believe.
    HE got a rework? Man havent touvhed dbd in a long time
        basically he's still the same except he has a limited meter so you can't charge or rev forever anymore without being put on a cooldown, also he has no charge addons anymore unless you want to move at 110% 4.4 m/s
My main point was the first part, but fair enough.
Reddit gonna Reddit lol
Yeah! I first found Fresh on the Breakbeat Kaos mixtapes, it's cool to see all that stuff on spotify.
What makes that weird?
well i don't think a single serious player would ever sincerely try this in game. and if they did and succeeded i would be very afraid of them lol
The overheat cooldown will always be the same. Sprinting while it's at 100% will not make the cooldown last any longer
    TY for the explanation, have a nice day
*Huuks
    He did that in a custom match....
Yes, but the other guy is NOT otzdarva. They just happen to be similar. Maybe close relatives?
Nah, Not Otzdarva killed the real one years ago and took his place.
u/Bipolar-Gamer , he's one of the most talented DBD players. That's why I'm saying you're a troll.
Yeah, when they announced the rework I was hoping they would add some kind of shelter to *Shelter* Woods, but it was only a graphical update.

In fact, the only change I noticed is that you can't use balanced landing on the giant tree anymore.
    Yeah I was using balanced on this map the other day and I never use balanced so I don‚Äôt really know where I need to go on each map to make it work. Realized there were no hills or anything so I had to settle for the basement which wasn‚Äôt exactly helpful
Pallet City, yet they managed to make it equally cancer for both survivors and killers
    How so?
        As a survivor there can be tons of dead ends if the killer doesn't break any doors.
            There's a corner of the Game on the top floor where if you get a hook and leave the door blocked it's a ridiculous choke, godly for trapper but even on any killer you can get 2-3 basic attacks in succession

I mean, the Game did have a relatively high kill rate prior to the rework.  The update shifted things in survivor's favor for sure.

> There are many videos of 20+ pallet shelter woods.

Yeah, and Autohaven would have had well over 30 pallets in comparison.  We're talking relatively here. Old-old Shelter woods would have been a little more survivor-favorable by today's standards, but it was still really killer-favorable in comparison to the other maps (like Pallet-haven) back then. It's still killer-favorable today.
What? I didnt think Shelter Woods was actually that big.
    It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs basically 3 rings Inner ring is a dead zone. Middle ring is half deadzone half tiles. Outer circle is just empty.

                    Yeah and if you're in that situation you can time it well and still stun him. And even if there was no way to stop him getting you there, wouldn't that be ok for a purple add-on? It's not like every Billy is running lopro chains because it's so op
                    How often are these moments for you? I very rarely get into scenarios on the pallet where I need to drop it. (Not to say I'm a god and never get outplayed, I mean scenarios in the sense of "if Billy had this add-on then I'd certainly get hit after dropping the pallet")

Charging the chainsaw takes so long and makes you move so much slower, you almost always have enough time to move out of the way before he can chainsaw through the pallet. And for those few times where it actually does happen, is it really that bad for a purple add-on that no one runs to actually be useful?
                    If your only option is to drop the pallet, then you can stun him with that pallet. That is ALWAYS an option when throwing a pallet. It's up to you to time it right though. If you don't time it right and he downs you well then he outplayed you by getting you into a situation where 1) you're already injured, 2) you were forced to drop the pallet, 3) you mis-timed the pallet drop, and 4) he used a very niche addon to get a single health state on a survivor in this exact situation. I said niche, but of course you still think OP.
    drop a pallet and keep going. or drop a pallet and wait for either revving or the breaking sound
        Why is everyone assuming I'm camping pallets? You've never had those close calls where your only option is to drop the pallet to avoid getting hit with the chainsaw?
Well DBD and R6 players are known to give so much shit and make fun of the console side of the playerbase so there's that
    Most likely. I'm way better than most PC players (at DBD) so it's funny to me when they think console players can't do anything.
        COnSolE pLaYeRs Be LiKe. But fr though I play crossplay and there are tons of both trash console and trash pc players (same with seeing good players on both side), but it annoys me when streamers/players will crap on console players specifically like bruh.
            I'm sure on average console players aren't as good. It is harder to control, especially certain killers like Nurse, Blight, Deathslinger, Huntress, etc. But a lot of streamers defend console players too which is cool. In the end, just like you said,  there's both good and bad players on both platforms.
HE got a rework? Man havent touvhed dbd in a long time
    basically he's still the same except he has a limited meter so you can't charge or rev forever anymore without being put on a cooldown, also he has no charge addons anymore unless you want to move at 110% 4.4 m/s
TY for the explanation, have a nice day
He did that in a custom match....
Yeah I was using balanced on this map the other day and I never use balanced so I don‚Äôt really know where I need to go on each map to make it work. Realized there were no hills or anything so I had to settle for the basement which wasn‚Äôt exactly helpful
How so?
    As a survivor there can be tons of dead ends if the killer doesn't break any doors.
        There's a corner of the Game on the top floor where if you get a hook and leave the door blocked it's a ridiculous choke, godly for trapper but even on any killer you can get 2-3 basic attacks in succession
    All those doors for survivors, and all those pallets for the killer
You sure you're not confusing this with old-old Autohaven? There was an insane number of tiles with double pallets, ie the entire area around Blood Lodge (aka Pallet Town) was just low-wall tiles with double pallets.  Shelter woods never had that density.

Shelter woods has always been pretty killer-favorable, between a complete lack of infinites, a lack of god-loops and honestly a lack of many good loops and pallets in general.
    Definitely not. The joke around the time is that the pallets sheltered the survivors.
        Yeah, no. [Shelter woods has been killer friendly since forever, distinctly because of a lack of pallets and juke spots.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/4udegg/whats_the_worst_map_in_the_game/).  It's always been a miserable map to survive on.
            Not sure an old reddit thread is a good indicator. Survivors today think the game is a good killer map. There are many videos of 20+ pallet shelter woods.
                >Not sure an old reddit thread is a good indicator. Survivors today think the game is a good killer map.

I mean, the Game did have a relatively high kill rate prior to the rework.  The update shifted things in survivor's favor for sure.

> There are many videos of 20+ pallet shelter woods.

Yeah, and Autohaven would have had well over 30 pallets in comparison.  We're talking relatively here. Old-old Shelter woods would have been a little more survivor-favorable by today's standards, but it was still really killer-favorable in comparison to the other maps (like Pallet-haven) back then. It's still killer-favorable today.
It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs basically 3 rings Inner ring is a dead zone. Middle ring is half deadzone half tiles. Outer circle is just empty.  

it‚Äôs a shame cus the tree honestly looks so cool but the only reason to go near it as survivor is when your team used all 4 pallets on the map and now holding W is the most effective ‚Äúloop‚Äù
    [deleted]
        I'm talking about the playable region of the map, most of the map is a dead zone, making it very very killer sided, the middle of the map is mostly a killer free zone for mobility and the outskirts are pretty empty too.
It's literally the second largest map...
That's... every map in a nutshell. Like I said, there is no gens and good tiles on the edges of the map and depending on RNG, a generator will or won't be spawned in the middle, making patrolling nearly half of the map pointless. Since survivors don't have gens to repair and tiles to run in those places, killers have no reason patrol and survivors have no reason to take a chase there, making actual playing area so small.

For comparision, take Coal Tower. The map's actual size is much smaller but since the edge's of the map have stuff for players to interact with, making actual playable area nearly equal to Shelter Wood's.
    It's not just every map it's the secound largest map in the game. Which if your three gen gets busted your prob done.  And the point about nothing on the outside I discussed by saying I have seen 5 jungle gyms  with rock loops, and pallet gyms connecting them. That certainly is not nothing. Even though I have also seen is spawn with basically nothing, got love a game with this much rng. Lol The middle is definitely a dead zone though. Im not saying the map is survior sided I'm saying you can beat good killers by doing the right gens. Just cause of the size of the map. I think it should be smaller and have a few more loops personally.
        Aside from our traditional shack, there are 2 tiles* on one side of the shack, 2 tiles* on other side, 1 tile* on the side that is far from shack with some shitty rock loops and huge deadzones in the middle and the side that is near shack side. That's only 5 tiles at max that barely connect to each other. I think loop count is fine in general. The problem is there is nothing in most of the map and most loops can't be connected.

Like I said 2 times previously, the map's playable area is smaller than actual size. Survivor or killer, people have no reason to use the half of the map. Like, it shouldn't take you so long to patrol the map. Survivors don't have anything to do in edges or center. 

*Tiles can be TL Walls, Jungle Gyms and Pallet Gyms.
    Just seen the secound part. I'd rather have things that lead to killer survior Interaction then me taking my ass across the map and it taking 30 secounds or surviors just dieing cause a Meg throw all the pallets.
Oh seriously? It feels so small. Maybe because of all the open space, especially around the edges
    Yeah a  lot of the gens are around the outside of the map so if everyone splits up and you guys do not three gen it's hard to win on without slowdown. But once shit gone it goes very much in the favor of the killer, but if the gens are on opposite side of the map no way killer can defend them all.
        Why does this sub downvote so much lol

If it‚Äôs not a corny joke or a ‚Äúwholesome‚Äù thing then i see downvotes/insults for no reason
This does not sound right to me, but I'm not English major.
    Let me explain a different way. The OP was asking how we are in a reality where there are 11 pallets. It is because the order of the words is "how the hell is this (a thing)" rather than "there are (X things)." It is a question about the existence of a thing rather than the number of things so "is" refers to the situation or reality rather than the items themselves.
> please, stfu, you are making yourself look stupid. 

I'm a native English speaker and "How are there only 11 pallets on this map" sounds absolutely right to me. This stuff really can be confusing and particular.

Also I don't see how "the map still has those 11 pallets" is relevant, since the issue is plural vs singular and both "is" and "are" are present tense.
nah, the addon isn't strong
But he can no longer one shot with his chainsaw. You no longer have any need to fear the saw so you don't have to predrop a pallet. All of Billy's chases are going to last way longer because you have to either M1 twice or saw twice. Add on is kind of a meme
    It only does less damage if he breaks a pallet, if you don't drop the pallet and end up getting sawed because of that you're gonna be insta downed
        Oh i didn't realize it got changed recently. Damn it actually kinda useful now
            IIRC, it got changed immediately when it hit the live servers. It was only different during the PTB (where Lopro Chains were also Ultra Rare instead of Very Rare).
        The damage debuff also only lasts a short time, so if you get chainsawed from 20 feet away after he breaks the pallet, you're still going down.
    Now that I'm thinking about it yeah, it does seem terrible since you lose your instadown. Also because only a good Billy can effectively uses his chainsaw well enough to get you into those terrible situations.
You should almost never just stand behind a pallet. Just drop the pallet and run away. If he's literally revving his chainsaw waiting for you to throw the pallet, then either don't throw the pallet so you can continue the loop or stun him. There are many counterplay options if you're good at the game.

Yall are just playing stupid at this point.
        Like I said in my post, you can pallet stun the Billy. I didn't assume you were camping the pallet, but I laid out the scenario as well as your good options and bad options.  

Did you even read my post or did you just call stupid the second you realized I didn't agree with you?
            >Just drop the pallet and run away.

And if I didn't drop the pallet and run away what would I be doing? I'd be camping the pallet like an idiot.

If you don't time it right and he downs you well then he outplayed you by getting you into a situation where 1) you're already injured, 2) you were forced to drop the pallet, 3) you mis-timed the pallet drop, and 4) he used a very niche addon to get a single health state on a survivor in this exact situation. I said niche, but of course you still think OP.
>Not sure an old reddit thread is a good indicator. Survivors today think the game is a good killer map.

I mean, the Game did have a relatively high kill rate prior to the rework.  The update shifted things in survivor's favor for sure.

> There are many videos of 20+ pallet shelter woods.

Yeah, and Autohaven would have had well over 30 pallets in comparison.  We're talking relatively here. Old-old Shelter woods would have been a little more survivor-favorable by today's standards, but it was still really killer-favorable in comparison to the other maps (like Pallet-haven) back then. It's still killer-favorable today.
Yeah and if you're in that situation you can time it well and still stun him. And even if there was no way to stop him getting you there, wouldn't that be ok for a purple add-on? It's not like every Billy is running lopro chains because it's so op
How often are these moments for you? I very rarely get into scenarios on the pallet where I need to drop it. (Not to say I'm a god and never get outplayed, I mean scenarios in the sense of "if Billy had this add-on then I'd certainly get hit after dropping the pallet")

Charging the chainsaw takes so long and makes you move so much slower, you almost always have enough time to move out of the way before he can chainsaw through the pallet.
