[[Demogorgon's power looks interesting]]





Hey, you’re finally awake. You were trying to escape Coldwind Farm, right? Walked right into that EW3 Myers, same as us, and that Dwight over there
    Damn you toxic swf, killers were fine until you came along. The entity was nice and lazy. But if they hadn’t been chasing you I could’ve rushed that gen and been halfway to Lery’s
        We're all brothers and sisters in dying state now, locker-boy.
            And what's wrong with him?
                Watch your tongue! That’s a Jake with Saboteur your speaking to.
                    Jake the Saboteur? But you're the one that sabo-ed all the hooks around here and almost made the killer disconnect...
                        If they’ve captured you... oh entity, where is Bubba taking us?
                            I don't know where are we going, but the Entity awaits...
                                No we can't get sacrificed, we aren't getting sacrificed!
                                    Face your sacrifice with some courage, locker-boy.
                                    Shut up back there
                            Pack it up, lads, we’re done here.
                    I do believe i was called here
    Best comment award goes to you
    Ok, this whole comment chain is art
    Lmfao. And that dwight over there. everyone shits on dwight :/ no wonder he has a helmet.
    Aw, shame the top comment ruined it before I even watched it.
You son of a bitch.
    ;)
        [removed]
            I enjoy when the OP replies to my comments, so I tend to do it too ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
                Don’t listen to this guy lol, no idea what his problem is.
                    Well, people who don’t get reddit karma like to complain and act toxic to others that are fairing better than they are.
            This was such a cringey thing to read
                it’s been removed now, what did it say?
                    Something abt OP karma farming by commenting on their own post so they get ‘downvotes from guys like me ;)’
            If that were true, why would reddit specifically denote the OP when they leave a comment?
            Imagine caring so much about orange arrows you make something called "reddiquette"
                Reddiquette is real but this isn’t part of it
                Reddiquette tte is a thing
            Not everything is about karma. Grow up and respect people who are responsive and nice to you.
            Are you trolling or?
            What’s wrong with talking to the people in the comments? I’ve been on reddit for over 1 1/2 years on different accounts and no one cares about OP commenting.
            This is why you got negative 95 karma on comments.
            ;)
            Shhh
            i really don't understand why some people like yourself take karma this seriously
                If I'm doing well in ~~The Game~~ Reddit karma, I'm doing well in life!
            r/downvotefarmers
            You’re a dick. Most normal people don’t care if the OP comments on their own post, or respond to comments.
            Sooo OP's are not allowed to answer comments and questions to their own posts?
     The Redditor is immunized against all dangers: one may call him a scoundrel, parasite, swindler, profiteer, it all runs off him like water off a raincoat. But call him a Redditor and you will be astonished at how he recoils, how injured he is, how he suddenly shrinks back: "Nu-uh".
        Cum
    Can’t believe I fell for that
    Was here to say exactly this
Okay but real question he has time to travel between portals and survivors can close portals, so what happens if all the portals are closed when he is inside?
    this is genuinely an interesting question and I wonder if the devs planned for this... can you just fucking trap it in a tunnel lmao
        You just sit under the map watching while the gens get finished one by one.
            *sounds of sobbing muffled by 2 feet of dirt*
                I mean... He'd be in the upside down
That's a little more than just dirt stopping sound
                    If you’ll notice, I was referencing the video that shows the gameplay in which it looks like a tunnel of dirt.
                Underrated comment
            Sounds like my average killer match with extra steps
    My guess is it either returns the demogorgon, or it doesn't allow the closing of the second portal until he's out.
        It would be brown trousers time if you’re trying to close a portal but it won’t let you
        Yeah it would probably act as when you’re working on the last gen but another one pops up - you just insta cancel your action
    You die, in real life.
        Fuck yeah
    That's an interesting point actually
    I think there would be some sort of function that would force the demigorgon out.
    I assume it's like Freddy being able to teleport to a gen as long as he starts teleporting before it gets finished.
    It would just allow him to go to whatever portal he was going to before it closed. 

Freddy can still teleport to a completed generator if he was channeling before it was completed.
    Honestly just seems like a hag remake with more range and a lunge. At this point I feel like we should all be calling for a buff for hag.
        That's my issue with killers lately. Ghost face is just pig+ Myers. Demi seems to be hag but not instant teleportation. 

Clown and spirit are fine though.
            I agree. I'd like to see more drastically different killers. Plague is very original, but Legion and Ghostface are both M1 knife-guys with a bit of extra flair. I like a varied gameplay experience when I play survivor, and you dont get that with a lot of redundant killers.
                I forgot about Plague.  


Legion wasn't bad. Just pigs charge was stolen. Everything else about them in unique.
    Destruction of a portal when he inters it probably resets to 0, either that or destruction doesn't save.
    They mention something about a tug-of-war mechanic
    From what I've seen it takes Steve and Nancy a long time to close the portals, much longer than it takes the Demogorgon to travel from A to B.
    I would assume that it takes longer to close a portal than to move between them. 

Then you simply don't allow the demogorgon to move to a portal that would close before he gets there.
    A portal opens IRL unleashing the demogorgon upon the world
    also... why use demogorgon when you could just use nurse with add ons?
        Because just like how Survivors are usually bad, Killers are also usually bad
            I'm bad at understanding her teleport and a little bit of just regular bad
Damn it Todd Howard you got me again.
God dammit
    Upvote because I yelled this
        Exactly the same here. I usually spot these coming, but this bamboozled tf outta me.
    Literally the new rick roll.

Fuck. The one time I wasn’t expecting this to happen.
As soon as I saw the screen go black, I knew. You got me.
Goddamnit.
When you start playing Skyrim you'll be given options of the various races to choose for your playthrough. However, there's one race that's unique and a question has been asked.  


Can you beat Skyrim as a Demogorgon?
Should've dug his way to civilization
I made a comment about this on a different post.

I feel like I had some part in this but I know better than that.
    You may have given me the idea ;)
God damn Todd Howard, you've done it again!
I tried to show this to my nephew. Now I hate you.
Motherf-
I expected the pyrocynical 250,000 subs meme, but this is refreshing
    So guys, we did it. We got blinded a quarter of a millions times.
Should've read the comments before I watched.

You got me.

Is the demogorgon an actual killer?
    Yup
        I don't believe you
            The Stranger Things chapter is getting released in September.

fuck you

edit: I was watching this on my other monitor right as I saw this  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYY1GHzauCo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYY1GHzauCo)
At first I thought "damn did this dude just wake up from 10 -year oblivion?"

...you got us in the first half not gonna lie
I don’t know how I’ve managed to see upwards of one hundred of these edits,and I still somehow fall for them each time.
Fr though I don’t really get its powers. It’s basically nurse but it’s power is slower?? From what I understand at least. Haven’t really looked into it.
    He can set up tunnels across the map, survivors can interact with them to close them but during this interaction they can’t hear the killers terror radius. 

That’s all I gathered from the Stranger Things spotlight, the numbers and stuff haven’t been released yet afaik
I CALLED IT OMG
I'm so upset
I knew it's gonna be these meme, such potential
Okay but tell me how this isn’t a worse hag
    Other than they don’t see it coming
Son of a bitch
I was going to say they showed this a few days ago, fuck you.
I knew exactly what this was going to be, yet I still looked
I fucking expected it, yet I fell for it
Son of a bitch
I was really hoping he would have a Freddy feel and you got sucked into the upside down.
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
If it does it again, it'll end up in blackreach
Scary moment
He can't keep getting away with this
Ahhh yes a great way to kill survivors going for exit gates

Oh! come on!

you. ass
Damn you toxic swf, killers were fine until you came along. The entity was nice and lazy. But if they hadn’t been chasing you I could’ve rushed that gen and been halfway to Lery’s
    We're all brothers and sisters in dying state now, locker-boy.
        And what's wrong with him?
            Watch your tongue! That’s a Jake with Saboteur your speaking to.
                Jake the Saboteur? But you're the one that sabo-ed all the hooks around here and almost made the killer disconnect...
                    If they’ve captured you... oh entity, where is Bubba taking us?
                        I don't know where are we going, but the Entity awaits...
                            No we can't get sacrificed, we aren't getting sacrificed!
                                Face your sacrifice with some courage, locker-boy.

        What’s wrong with talking to the people in the comments? I’ve been on reddit for over 1 1/2 years on different accounts and no one cares about OP commenting.
        This is why you got negative 95 karma on comments.
        ;)
        Shhh
        i really don't understand why some people like yourself take karma this seriously
            If I'm doing well in ~~The Game~~ Reddit karma, I'm doing well in life!
        r/downvotefarmers
        You’re a dick. Most normal people don’t care if the OP comments on their own post, or respond to comments.
        Sooo OP's are not allowed to answer comments and questions to their own posts?
 The Redditor is immunized against all dangers: one may call him a scoundrel, parasite, swindler, profiteer, it all runs off him like water off a raincoat. But call him a Redditor and you will be astonished at how he recoils, how injured he is, how he suddenly shrinks back: "Nu-uh".
    Cum
Can’t believe I fell for that
Was here to say exactly this
this is genuinely an interesting question and I wonder if the devs planned for this... can you just fucking trap it in a tunnel lmao
    You just sit under the map watching while the gens get finished one by one.
        *sounds of sobbing muffled by 2 feet of dirt*
            I mean... He'd be in the upside down
That's a little more than just dirt stopping sound
                If you’ll notice, I was referencing the video that shows the gameplay in which it looks like a tunnel of dirt.
            Underrated comment
        Sounds like my average killer match with extra steps
My guess is it either returns the demogorgon, or it doesn't allow the closing of the second portal until he's out.
    It would be brown trousers time if you’re trying to close a portal but it won’t let you
    Yeah it would probably act as when you’re working on the last gen but another one pops up - you just insta cancel your action
You die, in real life.
    Fuck yeah
That's an interesting point actually
I think there would be some sort of function that would force the demigorgon out.
I assume it's like Freddy being able to teleport to a gen as long as he starts teleporting before it gets finished.
It would just allow him to go to whatever portal he was going to before it closed. 

Freddy can still teleport to a completed generator if he was channeling before it was completed.
Honestly just seems like a hag remake with more range and a lunge. At this point I feel like we should all be calling for a buff for hag.
    That's my issue with killers lately. Ghost face is just pig+ Myers. Demi seems to be hag but not instant teleportation. 

Clown and spirit are fine though.
        I agree. I'd like to see more drastically different killers. Plague is very original, but Legion and Ghostface are both M1 knife-guys with a bit of extra flair. I like a varied gameplay experience when I play survivor, and you dont get that with a lot of redundant killers.
            I forgot about Plague.  


Legion wasn't bad. Just pigs charge was stolen. Everything else about them in unique.
Destruction of a portal when he inters it probably resets to 0, either that or destruction doesn't save.
They mention something about a tug-of-war mechanic
From what I've seen it takes Steve and Nancy a long time to close the portals, much longer than it takes the Demogorgon to travel from A to B.
I would assume that it takes longer to close a portal than to move between them. 

Then you simply don't allow the demogorgon to move to a portal that would close before he gets there.
A portal opens IRL unleashing the demogorgon upon the world
also... why use demogorgon when you could just use nurse with add ons?
    Because just like how Survivors are usually bad, Killers are also usually bad
        I'm bad at understanding her teleport and a little bit of just regular bad
Upvote because I yelled this
    Exactly the same here. I usually spot these coming, but this bamboozled tf outta me.
Literally the new rick roll.

I came here to say the exact same thing! 1 upvote sir!
I smell a collab. Bethesda will release the 50th version of Skyrim. Dead by Skyrimjob.
How dare YOU!
I just wanted to contribute to this.
Don’t worry it’s all on the dead by daylight YouTube channel

He can set up tunnels across the map, survivors can interact with them to close them but during this interaction they can’t hear the killers terror radius. 

That’s all I gathered from the Stranger Things spotlight, the numbers and stuff haven’t been released yet afaik
Other than they don’t see it coming
