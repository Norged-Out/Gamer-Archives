[[New face hooking counter coming!]]


Bubbas are fucked now! Killer being in a radius of the survivor generates a bar that lets the hooked unhook themselves for free. As someone who just experienced this twice yesterday I'm loving it


Wonder how this works on maps like The Game.
    Survivor swarming also slows the bar, but hopefully vertical terror radius is taken into account, a killer on a separate floor away from stairs isnt a threat
        I would imagine it‚Äôs not going to be terror radius based at all because if it is it‚Äôs completely countered by undetectable killers/perks.
            Correct. Insidious camping would still very much be a thing.
            Wesker: *Sweats nervously*
                Why?
                    40 meter terror radius
                        They said the radius of the hook. Not killer. Monstrous shrine works this way too. Punishing individual killers would make no sense.
                            I am aware. I was explaining the joke that I thought you might not have gotten, even if the joke is not applicable in this situation because the radius for camping is at 16m.
            BT used to only activate if it happened in the TR and stealth killers would use their undetectable to counter just that...  
Not that you didn't necessarily know that already. Just buttressing your statement.
                I did know, but I‚Äôm hoping that they learned something from that! Can‚Äôt see them making that mistake this time, insidious is a well established camping tool already so if they‚Äôve somehow not thought of that I would be surprised.
                    Unfortunately committing the same mistake is very BHVR
                        Gonna sound crazy here, but I think Behaviour has geniunely gotten *better* as a developer.  I don't see this only being linked to the TR. Basement Bubba is likely one of the major camping tactics they want to counter.
                            They've gotten better for sure, but they also make the same boneheaded mistakes over and over sometimes.
                                You could say that there's a Merciless Storm of them.
                                    Sadako is my favorite please don't activate my ptsd lol
                            They replaced the person in charge of balancing and they seem much more competent? The recent meta shakeup seems quite positive.
                                Positive if you only play Survivor. Whatever idiot is in charge of balancing this mess clearly has one priority, and it's make Killer unplayable while giving Survivors free wins at all costs at this point. Even the so called Survivor 'nerf' recently nerfed Killers harder than anything else in ages, gutting tons of perks and effectively removing them from play entirely, while Survivor healing was barely touched with the lightest of possible wrist slaps, and most of the actual nerfs that were supposed to happen instead were screamed and cried and whined away, showing, ultimately, this game is beyond help. The devs are insanely biased, and when they're not, the larger community can simply throw a fit and get what they want as the devs will bend the knee.

Hit the nail on the head bud. I don't think there's a way to recover from it when the survivor-only players just cry about every little inconvenience and get it fixed since that's a majority of the playerbase. 

The killer-only players do it too, but it's drowned out because it's maybe 20% of the playerbase. Flashlights caused seizures in some killer players because they could be spammed, and the survivor-only players threw a  fit over flashlights being "nerfed." üòë

It was literally hurting players, and I think that's the real reason people used the flashlight spam, to annoy or injure the player, not the killer.
                                    I'm having an easy time with perks such as Sloppy Butcher, Nowhere to Hide, Jolt, and Safe the Best for Last. I highly recommend these. Slowdown isn't necessary anymore and it's much better.
            Hmmm. I like them doing something about face camping but it feels the guy on the hook could therefore call the position of a stealth killer easily. Guess it'll just depend on the radius size.
        Isn‚Äôt there a hole on the 2nd floor of that map. Directly looking over a hook?
            There is also hooks next to the stairs if I remember right on some variations of the game.
            Definitely.  Surprisingly when i camped there nobody took the plunge that I expected but was convinced would be to obvious.
        It's 100% going to be vertical as well, which will suck for some maps but also handles camping up above the basement.
            [deleted]
                With agitation and iron grasp I can get to basement from near half the map on some maps. It's still a massive choke point and this doesn't even solve that because you still have to leave basement and run into the killer losing at least half your borrowed time timer and against trapper doesn't even help then.
                Basement is a very strong hook spot regardless. Many killer powers allow you to abuse how predictable it is, and it‚Äôs very easy to defend even without actually facecamping by just patrolling relatively near it. 

Survivors may make a mistake (although let‚Äôs be real it‚Äôs not that difficult to get hooked in the basement) but the Killer simply sitting infront of the hook should *also* be punished for making the mistake of not properly pressuring the team and just trying to cheese out one kill.
                i don't know what gave you the idea that getting hooked in the basement is a Survivor mistake? it's as much of a mistake as going down at all basement is an outdated mecanic only served a purpose when hooks used to be permanently sabotaged it's not an excuse for the killer to be an asshole.
        That's the hope, but just remember that hook spawns don't take that into account when they should
        I don't know how they would deal with this loophole but camping basement would still be an issue then.
        I hope "terror radius" is being used as a substitute for others words, because as someone that mains Nem and Wesker and doesn't camp (unless they bm), that'd be a huge issue.
    Nurse will likely abuse it. Hook below, camp above.
        Its not abuse. This is still harder than face camping, wich is what we get now. We really need to stop changing the game around nurse.
            It already is. They‚Äôve nerfed perks (ex: awakened awareness) because nurse players would exploit them with their power. BHVR refuses to rework nurse and instead prefer to balance the game around her. Take your head out of the sand and see the planned platitudes for what they are.
                Starstruck was never nerfed cause of Nurse, you're thinking of Awakened Awareness. Which they could honestly revert the change since Nurse can no longer use Starstruck.
                Without a complete Nurse Rework, the best solution for BHVR IS to balance the game over balancing Nurse herself.
No matter what balancing changes you do the nurse, she will still be able to counter basically the whole looping aspect of the game by going through walls

It does suck that perks need to be nerfed from what they could be if she wasn't in the game though...
    I'd expect it would be based on the pathfinding distance between the killer and the hook. This would account for the actual walking distance rather than the distance in space.
        I think you might be giving BHVR too much credit.
        Nurse is a killer tho
            ü§Ø
    Also this will greatly impact tournaments and comp teams.
  
Kinda of interesting to see what kind of strategies comp teams employ for this.
    If it's anything like how they handled boons and how they work on multiple floors, I don't think they're gonna consider the Y-axis and that concerns me
    From BHVR: ‚ÄúAs it stands, this system will remain active and function as intended on Maps with multiple floors like The Game or Midwich Elementary School. We‚Äôd like to clarify that this may possibly lead to edge cases where a Killer is falsely punished for face-camping, so we will be monitoring this closely following release and adjusting as needed.‚Äù
It's a good change, but honestly a face camping Bubba could likely still get you back down with his chainsaw.
    true, but its all about stalling them out, and having that DS ready to go afterwards. If they know they're losing an extra minute out of all this it might help deter it, especially if the other three survivors are rushing gens instead
        Exactly. If it lasts long enough for the rest of your team to finish gens and get out then the problem is solved regardless of if the face camped survivor makes it out. 

As is, the killer can face camp and easily get another two kills just because of how long it takes to do Gens.
            Hopefully this stops teammates from lingering around the hook and actually motivates them to do gens
                Yeah, I personally think that's the issue. I'd rather have a constant killer aura reveal on hook without perks
            Plus now the person getting face camped can actually reset and try chase again if they have DS/BT/Secondwind, burning even more of the killer‚Äôs time.
                I mean against most killers it's going to be ok.  Against a bubba though it is super easy to burn through borrowed time or off the record.  I imagine that it will make the person die faster than if they just sat on the hook against bubba
            Right, you wouldn‚Äôt even need to reassure them until stage 2 if the killer is camping so that‚Äôs very good gen efficiency
                Get Reassurance for both stages to max out survivor's time efficiency.

Second Wind, Lithe, DS, Blood Rush etc 

does it suck to still run a build to avoid camping? Yes... but I can see how some players or SWF could try to have fun with this
                    Absolutely
            If Killer is face camping for 2 minutes yet have plenty of time to get 2 more kills, those must be absurdly fast chases
                Most face campers get kills by grabbing people trying to get the hook or downing them after
                Depends on when the killer gets the down and if kindred is being used, 2 minutes is 120 seconds.  
If the killer downs the survivor at 5 gens even if the other 3 have their gens at 45 seconds (50%) they still need another 45 seconds to finish them and then at least 90 seconds to finish one of the 2 remaining (one gets worked by 1 person, the other by 2) 90+45 its 135, by that time the killer has 15 seconds to find someone and start a new chase and this is not taking on acount distance traveled to another gen or perks  like Deadlock.  
This assuming kindred is in play and the 3 survivors know the killer is camping, if they dont at least one or two will go check the hook, see the killer camping and then going back, increasing the overall time needed to fix all gens remaining, add NOED into the mix to get a very easy down once the gens are done and you can almost guarantee 2 or 3 kills without putting that much effort except on the first chase.  


Even if you get the down at 4 gens is very easy to get 3 kills if you facecamp using NOED and Deadlock.
        Kindred mains rejoice
            Not till they get rid of that BS annoying black bubble
        While that may be true, if a bubba is determined, there isn't much to stop them, even with this method in place. They would have to do some adjusting, idk what that would be but it would have to be something worth while
            True but imo the problem with camping is the killer doesnt get one kill, they get easily 2/3 or even 4 sometimes.  


I dont have that much of a problem with the killer getting one kill if they decide to camp, it sucks but honestly it would be really hard to find a method where that doesnt happen and cant be abused without overhauling the entire hook system, I think having the killer getting a pity kill its the lesser evil in this instance.  


I do have a problem with the killer winning the match just because they downed someone at 4/5 gens and decided to stand still for 2 minutes, especially against solos who cant tell eachother whats happening and must go to the hook to learn they have to rush gens.
        You‚Äôre assuming face-camping bubbas even understand how to play the game‚Ä¶ Okay, all jokes aside though, I do like this change.
        DS is a joke.
            It will still buy you time to get to a nearby tile or give your team 1 extra minute to finish gens and get out
                3 seconds is enough to get you two feet. Any ranged or speed killer eats that
                    3 seconds is still more time for your teammates to knock out gens.  Not including time for killer to pick you up and take you to a hook either. Any time you can buy your team while being facecamped is precious.  With dead hard you can extend those 3 seconds into potentially minutes
                        You went from 1 minute to 3 seconds real quick
                            And yes, it activates for one minute but as soon as you do a conspicuous action it deactivates
                            And yes, it‚Äôs 3 second stun off the shoulder, one of which is spent rolling off the shoulder.
                            1 minute is if the killer decides to play around DS, aka, dont pick you up until 1 minute.
                        And again, it‚Äôs useless without a companion perk. You can‚Äôt change the argument to ‚Äúwith deadhard‚Äù when deadhard+DS is a new concept to the argument. DS, without any helpers is garbage.
                            DS is still a pretty good perk, as in much better than most other perks, it just isn't the god tier perk it used to be, if your team is efficient on gens even the few seconds that it gets you are useful and can change the outcome of a game and it only gets stronger if you pair it with other perks like dead hard or off the record
                                That‚Äôs the thing it can‚Äôt stand alone. And if your team isn‚Äôt doing gens in the first place it‚Äôs buying dead time. If you only play in solo queue it‚Äôs kind of a wasted perk slot. I guess I can concede if I had a team it would be different. I‚Äôve come to realize as a survivor the game sucks without friends to enjoy the game with. I mainly play killer
                                    It's ok alone and amazing combined so that's what most people do. Solo queue isn't really the issue it's just that the average player is trash at the game, and the game happens to be killer sided if you put average players against average players (as in bad vs bad). At least when playing with friends communication let's you compensate for individual bad decisions and playing a game with friends is always more fun, that's honestly how I think you are supposed to play the game, either as survivor with friends or as killer if you are solo
                    Skill issue
                        Who said I run DS? Ain‚Äôt nobody
        Off the record, DS, Styptic. Make them earn it.
        Exactly every second counts and those shitties know it. Now we can at least contribute to the match than have our brain dead team mates walk into his saw. If he catches me one, shame on me and so on. That's a much better system than: he hooked you, youre dead.
    Fr, Bubbas do not give 1 singular fuck about endurance with their chainsaw sweep
        Waiting for BHVR to change Bubba's chainsaw attack to a "special attack" and make this specifically not work against recently unhooked Survivors or something.
            Bubbas saw is a special attack
    Yeah. It means nothing at all without extra anti-tunnel protections, and depending on their implementation, could actually buff face camping. Let's say that the unhook is automatic when the meter is full, as you'd think it'd have to be for second hook. That bypasses Reassurance and lets them down again all the faster. And plenty of killers can nullify or flat-out bypass the unhook BT. Pinhead's deep wound add-on is the most egregious, but Clown also greatly slows, Bubba can easily hit multiple times, Trapper can easily lock down entire areas so there's literally no way to leave at all, so on and so forth.
    Yeah not even including nurse, huntress, blight, spirit etc
    They should make it so Bubba cant hit though Endurance. Should only be able to hit you once per power use.
        Endurance already protects you from Bubba, even through his chainsaw
            He can double hit you is what I mean
            If he revs his chainsaw immediately behind you, he can hit you twice in the same charge assuming there's no cover nearby
                Not if are sprint bursting.
                    This would require you to time your Sprint Burst amazingly well and I'll be real honest: Most Survivors won't be able to do it in the scenario you're proposing. They'd have to WALK up to the hook and have it saved and ready and while a lot of people will walk to hooks to save it, a lot wouldn't.
        So what would the advantage of using Bubba be after that.

Like for real, what‚Äôs his power doing other than that?
            Really easy insta downs, aoe power, going though pallets really fast.
                It's also a pretty solid chase/loop tool or denier. If someone is trying to hover a pallet they have to choose to drop it early or risk getting hit trying to get the stun. And people really underestimate how far you can go with all three charges, I've caught a lot of people out as they leave a loop expecting me to run out of steam before I catch them.
                    Haven't played in awhile didn't he have a add on that gives extra distance on good timing hitting your charges
                As a Bubba main myself, his power is not an easy instadown if you know your window techs. He has legitimately zero map pressure. His strength comes from having a strong chase and the ability to wipe pallets out quickly, but if you have 2 other medium skill teammates and an acorn on your team he will lose all his gens. Its why bad bubbas facecamp: he can't harass more than 1 or 2 survivors consistently.
            You know you can chase with him normally and still win games, playing against a bubba who doesn't camp is actually fun.  


But because camping right now is so easy with him everyone is doing that because he is the easiest face camping killer.
            Bubba has an incredibly strong chase power:  It gives him a speed boost, allows him to insta-down survivors,  allows for multiple downs in a single usage, it instantly breaks pallets/walls, and if used properly can completely ignore the endurance effect.  Also, attempting to use a locker to avoid Bubba's chainsaw is a huge risk in and of itself.  The timings of his tantrums can vary based on a few things, and unless the survivor can identify it immediately, chances are they will get grabbed coming out of the locker.  Lastly, while perk dependent, Bubba is one of the few killers that can turn the shack into an absolute death trap if he is using Bamboozle properly.

Bubba is an incredibly versatile killer.  He garnered this reputation because of bad apples choosing to face camp.  That doesn't mean every Bubba does it.
    Free unhook AND regenerates a hook state
And if more survivorsd get close. it feels up slower to not punish swaming,
    This will be the life or death of this feature.

Killers should be punished for camping unnecessarily. Conversely, survivors should be punished for the same thing; where they'll just stand there, expecting the killer to chase them. The problem with that is, that's 2 people not doing gens, potentially 3 if someone else comes to unhook.

I do not want to be punished for what I feel is punishing survivors who just show up to taunt, abuse Off The Record, DS, etc.;
        I genuinely hope they get that part right. I feel like it should stop the bar filling up if survivors are really close, because where else is the killer supposed to go at that point?
            If survivors are close and in a chase I'd say. That way if a killer gets looped near the hooked survivor the killer won't be punished for just playing the game at that point while, simultaneously, if a survivor is sneaking up on the hook it won't punish the hooked survivor in the off chance that the sneaking survivor gets caught.
                I‚Äôm down with that. If the survivor at any point gets in a chase (or ‚Äúcaught‚Äù) and doesn‚Äôt leave the area, then they stop the bar from filling up, regardless of standing still to stop chase or whatever. Any good SWF already has tactics to get survivors off a hook with a killer nearby. Those are the people that will easily find a way to abuse a system like this. Punish them and the face campers and I‚Äôm very happy, but hopefully don‚Äôt punish the nuanced situations.
                    Yup! I love the idea of punishing killers for AFK camping but anyone who has played killer for any period of time have ran into the 'bully squads' who aggressively go after hooks with multiple flashlights, flashbangs, boil overs, flip flops, and more.

If you gave them this then I could 100% see them taking advantage of it which is just entirely not the point. If the killer is making an effort to play the game (i.e. chasing someone) then this system shouldn't be active at that point in time.
                Then survivors would literally just do what they did the last time the devs tried to add something like this and work on gens near the hook and then hide from the killer to stop a chase from occurring. The condition can't, and shouldn't ever be that the bar only stops if the killer is chasing someone near the hook. This is the issue with mechanics like this, they tried them before and they were so abused they didn't even make it out of the PTB. I can't say I would be surprised if that's exactly what happens with this mechanic.
                    I hope this idea gets nuked. Bully squads are already a pain to deal with...
            Trying to answer your question in good faith: commit to the survivor(s) swarming, right? In theory that's what should be encouraged. (I'm in favor of the bar slowing/stopping if survivors try to swarm the hook)
                Yeah, I‚Äôm mostly referring to the SWF swarm tactics, where you‚Äôve just hooked a player and see two other people lingering around. You should not be punished for pressuring them to make a move when 3/4 of the team are right there. I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre 12 yards away. They‚Äôve shown what their plan is. If you go chase one then the other immediately gets the unhook, when if you stay there (Which you weren‚Äôt planning on doing,) you now justifiably have pressure while they‚Äôre going to do they‚Äôre best to take that pressure away.
                    This is my only issue with the change, with how it's currently described

It's a good foundation, I'm just hoping they can work out the kinks.
                    Ok, got it, I'm on board.
                The problem is if more than 1 person comes and you‚Äôre in a good zone for them chasing will destroy you in some circumstances
                    Right; now, *not* chasing will destroy you even more, because you'll lose your hook pressure. So, you'll want to take the lesser evil: Chasing.

I'm generally okay with proxy camping, but you should be focused on at least *two* things at once, even if that includes the hook. That can even be simple things like kicking pallets to create deadzones. Hovering at one spot and going "Unhook so I can have a free hit. I won't chase you when you're within 100m of a pallet." is still basically just camping.
        As a solo queue player or is basically useless if a killer wants to tunnel someone they are hitting that survivor right off the hook 9/10 times, so otr is instantly gone.
            Nah nah, I mean in the specific situations where someone unhooked 20s ago, comes to fuck with your hook and has a minute of Off The Record. It's not super rare for me to be hooking someone and I get into a stalemate where someone with OTR is just standing at the hook, acting as bait because they know they're invincible.
                Then don't take the bait? That's 2 people not doing anything.
                    The worse thing they can do is intentionally body blocking so I can't get the other survivor knowing full well I can't outplay it (especially in certain maps). I'm playing Billy so they obviously do it so I can't insta down their teammate. Like at this point what am I supposed to do aside from tunneling the unhooked survivor? The unhooker already got enough distance.
            That is not true lol most killers that tunnel do not hit you off hook unless they know for sure that you have otr.
                I mean making sure dead hard is off the table when a chase starts after someone is unhooked is a huge plus for killers. This mechanic would be a good change if ds was still useful.
            Yeah i don't know why people think off the record is so good everytime i used it and went against an actual tunneling/face camping killer they just hit you right when they unhook you so your endurance is gone the moment you touch the ground.
        This is a massive crutch to both sides. Killer should never camp without a reason. (EGC, survivors being close w/o doing gens)
As survivors should never swarm the hook when killer is camping, correct play is to smash gens as much as you can while survivor X is being camped
            only one small objection but I do think they said the whole mechanic would deactivate in endgame collapse.
It's a change that is hard to judge without seeing the numbers. It's good it's not an instant effect and reduced by survivors being close to the hook as well. But depending on the numbers it could just be absolutely useless. Same thing if the numbers are too high. Not to mention how multi-level maps affect it.
Curious how this will affect basement camping, since camping the basement entrance isn't very close to the hooks.
    I hope it doesnt do anything to that. Basement should be a lethal place to get hooked.
        Basement should be reworked anyway
            How?
                basement only exists because back in the day when a hook was broken it was permanent, so they added the basement so that there was a spot that you could always hook someone. the least they should do is add a second entrance to the basement.

the scummiest of killers can literally just body block the stairs to wait out the bt.
                    100% they should double the exits.

maybe one outside and one inside the building it spawns in? 

Or maybe just keep the one stairs but double the size. Make it so there are 2 hooks on each side of the stairs. All hooks would be facing the staircase and then there would be a place to slip under the stairs between the two sides. Worst case you hide in the basement till everyone finishes the gens, then you die because they are still camping the stairs. But at least you wasted more of the killers time. 

I think I will conceptualize that big basement and post it later.
                        thats a bit too radical bro
                    I don't think it needs (or should have) a second entrance; the *point* of the basement is it is *supposed to be dangerous* because it is a Killer-sided place to be.

I don't think Killers can "actually" body block the basement, but someone will have to take a hit to get past them in some cases.
                        the point of the basement is the unsabotagable hooks it has no other purpose and is not an excuse for a killer to be an asshole.
                It‚Äôs just a badly designed area. Basically any killer can get to it from out of terror radius before anyone is far from the basement to a loopable area, it‚Äôs easy to block someone on the stairs to ignore unhook endurance, and is extremely easy to facecamp.

All this, because you went down moderately close to either main building or shack, or the killer ran Agitation, a perk anyone can get because it‚Äôs on Trapper.
                    Tbf, the basement is something to be feared. Adding a second entrance would take that away imo
                Honestly it doesn't really need a rework, it should just be gone. What healthy things does it encourage in the game, genuinely? It's a spot that generates boringness, as far as I can tell.
                    It adds balance to the main buildings / killer shack, giving more of a risk to what are usually very powerful loops. It also gurantees hooks that are unable to be sabotaged or broken, preventing complete anti-hook builds from making the game unplayable to the killer.
                    It generates boredom, easier camping and BMing, more likely to be downed right after being unhooked.

I wouldn't say the basements are terrible, but nothing good comes from having them as part of the game.
                        Quit trying to make your loops even more op survivor main
                            The basement has nothing to do with loops
        it still encourages the killer to just sit at the top of basement stairs, they might as well be facecamping at that point. so yeah, that playstyle also needs to be addressed as they aren't participating in normal gameplay.
        It‚Äôs soooo easy for a killer to get a surv to basement, why should that be lethal? Hook camping ruins the game for everyone whether it‚Äôs in basement or not. Should definitely effect standing at the top on the stairs.
Adding it to the test servers later this year, so it's probably still like a year away
    yes, but everyone knows its coming now, so hopefully it turns people away from that kind of gameplay now (and not doing a last hurrah of face camping)
        hahaha  no,     everytime some op/toxic    perk/item gets disabled or nerfed into the ground people are bringing them out and abusing them as hard as they can before the change happens.  


So you can except killers actually doing more face camps until the change.
        Bruh you just know people who are unapologetic/serial campers are just gonna camp harder now because they know they might no longer have it in the near future lol
        Campers certainly have a lot of time to learn how to play
            Let's just hope Bully squads learn that too and stop harassing the killers like here

https://twitter.com/S1niiK/status/1657678689084100610

basically, even if the killer play fair, the survivors won't, from my experience since 2016
        it can still be scratched, like many things were
        Just like the Mori update and basekit Unbreakable
        Right, because players need daddy BHVR to come bail them out whenever they don't like the killer killing them in a way they find distasteful.

I wonder if they'll add in mechanics on the killer side that make survivors run, vault, and repair slower, the longer they loop and slam gens.

I don't particularly care what they're doing except in instances where survivors flood the hook and the final kill of a game. Base kit BT for free practically forces you to secure your kill, and any competent survivor group can juggle hits and body block to make the rescue successful. I also have skepticism of how well the feature is coded and its interaction with multi-floor maps. Good survivors are already smart enough to make strong use of the tools available to them, and killers often have to make decisions to break chase early and quickly because of safety of a particular zone and so on. Imagine what happens when a survivor starts looping above/below a hooked survivor while the remaining players continue slamming gens. The hooked survivor gets to unhook for free, even at a slowed rate, or the chased survivor gets a free pass because he's going to an area that's safe/loopable to the point where the survivor gets the free unhook.

The problem I have with something like this is the control being exerted over players. There are multiple gameplay strategies that people take issue with for one reason or another, but all fall within the rules of the game. Interfering with that based on the incessant whining of a particular side is a really bad idea because everyone will be for it until their side is on the receiving end.
        Before you get all excited, they've promised this before in one of their roadmaps. Lots of things end up never seeing the light of day after they announce it, you can go back and always find 2-3 things they say are "coming at the end of the year!" and they never did. 

Cross progression....they actually gave that one a specific date even lol.
        There is always a last hurrah, on both sides
Not sure if this will affect Leatherface much because he can just double hit the unhooked person
    Honestly, I feel like this might make his weakening add-on more popular. If you have to hit them twice, why not get more BP in the meantime?
I feel like this is only going to encourage bleeding people out.
    Knock Out is the new meta.
    I don‚Äôt really see how except in the case of people who were face campers before being sluggers now, and even then slugging is easier to help teammates out of than a facecamper
        then won't that just encourage the devs to push out the basekit unbreakable?
            Not really. Facecamping is unhealthy because the person being facecamped has absolutely no chance of escape given the killer is playing a camping character like Bubba, hence the new system. 

There‚Äôs plenty of systems currently in the game that allow the counter of slugging, and trying to camp a slug is significantly slower than camping a hook.

Aside from that the main killers who can take advantage of slugging are high mobility/action killers like Blight and Nurse, and chances are a killer main who is displaced by the new anti face camp system is not going to be the type of person to play those killers in that way

    Yeah, it prolly flops like basekit UB but let's see.
        Idk that really wasn't a good change, with the correct format this could be a really good change. Obvs the face camping cohort will be enraged, the only legitimate issue I can see is endgame hooking. If you're kinda close to an open gate you don't have much of a choice than to proxy camp or its just an escape, I suppose by that point you've lost the game already so idk. Excited for the change could be good.
            Btw they've got egc covered this feature according to them will disable in egc.
                Nice think that's fair to killers, it makes the endgame chases more interesting too add a bit more fear.
                    Yup, exactly.
                It should disable when all gens are finished rather than egc.  Survivors can just 99 gates for literally zero penalty.  If the gates are 99, they may as well be open, so facecamping whatever kills you've guaranteed in that situation is still kosher.
            I completely agree. I hope it doesn't flop, if its correctly implemented it could be one of the healthiest changes for the game up there with basekit bt.
        Disagree.  UB being base kit has a lot more harm to general gameplay to try and address slugging when face camping is a far more specific issue that has much less of an impact if/when addressed.
            Exactly, I didn't mean to say that they're equal and therefore other would also flop,
my bad.

        Bruh you cannot be calling behavior's solution needlessly convoluted and then in the same comment suggest hooks randomly teleport mid hook progress.

Lmao.

                Because giving someone a free unhook has got to be one of the stupidest things you could ever do to ease the whining of players about a gameplay tactic they're discontent with. If you want players to not camp, which is in no way against the rules of the game, then you have to make other options more attractive, not install some moronic punitive measure.
                    >If you want players to not camp, which is in no way against the rules of the game,

If the devs are actively trying to punish face camping, I think it's safe to say that it, at the very least, goes against the devs wishes.

Making face camping straight up against the roles is a very tricky thing to do, if they wanted to, because you'd have people potentially getting bans for protecting a swarmed hook.
                        > If the devs are actively trying to punish face camping, I think it's safe to say that it, at the very least, goes against the devs wishes.

Or, they're catering, once again, to the survivor player base. It's a numbers game at the end of the day, after all. If it were never intended to be an allowed or legitimized strategy, it would've been programmed that way from the start. Now, there *have* been things that were in need of fixing, Trapper traps directly underneath hooked survivor's feet, for instance, and they've been fixed. Addressing an issue is not the same as addressing an entire gameplay element. 

> Making face camping straight up against the roles is a very tricky thing to do, if they wanted to, because you'd have people potentially getting bans for protecting a swarmed hook.

Correct, which is why you leave players to their own devices and take the coddling countermeasures out of the equation entirely. If a player is to be punished for his actions, let it be in the way his game turns out. I don't think survivors should be so emboldened as to run into the killer's face and provoke him, but they should be allowed to do so. If they manage to capture his attention, but get camped to death for it, then that's what they have to accept. You have to be completely brainless and stupid to think you somehow deserve a "fair shot at escaping" if you pull something like that. Similarly, if you sit on top of someone as Leatherface holding your chainsaw, you should expect every generator on the map to go up as the survivors work with impunity. You'd have to be likewise brainless and stupid to think you somehow deserve a longer game or more time to chase and kill survivors if you pull something like that.

I don't particularly enjoy camping from either side, but I dislike even more the concept that gameplay elements that are deemed via social convention to be dishonorable or inconveniencing have outside power and constraints used on it. That's a really bad precedent to set. If something is not expressly against the rules of the game, then it's considered fair play, regardless of how cutthroat of a tactic it may be. 

You may not enjoy being camped to death, but if I have you on the hook in a position where I have quick access to multiple generators and can simultaneously defend all of them, all you're doing is punishing my smart and advantageous play because of someone's irritation at their own disadvantaged position. Killers already have to put out a disproportionately higher amount of effort as a role, and even more so considering the power of survivors in this game, so when I manage to swing things into my favor, it's bullshit that any outside force would undermine that, particularly when it's gained through forming a daisy chain temper tantrum. Sure, this leads to the door being open to people being face camped at 5 gens 30 seconds into the match if they're unfortunate enough to go down that quickly, but that's the risk you run, and once you start this external control, the line inevitably gets pushed more and more.
                    They just *changed* the rules of the game. Because it‚Äôs a game. That can change.

Now, pray they don‚Äôt change them any further.
                        No, they didn't. If they were to change the rules, it would be reportable and bannable. Find me something that expressly states "thou shalt not camp". They're enacting punitive gameplay elements for camping through this proposed feature, but that doesn't mean the rules are changing.

By that logic, we might as well assume tunneling is against the rules because of Decisive Strike and Off the Record.
                            You are fixating on the word "rules", while also incorrectly representing it.

"Rules" can refer to general game design terms, like "The rules for Dead Hard allow you to use it only after you've been unhooked". Video games are not like sports where they can sweep in a referee to yell "Camping!" Mechanics, often also known as rules, are their way of enforcing general behaviors that make the game more fun.

You're like the guy insisting they bring back TDM in a shooter, because you can't just camp in a corner to get kills in an objective-based game mode. Face it; the rules changed, and you need to change your play style with them.
                                > You are fixating on the word "rules", while also incorrectly representing it.

No, I'm using the word as it is. *You* are incorrectly representing it with the following:

> "Rules" can refer to general game design terms, like "The rules for Dead Hard allow you to use it only after you've been unhooked".

Rules for activation of a perk and rules that govern gameplay are in no way mutually exclusive. What activates something might be "governed by a set of parameters", but that's not anywhere close to "you may not use exploits or bugs that break the game's design". I can't believe I'm actually having to explain that.

> Video games are not like sports where they can sweep in a referee to yell "Camping!"

Of course not, but they *can*, however, sweep in a referee to yell "GLITCH EXPLOIT! BUG ABUSE! HACKS OR CHEATS USED!"

> Mechanics, often also known as rules, are their way of enforcing general behaviors that make the game more fun.

Mechanics are not rules. Again, I'm flabbergasted that this has to be explained, and that you're honestly trying to make that stretch. Saying that there's a rule governing how fast movement speed is coded in the game is the same as a rule governing not being able use external programs to augment your speed has got to be one of the most laughable attempts at rationalization I've ever heard. And more fun for whom? Survivors? That sure seems to be the prevailing theme here. I'm sure killers are going to have plenty of fun not being able to play defense under this ridiculous design change while simultaneously being castigated as immoral people. The assumption is all camping is face camping, which is as stupid as this proposal. 

> You're like the guy insisting they bring back TDM in a shooter, because you can't just camp in a corner to get kills in an objective-based game mode.

No, I'm the guy that says "let players play however they see fit". I'm the guy that says lay the rules of the game, and then get out of the way. I'm the guy that says there are multiple ways to play a game, and whether or not you find it pleasing doesn't make a difference. I'm the guy that says "in this objective-based game mode, if I decide to choose to zerg the bomb site or play slowly and methodically, that's my choice. If I want to play patiently and let my opponents overextend and pick them off to reduce their numbers advantage, then that's my prerogative. If I want to run in guns a-blazin' because I'm grossly outnumbered and I don't want to play out 10 minutes of slow pushing and corner clearing, then that's my prerogative, and you complaining about my recklessness has no weight except what *you* choose to give it".

> Face it; the rules changed, and you need to change your play style with them.

There's no real adaptation for me to make, save for no longer being able to defend hooks. I guess if survivors fuck up their gen pathing and end up in a 3 gen, then I'm gonna be forced to either walk far away to hook them, leaving him wide open for easy rescue, hook him in the middle of the 3 gen, but watch helplessly as he escapes for free, or hook him in the 3 gen, and be forced to leave the area while the other survivors leave him sitting on the hook, possibly with Reassurance, while they finish their last gen because I can't be near the hook and they're using the hooked survivor as a shield. I don't indiscriminately face camp hooks because it's not helpful for the overall goal for killer. If I have a defensible position that puts the ball in my court, I do so, but if I don't have anything to defend, then I go hunting for my next chase. 

I suspect the heart of the problem with survivors disliking camping is the timing and method. I haven't heard a great many complaints about hard camping a hook during EGC, but hear plenty of complaints of hard camping at 5 gens. Nobody's saying their frustration isn't warranted, but I'm most definitely saying their frustration at someone playing something poorly doesn't warrant outside intervention or moralizing.
            ‚ÄúGosh, I sure hate having to mind my distance from hooks. It‚Äôs so dumb to have to stay so far out to avoid letting people unhook themse-‚Äú

*Mystical entity sound effect*

‚ÄúFelix got moved over there!? Oh my god! They‚Äôve got two guys over there just about to stick a gen! See!? He‚Äôs already unhooked and safe! They stuck the gen! They double healed him!‚Äù

I think this self-unhook solution is definitely the way to go.
                Plus like it's not even the first time killers have to be mindful of hook distance in relation to other players.  Survivors actively playing to help each other are already more than capable of getting unhooks without trading.

So the killer already has to think against competent teams.
        >Camping killers just get to tunnel out someone faster as the survivor attempts to unhook themselves only to realize the killer is still right there and they're not getting away.

The difference though, is that this would have happened anyways but now the other survivors don't have to attempt to trade or potentially end up with 2 people downed. They can just stay on gens now while the killer camps.
            [deleted]
                I mean, anyone decent at the game is going to see they‚Äôre being face camped, watch the meter fill, and wait until they‚Äôre about to hit stage 2 before they rip it. They‚Äôre not going to be there for ‚Äúless‚Äù time.

Then the killer is guaranteed to waste 2 minutes staring at them (not even including the time in the intermediary chases) while 3 people are hard committing generators.
        Honestly yeah that's how you punish face camping. One change I would do to your suggestion is make it so the gauge will pause when the killer is in chase
        Hook progression stopping is a moronic idea. Did you not see how abused it got when it got added as an activateable perk? I don‚Äôt want to be punished cause some annoying feng decided to chase near hook.
            No, I didn‚Äôt. Can you link me to a video of hook pausing being abused?
        This needs more upvotes. Genuinely way better idea and could actually fix how boring it is when you get tunneled out.
    I don't like the change as survivors will purposely try to loop near hooked players. If I chase someone to a hooked player, it shouldn't benefit the person on the hook just because I'm chasing someone else.
        Except they specifically state if there's a survivor near then the bar slows down.

Chasing someone near a hooked player 100% benefits you more then it benefits them right now, this change is looking to fix that so that a hooked player doesn't get screwed because a killer doesn't want to leave the hook, that's all. If you're not hook camping then this shouldn't effect you.
            It shouldn't benefit the hooked player at all. Even if the slows the meter down, it still punishes the killer for doing exactly what this change is wanting which is to not camp the hooked survivor.

Imagine you're a killer who hooked a survivor and then you leave the hook. Mission accomplished but then your next survivor just runs to the hook and starts looping you around the hooked survivor. All this does is fill the 'camp' meter even though the killer isn't camping.

It needs to stop completely when someone is getting chased nearby. Not hiding nearby, but actively in a chase. That way waiting to spring a quick unhook doesn't punish the hooked survivor while chasing someone who jumped the gun won't punish the killer.
                >It shouldn't benefit the hooked player at all

This is literally what we have in the game right now. Someone gets hooked, and weather the killer face camps or the survivors loop near hook, *all of that leads to the hooked player losing a state or dying*. And they have no say or control over it.

All this change is doing is giving the hooked survivor a way to get off hook if they have no other option. 

>It needs to stop completely when someone is getting chased nearby. Not hiding nearby, but actively in a chase.

I disagree. If you're activating chase and you're still close enough to the hook to where this meter would be charging, then it should still be going. The killer is making a choice to be near the hook, which makes it VERY difficult to get unhooks, that's exactly what this meter is for.

And if there's enough survivors near hook to where the killer would want to stay next to it anyways, the the meter does slow down. All this is going to punish is players staying very close to the hook for extended periods of time, nobody else.
                    Then all a survivor has to do is run to the hooked survivor during chase to punish the killer. That's not a decision, it's not a strategy for the killer, it's just outright punishment that the killer has zero control over.

That's counterintuitive for the game.

Under what I'm talking about, if the killer decides to run around looking for survivors then that's a choice. If the other survivors decide to engage near hook then that's a choice.

Under what you're proposing there is no choice because the best strategy will almost always be: Take killer to hooked survivor to punish them both in time and getting a survivor off hook.
                        And we go back to my first comment:

The meter slows down if there's a survivor near.

How fast exactly do you think this meter is filling up to think that looping the killer near hook is going to be a viable strat? Do you think it's like 10 second meter or something?

And besides, lets make one thing clear: looping the killer near another downed/hooked survivor is literally one of the worst things a survivor can do. if you get a downed player near the hook that's usually just a GG. Having a meter that slowly fills up that lets someone get off hook after an extended period of time won't change that, and looping near hook isn't going to be viable.

Remember, this meter isn't a frontline defense, it's meant as a last resort for if the hooked player is getting relentlessly facecamped. They don't want it to effect people NOT face camping, and I think you're just imagining the worst possible scenario of giving everyone basekit deliverance if a killer stays near hook for 5 seconds.
                            It's posts like this that make me glad that the majority of people here aren't on the design team because you're advocating for the killer to be punished for doing anything but camping. I'm not really sure how this fact eludes you or how unintuitive it is from understanding what is happening in the game state but honestly I'm not really going to exert any more effort here. You've got salty survivor syndrome all over you so Imma head out.

But hey, we'll see how it plays out when it hits the PTB later this year.
                                Homie what are you talking about haha. I'm not salty about anything and I'm not advocating for anything.

I don't want the killer to get punished for playing the game normally, neither does BHVR. All this change does is make it so if the killer stays very close to hook, then the hooked survivor can get a way off hook without having to sit there for 2 minutes and die. Seems like a pretty darn reasonable change to make.

All the killer has to do to prevent this is...not stay right next to the hook for a long time. It's that easy. It just sounds to me like you want to be able to camp hooks, which unfortunately is not what BHVR or the majority of the community wants.
                            Don‚Äôt bother debating him. ‚ÄúLooping near the hook‚Äù is a parrot phrase that hobbyist facecampers use to shut down discussion.

If they ever actually tried to play a pallet or moonwalked to hide their red stain and knew how chases work, they would know it is a hilariously misleading notion.
                        >Under what you're proposing there is no choice because the best strategy will almost always be: Take killer to hooked survivor to punish them both in time and getting a survivor off hook.

Do we even know how slow it goes or how long it takes? If having a survivor around makes it significant slower, then this is an awful 'tactic'

So instead of leading the killer away so someone can make a save, you decide to waste time by:

\- Not doing gens

\- Risk getting knocked next to a hooked survivor (better hope there is a good loop nearby or you'll die pretty quick)

\- Not allowing the hooked survivor to be rescued
                    > Someone gets hooked, and weather the killer face camps or the survivors loop near hook, all of that leads to the hooked player losing a state or dying. And they have no say or control over it.

Correct, they don't, *nor should they*. If you found yourself hooked, you're now completely powerless over your fate unless you have Deliverance at the ready. Sure, it sucks if you get one hooked because of one reason or another, but that's the risk you take when you load into a game. You're not entitled to any specific amount of time or outcome, and whether or not you find your death circumstances palatable or not is irrelevant.

> All this change is doing is giving the hooked survivor a way to get off hook if they have no other option.

Meaning they're being given a free second or third chance (depending on design and circumstances) that's unearned, and through doing so, placing Marionette strings on the killer. I wonder when the day comes that survivors get a few of these to favor the killer side of things.

> The killer is making a choice to be near the hook, which makes it VERY difficult to get unhooks, that's exactly what this meter is for.

If this isn't the most nonsensical take I've ever heard, I don't know what is. How small-minded does one have to be to *actually* rationalize this particular point in the way you just tried to. I'm not going to insult your intelligence here, but you've reached a pretty low point with this one. Think of the immense power in chases survivors *already* have with the strength of tiles and their prevalence and spawn patterns. Chases, particularly against M1 killers, can last 90 seconds or more with relative ease, granted the survivors aren't braindead trash (in which case, you shouldn't balance anything around them anyway). If the survivor leads the chase near the hook and is skilled enough at looping, then the killer is in a lose-lose situation if he continues to chase. This basically forces the killer to break chase anytime the survivor runs that direction. This harkens back to the era of infinites, and the middle finger survivors would give you as they ran to the Safety Tree/Magic School Bus/etc. Good luck getting killers to play the game in that case.

> And if there's enough survivors near hook to where the killer would want to stay next to it anyways, the the meter does slow down. All this is going to punish is players staying very close to the hook for extended periods of time, nobody else.

That slowdown better be pretty damn significant, or else you'll just end up with survivors dancing on the edge of safety. The amount of power this puts in the hands of survivors could be absolutely unreal, and SWF is already completely stupid in terms of the power imbalance that already exists between survivor and killer. 

> And besides, lets make one thing clear: looping the killer near another downed/hooked survivor is literally one of the worst things a survivor can do.

Except when they have a safe zone and a survivor that can freely unhook themselves because of this stupid "fairness" mechanic.

> I don't want the killer to get punished for playing the game normally, neither does BHVR.

Camping *is* a normal part, as is tunneling, as is gen rushing, as is bully squad strats, and unless you're willing to curtail the power of those things, then your hypocritical diatribe is worthless. *Nothing* in the official rules of the game says "and when you unhook, you *must* leave the area **immediately**".

> All the killer has to do to prevent this is...not stay right next to the hook for a long time. It's that easy.

Sure. So when I get a survivor hooked in an area of multiple generators that I can defend all pretty well simultaneously, I now have to abandon my position and go sit in the corner of the map with my hand down my pants. God forbid I defend my position, try securing a kill, and put any momentum in my side. Heavens no, that might make some childish survivor player cry their eyeballs out.

> It just sounds to me like you want to be able to camp hooks, which unfortunately is not what BHVR or the majority of the community wants.

Oh I *do* love a good character argument. I mean, it's possible that someone could just have a logical or rational viewpoint on a particular thing, but it's best to assume they're just a bad person, just in case. I guess seeing something from a principled perspective and opposing it because of that just isn't feasible. Yes, I'm being sarcastic here, because you have to put on some very serious blinders to not realize that if you invoke power to change or remove gameplay strategies, in any direction, there will likely come a time when that power is used *against* you.

Imagine the outrage if any of the commonly complained about survivor elements were treated this way. Survivor-biased players would lose their hive-minds if SWF was removed, extra generators were added, or any other point complained about whether or not its complaints are warranted.

EDIT: Another user making his emotional appeal and tucking tail and blocking me. Apparently valuing principles of player freedom in choice of how to play is a hot take. Who knew?
                        I can *feel* the anger you clearly had while typing this. Really appreciate the insults by the way, very cool of you.

This change is giving people who were going to have their games ruined, another chance. It's encouraging killers to actually engage with the full game instead of just camping. It's a good thing no matter how much you personally feel entitled to camping for kills in this game.

The fact that you said people aren't entitlted to any specific outcome is one of the most unempathetic takes I've read on this sub. You really should try to remember that the people you're playing against *are people,* and your desire to win in a casual game that doesn't record or rank wins, shouldn't supercede someones desire to have a chance at having fun. 

Yes as a matter of fact, people should be entitled to matches where someone doesn't single them out and ruin their match, matches where they can get the chance to have fun, win or lose. Same way killers should be entitled to not getting infinite looped, and dealing with infinite and quick self healing, win or lose. This isn't the wild west where everyone fights for their own experience, it's a *game* and it's up to the devs to make sure everyone can have fun.

You seem to be forgetting that *this is not a competitive game*. There is no ranked mode, there is no ranked ladder, you can't see your MMR, there's no significant reward for winning, the game doesn't even define what a win is. Playing to win at all costs is passable in games that focus heavily on competition with ranked ladders and such (you know, e-sports titles), but dbd is not that. It's a casual game that's supposed to be fun.

As such, getting camped out at 5 gens isn't fun, this change is trying to remedy that. And guess what, if it's problematic it will be tuned until it's fine. That's what tests are for. I think you're *far* too caught up in the competitive aspects of this game and are forgetting that most of us are just here for some good fun.

Don't bother responding, because I'm blocking you. You're clearly not fit to be having a rational discussion about this.
            Slows but doesn't stop completely.  
Also these kind of radius mechanics in the game so far have been either spheres or infinitely tall cylinders so on The Game and Midwhich survivors will abuse free deliverances out of it by trying to get chases to above or below the hook.  
If the hook is on Midwich in an inner courtyard next to the wall - you will count as "close to hook" if you are in the classroom behind, despite the walking distance to the hook being a long path.
                I think you're overblowing how fast this meter is going to be filling up, and how far away it will work lol. You're describing it like it'll fill up in 10 seconds even if the killer is on a different floor or in a different room, which I highly doubt is the intention.

They're not tryna give everyone basekit deliverance, they're trying to stop face camping. If you're not face camping then you have nothing to worry about.
                    They literally say it fills up through floors and it can result in unintended punishment for killers. I don't trust BHVR to implement this correctly.
                        Yes, I meant that it won't fill up quickly if they're far enough. Yes if you're just one room over it'll probably still be filling up, but it's gonna be very slow.
                            How slow do you think it's gonna be? My guess is it'll probably be the same as wiggle bar so like 16 seconds. It's pretty easy to loop a killer for 16 seconds around a hook.
                                There's no way they're gonna make it 16 seconds even if it's JUST the killer face camping.

And besides, if someone is looping near the hook then the bar fills up much more slowly. Survivors being near slow it down, remember?
    Because it‚Äôs an awful idea.
    That would be ideal
    I hope it goes through with the added caveat that killer receive basekit buffs as well. I'm not watching stream so idk what's all coming, I'll check the sub ig
    Yep, just like the Finisher Mori, like, the concept required more work for sure (specially UB perk) but the general idea was fine, or at lest the intention. But of course Killers cried about it because anything that targets their unhealthy play-styles is bad.
        The finisher mori had legit huge issues though. 

For once thing, if all 4 survcivors went down really early, everyone just died with no counter to it. Bad. 

Everyone getting a free Unbreakable was bad for killers like oni, myers and twins who realy on slugging. 

&#x200B;

It had a good core, but it had plenty of issues.
            > For once thing, if all 4 survcivors went down really early, everyone just died with no counter to it.

I mean, if that happens currently the game's pretty much over anyways, unless someone brought UB. With the proposed change they could at least get a chance, unless they all went down in >40 seconds.


> Everyone getting a free Unbreakable was bad for killers like oni, myers and twins who realy on slugging.

The recovery time got increased though, it went from 30 seconds to 40/45 (?) seconds... If you needed to slug for more than that I feel like it's OK to get punished for it.

UB (perk) was the main issue, but again, it's something that can get worked around, like making it a one time use still or have it work like Built to Last in which every subsequent recovery is less effective.

Again, the concept needed work, but I feel like the overall idea was fine, targeting the most annoying types of slugging.
                The idea i thought was fine but, but it defently needing more time in the oven is all.
                I've had multiple games where everyone has gone down but because my power struggle builds runs unbreakable I've been able to pick myself back up and we eventually won, I'd be so sad if they ever added that finisher mori the way they were planning it.
        I didn‚Äôt think it would have been that hard. Make it so the last survivor mori (the yellow one) is built in the kit.
        >anything that targets their unhealthy play-styles is bad.

have you ever thought why they use 'unhealthy' playstyles, or why are these so effective?
    i mean probably camping is  thing but its not like you can just allow the other suriviors to unhook scott free either it also depends on the size because some of the smaller maps will have issues
    That‚Äôs something they have to be ready for: The feedback will be negative because a tiny, vocal, and extremely toxic minority of killer players just love face camping.

My hope is for them to spot out the bot accounts with 2 days post history criticizing it, and move forward anyway, as they should have done with BaseUB (even if that did need some small fixes)
remember when they said they didn't want to make kindred base kit because it would make the game too complicated for newer players ? because this mechaninc clearly sounds extremly intuitive and not at all like a massively over-engineered band-aid that will probably be either completly useless or completly broken based on it's numbers
    I look forward to having to keep track of yet another mechanic as a killer.
I think the "bar" should decrease when the killer isn't in proximity.

If it's cumulative, it'll punish killers from simply passing by or having the surv hooked in the middle of a 3 gen (a very valid strategy).
    That‚Äôs a good idea! Though it should tick down slowly, so that killers can‚Äôt just dip in and out of the radius repeatedly to guard a hooked survivor
        If the distance is correct, even "dipping in and out" would just be proximity camping, which is fair strategy (3 gen situation mostly)  and certainly not "face camping" as they go out their way to say this is meant to deter.
            Absolutely! I‚Äôm excited/curious to see how it‚Äôs implemented, whether both killer and survivor can see a visual radius of it, aswell as how large the radius is. Hopefully it‚Äôs done well as to not be completely useless or ridiculously overpowered
    If a killer is simply passing by, it sounds like the idea would be that the bar would build, but not enough for them to unhook.

Keep in mind, the bar is basically racing against the entity progression meter. As long as the self-unhook doesn't fill before that, the killer's pressure stays fine. I would wager it can be thought of in a simple way like "The killer can be within the radius for no more than 30sec(?) of the entity progress before the unhook meter fills", which still definitely allows for walking back and forth from kicking a gen or something.
        That's still bad especially on smaller maps. It could happen incidentally or survivors can use their hooked teammate at as a semi safe zone.

It would punish you for even going to check to see if there's a survivor going for the unhook.
I suspect "proxy camping" will be the next complaint, though.
    Huntresses lookin at this change: *pathetic*     
That said - better than nothing
    I won't deny it, I've proxy camped as killer.

The good part of it for survivors is, if they can get close enough to the hooks before I realize they're nearby, they can get away with at most an injury. If I've created a deadzone that forces a trade, that's something I've earned by committing to prior chases, and may require survivors to play more aggressively or in teams.
Does this work in endgame? Camping in endgame is kinda necessary sometimes
    They said it turns off when the gates are powered.

Basically like how off the record shuts off at that point.
    it's disabled on egc so you can camp when the exit games are powered lol
        Ooooof course, they just refuse to take away the killer‚Äôs free kill for facecamping in endgame lol
  
I get there‚Äôs nothing else to do but that doesn‚Äôt require giving a consolation prize for just having someone hooked in endgame.
  
Edit:  people seem to be really up in arms about this.  My main issue is not that camping EXISTS in endgame.  I get that it‚Äôs clearly the only thing a killer CAN do right now.  My problem is that it becomes STRONGER in endgame because they purposely disable any protection against it.  In that sense, camping as a strategy is REWARDED in endgame as opposed to any other time.
  
While we‚Äôre on the topic, yes, I hate hatch too.  It incentivizes both sides playing shitty (hiding while your teammate dies, and slugging for a 4k) and would be better off being reworked into a ‚Äúfinal chase‚Äù mechanic heavily favoring the killer‚Äôs side.
            I mean unhooking yourself in endgame is basically guaranteed escape. Good teamwork is too.

If a killer has someone hooked in endgame, they're allowed to have that pressure. I don't see how it's fair that once the gates are open the killer is helpless. I think it's balanced the way it currently is.
                Survs want those free endgame escapes, so they can heal up, then wait to teabag the killer in the gate.
            So sorry that the gates being open doesn't mean you get an auto-win.

The only objective left for the killer at that point IS the hook. If you get caught during EGC then that's on you. The whole point then is if your team will come to get you or not. If you could just deli yourself off then the killer might as well just AFK the moment the gates open.
                That‚Äôs fine and dandy, but please explain why camping needs to become MORE effective in endgame?
                    Because, as the devs already said, the killer has no other objective. During the regular game the killer has gens to protect and the survivors has no where to go if they get caught.

But during the EGC the survivors can escape to 100% safety and the killer really only has one objective once someone is hooked: the hooked survivor. If the killer leaves that hook you know, I know, and everyone else knows that the odds of the killer getting anyone else are relatively low.

So punishing the killer for playing to their only objective isn't fair or good for the game. Like sucks that you got caught, it's what happens during that stage.
            So what would we do? Just chase you to gate yet someone freely unhooks?
                Whatever you feel like.  Not that hard of a concept.  Try to catch someone out, force them out of the gate, or stand there and they unhook themselves.
  
Or, y‚Äôknow, don‚Äôt let them reach that phase of the game to begin with if you think you ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù a kill.
                    Okay, I‚Äôll just tunnel out harder than. This just gives an incentive to slow down Gens even more which I‚Äôm all for. To not let them get to the end phase.
                        As if you wouldn‚Äôt already do that.  At least the perks to prevent that actually work up until endgame.
            Oh it's not free, I've rescued and been rescued from endgame facecamps quite a number of times.
                It‚Äôs very free as long as you run any killer with STBFL or a chase power.
            > I get there‚Äôs nothing else to do but that doesn‚Äôt require giving a consolation prize for just having someone hooked in endgame.

I suppose you feel differently about hatch being a consolation prize as well.
                Nope, hatch has been dumb as shit as long as it‚Äôs existed and, like the disabling of anti tunnel perks in endgame, incentives shitty gameplay like letting your teammate die for hatch or slugging to prevent a hatch escape.  Would be better to do away with it and rethink the system.  
  
Ideally, we‚Äôd just get rid of the whole ‚Äúprotection perks disable in endgame‚Äù and then rework hatch to some sort of ‚Äúfinal chase‚Äù mechanic heavily weighted in the killer‚Äôs favor.
    Nope they said it disables as soon as the exit gates are powered
Slugging is about to look really good.
Sure its stops facecamping but it doesnt stop killers from tunneling through the base kit BT
    Literally tunneling wouldn't be an issue if they revert DS back to 5s stun. You can't stop tunneling but sometimes it's a good thing, there are gameplay interacts around it unlike camping.
        I 100% agree with this. The meta is changed enough where it wouldn‚Äôt be run by *everybody*, but it‚Äôd actually have a purpose unlike its current version.
        if DS gets reverted, i want CoB and Pain Res get reverted also
    It's a good thing that the change isn't meant to be a swiss army knife that solves all of the "annoying" ways a killer can play into a survivor.

Obviously the solution BH is proposing isn't perfect.  What is important is if it does what it is meant to do and the trade off(s) it brings are worth it or not.
    Endurance really should just make you lose your collision with the killer while it's active.
I imagine this will actually incentivize face-camping even more. The reason is because now the killer knows that the survivor can unhook themselves, there's a greater likelihood that they'll do so and they can opt to tunnel them out much faster. It's not like killers like nurse/blight/spirit have a hard time closing that gap.

ADD: I‚Äôll try to be fair though, how to fix this strategy is really difficult‚Äîwhat are they to do? Nothing? Here‚Äôs my suggestion: consecutive hooks don‚Äôt further the hook state, instead it resumes the progress. This isn‚Äôt a 100% fix, but I think it gets more at why killers camp/tunnel in the first place which is to skew it to a much more manageable 3v1 scenario. By dramatically slowing down this process of consecutive hooks, you incentivize them to rotate targets more which I think is more in line with what players want.
    Why would survivors unhook themselves early? They'll wait for the 60 seconds to be nearly up before doing so.

If they're even decent, they'll use 10sec BT to vault a window, and then the killer has to handle another entire chase. Now they've wasted well over a minute trying to force second stage, with absolutely nothing stopping the other 3 survivors doing gens (normally, some of them would get off to unhook, but not against a camper)
        While I agree that would be the strategic take, I would say that the impulsive take is more likely to take over. Why? Because what's more fun? Actually interacting with the map, or hanging doing nothing on the hook? People will opt for the chance to unhook themselves and I think killers will capitalize on that fact. Given, this is just a prediction, it's hard to say without hard data what the tendency will be; what we do know is that under the current meta it's been highly favorable to tunnel somebody out of the match.
            Survivors spend their whole game *buying time* for their teammates to do other things by leading the killer on chases. Some of them even appreciate hook time as a brief "time out" from having to chase. I really think you misunderstand the psychology of playing survivor.
                I don't, I have nearly 6k hours in this game, probably majority as survivor.   
Of course survivors try to waste time, but the moment that it becomes a 3v1, they're severely disadvantaged and that's the main reason why killers play in the way that they do. While say a well-coordinated swf will take the strategic option, most people will opt for the more interactive approach because it's personally more fun than not doing anything. Games do not last long enough for there to be the 'let me take a break incentive'. I think you really misunderstand the psychology of playing survivor.
It's not a problem for bubbas who don't do this. A good change though
Should be disabled when exit gates are powered.
    good news: it is
    True. Endgames should be about securing a kill. I think devs have said in the past that the endgame is their favorite part of the game, iirc.
Sure hope theres at least an AoE or HUD indicator for killers. I wouldn't want to lose my hook to proximity just cause the hook in use is within the patrol path of my 3 gen. Especially if survivors are forcing me near hooks by working on nearby gens.
Bubba with iri flesh does not give a fuck.
But is it going to change much tho? Someone camping you is going to tunnel you, so 9/10 they are going to hit you as soon as you are off the hook so their goes the built in bt, otr, and dh in the first second of the chase. Not to mention ds nerfed stun.
So what if another survivor gets chased next to the hook??
    they said it will make the bar fill at a reduced rate
        Why should the bar fill at all? Survivors shouldn't lead a killer to an active hook and should be punished harder for that.
            I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs so that if you‚Äôve been getting hard facecamped and your bar is on like 90% you can still get the effect if one of your teammates is a moron.
            The problem is the one who gets punished is still the one on hook, not the one who lead the killer there
    it slows down.
The idea I had was that survivors can now face-camp each other if they hang out with the killer.
On paper I think it is pretty great! How good it is, depends on the implementation. But that makes it exciting since even if its initial implementation is not great it could be fixed by some number tweaking.
Bye bye bubba streamers :)
    [removed]
        True, but now all other survivors know the person on hook can unhook, themselves, letting them crank gens as fast as possible.  


Meanwhile, the survivor on the hook will unhook themselves last moment before hitting stage two, do a bit of chase with basekit BT and then repeat on the 2nd hookstage.
        [removed]
            [removed]
            No it doesn't, you can easily double hit a unhooked survivor as bubba in a single sweep with addons
            Bubba main. Not really that hard, just need to time it.
            bubba can still catch up to sb
            Not even almost impossible. Bubba picks up a lot of speed when he's using the chainsaw. You'll get downed again quickly as sure as night follows day
I wish they would just slowdown or pause the timer if the killer hovers for too long. I know that‚Äôs not perfect but it would incentivize finding another survivor.
"Bubbas are fucked now", but... Bubbas can easily chew through BT though. (If they are smart enough to use their chainsaw efficiently to get a double tap ofc), no matter if it's self unhook or any unhook for that matter.

Not to say that I am not satisfied with this though! I am happy for this change, as it actually give people a chance without punishing the killer harshly if there are survivors doing some shenanigans near the hooks (aka looping very near or smth like that where the killer is forced to stay).

 It only really punishes actual campers and it doesn't actually impede too much in comp DBD where some form of camping is used (usually it's near the death of the survivor, to ensure to kill and to avoid a last minute save), so even comp players are fine, only "hardcore" campers get punished by this new system.

For once, BHVR really did think this solution through. I am impressed and happy with them
Kindred value.
MFers on the game and midwitch üíÄ
there is so much they need to get right with this...but i think honestly it's the wrong approach with the meter. i think they just read the forums and thats what ppl suggested which is never a way to solve an actual problem. i really feel they should get creative with this stuff. 

also 
what if basement...?

what if survivors hover really close to the zone but don't fully get in it?

what if there are gens really close and you're zoning an area?

how does it work with two story buildings and walls?

how will it effect leatherface who can just double hit anyway and is the most notorious face camper?

+many more...they got a lot of work to do i think....
    I would wager for the past year, they've been prototyping various anti-camping mechanisms before settling on this one. Highly doubt this is their first attempt at it.

> what if survivors hover really close to the zone but don't fully get in it?

Then chase them.

> what if there are gens really close and you're zoning an area?

I could still see this working fine through proxy camping. Say, an area only has one approach, has a nearly-done generator you've kicked, and a hook victim. You'd guard the approach to the area, not sit in front of the hook. Even if the victim does unhook themselves, 10sec BT might not get them out of that region. (Meanwhile, survivors could counter you by teaming up to distract you)

> how will it effect leatherface who can just double hit anyway and is the most notorious face camper?

The fact that it doesn't fix literally every killer imbalance shouldn't be a reason not to do it. Even for leatherface, while it's going to be easier to facecamp than most of the roster, it's still going to be *harder* than it was before since survivors no longer need to unhook.
        >I would wager for the past year, they've been prototyping various anti-camping mechanisms before settling on this one. Highly doubt this is their first attempt at it.

have you played this game long? do you even remember the last patch before the PTB? 

>Then chase them.

What I mean here is the survivor doesn't come close enough to commit, but far enough away to make the chase worthless.

>The fact that it doesn't fix literally every killer imbalance shouldn't be a reason not to do it. Even for leatherface, while it's going to be easier to facecamp than most of the roster, it's still going to be harder than it was before since survivors no longer need to unhook.

but the fact that it won't work on the most widely used face camper has to be an issue.

        It's originally from world of warcraft iirc, there's two factions/races that couldn't understand each other so in game some letters got mixed around, lols or something like that was changed into kekw for the other side. This is all just based off of memory though

So all chases go to the hooked survivor now? Great idea
Whats the radius
    Dynamic. Strong up close, tapers off with distance. This is to soft counter proxy camping.
Two great ideas I‚Äôve seen in comments: killer should have some way to know whether they‚Äôre ‚Äòwithin range‚Äô or not - esp. on multi-level maps. Also, it‚Äôd be nice if the progress would slowly decline when the killer is no longer in radius
Unnerving presence shadownerfed
Depending on how far away a killer needs to be for the bar to start moving and how fast it fills,this could be a great change. That being said,the bar not stopping if there's survivors around the hook is a dumb fucking idea cuz it sounds so goddamn easy to exploit
And now you get tunneled. BHVR dosen't know how to balance the game.

They need to fix body blocking, especially when it comes to hooking.
sounds like a bad idea
next hotfix: removed face camp counter from basement hooks.
    oh noooooooo
I think it can be really good for soloq but we're going to see so much more ds and off the record because of it lmao.  


I'm a bit worried/curious on the more high level of dbd like competitive,how it's going to affect camping on some character like huntress (even tho she can prob camp from far away the bar wont charge lmao)
    we'll probably ban the use of it since in most leagues we ban 4%-ing off of hook except if you have Deliverance.
        But the 4% is banned because it adds an element of luck. This is a guaranteed chance like deli so I think it would be allowed.
            I think a lot of people in the comp community understand that camping at the root of it is a strategy to employ. BHVR is making this change for the aspect of fun, rather than strategy. Sometimes, facecamping a survivor when gens aren't completed, or proxying a surv in an area with active gens, IS the best option.

This is at least my opinion on the changes. Good change against boring pub killers though lol.
                Eh it's a strategy with counters like......... nothing lol especially if it's billy or something. Kinda boring that sometimes killers only need 6 hooks to win or something and so they just face camp their first down and the match is already over no matter what the survs do. Also ignoring game mechanics because killers would prefer staring at a survivor for 60-120 seconds is kinda stupid, i'm sure killers can get buffed in different ways like perk bans and stuff rather than ignoring the ability to unhook yourself guaranteed.
                    matches are often mirrored for both teams so they have the same win conditions. Likewise, if you go down early enough vs a billy you probably should get punished for it. Survs can certainly win but we factor both hook states and gens getting done for point scoring.
It turns off (or gets really slow) when gates are powered.
Ive seen bubbas not even get a down till all gens are done, and still pull 2-3ks from altruism
This is going to have a lot of implications for high level DbD. A common strategy for certain killers is to camp out the first hook state (because of no deli) to threaten an early kill, and this may change that.

If the bar fills too fast, then this will just reward bad survivor gameplay. A good way to punish survivors who don't heal is to go back to hook. Survs will get off their gens to save last second only to realize they can't save because everybody is injured. Letting the bar take about 20-30 seconds should keep this feature in a reasonable place, and not just allow survivors to play a brainless macro-game and unhook for free each time.

Assuming that the bar fills at a reasonable pace, this really will only affect pinky ring Clown, Bubba, Hillbilly, and possibly Oni. Huntress should be able to proxy from a distance, and she probably should so she can zone Reassurance players.
I honestly don‚Äôt like it. Tunneling is probably more important to address
    Considering most "tunneling" from what I have seen involves the unhooked survivor bumbling their way into the killer who was looking for someone else. There are no fixes for it that wouldn't punish killers who aren't actively trying to be an asshole.
        Yeah I guess you‚Äôre right
Knowing that BHVR is dog shit when it comes to anything to do with Killers, I fully expect that a killer being above the hook like a map such as The Game will allow Survivors to get progress on unhooking themselves. 

Hell I fully expect that the slow down on the unhook bar while swarming it won‚Äôt be meaningful in anyway making it easy to just swarm the hook and get them out that way as well.
This won‚Äôt help at all. Killer can still just follow you and wait out bt. Bhvr does not play their own game
Hmmm, I don't really have any problems with camping, except bubba but he's allowed.

Tunnelling and hackers have been a much bigger problem for me
The problem is, SWF could abuse this by making the killer chase them near a hooked survivor.

The meter should completely stop if other survivors are being chased near the hook otherwise it punishes killers for no reason.


I really hope it will go thru massive changes after its in the PTB but I don't trust BHVR to make this fair for both sides.
    They actually couldn‚Äôt abuse this since it won‚Äôt gain progress if a survivor is near the hook
This is hilarious because anyone with a little bit of experience can see this will only serve to make people better at camping.

Sure, face camping is unfortunate and ruins the game for the player being camped. . 

**But-**

*Proxy camping is infinitely more effective and this is literally training wheels for players to learn how to proxy efficiently.*

Thoughtful gesture, but whoa boy! People are in for a surprise when those types of killers suddenly become even better at camping. Nice going BHVR!
    It will likely empower proxy camping even more BUT...its a step in the right direction at the very least.  Literally almost anything is better than the current situation is lol.  At the very least it may encourage the killer to patrol gens or take actual chases rather than just wait for hook trades only...which is seemily becoming something that is a part of almost every match on survivor side nowadays.
        Yeah. Face camping is always favoured towards the killer- ***if survivors go for the save.*** If not? 1 or maybe 2k with an effortless escape for the other survivors that played it properly.

Proxy is all down to skill though and it's a fairly even matchup since now you won't be able to fall back onto face camping if you fuck up. You pretty much have to send multiple survivors without making it obvious that there are multiple coming. I've noticed players don't like adapting new strategies much though so it's likely quite favoured towards killer role still.

***But as we all know as indisputable truth (apparently), you can't expect any coordination from solo survivors so anything that requires teamwork is automatically impossible to counter.***
    Then what are they supposed to do? Nothing?
        There's nothing you really *can* do to completely nullify camping. Camping is something that's inherent of the whole design of the game with players becoming stationary objectives.

I'm not saying that this will do nothing. It will stop face camping, the thing that many players complain about and find boring, but at the same time it will train even the most beginner killer players to be more efficient at camping.

"Worse" killers who ***only*** face camp will be erased from the game, essentially. Which is good really. They'll end up becoming even more effective killers though.

Escaping proxy camping is down to skill so it's a bit more balanced than face camping but higher skilled killers will come out on top if they can get a proxy inside of a 3-gen just about every time.
I don't know why people are complaining about this.

What? Are they mad because they have to play the game instead of doing nothing?
    Spoken like a true survivor main.
I bet it gets reversed. I can see teams abusing this and I get that being camped sucks, but imagine getting into a game with a 4man who gen rushed you while you chase 1 guy. 3 gens gone so you camp to create pressure. But it doesn‚Äôt work cause they just come off the hook, now they have off the record and DS while the last gen is finished, guess what, they have adrenaline too. Have fun, it‚Äôs a fair and balanced game. Lol
    Exactly. This has way too much potential for abuse.
        It‚Äôs the same as when they wanted to let survivors get off the ground without perks.
    > so you camp to create pressure

I feel like you don't have much experience going against 4mans. Camping doesn't create pressure. Chasing people does.
        You‚Äôre right. Chasing does, but you ever go against those swfs that basically throw themselves at the hook to unhook their friend? 
Like they‚Äôll smash out 4 gens in the least amount of time possible, but get dumb when you camp their friend.
            No, I don't have intimate knowledge of how dumb people get when I camp their friends. Because I don't camp.

Meanwhile, I've had games as Deathslinger where my first hook was with 1 gen remaining, and I still made a comeback and got a 4k.
                I think when you play enough killer you experience any type of match you can think of. I‚Äôve had plenty of game go just how you explained. 

I know that some people that play killer can use camping as the only play style, but I think of it as a tool in the chest that you can use when needed.
    Camping doesnt create pressure. Just chase other people, otherwise you have 3 people completing 2 gens instead of 1 person on a gen while one is saving and the other is being chased :)
        Just go read my replies to the other guy
So if survivors stay near the hook and the killer try's to get them do they still get out free?
     pretty much.
Did killer get anything in return?
    Nope.
    Why should they? This isn't a balance change, it's a "making the game more exciting than watching paint dry" change.
        People have made a great point that because it only slows when other survivors around it encourages people to loop around hooked teammates to fuck the killer.
        Still a buff to survivors like basekit bt was.
Hmmmm. I feel like this could be problematic. What about Distressing builds? Or characters like Wesker that have a much higher radius than normal? What about maps that have 2 floors?   


Also often in end game collapse, this is the only chance you have to get a single kill. Do we just have to deal with getting gen rushed and bullied into nonexistence?
    I don't think its related to terror radius
        If it's not there's still even more issues with it, still the end game collapse. And what about all the hook pause perks? Is Kinship just completely pointless now? Like, there's so many issues with adding something like this. Instead it should simply be "Moving to second hook state allows the Survivor to stun the killer for 3 seconds if within 6 meters and escape the hook but be affected by the Broken status effect for 30 seconds"

So basically a different Deliverance where you have to take 2 hook stages to activate.  


The End Game is my main issue. A LOT of games especially on weaker killers, getting a single kill often requires face camping them during that stage. Otherwise you're not getting even 1 kill, and having 3 other people makes saving a possibility, but also a risk. Facecamping before 5 gens are done yeah, something needs to be done about that. But not in the end game.
            So real quick breaking down each point in this post

\- Disabled once the exit gates are powered, killers only objective at that point is the hook which they said it does disable during the endgame and when survivors swarm the hook.

\- They said the bar fills up slowly when the killer is further away so Kinship and Camaraderie will still be good, extending your phase 1 and 2 as to give more time for your unhook bar to go up against say a proxying basement trapper who slightly leaves to get traps etc.

\- You do not need to take 2 hook stages, they said the bar fills up based on killer proximity to hook they didn't mention it taking a full stage which ties back into the Kinship/Camaraderie
                Tiny correction, it gets disabled when the gates are powered, not when opened, meaning survivors can't abuse 99 gates to get free unhooks in the endgame.
                Okay the first two points are good. I am glad to hear that.  


The third point however, was simply my own little idea for an anti-facecamp idea, not actually what they're doing.
                    Aa gotcha, thought maybe you knew something i didn't
I hope it's deactivated once all gens are done and endgame didn't collapse
in the words of adam sandler  


"holy shit im gonna fucking cum"
Good. Let‚Äôs hope they introduce a counter to hard tunneling next. Face camping and hard tunneling are the two worst things that new and old players have experienced since drop
Finally, the optimised Survivor teams get another way of kicking booty after 5 gens
I‚Äôm worried about how it will affect killers who aren‚Äôt hard camping, but maybe patrolling some gens that just happen to be nearby.  Also interested in how the meter speed works when teammates are nearby.  Because if survivors can weaponize this new feature, you know they will.
That's cool and all. But when is trapper getting buffed?
Wait, so I can trick survivors into unhooking right in front of me?? Sweet
hilariously bubba is one of the killers least affected by this, his chainsaw sweep can get multiple hits in so it burns your bt and then downs you anyway
The feature honestly sounds pretty good, it also covers EGC and Survivors "swarming" hooks or looping around it. I can still expect "certain" Killers to cry and complain about it.

The bad part? It's coming to PTB "later" this year... Like what?
Devs will just never admit the game is insanely survivor sided on 80% of the maps and 90% of the killer roster struggles to compete at all. BHVR making sure every single survivor complaint is taken care of, basekit BT, basekit Deli, almost got basekit UB meanwhile killers can't even get a half decent FOV for actually no reason.

Glad I picked up Star Rail last week and only play maybe one DBD game every 3 days now, I know a universe exists where this anti camping mechanic comes out at the same time as a full map tile rework and a gen speed nerf so the game hits the perfect stride of everyone playing for hooks, every pallet is fair and can be played around on both sides and everything is wonderful but I deadass think BHVR is incapable of giving us anything close to that.
    Haven‚Äôt played in 3 months. None of the subsequent updates have made me feel like I‚Äôm welcome back to the game as a killer main. Survs won‚Äôt be happy till they 4 man escape every game. It‚Äôs ridiculous.
I'm so glad I got out of this game 2 months ago.  Killer main, just watching them nerf killers at will.  Does this at least turn off during the Endgame Collapse?
Sure sure. Then while we are at it pallets should break even if they miss the killer so that you can‚Äôt just loop and slide infinitely if you‚Äôre good at baiting a killer. 

You can‚Äôt take away a strategy from a killer that actually helps every so often but not take something away from the survivors to make it possible for the killer to still kill. 

Facecamping sucks, everyone knows. But if you‚Äôre in the middle of a three gen with a survivor on the hook, that isn‚Äôt face camping. You‚Äôre watching all three gens and if you decide to just meander about them then you lose the advantage you now have because you know where a player is and there‚Äôs usually one for the unhook. So that‚Äôs two people out of play. If there‚Äôs four players and one gen, it‚Äôs a genuine start to Maintain control.
I like the change and loved it when they said once gates are powered the mechanic turns off. Told me they even realize if a killer has someone on hook there's no other objective at that point once gates are up.
we don't even know 100% how this will work yet and people are LOSING their minds saying survivors are going to abuse the fuck out of it like please calm down lmao. so pathetic.
Some people are complaining but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if those players are the ones face camping. It happens so often that there‚Äôs no way those same people aren‚Äôt on this sub in sizable numbers.

Yes, tunneling will still happen, but at least this gives the player a chance to interact with the game rather than being camped for 2 minutes straight.
is it gonna work on second stage? I assume not
    They said it does
        What about in EGC?
            Doesn‚Äôt work when exit gates are powered
                Cool, cool.
This is a good change. I'm yearning for a change concerning squatting survivors infront of hooks, I know it's not a winning strat by any means but it's just so annoying.
This is actually fucking awful when you REALLY think about it. This will punish Killers for survivor mistakes, because all survivors are gonna do it abuse perks and swarm the hook. Also killers on a different floor are going to be punished anyways?? And what about getting to end game and not being allowed to get even one fucking kill because the survivors are just gonna bully the killer and swarm the hook making it impossible to secure at least one kill and at WORST drag the game out to be unnecessarily long? This is just a horrible feature.
[deleted]
    It turns off  once the gens are done.
Does this disable during end game?
Amazing change.
Looks like Decisive is back on the menu boys!
Finally... GAMEPLAY...
I still think it should slow down the timer instead of this. I don't think giving the survivor this level of autonomy is good, after all it is supposed to come down to working as a team. If the timer was slower the higher the bar was, then it would give the survivors more time to plot a rescue. Perhaps in endgame it instead allows you to unhook yourself.
This is great for huntress though, a survivor unhooking themselves lets me immediately hatchet them to waste borrowed time and then the chase after and down them with m1.
This change sucks. Most of the time killers face camp is when they are losing so bad that they have to or the survivor is almost dead and they are securing the kill.
    Most of the time killers face-camp to be toxic...
SpookNJukes has already tweeted saying this change won't effect Basement Bubbas very much.

https://twitter.com/SpooknJukes/status/1659687045537619969
I mean it doesn't technically stop bubba's bcs all they have to do is keep the chainsaw sprint going since it can insta down through endurance if he hits you twice
imo bar shouldn‚Äôt move at all if 2 or more survivors are present. surv unhooks themself (gets free endurance???) to tank 1 hit then other survs tank 3 more. will make bully squads even more op
They need to change Deliverance and Reassurance so they don't become useless with this chance, specially Reassurance.
How does this work if I as a killer KNOW that there is someone who wants to unhook nearby?
Based on how people are talking bout it, and my biased l opinion, it really probably is gonna be scrapped or something
Yet another mechanic to give Survivors another free win for playing poorly. Wonderful.
    Not happy about this, as it only empowers bully squads and gen rushers even more.
    Lmao, so you rather have survivors lose a whole round because they lose one 50:50 at a palette and get camped to death
        So a Survivor on top of the SH school should get a free escape because I was chasing someone on a lower floor while 2 others pound out gens? Great logic from the Survivor mains as always.
            Who said that?
                The devs, because the range doesn't respect flooring. Probably because they can't code for crap. This is ridiculous, so many hooks are clustered around high traffic zones or near gens, so Killers are now punished when chases lead them near hooks so this idiotic meter builds?
                    Before heading deeper down into the salt mine you might wanna wait for the actual mechanic to come ATLEAST to the PTB, youre being very pessimistic on the competence of the devs and the impact of this new mechanic on your game enjoyment
                        Because 7 years of incompetent game design and clear favoritism for the Survivor side give all the reason in the world to be quite judgemental of their intent and performance.
    Crying days before the PTB even releases....
This game just keep getting easier for survivor. My gosh.
    Cuz face camping is such a skillful strategy right?
        Nice straw man. If You can‚Äôt see the abuse this will bring up, you‚Äôre blind. Especially with a swf.  Chase a survivor into the radius and free unhook
            Nope, the timer slows to a crawl if a surv is near, but hey let‚Äôs make shit up right?
                And you don‚Äôt see an issue with that? And I haven‚Äôt listened to the stream. I‚Äôm going off what OP says
                    No I don‚Äôt see an issue, why would you want survivors to horde around a hook with no penalty?
                        Hold on. I think I‚Äôm misunderstanding you. I understood it as when the survivors are around the hook, the hook timer slows down. Is that not the case?
                    "i haven't listened to the stream" then maybe don't share your uninformed opinion on it?
[removed]
    They said it‚Äôs completely disabled once gates are powered
This is the best defense against face camping we could have gotten, and doesn‚Äôt fuck killers who are actively defending hooks. Just campers. I‚Äôm honestly surprised it wasn‚Äôt suggested before. Get fucked, Bubba.
Imagine crying about camping. Just survive.
I can't be the only person here thinking killers are getting fucked right? Like yes camping early sucks but with the recent regression nerfs killers are running out of ways of having good pressure without being a master and sweating at the game, the casual fun of the killer side is gone and it's affecting everyone
    Survivor mains won‚Äôt be happy until they have 4 man escapes regularly. Killer main, and I haven‚Äôt played this game in 3 months, these updates haven‚Äôt made me change my mind.
Really hope it gets disabled during the end game, since it's the best strategy once the doors are open.
    They said it would not activate during EGC
        Shouldn't be active once the grns are done. 99ing doors is already super strong as it is.
I personally hate camping myself, it just isn't fun. But on some maps that's the only thing you can do since survivors can just run from loop to loop and there's not much you can do about it depending on the killer.
Horrendous idea. Survivors now have the equivalent of six perks
I‚Äôll just tunnel off hook lol.
Definitely another strong SWF/comms buff.
If the radius is too big it‚Äôs unbalanced. This is yet another thing a coordinated team can abuse yet again. I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äúdelete swf because I‚Äôm a crybaby killer‚Äù I‚Äôm saying this is completely abusable by any four man team with comms. I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt agree, I‚Äôm getting real tired of camping wraiths and Weskers because as much as everybody goes ‚Äúhaha camping bubba‚Äù he doesn‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs literally baby killers getting matched against people that far outrank them. I just know for a fact you can abuse the crap out of this. It would work way better if powers were disabled when within 10 m of hook, the basic attack cooldown was increased drastically and healthy grabs off of survivors rescuing off hook were just deleted.
Bubba should be exempt from this. I love you bubba.
Great another survivor friendly rework. When are survivors not going to be able to use map blessings. I'm tired of going to the same old survivor sided maps which forces me to camp and tunnel for a few kills
‚ÄúAllows you to unhook yourself for free‚Äù

So we‚Äôll have Survivors not giving their team time to do things, now?

Nah, this just made camping easier. I can‚Äôt say if I do or don‚Äôt like the change, but this isn‚Äôt the right way to go about it.
    The difference is that a smart or even just decent survivor will know they can just save the unhook for the last second of the phase, giving them more time than if they were just left on to second (given it doesn‚Äôt unhook automatically which would be weird)

The only way it makes camping easier is if the survivor makes the mistake of unhooking at a bad time which shouldn‚Äôt be the killers problem
        You‚Äôre not wrong there, but this poses another problem: how many randos do you see using practical judgment when they have a ‚Äúget out of jail free card‚Äù?
    they actually give them even more time. a camper will most likely also tunnel you. so instead from going from normal mode to struggle mode in just a second you can escape, waste another few seconds of the killers time until they get you again and a few more seconds to carry you back to a hook before struggle mode. and then you can do it once again before going to be sacrificed.
        Y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt getting it, and it shows.
            Looks like you aren‚Äôt getting it. Even tho I explained it very well üíÄ
I honestly think it will be a disaster because swarming could be a serious issue, slowing down the meter is not enough. 

What am I supposed to do if I literally see survivors camping the hook for the rescue?

  
How does the game know I'm not camping when hooks are near, there are multiple people in the basement or the game has vertical structures and multiple floors?

Why are people allowed to also unhook in the second stage? Cause taking out camping from the game is ok, destroyng a feature that most times is strategic and also used in tournaments, is not a very good choice imho...
Your whole attitude and way you approach the game is way killers play this way in the first place
    I thought it was because your average serial facecampers weren't skilled enough to get more than one or two downs per game?
        Probably not but the design of the game doesn't encourage them to do much else
No its not, it will be abused and then scrapped like last times

But this one has this feature to prevent that or that feature to prevent this. Cool, it doesnt cover all bases, it will be abused. It will be scrapped

To prevent face camping and tunneling, a fundemental change of core dbd game mechanic needs to change, anything else will inevitably fall short.

This is not hard to understand ...
Well now there's no way to stop getting gen rushed. Great.
Pray to god this is BS. It‚Äôs already hard enough to deal with survivors once the exits are 99d. Now y‚Äôall want a free escape?
Not a fan, so during endgame we can‚Äôt stay at the hook and are forced to chase when the gates are wide open?
    They literally said it turns off during endgame...
    They should make a change to where it‚Äôs allowed in end game, but during the game you can‚Äôt.
        Honestly this change is just going to make me tunnel people harder and slug.
It needs to be fair for both sides.

My suggestions to make it fair: if one survivor being chased goes within 10 to 15 meters of the hooked survivor then the timer is slowed to 30%, if one or more survivors are being chased and go near the hook then the timer stops completely, make Scourge Hook: Monstrous Shrine basekit where if the killer isn't within 15 meters of the hook then entity progess is 15% to 20% faster.

I know it will go thru changes before it ever goes live but it definitely shouldn't punish killers who are actively chasing another survivor and the survivor goes anywhere near the hook. 

The killer shouldn't have to drop the chase and lose a hit and potentially a down.
    > if one survivor being chased goes within 10 to 15 meters of the hooked survivor then the timer is slowed to 30%

Any progress is too much progress if killer in a chase.  Otherwise, you give swfs yet another buff.
    Effects are slowed down by survivors being around it regardless of chase. It is also turned off entirely once the last gen pops
Of all the killers that facecamp, Bubba is the least screwed by this. He can already down you through your bt, the only thing this does for facecamping Bubba is make him also need to watch you. Imo they should have made the killer being in a close enough proximity extend the duration of your hook stage, OR if they are too close, nullify it completely after the bar fills up.
I'm gonna wait on further details before I get excited or doomer about this, three things that will decide if it will live or die imo:

Verticality: If it's a sphere radius like the terror radius then maps like The Game are going to become a nightmare, like unironically DC-worthy if they do it badly enough. But then there are places like the basement where this feature will be useless without a vertical radius. I'm sure there's some compromise BHVR could implement (eg. sections like the basement stairs will always trigger the timer even if the survivor is outside of the unhook radius) but we'll see if they're willing to bother with it.

Swarmers: The exact way in which players swarm can be hard to design something like this around, people have mentioned that it will slow down the bar if another survivor is nearby but  unless "nearby" is defined in some way super generous to the killer, or if the unhook bar outright stops, it will be fairly easy for a competent survivor to loop the killer near the hook until the bar fills up or stand just outside of range to bait the killer into the area without being close enough to start a chase. 

Proximity to generators: Tbh this is the one that has me most worried, there are a lot of hooks in the game at the moment that are placed right next to a generator, and a bad enough 3-gen could force the killer to decide between actually patrolling the gens or keeping the survivor on hook. An extra variable to slow down the bar when generators are nearby (maybe with some scaling for gens with progress so you don't get penalised for keeping a close eye on the 90% gen) could maybe work, but again I'm not sure if BHVR will bother to go through the trouble accounting for this.
Wow,BHVR not making choices that are entirely killer sided for once and it took them only nearly a decade to make this game actually enjoyable and not a hanging on a hook simulator? What happened? Did they hire someone who posseses basic logic and sense?
We will have to see how it works but just from that it doesn‚Äôt sound all that useful. I just hope if a killer keeps activating it they get banned for it
Imagine chasing someone near a hook and just loosing your progress, great change üëç
Maybe someone already asked. Does this only work for first hook face camping?
    Nope, both stages. This is now a special case where you can unhook yourself in second stage.
This game dude.. If you didn‚Äôt get caught then you wouldn‚Äôt be on the hook..
[deleted]
    They said other survs being nearby slows down the gauge, and it does work on 2nd hook
        Thanks couldn‚Äôt watch live stream when it happened.

Survivors win hook stands off now then if it just slows and doesn‚Äôt pause hmmm.
    >survivor also looping in the area Near the hook does timer pause?  
>  
>Can survivors unhook themselves on second stage too?  
>  
>I guess it‚Äôs imposs

surviors near the hook slow the progress, surviovrs can unhook themselves in stage two, and the self unhook is turned off once exit gates are powered
Seems cool defiantly can‚Äôt secure that last kill at end game from now on ü§£
That's problematic. How is this going to take into account survivors camping the hook and deliberately making the killer chase them around said hook?
lmao. so if I camp you, I get to down you again and re-hook you faster than waiting for a save? This is great.
Ok. Then we need a gen camping counter where if a survivor stays near one after it's kicked it explodes. Same concept.
idc about this too much , just make surrivor who dc die for good for the match in a grusome animation, ai bots will just make the game's pvp feel fake
It's not gonna happen, lol.
I'm glad they're adding the things that matter. Refocusing on the horror design is super important and I'm so hyped. The one thing that I cannot fathom is why the perk search bar blacks out and fills like the whole screen when pressed. Why can't you just type directly into the perk UI search bar? It's like... basic UI design.
Wait so that one perk that lets you unhook for free will be "nerfed" or how is this all going to work out? :s

And all the luck perks and offerings will only be good for chests?
This won‚Äôt stop me! I‚Äôm the best bubba main be thankful you haven‚Äôt faced me!
This is a fantastic addition, they've needed SOMETHING to deal with face camping for literally years and I'm glad it's finally happening.
Holup when was this added
Where's the source on this?
[deleted]
    the dev broadcast
        Seriously? Fucking finally
Terrible change and I don't even play the game anymore
killers rejoice, this punishes survivors floating around the hook. meaning you now have definitive proof when the way they played led to the facecamp
This is so fucking dumb, the easierst solution by far is to just add a time penalty during wich a freshly hooked survivor cannot be unhooked (aka respawn timer). No insta unhooks, no survivors comming, camping the hook would be pure waste of time. It's literally this easy but nooooo, behaviour devs are just to dense to go for the easy, practicall solution. Instead they shoehorn whatever the fuck this shit is. Shame
For people who play this game, it seems like a great change. But imagine if you're someone who just started playing... How does it make any sense thematically that you can somehow just leap off the hook when the killer is right next to you?

So lame. This game keeps getting further away from what it could (and SHOULD) be‚Äî an exciting, heart-pumping, asymmetrical HORROR game.
Survivor swarming also slows the bar, but hopefully vertical terror radius is taken into account, a killer on a separate floor away from stairs isnt a threat
    I would imagine it‚Äôs not going to be terror radius based at all because if it is it‚Äôs completely countered by undetectable killers/perks.
        Correct. Insidious camping would still very much be a thing.
        Wesker: *Sweats nervously*
            Why?
                40 meter terror radius
                    They said the radius of the hook. Not killer. Monstrous shrine works this way too. Punishing individual killers would make no sense.
                        I am aware. I was explaining the joke that I thought you might not have gotten, even if the joke is not applicable in this situation because the radius for camping is at 16m.
        BT used to only activate if it happened in the TR and stealth killers would use their undetectable to counter just that...  
Not that you didn't necessarily know that already. Just buttressing your statement.
            I did know, but I‚Äôm hoping that they learned something from that! Can‚Äôt see them making that mistake this time, insidious is a well established camping tool already so if they‚Äôve somehow not thought of that I would be surprised.
                Unfortunately committing the same mistake is very BHVR
                    Gonna sound crazy here, but I think Behaviour has geniunely gotten *better* as a developer.  I don't see this only being linked to the TR. Basement Bubba is likely one of the major camping tactics they want to counter.
                        They've gotten better for sure, but they also make the same boneheaded mistakes over and over sometimes.
                            You could say that there's a Merciless Storm of them.

                        They replaced the person in charge of balancing and they seem much more competent? The recent meta shakeup seems quite positive.
                            Positive if you only play Survivor. Whatever idiot is in charge of balancing this mess clearly has one priority, and it's make Killer unplayable while giving Survivors free wins at all costs at this point. Even the so called Survivor 'nerf' recently nerfed Killers harder than anything else in ages, gutting tons of perks and effectively removing them from play entirely, while Survivor healing was barely touched with the lightest of possible wrist slaps, and most of the actual nerfs that were supposed to happen instead were screamed and cried and whined away, showing, ultimately, this game is beyond help. The devs are insanely biased, and when they're not, the larger community can simply throw a fit and get what they want as the devs will bend the knee.

Hit the nail on the head bud. I don't think there's a way to recover from it when the survivor-only players just cry about every little inconvenience and get it fixed since that's a majority of the playerbase. 

The killer-only players do it too, but it's drowned out because it's maybe 20% of the playerbase. Flashlights caused seizures in some killer players because they could be spammed, and the survivor-only players threw a  fit over flashlights being "nerfed." üòë

It was literally hurting players, and I think that's the real reason people used the flashlight spam, to annoy or injure the player, not the killer.
                                I'm having an easy time with perks such as Sloppy Butcher, Nowhere to Hide, Jolt, and Safe the Best for Last. I highly recommend these. Slowdown isn't necessary anymore and it's much better.
        Hmmm. I like them doing something about face camping but it feels the guy on the hook could therefore call the position of a stealth killer easily. Guess it'll just depend on the radius size.
    Isn‚Äôt there a hole on the 2nd floor of that map. Directly looking over a hook?
        There is also hooks next to the stairs if I remember right on some variations of the game.
        Definitely.  Surprisingly when i camped there nobody took the plunge that I expected but was convinced would be to obvious.
    It's 100% going to be vertical as well, which will suck for some maps but also handles camping up above the basement.
        [deleted]
            With agitation and iron grasp I can get to basement from near half the map on some maps. It's still a massive choke point and this doesn't even solve that because you still have to leave basement and run into the killer losing at least half your borrowed time timer and against trapper doesn't even help then.
            Basement is a very strong hook spot regardless. Many killer powers allow you to abuse how predictable it is, and it‚Äôs very easy to defend even without actually facecamping by just patrolling relatively near it. 

Survivors may make a mistake (although let‚Äôs be real it‚Äôs not that difficult to get hooked in the basement) but the Killer simply sitting infront of the hook should *also* be punished for making the mistake of not properly pressuring the team and just trying to cheese out one kill.
            i don't know what gave you the idea that getting hooked in the basement is a Survivor mistake? it's as much of a mistake as going down at all basement is an outdated mecanic only served a purpose when hooks used to be permanently sabotaged it's not an excuse for the killer to be an asshole.
    That's the hope, but just remember that hook spawns don't take that into account when they should
    I don't know how they would deal with this loophole but camping basement would still be an issue then.
    I hope "terror radius" is being used as a substitute for others words, because as someone that mains Nem and Wesker and doesn't camp (unless they bm), that'd be a huge issue.
Nurse will likely abuse it. Hook below, camp above.
    Its not abuse. This is still harder than face camping, wich is what we get now. We really need to stop changing the game around nurse.
        It already is. They‚Äôve nerfed perks (ex: awakened awareness) because nurse players would exploit them with their power. BHVR refuses to rework nurse and instead prefer to balance the game around her. Take your head out of the sand and see the planned platitudes for what they are.
            Starstruck was never nerfed cause of Nurse, you're thinking of Awakened Awareness. Which they could honestly revert the change since Nurse can no longer use Starstruck.
            Without a complete Nurse Rework, the best solution for BHVR IS to balance the game over balancing Nurse herself.
No matter what balancing changes you do the nurse, she will still be able to counter basically the whole looping aspect of the game by going through walls

It does suck that perks need to be nerfed from what they could be if she wasn't in the game though...
I'd expect it would be based on the pathfinding distance between the killer and the hook. This would account for the actual walking distance rather than the distance in space.
    I think you might be giving BHVR too much credit.
    Nurse is a killer tho
        ü§Ø
Also this will greatly impact tournaments and comp teams.
  
Kinda of interesting to see what kind of strategies comp teams employ for this.
If it's anything like how they handled boons and how they work on multiple floors, I don't think they're gonna consider the Y-axis and that concerns me
From BHVR: ‚ÄúAs it stands, this system will remain active and function as intended on Maps with multiple floors like The Game or Midwich Elementary School. We‚Äôd like to clarify that this may possibly lead to edge cases where a Killer is falsely punished for face-camping, so we will be monitoring this closely following release and adjusting as needed.‚Äù
true, but its all about stalling them out, and having that DS ready to go afterwards. If they know they're losing an extra minute out of all this it might help deter it, especially if the other three survivors are rushing gens instead
    Exactly. If it lasts long enough for the rest of your team to finish gens and get out then the problem is solved regardless of if the face camped survivor makes it out. 

As is, the killer can face camp and easily get another two kills just because of how long it takes to do Gens.
        Hopefully this stops teammates from lingering around the hook and actually motivates them to do gens
            Yeah, I personally think that's the issue. I'd rather have a constant killer aura reveal on hook without perks
        Plus now the person getting face camped can actually reset and try chase again if they have DS/BT/Secondwind, burning even more of the killer‚Äôs time.
            I mean against most killers it's going to be ok.  Against a bubba though it is super easy to burn through borrowed time or off the record.  I imagine that it will make the person die faster than if they just sat on the hook against bubba
        Right, you wouldn‚Äôt even need to reassure them until stage 2 if the killer is camping so that‚Äôs very good gen efficiency
            Get Reassurance for both stages to max out survivor's time efficiency.

Second Wind, Lithe, DS, Blood Rush etc 

does it suck to still run a build to avoid camping? Yes... but I can see how some players or SWF could try to have fun with this
                Absolutely
        If Killer is face camping for 2 minutes yet have plenty of time to get 2 more kills, those must be absurdly fast chases
            Most face campers get kills by grabbing people trying to get the hook or downing them after
            Depends on when the killer gets the down and if kindred is being used, 2 minutes is 120 seconds.  
If the killer downs the survivor at 5 gens even if the other 3 have their gens at 45 seconds (50%) they still need another 45 seconds to finish them and then at least 90 seconds to finish one of the 2 remaining (one gets worked by 1 person, the other by 2) 90+45 its 135, by that time the killer has 15 seconds to find someone and start a new chase and this is not taking on acount distance traveled to another gen or perks  like Deadlock.  
This assuming kindred is in play and the 3 survivors know the killer is camping, if they dont at least one or two will go check the hook, see the killer camping and then going back, increasing the overall time needed to fix all gens remaining, add NOED into the mix to get a very easy down once the gens are done and you can almost guarantee 2 or 3 kills without putting that much effort except on the first chase.  


Even if you get the down at 4 gens is very easy to get 3 kills if you facecamp using NOED and Deadlock.
    Kindred mains rejoice
        Not till they get rid of that BS annoying black bubble
    While that may be true, if a bubba is determined, there isn't much to stop them, even with this method in place. They would have to do some adjusting, idk what that would be but it would have to be something worth while
        True but imo the problem with camping is the killer doesnt get one kill, they get easily 2/3 or even 4 sometimes.  


I dont have that much of a problem with the killer getting one kill if they decide to camp, it sucks but honestly it would be really hard to find a method where that doesnt happen and cant be abused without overhauling the entire hook system, I think having the killer getting a pity kill its the lesser evil in this instance.  


I do have a problem with the killer winning the match just because they downed someone at 4/5 gens and decided to stand still for 2 minutes, especially against solos who cant tell eachother whats happening and must go to the hook to learn they have to rush gens.
    You‚Äôre assuming face-camping bubbas even understand how to play the game‚Ä¶ Okay, all jokes aside though, I do like this change.
    DS is a joke.
        It will still buy you time to get to a nearby tile or give your team 1 extra minute to finish gens and get out
            3 seconds is enough to get you two feet. Any ranged or speed killer eats that
                3 seconds is still more time for your teammates to knock out gens.  Not including time for killer to pick you up and take you to a hook either. Any time you can buy your team while being facecamped is precious.  With dead hard you can extend those 3 seconds into potentially minutes
                    You went from 1 minute to 3 seconds real quick
                        And yes, it activates for one minute but as soon as you do a conspicuous action it deactivates
                        And yes, it‚Äôs 3 second stun off the shoulder, one of which is spent rolling off the shoulder.
                        1 minute is if the killer decides to play around DS, aka, dont pick you up until 1 minute.
                    And again, it‚Äôs useless without a companion perk. You can‚Äôt change the argument to ‚Äúwith deadhard‚Äù when deadhard+DS is a new concept to the argument. DS, without any helpers is garbage.
                        DS is still a pretty good perk, as in much better than most other perks, it just isn't the god tier perk it used to be, if your team is efficient on gens even the few seconds that it gets you are useful and can change the outcome of a game and it only gets stronger if you pair it with other perks like dead hard or off the record
                            That‚Äôs the thing it can‚Äôt stand alone. And if your team isn‚Äôt doing gens in the first place it‚Äôs buying dead time. If you only play in solo queue it‚Äôs kind of a wasted perk slot. I guess I can concede if I had a team it would be different. I‚Äôve come to realize as a survivor the game sucks without friends to enjoy the game with. I mainly play killer
                                It's ok alone and amazing combined so that's what most people do. Solo queue isn't really the issue it's just that the average player is trash at the game, and the game happens to be killer sided if you put average players against average players (as in bad vs bad). At least when playing with friends communication let's you compensate for individual bad decisions and playing a game with friends is always more fun, that's honestly how I think you are supposed to play the game, either as survivor with friends or as killer if you are solo
                Skill issue
                    Who said I run DS? Ain‚Äôt nobody
    Off the record, DS, Styptic. Make them earn it.
    Exactly every second counts and those shitties know it. Now we can at least contribute to the match than have our brain dead team mates walk into his saw. If he catches me one, shame on me and so on. That's a much better system than: he hooked you, youre dead.
Fr, Bubbas do not give 1 singular fuck about endurance with their chainsaw sweep
    Waiting for BHVR to change Bubba's chainsaw attack to a "special attack" and make this specifically not work against recently unhooked Survivors or something.
        Bubbas saw is a special attack
Yeah. It means nothing at all without extra anti-tunnel protections, and depending on their implementation, could actually buff face camping. Let's say that the unhook is automatic when the meter is full, as you'd think it'd have to be for second hook. That bypasses Reassurance and lets them down again all the faster. And plenty of killers can nullify or flat-out bypass the unhook BT. Pinhead's deep wound add-on is the most egregious, but Clown also greatly slows, Bubba can easily hit multiple times, Trapper can easily lock down entire areas so there's literally no way to leave at all, so on and so forth.
Yeah not even including nurse, huntress, blight, spirit etc
They should make it so Bubba cant hit though Endurance. Should only be able to hit you once per power use.
    Endurance already protects you from Bubba, even through his chainsaw
        He can double hit you is what I mean
        If he revs his chainsaw immediately behind you, he can hit you twice in the same charge assuming there's no cover nearby
            Not if are sprint bursting.
                This would require you to time your Sprint Burst amazingly well and I'll be real honest: Most Survivors won't be able to do it in the scenario you're proposing. They'd have to WALK up to the hook and have it saved and ready and while a lot of people will walk to hooks to save it, a lot wouldn't.
    So what would the advantage of using Bubba be after that.

Like for real, what‚Äôs his power doing other than that?
        Really easy insta downs, aoe power, going though pallets really fast.
            It's also a pretty solid chase/loop tool or denier. If someone is trying to hover a pallet they have to choose to drop it early or risk getting hit trying to get the stun. And people really underestimate how far you can go with all three charges, I've caught a lot of people out as they leave a loop expecting me to run out of steam before I catch them.
                Haven't played in awhile didn't he have a add on that gives extra distance on good timing hitting your charges
            As a Bubba main myself, his power is not an easy instadown if you know your window techs. He has legitimately zero map pressure. His strength comes from having a strong chase and the ability to wipe pallets out quickly, but if you have 2 other medium skill teammates and an acorn on your team he will lose all his gens. Its why bad bubbas facecamp: he can't harass more than 1 or 2 survivors consistently.
        You know you can chase with him normally and still win games, playing against a bubba who doesn't camp is actually fun.  


But because camping right now is so easy with him everyone is doing that because he is the easiest face camping killer.
        Bubba has an incredibly strong chase power:  It gives him a speed boost, allows him to insta-down survivors,  allows for multiple downs in a single usage, it instantly breaks pallets/walls, and if used properly can completely ignore the endurance effect.  Also, attempting to use a locker to avoid Bubba's chainsaw is a huge risk in and of itself.  The timings of his tantrums can vary based on a few things, and unless the survivor can identify it immediately, chances are they will get grabbed coming out of the locker.  Lastly, while perk dependent, Bubba is one of the few killers that can turn the shack into an absolute death trap if he is using Bamboozle properly.

Bubba is an incredibly versatile killer.  He garnered this reputation because of bad apples choosing to face camp.  That doesn't mean every Bubba does it.
Free unhook AND regenerates a hook state
This will be the life or death of this feature.

Killers should be punished for camping unnecessarily. Conversely, survivors should be punished for the same thing; where they'll just stand there, expecting the killer to chase them. The problem with that is, that's 2 people not doing gens, potentially 3 if someone else comes to unhook.

I do not want to be punished for what I feel is punishing survivors who just show up to taunt, abuse Off The Record, DS, etc.;
    I genuinely hope they get that part right. I feel like it should stop the bar filling up if survivors are really close, because where else is the killer supposed to go at that point?
        If survivors are close and in a chase I'd say. That way if a killer gets looped near the hooked survivor the killer won't be punished for just playing the game at that point while, simultaneously, if a survivor is sneaking up on the hook it won't punish the hooked survivor in the off chance that the sneaking survivor gets caught.
            I‚Äôm down with that. If the survivor at any point gets in a chase (or ‚Äúcaught‚Äù) and doesn‚Äôt leave the area, then they stop the bar from filling up, regardless of standing still to stop chase or whatever. Any good SWF already has tactics to get survivors off a hook with a killer nearby. Those are the people that will easily find a way to abuse a system like this. Punish them and the face campers and I‚Äôm very happy, but hopefully don‚Äôt punish the nuanced situations.
                Yup! I love the idea of punishing killers for AFK camping but anyone who has played killer for any period of time have ran into the 'bully squads' who aggressively go after hooks with multiple flashlights, flashbangs, boil overs, flip flops, and more.

If you gave them this then I could 100% see them taking advantage of it which is just entirely not the point. If the killer is making an effort to play the game (i.e. chasing someone) then this system shouldn't be active at that point in time.
            Then survivors would literally just do what they did the last time the devs tried to add something like this and work on gens near the hook and then hide from the killer to stop a chase from occurring. The condition can't, and shouldn't ever be that the bar only stops if the killer is chasing someone near the hook. This is the issue with mechanics like this, they tried them before and they were so abused they didn't even make it out of the PTB. I can't say I would be surprised if that's exactly what happens with this mechanic.
                I hope this idea gets nuked. Bully squads are already a pain to deal with...
        Trying to answer your question in good faith: commit to the survivor(s) swarming, right? In theory that's what should be encouraged. (I'm in favor of the bar slowing/stopping if survivors try to swarm the hook)
            Yeah, I‚Äôm mostly referring to the SWF swarm tactics, where you‚Äôve just hooked a player and see two other people lingering around. You should not be punished for pressuring them to make a move when 3/4 of the team are right there. I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre 12 yards away. They‚Äôve shown what their plan is. If you go chase one then the other immediately gets the unhook, when if you stay there (Which you weren‚Äôt planning on doing,) you now justifiably have pressure while they‚Äôre going to do they‚Äôre best to take that pressure away.
                This is my only issue with the change, with how it's currently described

It's a good foundation, I'm just hoping they can work out the kinks.
                Ok, got it, I'm on board.
            The problem is if more than 1 person comes and you‚Äôre in a good zone for them chasing will destroy you in some circumstances
                Right; now, *not* chasing will destroy you even more, because you'll lose your hook pressure. So, you'll want to take the lesser evil: Chasing.

I'm generally okay with proxy camping, but you should be focused on at least *two* things at once, even if that includes the hook. That can even be simple things like kicking pallets to create deadzones. Hovering at one spot and going "Unhook so I can have a free hit. I won't chase you when you're within 100m of a pallet." is still basically just camping.
    As a solo queue player or is basically useless if a killer wants to tunnel someone they are hitting that survivor right off the hook 9/10 times, so otr is instantly gone.
        Nah nah, I mean in the specific situations where someone unhooked 20s ago, comes to fuck with your hook and has a minute of Off The Record. It's not super rare for me to be hooking someone and I get into a stalemate where someone with OTR is just standing at the hook, acting as bait because they know they're invincible.
            Then don't take the bait? That's 2 people not doing anything.
                The worse thing they can do is intentionally body blocking so I can't get the other survivor knowing full well I can't outplay it (especially in certain maps). I'm playing Billy so they obviously do it so I can't insta down their teammate. Like at this point what am I supposed to do aside from tunneling the unhooked survivor? The unhooker already got enough distance.
        That is not true lol most killers that tunnel do not hit you off hook unless they know for sure that you have otr.
            I mean making sure dead hard is off the table when a chase starts after someone is unhooked is a huge plus for killers. This mechanic would be a good change if ds was still useful.
        Yeah i don't know why people think off the record is so good everytime i used it and went against an actual tunneling/face camping killer they just hit you right when they unhook you so your endurance is gone the moment you touch the ground.
    This is a massive crutch to both sides. Killer should never camp without a reason. (EGC, survivors being close w/o doing gens)
As survivors should never swarm the hook when killer is camping, correct play is to smash gens as much as you can while survivor X is being camped
        only one small objection but I do think they said the whole mechanic would deactivate in endgame collapse.
I hope it doesnt do anything to that. Basement should be a lethal place to get hooked.
    Basement should be reworked anyway
        How?
            basement only exists because back in the day when a hook was broken it was permanent, so they added the basement so that there was a spot that you could always hook someone. the least they should do is add a second entrance to the basement.

the scummiest of killers can literally just body block the stairs to wait out the bt.
                100% they should double the exits.

maybe one outside and one inside the building it spawns in? 

Or maybe just keep the one stairs but double the size. Make it so there are 2 hooks on each side of the stairs. All hooks would be facing the staircase and then there would be a place to slip under the stairs between the two sides. Worst case you hide in the basement till everyone finishes the gens, then you die because they are still camping the stairs. But at least you wasted more of the killers time. 

I think I will conceptualize that big basement and post it later.
                    thats a bit too radical bro
                I don't think it needs (or should have) a second entrance; the *point* of the basement is it is *supposed to be dangerous* because it is a Killer-sided place to be.

I don't think Killers can "actually" body block the basement, but someone will have to take a hit to get past them in some cases.
                    the point of the basement is the unsabotagable hooks it has no other purpose and is not an excuse for a killer to be an asshole.
            It‚Äôs just a badly designed area. Basically any killer can get to it from out of terror radius before anyone is far from the basement to a loopable area, it‚Äôs easy to block someone on the stairs to ignore unhook endurance, and is extremely easy to facecamp.

All this, because you went down moderately close to either main building or shack, or the killer ran Agitation, a perk anyone can get because it‚Äôs on Trapper.
                Tbf, the basement is something to be feared. Adding a second entrance would take that away imo
            Honestly it doesn't really need a rework, it should just be gone. What healthy things does it encourage in the game, genuinely? It's a spot that generates boringness, as far as I can tell.
                It adds balance to the main buildings / killer shack, giving more of a risk to what are usually very powerful loops. It also gurantees hooks that are unable to be sabotaged or broken, preventing complete anti-hook builds from making the game unplayable to the killer.
                It generates boredom, easier camping and BMing, more likely to be downed right after being unhooked.

I wouldn't say the basements are terrible, but nothing good comes from having them as part of the game.
                    Quit trying to make your loops even more op survivor main
                        The basement has nothing to do with loops
    it still encourages the killer to just sit at the top of basement stairs, they might as well be facecamping at that point. so yeah, that playstyle also needs to be addressed as they aren't participating in normal gameplay.
    It‚Äôs soooo easy for a killer to get a surv to basement, why should that be lethal? Hook camping ruins the game for everyone whether it‚Äôs in basement or not. Should definitely effect standing at the top on the stairs.
yes, but everyone knows its coming now, so hopefully it turns people away from that kind of gameplay now (and not doing a last hurrah of face camping)
    hahaha  no,     everytime some op/toxic    perk/item gets disabled or nerfed into the ground people are bringing them out and abusing them as hard as they can before the change happens.  


So you can except killers actually doing more face camps until the change.
    Bruh you just know people who are unapologetic/serial campers are just gonna camp harder now because they know they might no longer have it in the near future lol
    Campers certainly have a lot of time to learn how to play
        Let's just hope Bully squads learn that too and stop harassing the killers like here

https://twitter.com/S1niiK/status/1657678689084100610

basically, even if the killer play fair, the survivors won't, from my experience since 2016
    it can still be scratched, like many things were
    Just like the Mori update and basekit Unbreakable
    Right, because players need daddy BHVR to come bail them out whenever they don't like the killer killing them in a way they find distasteful.

I wonder if they'll add in mechanics on the killer side that make survivors run, vault, and repair slower, the longer they loop and slam gens.

I don't particularly care what they're doing except in instances where survivors flood the hook and the final kill of a game. Base kit BT for free practically forces you to secure your kill, and any competent survivor group can juggle hits and body block to make the rescue successful. I also have skepticism of how well the feature is coded and its interaction with multi-floor maps. Good survivors are already smart enough to make strong use of the tools available to them, and killers often have to make decisions to break chase early and quickly because of safety of a particular zone and so on. Imagine what happens when a survivor starts looping above/below a hooked survivor while the remaining players continue slamming gens. The hooked survivor gets to unhook for free, even at a slowed rate, or the chased survivor gets a free pass because he's going to an area that's safe/loopable to the point where the survivor gets the free unhook.

The problem I have with something like this is the control being exerted over players. There are multiple gameplay strategies that people take issue with for one reason or another, but all fall within the rules of the game. Interfering with that based on the incessant whining of a particular side is a really bad idea because everyone will be for it until their side is on the receiving end.
    Before you get all excited, they've promised this before in one of their roadmaps. Lots of things end up never seeing the light of day after they announce it, you can go back and always find 2-3 things they say are "coming at the end of the year!" and they never did. 

Cross progression....they actually gave that one a specific date even lol.
    There is always a last hurrah, on both sides
Honestly, I feel like this might make his weakening add-on more popular. If you have to hit them twice, why not get more BP in the meantime?
Knock Out is the new meta.
I don‚Äôt really see how except in the case of people who were face campers before being sluggers now, and even then slugging is easier to help teammates out of than a facecamper
    then won't that just encourage the devs to push out the basekit unbreakable?
        Not really. Facecamping is unhealthy because the person being facecamped has absolutely no chance of escape given the killer is playing a camping character like Bubba, hence the new system. 

There‚Äôs plenty of systems currently in the game that allow the counter of slugging, and trying to camp a slug is significantly slower than camping a hook.

Aside from that the main killers who can take advantage of slugging are high mobility/action killers like Blight and Nurse, and chances are a killer main who is displaced by the new anti face camp system is not going to be the type of person to play those killers in that way
Yeah, it prolly flops like basekit UB but let's see.
    Idk that really wasn't a good change, with the correct format this could be a really good change. Obvs the face camping cohort will be enraged, the only legitimate issue I can see is endgame hooking. If you're kinda close to an open gate you don't have much of a choice than to proxy camp or its just an escape, I suppose by that point you've lost the game already so idk. Excited for the change could be good.
        Btw they've got egc covered this feature according to them will disable in egc.
            Nice think that's fair to killers, it makes the endgame chases more interesting too add a bit more fear.
                Yup, exactly.
            It should disable when all gens are finished rather than egc.  Survivors can just 99 gates for literally zero penalty.  If the gates are 99, they may as well be open, so facecamping whatever kills you've guaranteed in that situation is still kosher.
        I completely agree. I hope it doesn't flop, if its correctly implemented it could be one of the healthiest changes for the game up there with basekit bt.
    Disagree.  UB being base kit has a lot more harm to general gameplay to try and address slugging when face camping is a far more specific issue that has much less of an impact if/when addressed.
        Exactly, I didn't mean to say that they're equal and therefore other would also flop,
my bad.

    Bruh you cannot be calling behavior's solution needlessly convoluted and then in the same comment suggest hooks randomly teleport mid hook progress.

            Because giving someone a free unhook has got to be one of the stupidest things you could ever do to ease the whining of players about a gameplay tactic they're discontent with. If you want players to not camp, which is in no way against the rules of the game, then you have to make other options more attractive, not install some moronic punitive measure.
                >If you want players to not camp, which is in no way against the rules of the game,

If the devs are actively trying to punish face camping, I think it's safe to say that it, at the very least, goes against the devs wishes.

Making face camping straight up against the roles is a very tricky thing to do, if they wanted to, because you'd have people potentially getting bans for protecting a swarmed hook.
                    > If the devs are actively trying to punish face camping, I think it's safe to say that it, at the very least, goes against the devs wishes.

Or, they're catering, once again, to the survivor player base. It's a numbers game at the end of the day, after all. If it were never intended to be an allowed or legitimized strategy, it would've been programmed that way from the start. Now, there *have* been things that were in need of fixing, Trapper traps directly underneath hooked survivor's feet, for instance, and they've been fixed. Addressing an issue is not the same as addressing an entire gameplay element. 

> Making face camping straight up against the roles is a very tricky thing to do, if they wanted to, because you'd have people potentially getting bans for protecting a swarmed hook.

Correct, which is why you leave players to their own devices and take the coddling countermeasures out of the equation entirely. If a player is to be punished for his actions, let it be in the way his game turns out. I don't think survivors should be so emboldened as to run into the killer's face and provoke him, but they should be allowed to do so. If they manage to capture his attention, but get camped to death for it, then that's what they have to accept. You have to be completely brainless and stupid to think you somehow deserve a "fair shot at escaping" if you pull something like that. Similarly, if you sit on top of someone as Leatherface holding your chainsaw, you should expect every generator on the map to go up as the survivors work with impunity. You'd have to be likewise brainless and stupid to think you somehow deserve a longer game or more time to chase and kill survivors if you pull something like that.

I don't particularly enjoy camping from either side, but I dislike even more the concept that gameplay elements that are deemed via social convention to be dishonorable or inconveniencing have outside power and constraints used on it. That's a really bad precedent to set. If something is not expressly against the rules of the game, then it's considered fair play, regardless of how cutthroat of a tactic it may be. 

You may not enjoy being camped to death, but if I have you on the hook in a position where I have quick access to multiple generators and can simultaneously defend all of them, all you're doing is punishing my smart and advantageous play because of someone's irritation at their own disadvantaged position. Killers already have to put out a disproportionately higher amount of effort as a role, and even more so considering the power of survivors in this game, so when I manage to swing things into my favor, it's bullshit that any outside force would undermine that, particularly when it's gained through forming a daisy chain temper tantrum. Sure, this leads to the door being open to people being face camped at 5 gens 30 seconds into the match if they're unfortunate enough to go down that quickly, but that's the risk you run, and once you start this external control, the line inevitably gets pushed more and more.
                They just *changed* the rules of the game. Because it‚Äôs a game. That can change.

Now, pray they don‚Äôt change them any further.
                    No, they didn't. If they were to change the rules, it would be reportable and bannable. Find me something that expressly states "thou shalt not camp". They're enacting punitive gameplay elements for camping through this proposed feature, but that doesn't mean the rules are changing.

By that logic, we might as well assume tunneling is against the rules because of Decisive Strike and Off the Record.
                        You are fixating on the word "rules", while also incorrectly representing it.

"Rules" can refer to general game design terms, like "The rules for Dead Hard allow you to use it only after you've been unhooked". Video games are not like sports where they can sweep in a referee to yell "Camping!" Mechanics, often also known as rules, are their way of enforcing general behaviors that make the game more fun.

You're like the guy insisting they bring back TDM in a shooter, because you can't just camp in a corner to get kills in an objective-based game mode. Face it; the rules changed, and you need to change your play style with them.
                            > You are fixating on the word "rules", while also incorrectly representing it.

No, I'm using the word as it is. *You* are incorrectly representing it with the following:

> "Rules" can refer to general game design terms, like "The rules for Dead Hard allow you to use it only after you've been unhooked".

Rules for activation of a perk and rules that govern gameplay are in no way mutually exclusive. What activates something might be "governed by a set of parameters", but that's not anywhere close to "you may not use exploits or bugs that break the game's design". I can't believe I'm actually having to explain that.

> Video games are not like sports where they can sweep in a referee to yell "Camping!"

Of course not, but they *can*, however, sweep in a referee to yell "GLITCH EXPLOIT! BUG ABUSE! HACKS OR CHEATS USED!"

> Mechanics, often also known as rules, are their way of enforcing general behaviors that make the game more fun.

Mechanics are not rules. Again, I'm flabbergasted that this has to be explained, and that you're honestly trying to make that stretch. Saying that there's a rule governing how fast movement speed is coded in the game is the same as a rule governing not being able use external programs to augment your speed has got to be one of the most laughable attempts at rationalization I've ever heard. And more fun for whom? Survivors? That sure seems to be the prevailing theme here. I'm sure killers are going to have plenty of fun not being able to play defense under this ridiculous design change while simultaneously being castigated as immoral people. The assumption is all camping is face camping, which is as stupid as this proposal. 

> You're like the guy insisting they bring back TDM in a shooter, because you can't just camp in a corner to get kills in an objective-based game mode.

No, I'm the guy that says "let players play however they see fit". I'm the guy that says lay the rules of the game, and then get out of the way. I'm the guy that says there are multiple ways to play a game, and whether or not you find it pleasing doesn't make a difference. I'm the guy that says "in this objective-based game mode, if I decide to choose to zerg the bomb site or play slowly and methodically, that's my choice. If I want to play patiently and let my opponents overextend and pick them off to reduce their numbers advantage, then that's my prerogative. If I want to run in guns a-blazin' because I'm grossly outnumbered and I don't want to play out 10 minutes of slow pushing and corner clearing, then that's my prerogative, and you complaining about my recklessness has no weight except what *you* choose to give it".

> Face it; the rules changed, and you need to change your play style with them.

There's no real adaptation for me to make, save for no longer being able to defend hooks. I guess if survivors fuck up their gen pathing and end up in a 3 gen, then I'm gonna be forced to either walk far away to hook them, leaving him wide open for easy rescue, hook him in the middle of the 3 gen, but watch helplessly as he escapes for free, or hook him in the 3 gen, and be forced to leave the area while the other survivors leave him sitting on the hook, possibly with Reassurance, while they finish their last gen because I can't be near the hook and they're using the hooked survivor as a shield. I don't indiscriminately face camp hooks because it's not helpful for the overall goal for killer. If I have a defensible position that puts the ball in my court, I do so, but if I don't have anything to defend, then I go hunting for my next chase. 

I suspect the heart of the problem with survivors disliking camping is the timing and method. I haven't heard a great many complaints about hard camping a hook during EGC, but hear plenty of complaints of hard camping at 5 gens. Nobody's saying their frustration isn't warranted, but I'm most definitely saying their frustration at someone playing something poorly doesn't warrant outside intervention or moralizing.
        ‚ÄúGosh, I sure hate having to mind my distance from hooks. It‚Äôs so dumb to have to stay so far out to avoid letting people unhook themse-‚Äú

*Mystical entity sound effect*

‚ÄúFelix got moved over there!? Oh my god! They‚Äôve got two guys over there just about to stick a gen! See!? He‚Äôs already unhooked and safe! They stuck the gen! They double healed him!‚Äù

I think this self-unhook solution is definitely the way to go.
            Plus like it's not even the first time killers have to be mindful of hook distance in relation to other players.  Survivors actively playing to help each other are already more than capable of getting unhooks without trading.

So the killer already has to think against competent teams.
    >Camping killers just get to tunnel out someone faster as the survivor attempts to unhook themselves only to realize the killer is still right there and they're not getting away.

The difference though, is that this would have happened anyways but now the other survivors don't have to attempt to trade or potentially end up with 2 people downed. They can just stay on gens now while the killer camps.
        [deleted]
            I mean, anyone decent at the game is going to see they‚Äôre being face camped, watch the meter fill, and wait until they‚Äôre about to hit stage 2 before they rip it. They‚Äôre not going to be there for ‚Äúless‚Äù time.

Then the killer is guaranteed to waste 2 minutes staring at them (not even including the time in the intermediary chases) while 3 people are hard committing generators.
    Honestly yeah that's how you punish face camping. One change I would do to your suggestion is make it so the gauge will pause when the killer is in chase
    Hook progression stopping is a moronic idea. Did you not see how abused it got when it got added as an activateable perk? I don‚Äôt want to be punished cause some annoying feng decided to chase near hook.
        No, I didn‚Äôt. Can you link me to a video of hook pausing being abused?
    This needs more upvotes. Genuinely way better idea and could actually fix how boring it is when you get tunneled out.
I don't like the change as survivors will purposely try to loop near hooked players. If I chase someone to a hooked player, it shouldn't benefit the person on the hook just because I'm chasing someone else.
    Except they specifically state if there's a survivor near then the bar slows down.

Chasing someone near a hooked player 100% benefits you more then it benefits them right now, this change is looking to fix that so that a hooked player doesn't get screwed because a killer doesn't want to leave the hook, that's all. If you're not hook camping then this shouldn't effect you.
        It shouldn't benefit the hooked player at all. Even if the slows the meter down, it still punishes the killer for doing exactly what this change is wanting which is to not camp the hooked survivor.

Imagine you're a killer who hooked a survivor and then you leave the hook. Mission accomplished but then your next survivor just runs to the hook and starts looping you around the hooked survivor. All this does is fill the 'camp' meter even though the killer isn't camping.

It needs to stop completely when someone is getting chased nearby. Not hiding nearby, but actively in a chase. That way waiting to spring a quick unhook doesn't punish the hooked survivor while chasing someone who jumped the gun won't punish the killer.
            >It shouldn't benefit the hooked player at all

This is literally what we have in the game right now. Someone gets hooked, and weather the killer face camps or the survivors loop near hook, *all of that leads to the hooked player losing a state or dying*. And they have no say or control over it.

All this change is doing is giving the hooked survivor a way to get off hook if they have no other option. 

>It needs to stop completely when someone is getting chased nearby. Not hiding nearby, but actively in a chase.

I disagree. If you're activating chase and you're still close enough to the hook to where this meter would be charging, then it should still be going. The killer is making a choice to be near the hook, which makes it VERY difficult to get unhooks, that's exactly what this meter is for.

And if there's enough survivors near hook to where the killer would want to stay next to it anyways, the the meter does slow down. All this is going to punish is players staying very close to the hook for extended periods of time, nobody else.
                Then all a survivor has to do is run to the hooked survivor during chase to punish the killer. That's not a decision, it's not a strategy for the killer, it's just outright punishment that the killer has zero control over.

That's counterintuitive for the game.

Under what I'm talking about, if the killer decides to run around looking for survivors then that's a choice. If the other survivors decide to engage near hook then that's a choice.

Under what you're proposing there is no choice because the best strategy will almost always be: Take killer to hooked survivor to punish them both in time and getting a survivor off hook.
                    And we go back to my first comment:

The meter slows down if there's a survivor near.

How fast exactly do you think this meter is filling up to think that looping the killer near hook is going to be a viable strat? Do you think it's like 10 second meter or something?

And besides, lets make one thing clear: looping the killer near another downed/hooked survivor is literally one of the worst things a survivor can do. if you get a downed player near the hook that's usually just a GG. Having a meter that slowly fills up that lets someone get off hook after an extended period of time won't change that, and looping near hook isn't going to be viable.

Remember, this meter isn't a frontline defense, it's meant as a last resort for if the hooked player is getting relentlessly facecamped. They don't want it to effect people NOT face camping, and I think you're just imagining the worst possible scenario of giving everyone basekit deliverance if a killer stays near hook for 5 seconds.
                        It's posts like this that make me glad that the majority of people here aren't on the design team because you're advocating for the killer to be punished for doing anything but camping. I'm not really sure how this fact eludes you or how unintuitive it is from understanding what is happening in the game state but honestly I'm not really going to exert any more effort here. You've got salty survivor syndrome all over you so Imma head out.

But hey, we'll see how it plays out when it hits the PTB later this year.
                            Homie what are you talking about haha. I'm not salty about anything and I'm not advocating for anything.

I don't want the killer to get punished for playing the game normally, neither does BHVR. All this change does is make it so if the killer stays very close to hook, then the hooked survivor can get a way off hook without having to sit there for 2 minutes and die. Seems like a pretty darn reasonable change to make.

All the killer has to do to prevent this is...not stay right next to the hook for a long time. It's that easy. It just sounds to me like you want to be able to camp hooks, which unfortunately is not what BHVR or the majority of the community wants.
                        Don‚Äôt bother debating him. ‚ÄúLooping near the hook‚Äù is a parrot phrase that hobbyist facecampers use to shut down discussion.

If they ever actually tried to play a pallet or moonwalked to hide their red stain and knew how chases work, they would know it is a hilariously misleading notion.
                    >Under what you're proposing there is no choice because the best strategy will almost always be: Take killer to hooked survivor to punish them both in time and getting a survivor off hook.

Do we even know how slow it goes or how long it takes? If having a survivor around makes it significant slower, then this is an awful 'tactic'

So instead of leading the killer away so someone can make a save, you decide to waste time by:

\- Not doing gens

\- Risk getting knocked next to a hooked survivor (better hope there is a good loop nearby or you'll die pretty quick)

\- Not allowing the hooked survivor to be rescued
                > Someone gets hooked, and weather the killer face camps or the survivors loop near hook, all of that leads to the hooked player losing a state or dying. And they have no say or control over it.

Correct, they don't, *nor should they*. If you found yourself hooked, you're now completely powerless over your fate unless you have Deliverance at the ready. Sure, it sucks if you get one hooked because of one reason or another, but that's the risk you take when you load into a game. You're not entitled to any specific amount of time or outcome, and whether or not you find your death circumstances palatable or not is irrelevant.

> All this change is doing is giving the hooked survivor a way to get off hook if they have no other option.

Meaning they're being given a free second or third chance (depending on design and circumstances) that's unearned, and through doing so, placing Marionette strings on the killer. I wonder when the day comes that survivors get a few of these to favor the killer side of things.

> The killer is making a choice to be near the hook, which makes it VERY difficult to get unhooks, that's exactly what this meter is for.

If this isn't the most nonsensical take I've ever heard, I don't know what is. How small-minded does one have to be to *actually* rationalize this particular point in the way you just tried to. I'm not going to insult your intelligence here, but you've reached a pretty low point with this one. Think of the immense power in chases survivors *already* have with the strength of tiles and their prevalence and spawn patterns. Chases, particularly against M1 killers, can last 90 seconds or more with relative ease, granted the survivors aren't braindead trash (in which case, you shouldn't balance anything around them anyway). If the survivor leads the chase near the hook and is skilled enough at looping, then the killer is in a lose-lose situation if he continues to chase. This basically forces the killer to break chase anytime the survivor runs that direction. This harkens back to the era of infinites, and the middle finger survivors would give you as they ran to the Safety Tree/Magic School Bus/etc. Good luck getting killers to play the game in that case.

> And if there's enough survivors near hook to where the killer would want to stay next to it anyways, the the meter does slow down. All this is going to punish is players staying very close to the hook for extended periods of time, nobody else.

That slowdown better be pretty damn significant, or else you'll just end up with survivors dancing on the edge of safety. The amount of power this puts in the hands of survivors could be absolutely unreal, and SWF is already completely stupid in terms of the power imbalance that already exists between survivor and killer. 

> And besides, lets make one thing clear: looping the killer near another downed/hooked survivor is literally one of the worst things a survivor can do.

Except when they have a safe zone and a survivor that can freely unhook themselves because of this stupid "fairness" mechanic.

> I don't want the killer to get punished for playing the game normally, neither does BHVR.

Camping *is* a normal part, as is tunneling, as is gen rushing, as is bully squad strats, and unless you're willing to curtail the power of those things, then your hypocritical diatribe is worthless. *Nothing* in the official rules of the game says "and when you unhook, you *must* leave the area **immediately**".

> All the killer has to do to prevent this is...not stay right next to the hook for a long time. It's that easy.

Sure. So when I get a survivor hooked in an area of multiple generators that I can defend all pretty well simultaneously, I now have to abandon my position and go sit in the corner of the map with my hand down my pants. God forbid I defend my position, try securing a kill, and put any momentum in my side. Heavens no, that might make some childish survivor player cry their eyeballs out.

> It just sounds to me like you want to be able to camp hooks, which unfortunately is not what BHVR or the majority of the community wants.

Oh I *do* love a good character argument. I mean, it's possible that someone could just have a logical or rational viewpoint on a particular thing, but it's best to assume they're just a bad person, just in case. I guess seeing something from a principled perspective and opposing it because of that just isn't feasible. Yes, I'm being sarcastic here, because you have to put on some very serious blinders to not realize that if you invoke power to change or remove gameplay strategies, in any direction, there will likely come a time when that power is used *against* you.

Imagine the outrage if any of the commonly complained about survivor elements were treated this way. Survivor-biased players would lose their hive-minds if SWF was removed, extra generators were added, or any other point complained about whether or not its complaints are warranted.

EDIT: Another user making his emotional appeal and tucking tail and blocking me. Apparently valuing principles of player freedom in choice of how to play is a hot take. Who knew?
                    I can *feel* the anger you clearly had while typing this. Really appreciate the insults by the way, very cool of you.

This change is giving people who were going to have their games ruined, another chance. It's encouraging killers to actually engage with the full game instead of just camping. It's a good thing no matter how much you personally feel entitled to camping for kills in this game.

The fact that you said people aren't entitlted to any specific outcome is one of the most unempathetic takes I've read on this sub. You really should try to remember that the people you're playing against *are people,* and your desire to win in a casual game that doesn't record or rank wins, shouldn't supercede someones desire to have a chance at having fun. 

Yes as a matter of fact, people should be entitled to matches where someone doesn't single them out and ruin their match, matches where they can get the chance to have fun, win or lose. Same way killers should be entitled to not getting infinite looped, and dealing with infinite and quick self healing, win or lose. This isn't the wild west where everyone fights for their own experience, it's a *game* and it's up to the devs to make sure everyone can have fun.

You seem to be forgetting that *this is not a competitive game*. There is no ranked mode, there is no ranked ladder, you can't see your MMR, there's no significant reward for winning, the game doesn't even define what a win is. Playing to win at all costs is passable in games that focus heavily on competition with ranked ladders and such (you know, e-sports titles), but dbd is not that. It's a casual game that's supposed to be fun.

As such, getting camped out at 5 gens isn't fun, this change is trying to remedy that. And guess what, if it's problematic it will be tuned until it's fine. That's what tests are for. I think you're *far* too caught up in the competitive aspects of this game and are forgetting that most of us are just here for some good fun.

Don't bother responding, because I'm blocking you. You're clearly not fit to be having a rational discussion about this.
        Slows but doesn't stop completely.  
Also these kind of radius mechanics in the game so far have been either spheres or infinitely tall cylinders so on The Game and Midwhich survivors will abuse free deliverances out of it by trying to get chases to above or below the hook.  
If the hook is on Midwich in an inner courtyard next to the wall - you will count as "close to hook" if you are in the classroom behind, despite the walking distance to the hook being a long path.
            I think you're overblowing how fast this meter is going to be filling up, and how far away it will work lol. You're describing it like it'll fill up in 10 seconds even if the killer is on a different floor or in a different room, which I highly doubt is the intention.

They're not tryna give everyone basekit deliverance, they're trying to stop face camping. If you're not face camping then you have nothing to worry about.
                They literally say it fills up through floors and it can result in unintended punishment for killers. I don't trust BHVR to implement this correctly.
                    Yes, I meant that it won't fill up quickly if they're far enough. Yes if you're just one room over it'll probably still be filling up, but it's gonna be very slow.
                        How slow do you think it's gonna be? My guess is it'll probably be the same as wiggle bar so like 16 seconds. It's pretty easy to loop a killer for 16 seconds around a hook.
                            There's no way they're gonna make it 16 seconds even if it's JUST the killer face camping.

And besides, if someone is looping near the hook then the bar fills up much more slowly. Survivors being near slow it down, remember?
Because it‚Äôs an awful idea.
That would be ideal
I hope it goes through with the added caveat that killer receive basekit buffs as well. I'm not watching stream so idk what's all coming, I'll check the sub ig
Yep, just like the Finisher Mori, like, the concept required more work for sure (specially UB perk) but the general idea was fine, or at lest the intention. But of course Killers cried about it because anything that targets their unhealthy play-styles is bad.
    The finisher mori had legit huge issues though. 

For once thing, if all 4 survcivors went down really early, everyone just died with no counter to it. Bad. 

Everyone getting a free Unbreakable was bad for killers like oni, myers and twins who realy on slugging. 

&#x200B;

It had a good core, but it had plenty of issues.
        > For once thing, if all 4 survcivors went down really early, everyone just died with no counter to it.

I mean, if that happens currently the game's pretty much over anyways, unless someone brought UB. With the proposed change they could at least get a chance, unless they all went down in >40 seconds.


> Everyone getting a free Unbreakable was bad for killers like oni, myers and twins who realy on slugging.

The recovery time got increased though, it went from 30 seconds to 40/45 (?) seconds... If you needed to slug for more than that I feel like it's OK to get punished for it.

UB (perk) was the main issue, but again, it's something that can get worked around, like making it a one time use still or have it work like Built to Last in which every subsequent recovery is less effective.

Again, the concept needed work, but I feel like the overall idea was fine, targeting the most annoying types of slugging.
            The idea i thought was fine but, but it defently needing more time in the oven is all.
            I've had multiple games where everyone has gone down but because my power struggle builds runs unbreakable I've been able to pick myself back up and we eventually won, I'd be so sad if they ever added that finisher mori the way they were planning it.
    I didn‚Äôt think it would have been that hard. Make it so the last survivor mori (the yellow one) is built in the kit.
    >anything that targets their unhealthy play-styles is bad.

have you ever thought why they use 'unhealthy' playstyles, or why are these so effective?
i mean probably camping is  thing but its not like you can just allow the other suriviors to unhook scott free either it also depends on the size because some of the smaller maps will have issues
That‚Äôs something they have to be ready for: The feedback will be negative because a tiny, vocal, and extremely toxic minority of killer players just love face camping.

My hope is for them to spot out the bot accounts with 2 days post history criticizing it, and move forward anyway, as they should have done with BaseUB (even if that did need some small fixes)
I look forward to having to keep track of yet another mechanic as a killer.
That‚Äôs a good idea! Though it should tick down slowly, so that killers can‚Äôt just dip in and out of the radius repeatedly to guard a hooked survivor
    If the distance is correct, even "dipping in and out" would just be proximity camping, which is fair strategy (3 gen situation mostly)  and certainly not "face camping" as they go out their way to say this is meant to deter.
        Absolutely! I‚Äôm excited/curious to see how it‚Äôs implemented, whether both killer and survivor can see a visual radius of it, aswell as how large the radius is. Hopefully it‚Äôs done well as to not be completely useless or ridiculously overpowered
If a killer is simply passing by, it sounds like the idea would be that the bar would build, but not enough for them to unhook.

Keep in mind, the bar is basically racing against the entity progression meter. As long as the self-unhook doesn't fill before that, the killer's pressure stays fine. I would wager it can be thought of in a simple way like "The killer can be within the radius for no more than 30sec(?) of the entity progress before the unhook meter fills", which still definitely allows for walking back and forth from kicking a gen or something.
    That's still bad especially on smaller maps. It could happen incidentally or survivors can use their hooked teammate at as a semi safe zone.

It would punish you for even going to check to see if there's a survivor going for the unhook.
Huntresses lookin at this change: *pathetic*     
That said - better than nothing
I won't deny it, I've proxy camped as killer.

The good part of it for survivors is, if they can get close enough to the hooks before I realize they're nearby, they can get away with at most an injury. If I've created a deadzone that forces a trade, that's something I've earned by committing to prior chases, and may require survivors to play more aggressively or in teams.
They said it turns off when the gates are powered.

Basically like how off the record shuts off at that point.
it's disabled on egc so you can camp when the exit games are powered lol
    Ooooof course, they just refuse to take away the killer‚Äôs free kill for facecamping in endgame lol
  
I get there‚Äôs nothing else to do but that doesn‚Äôt require giving a consolation prize for just having someone hooked in endgame.
  
Edit:  people seem to be really up in arms about this.  My main issue is not that camping EXISTS in endgame.  I get that it‚Äôs clearly the only thing a killer CAN do right now.  My problem is that it becomes STRONGER in endgame because they purposely disable any protection against it.  In that sense, camping as a strategy is REWARDED in endgame as opposed to any other time.
  
While we‚Äôre on the topic, yes, I hate hatch too.  It incentivizes both sides playing shitty (hiding while your teammate dies, and slugging for a 4k) and would be better off being reworked into a ‚Äúfinal chase‚Äù mechanic heavily favoring the killer‚Äôs side.
        I mean unhooking yourself in endgame is basically guaranteed escape. Good teamwork is too.

If a killer has someone hooked in endgame, they're allowed to have that pressure. I don't see how it's fair that once the gates are open the killer is helpless. I think it's balanced the way it currently is.
            Survs want those free endgame escapes, so they can heal up, then wait to teabag the killer in the gate.
        So sorry that the gates being open doesn't mean you get an auto-win.

The only objective left for the killer at that point IS the hook. If you get caught during EGC then that's on you. The whole point then is if your team will come to get you or not. If you could just deli yourself off then the killer might as well just AFK the moment the gates open.
            That‚Äôs fine and dandy, but please explain why camping needs to become MORE effective in endgame?
                Because, as the devs already said, the killer has no other objective. During the regular game the killer has gens to protect and the survivors has no where to go if they get caught.

But during the EGC the survivors can escape to 100% safety and the killer really only has one objective once someone is hooked: the hooked survivor. If the killer leaves that hook you know, I know, and everyone else knows that the odds of the killer getting anyone else are relatively low.

So punishing the killer for playing to their only objective isn't fair or good for the game. Like sucks that you got caught, it's what happens during that stage.
        So what would we do? Just chase you to gate yet someone freely unhooks?
            Whatever you feel like.  Not that hard of a concept.  Try to catch someone out, force them out of the gate, or stand there and they unhook themselves.
  
Or, y‚Äôknow, don‚Äôt let them reach that phase of the game to begin with if you think you ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù a kill.
                Okay, I‚Äôll just tunnel out harder than. This just gives an incentive to slow down Gens even more which I‚Äôm all for. To not let them get to the end phase.
                    As if you wouldn‚Äôt already do that.  At least the perks to prevent that actually work up until endgame.
        Oh it's not free, I've rescued and been rescued from endgame facecamps quite a number of times.
            It‚Äôs very free as long as you run any killer with STBFL or a chase power.
        > I get there‚Äôs nothing else to do but that doesn‚Äôt require giving a consolation prize for just having someone hooked in endgame.

I suppose you feel differently about hatch being a consolation prize as well.
            Nope, hatch has been dumb as shit as long as it‚Äôs existed and, like the disabling of anti tunnel perks in endgame, incentives shitty gameplay like letting your teammate die for hatch or slugging to prevent a hatch escape.  Would be better to do away with it and rethink the system.  
  
Ideally, we‚Äôd just get rid of the whole ‚Äúprotection perks disable in endgame‚Äù and then rework hatch to some sort of ‚Äúfinal chase‚Äù mechanic heavily weighted in the killer‚Äôs favor.
Nope they said it disables as soon as the exit gates are powered
Literally tunneling wouldn't be an issue if they revert DS back to 5s stun. You can't stop tunneling but sometimes it's a good thing, there are gameplay interacts around it unlike camping.
    I 100% agree with this. The meta is changed enough where it wouldn‚Äôt be run by *everybody*, but it‚Äôd actually have a purpose unlike its current version.
    if DS gets reverted, i want CoB and Pain Res get reverted also
It's a good thing that the change isn't meant to be a swiss army knife that solves all of the "annoying" ways a killer can play into a survivor.

Obviously the solution BH is proposing isn't perfect.  What is important is if it does what it is meant to do and the trade off(s) it brings are worth it or not.
Endurance really should just make you lose your collision with the killer while it's active.
Why would survivors unhook themselves early? They'll wait for the 60 seconds to be nearly up before doing so.

If they're even decent, they'll use 10sec BT to vault a window, and then the killer has to handle another entire chase. Now they've wasted well over a minute trying to force second stage, with absolutely nothing stopping the other 3 survivors doing gens (normally, some of them would get off to unhook, but not against a camper)
    While I agree that would be the strategic take, I would say that the impulsive take is more likely to take over. Why? Because what's more fun? Actually interacting with the map, or hanging doing nothing on the hook? People will opt for the chance to unhook themselves and I think killers will capitalize on that fact. Given, this is just a prediction, it's hard to say without hard data what the tendency will be; what we do know is that under the current meta it's been highly favorable to tunnel somebody out of the match.
        Survivors spend their whole game *buying time* for their teammates to do other things by leading the killer on chases. Some of them even appreciate hook time as a brief "time out" from having to chase. I really think you misunderstand the psychology of playing survivor.
            I don't, I have nearly 6k hours in this game, probably majority as survivor.   
Of course survivors try to waste time, but the moment that it becomes a 3v1, they're severely disadvantaged and that's the main reason why killers play in the way that they do. While say a well-coordinated swf will take the strategic option, most people will opt for the more interactive approach because it's personally more fun than not doing anything. Games do not last long enough for there to be the 'let me take a break incentive'. I think you really misunderstand the psychology of playing survivor.
good news: it is
True. Endgames should be about securing a kill. I think devs have said in the past that the endgame is their favorite part of the game, iirc.
they said it will make the bar fill at a reduced rate
    Why should the bar fill at all? Survivors shouldn't lead a killer to an active hook and should be punished harder for that.
        I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs so that if you‚Äôve been getting hard facecamped and your bar is on like 90% you can still get the effect if one of your teammates is a moron.
        The problem is the one who gets punished is still the one on hook, not the one who lead the killer there
it slows down.
[removed]
    True, but now all other survivors know the person on hook can unhook, themselves, letting them crank gens as fast as possible.  


Meanwhile, the survivor on the hook will unhook themselves last moment before hitting stage two, do a bit of chase with basekit BT and then repeat on the 2nd hookstage.

        No it doesn't, you can easily double hit a unhooked survivor as bubba in a single sweep with addons
        Bubba main. Not really that hard, just need to time it.
        bubba can still catch up to sb
        Not even almost impossible. Bubba picks up a lot of speed when he's using the chainsaw. You'll get downed again quickly as sure as night follows day
I would wager for the past year, they've been prototyping various anti-camping mechanisms before settling on this one. Highly doubt this is their first attempt at it.

> what if survivors hover really close to the zone but don't fully get in it?

Then chase them.

> what if there are gens really close and you're zoning an area?

I could still see this working fine through proxy camping. Say, an area only has one approach, has a nearly-done generator you've kicked, and a hook victim. You'd guard the approach to the area, not sit in front of the hook. Even if the victim does unhook themselves, 10sec BT might not get them out of that region. (Meanwhile, survivors could counter you by teaming up to distract you)

> how will it effect leatherface who can just double hit anyway and is the most notorious face camper?

The fact that it doesn't fix literally every killer imbalance shouldn't be a reason not to do it. Even for leatherface, while it's going to be easier to facecamp than most of the roster, it's still going to be *harder* than it was before since survivors no longer need to unhook.
    >I would wager for the past year, they've been prototyping various anti-camping mechanisms before settling on this one. Highly doubt this is their first attempt at it.

have you played this game long? do you even remember the last patch before the PTB? 

>Then chase them.

What I mean here is the survivor doesn't come close enough to commit, but far enough away to make the chase worthless.

>The fact that it doesn't fix literally every killer imbalance shouldn't be a reason not to do it. Even for leatherface, while it's going to be easier to facecamp than most of the roster, it's still going to be harder than it was before since survivors no longer need to unhook.

but the fact that it won't work on the most widely used face camper has to be an issue.
What is kekw?
    It's originally from world of warcraft iirc, there's two factions/races that couldn't understand each other so in game some letters got mixed around, lols or something like that was changed into kekw for the other side. This is all just based off of memory though
    Its a twitch emote, from a third party app.
        I don't think twitch emotes work on Reddit
    It's something cringe zoomers say that's adopted from Twitch chat, which, when input in chat, shows an emoji of man laughing. 

People who use this as a form of expression are typically young, have high anxiety, and boast mediocre social skills. 

They're pretty monkaS.

Dude, it's Juan Joya Borja (rip), this is hardly a zoomer thing, his iconic laughter became popular on the internet almost a decade ago, and the emote just used his face

I hope I get to camp you for this comment.
    Oh no, i made a basement dwelling redditor cry. What shall i do??? Kek
Dynamic. Strong up close, tapers off with distance. This is to soft counter proxy camping.
oh noooooooo
we'll probably ban the use of it since in most leagues we ban 4%-ing off of hook except if you have Deliverance.
    But the 4% is banned because it adds an element of luck. This is a guaranteed chance like deli so I think it would be allowed.
        I think a lot of people in the comp community understand that camping at the root of it is a strategy to employ. BHVR is making this change for the aspect of fun, rather than strategy. Sometimes, facecamping a survivor when gens aren't completed, or proxying a surv in an area with active gens, IS the best option.

This is at least my opinion on the changes. Good change against boring pub killers though lol.
            Eh it's a strategy with counters like......... nothing lol especially if it's billy or something. Kinda boring that sometimes killers only need 6 hooks to win or something and so they just face camp their first down and the match is already over no matter what the survs do. Also ignoring game mechanics because killers would prefer staring at a survivor for 60-120 seconds is kinda stupid, i'm sure killers can get buffed in different ways like perk bans and stuff rather than ignoring the ability to unhook yourself guaranteed.
                matches are often mirrored for both teams so they have the same win conditions. Likewise, if you go down early enough vs a billy you probably should get punished for it. Survs can certainly win but we factor both hook states and gens getting done for point scoring.
Considering most "tunneling" from what I have seen involves the unhooked survivor bumbling their way into the killer who was looking for someone else. There are no fixes for it that wouldn't punish killers who aren't actively trying to be an asshole.
    Yeah I guess you‚Äôre right
They actually couldn‚Äôt abuse this since it won‚Äôt gain progress if a survivor is near the hook
It will likely empower proxy camping even more BUT...its a step in the right direction at the very least.  Literally almost anything is better than the current situation is lol.  At the very least it may encourage the killer to patrol gens or take actual chases rather than just wait for hook trades only...which is seemily becoming something that is a part of almost every match on survivor side nowadays.
    Yeah. Face camping is always favoured towards the killer- ***if survivors go for the save.*** If not? 1 or maybe 2k with an effortless escape for the other survivors that played it properly.

Proxy is all down to skill though and it's a fairly even matchup since now you won't be able to fall back onto face camping if you fuck up. You pretty much have to send multiple survivors without making it obvious that there are multiple coming. I've noticed players don't like adapting new strategies much though so it's likely quite favoured towards killer role still.

***But as we all know as indisputable truth (apparently), you can't expect any coordination from solo survivors so anything that requires teamwork is automatically impossible to counter.***
Then what are they supposed to do? Nothing?
    There's nothing you really *can* do to completely nullify camping. Camping is something that's inherent of the whole design of the game with players becoming stationary objectives.

I'm not saying that this will do nothing. It will stop face camping, the thing that many players complain about and find boring, but at the same time it will train even the most beginner killer players to be more efficient at camping.

"Worse" killers who ***only*** face camp will be erased from the game, essentially. Which is good really. They'll end up becoming even more effective killers though.

Escaping proxy camping is down to skill so it's a bit more balanced than face camping but higher skilled killers will come out on top if they can get a proxy inside of a 3-gen just about every time.
Spoken like a true survivor main.
Exactly. This has way too much potential for abuse.
    It‚Äôs the same as when they wanted to let survivors get off the ground without perks.
> so you camp to create pressure

I feel like you don't have much experience going against 4mans. Camping doesn't create pressure. Chasing people does.
    You‚Äôre right. Chasing does, but you ever go against those swfs that basically throw themselves at the hook to unhook their friend? 
Like they‚Äôll smash out 4 gens in the least amount of time possible, but get dumb when you camp their friend.
        No, I don't have intimate knowledge of how dumb people get when I camp their friends. Because I don't camp.

Meanwhile, I've had games as Deathslinger where my first hook was with 1 gen remaining, and I still made a comeback and got a 4k.
            I think when you play enough killer you experience any type of match you can think of. I‚Äôve had plenty of game go just how you explained. 

I know that some people that play killer can use camping as the only play style, but I think of it as a tool in the chest that you can use when needed.
Camping doesnt create pressure. Just chase other people, otherwise you have 3 people completing 2 gens instead of 1 person on a gen while one is saving and the other is being chased :)
    Just go read my replies to the other guy
 pretty much.
Nope.
Why should they? This isn't a balance change, it's a "making the game more exciting than watching paint dry" change.
    People have made a great point that because it only slows when other survivors around it encourages people to loop around hooked teammates to fuck the killer.
    Still a buff to survivors like basekit bt was.
I don't think its related to terror radius
    If it's not there's still even more issues with it, still the end game collapse. And what about all the hook pause perks? Is Kinship just completely pointless now? Like, there's so many issues with adding something like this. Instead it should simply be "Moving to second hook state allows the Survivor to stun the killer for 3 seconds if within 6 meters and escape the hook but be affected by the Broken status effect for 30 seconds"

So basically a different Deliverance where you have to take 2 hook stages to activate.  


The End Game is my main issue. A LOT of games especially on weaker killers, getting a single kill often requires face camping them during that stage. Otherwise you're not getting even 1 kill, and having 3 other people makes saving a possibility, but also a risk. Facecamping before 5 gens are done yeah, something needs to be done about that. But not in the end game.
        So real quick breaking down each point in this post

\- Disabled once the exit gates are powered, killers only objective at that point is the hook which they said it does disable during the endgame and when survivors swarm the hook.

\- They said the bar fills up slowly when the killer is further away so Kinship and Camaraderie will still be good, extending your phase 1 and 2 as to give more time for your unhook bar to go up against say a proxying basement trapper who slightly leaves to get traps etc.

\- You do not need to take 2 hook stages, they said the bar fills up based on killer proximity to hook they didn't mention it taking a full stage which ties back into the Kinship/Camaraderie
            Tiny correction, it gets disabled when the gates are powered, not when opened, meaning survivors can't abuse 99 gates to get free unhooks in the endgame.
            Okay the first two points are good. I am glad to hear that.  


The third point however, was simply my own little idea for an anti-facecamp idea, not actually what they're doing.
                Aa gotcha, thought maybe you knew something i didn't
Haven‚Äôt played in 3 months. None of the subsequent updates have made me feel like I‚Äôm welcome back to the game as a killer main. Survs won‚Äôt be happy till they 4 man escape every game. It‚Äôs ridiculous.
They said it does
    What about in EGC?
        Doesn‚Äôt work when exit gates are powered
            Cool, cool.
It turns off  once the gens are done.
Most of the time killers face-camp to be toxic...
Not happy about this, as it only empowers bully squads and gen rushers even more.
Lmao, so you rather have survivors lose a whole round because they lose one 50:50 at a palette and get camped to death
    So a Survivor on top of the SH school should get a free escape because I was chasing someone on a lower floor while 2 others pound out gens? Great logic from the Survivor mains as always.
        Who said that?
            The devs, because the range doesn't respect flooring. Probably because they can't code for crap. This is ridiculous, so many hooks are clustered around high traffic zones or near gens, so Killers are now punished when chases lead them near hooks so this idiotic meter builds?
                Before heading deeper down into the salt mine you might wanna wait for the actual mechanic to come ATLEAST to the PTB, youre being very pessimistic on the competence of the devs and the impact of this new mechanic on your game enjoyment
                    Because 7 years of incompetent game design and clear favoritism for the Survivor side give all the reason in the world to be quite judgemental of their intent and performance.
Crying days before the PTB even releases....
Cuz face camping is such a skillful strategy right?
    Nice straw man. If You can‚Äôt see the abuse this will bring up, you‚Äôre blind. Especially with a swf.  Chase a survivor into the radius and free unhook
        Nope, the timer slows to a crawl if a surv is near, but hey let‚Äôs make shit up right?
            And you don‚Äôt see an issue with that? And I haven‚Äôt listened to the stream. I‚Äôm going off what OP says
                No I don‚Äôt see an issue, why would you want survivors to horde around a hook with no penalty?
                    Hold on. I think I‚Äôm misunderstanding you. I understood it as when the survivors are around the hook, the hook timer slows down. Is that not the case?
                "i haven't listened to the stream" then maybe don't share your uninformed opinion on it?
They said it‚Äôs completely disabled once gates are powered
Survivor mains won‚Äôt be happy until they have 4 man escapes regularly. Killer main, and I haven‚Äôt played this game in 3 months, these updates haven‚Äôt made me change my mind.
They said it would not activate during EGC
    Shouldn't be active once the grns are done. 99ing doors is already super strong as it is.
The difference is that a smart or even just decent survivor will know they can just save the unhook for the last second of the phase, giving them more time than if they were just left on to second (given it doesn‚Äôt unhook automatically which would be weird)

The only way it makes camping easier is if the survivor makes the mistake of unhooking at a bad time which shouldn‚Äôt be the killers problem
    You‚Äôre not wrong there, but this poses another problem: how many randos do you see using practical judgment when they have a ‚Äúget out of jail free card‚Äù?
they actually give them even more time. a camper will most likely also tunnel you. so instead from going from normal mode to struggle mode in just a second you can escape, waste another few seconds of the killers time until they get you again and a few more seconds to carry you back to a hook before struggle mode. and then you can do it once again before going to be sacrificed.
    Y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt getting it, and it shows.
        Looks like you aren‚Äôt getting it. Even tho I explained it very well üíÄ
I thought it was because your average serial facecampers weren't skilled enough to get more than one or two downs per game?
    Probably not but the design of the game doesn't encourage them to do much else
They literally said it turns off during endgame...
They should make a change to where it‚Äôs allowed in end game, but during the game you can‚Äôt.
    Honestly this change is just going to make me tunnel people harder and slug.
> if one survivor being chased goes within 10 to 15 meters of the hooked survivor then the timer is slowed to 30%

Any progress is too much progress if killer in a chase.  Otherwise, you give swfs yet another buff.
Effects are slowed down by survivors being around it regardless of chase. It is also turned off entirely once the last gen pops
Nope, both stages. This is now a special case where you can unhook yourself in second stage.
They said other survs being nearby slows down the gauge, and it does work on 2nd hook
    Thanks couldn‚Äôt watch live stream when it happened.

Survivors win hook stands off now then if it just slows and doesn‚Äôt pause hmmm.
>survivor also looping in the area Near the hook does timer pause?  
>  
>Can survivors unhook themselves on second stage too?  
>  
>I guess it‚Äôs imposs

surviors near the hook slow the progress, surviovrs can unhook themselves in stage two, and the self unhook is turned off once exit gates are powered
the dev broadcast
    Seriously? Fucking finally
I would imagine it‚Äôs not going to be terror radius based at all because if it is it‚Äôs completely countered by undetectable killers/perks.
    Correct. Insidious camping would still very much be a thing.
    Wesker: *Sweats nervously*
        Why?
            40 meter terror radius
                They said the radius of the hook. Not killer. Monstrous shrine works this way too. Punishing individual killers would make no sense.
                    I am aware. I was explaining the joke that I thought you might not have gotten, even if the joke is not applicable in this situation because the radius for camping is at 16m.
    BT used to only activate if it happened in the TR and stealth killers would use their undetectable to counter just that...  
Not that you didn't necessarily know that already. Just buttressing your statement.
        I did know, but I‚Äôm hoping that they learned something from that! Can‚Äôt see them making that mistake this time, insidious is a well established camping tool already so if they‚Äôve somehow not thought of that I would be surprised.
            Unfortunately committing the same mistake is very BHVR
                Gonna sound crazy here, but I think Behaviour has geniunely gotten *better* as a developer.  I don't see this only being linked to the TR. Basement Bubba is likely one of the major camping tactics they want to counter.
                    They've gotten better for sure, but they also make the same boneheaded mistakes over and over sometimes.
                        You could say that there's a Merciless Storm of them.
                            Sadako is my favorite please don't activate my ptsd lol
                    They replaced the person in charge of balancing and they seem much more competent? The recent meta shakeup seems quite positive.
                        Positive if you only play Survivor. Whatever idiot is in charge of balancing this mess clearly has one priority, and it's make Killer unplayable while giving Survivors free wins at all costs at this point. Even the so called Survivor 'nerf' recently nerfed Killers harder than anything else in ages, gutting tons of perks and effectively removing them from play entirely, while Survivor healing was barely touched with the lightest of possible wrist slaps, and most of the actual nerfs that were supposed to happen instead were screamed and cried and whined away, showing, ultimately, this game is beyond help. The devs are insanely biased, and when they're not, the larger community can simply throw a fit and get what they want as the devs will bend the knee.

Hit the nail on the head bud. I don't think there's a way to recover from it when the survivor-only players just cry about every little inconvenience and get it fixed since that's a majority of the playerbase. 

The killer-only players do it too, but it's drowned out because it's maybe 20% of the playerbase. Flashlights caused seizures in some killer players because they could be spammed, and the survivor-only players threw a  fit over flashlights being "nerfed." üòë

It was literally hurting players, and I think that's the real reason people used the flashlight spam, to annoy or injure the player, not the killer.
                            I'm having an easy time with perks such as Sloppy Butcher, Nowhere to Hide, Jolt, and Safe the Best for Last. I highly recommend these. Slowdown isn't necessary anymore and it's much better.
    Hmmm. I like them doing something about face camping but it feels the guy on the hook could therefore call the position of a stealth killer easily. Guess it'll just depend on the radius size.
Isn‚Äôt there a hole on the 2nd floor of that map. Directly looking over a hook?
    There is also hooks next to the stairs if I remember right on some variations of the game.
    Definitely.  Surprisingly when i camped there nobody took the plunge that I expected but was convinced would be to obvious.
It's 100% going to be vertical as well, which will suck for some maps but also handles camping up above the basement.

        With agitation and iron grasp I can get to basement from near half the map on some maps. It's still a massive choke point and this doesn't even solve that because you still have to leave basement and run into the killer losing at least half your borrowed time timer and against trapper doesn't even help then.
        Basement is a very strong hook spot regardless. Many killer powers allow you to abuse how predictable it is, and it‚Äôs very easy to defend even without actually facecamping by just patrolling relatively near it. 

Survivors may make a mistake (although let‚Äôs be real it‚Äôs not that difficult to get hooked in the basement) but the Killer simply sitting infront of the hook should *also* be punished for making the mistake of not properly pressuring the team and just trying to cheese out one kill.
        i don't know what gave you the idea that getting hooked in the basement is a Survivor mistake? it's as much of a mistake as going down at all basement is an outdated mecanic only served a purpose when hooks used to be permanently sabotaged it's not an excuse for the killer to be an asshole.
That's the hope, but just remember that hook spawns don't take that into account when they should
I don't know how they would deal with this loophole but camping basement would still be an issue then.
I hope "terror radius" is being used as a substitute for others words, because as someone that mains Nem and Wesker and doesn't camp (unless they bm), that'd be a huge issue.
Its not abuse. This is still harder than face camping, wich is what we get now. We really need to stop changing the game around nurse.
    It already is. They‚Äôve nerfed perks (ex: awakened awareness) because nurse players would exploit them with their power. BHVR refuses to rework nurse and instead prefer to balance the game around her. Take your head out of the sand and see the planned platitudes for what they are.
        Starstruck was never nerfed cause of Nurse, you're thinking of Awakened Awareness. Which they could honestly revert the change since Nurse can no longer use Starstruck.
        Without a complete Nurse Rework, the best solution for BHVR IS to balance the game over balancing Nurse herself.
No matter what balancing changes you do the nurse, she will still be able to counter basically the whole looping aspect of the game by going through walls

It does suck that perks need to be nerfed from what they could be if she wasn't in the game though...
I think you might be giving BHVR too much credit.
Nurse is a killer tho
    ü§Ø
Exactly. If it lasts long enough for the rest of your team to finish gens and get out then the problem is solved regardless of if the face camped survivor makes it out. 

As is, the killer can face camp and easily get another two kills just because of how long it takes to do Gens.
    Hopefully this stops teammates from lingering around the hook and actually motivates them to do gens
        Yeah, I personally think that's the issue. I'd rather have a constant killer aura reveal on hook without perks
    Plus now the person getting face camped can actually reset and try chase again if they have DS/BT/Secondwind, burning even more of the killer‚Äôs time.
        I mean against most killers it's going to be ok.  Against a bubba though it is super easy to burn through borrowed time or off the record.  I imagine that it will make the person die faster than if they just sat on the hook against bubba
    Right, you wouldn‚Äôt even need to reassure them until stage 2 if the killer is camping so that‚Äôs very good gen efficiency
        Get Reassurance for both stages to max out survivor's time efficiency.

Second Wind, Lithe, DS, Blood Rush etc 

does it suck to still run a build to avoid camping? Yes... but I can see how some players or SWF could try to have fun with this
            Absolutely
    If Killer is face camping for 2 minutes yet have plenty of time to get 2 more kills, those must be absurdly fast chases
        Most face campers get kills by grabbing people trying to get the hook or downing them after
        Depends on when the killer gets the down and if kindred is being used, 2 minutes is 120 seconds.  
If the killer downs the survivor at 5 gens even if the other 3 have their gens at 45 seconds (50%) they still need another 45 seconds to finish them and then at least 90 seconds to finish one of the 2 remaining (one gets worked by 1 person, the other by 2) 90+45 its 135, by that time the killer has 15 seconds to find someone and start a new chase and this is not taking on acount distance traveled to another gen or perks  like Deadlock.  
This assuming kindred is in play and the 3 survivors know the killer is camping, if they dont at least one or two will go check the hook, see the killer camping and then going back, increasing the overall time needed to fix all gens remaining, add NOED into the mix to get a very easy down once the gens are done and you can almost guarantee 2 or 3 kills without putting that much effort except on the first chase.  


Even if you get the down at 4 gens is very easy to get 3 kills if you facecamp using NOED and Deadlock.
Kindred mains rejoice
    Not till they get rid of that BS annoying black bubble
While that may be true, if a bubba is determined, there isn't much to stop them, even with this method in place. They would have to do some adjusting, idk what that would be but it would have to be something worth while
    True but imo the problem with camping is the killer doesnt get one kill, they get easily 2/3 or even 4 sometimes.  


I dont have that much of a problem with the killer getting one kill if they decide to camp, it sucks but honestly it would be really hard to find a method where that doesnt happen and cant be abused without overhauling the entire hook system, I think having the killer getting a pity kill its the lesser evil in this instance.  


I do have a problem with the killer winning the match just because they downed someone at 4/5 gens and decided to stand still for 2 minutes, especially against solos who cant tell eachother whats happening and must go to the hook to learn they have to rush gens.
You‚Äôre assuming face-camping bubbas even understand how to play the game‚Ä¶ Okay, all jokes aside though, I do like this change.
DS is a joke.
    It will still buy you time to get to a nearby tile or give your team 1 extra minute to finish gens and get out
        3 seconds is enough to get you two feet. Any ranged or speed killer eats that
            3 seconds is still more time for your teammates to knock out gens.  Not including time for killer to pick you up and take you to a hook either. Any time you can buy your team while being facecamped is precious.  With dead hard you can extend those 3 seconds into potentially minutes
                You went from 1 minute to 3 seconds real quick
                    And yes, it activates for one minute but as soon as you do a conspicuous action it deactivates
                    And yes, it‚Äôs 3 second stun off the shoulder, one of which is spent rolling off the shoulder.
                    1 minute is if the killer decides to play around DS, aka, dont pick you up until 1 minute.
                And again, it‚Äôs useless without a companion perk. You can‚Äôt change the argument to ‚Äúwith deadhard‚Äù when deadhard+DS is a new concept to the argument. DS, without any helpers is garbage.
                    DS is still a pretty good perk, as in much better than most other perks, it just isn't the god tier perk it used to be, if your team is efficient on gens even the few seconds that it gets you are useful and can change the outcome of a game and it only gets stronger if you pair it with other perks like dead hard or off the record
                        That‚Äôs the thing it can‚Äôt stand alone. And if your team isn‚Äôt doing gens in the first place it‚Äôs buying dead time. If you only play in solo queue it‚Äôs kind of a wasted perk slot. I guess I can concede if I had a team it would be different. I‚Äôve come to realize as a survivor the game sucks without friends to enjoy the game with. I mainly play killer
                            It's ok alone and amazing combined so that's what most people do. Solo queue isn't really the issue it's just that the average player is trash at the game, and the game happens to be killer sided if you put average players against average players (as in bad vs bad). At least when playing with friends communication let's you compensate for individual bad decisions and playing a game with friends is always more fun, that's honestly how I think you are supposed to play the game, either as survivor with friends or as killer if you are solo
            Skill issue
                Who said I run DS? Ain‚Äôt nobody
Off the record, DS, Styptic. Make them earn it.
Exactly every second counts and those shitties know it. Now we can at least contribute to the match than have our brain dead team mates walk into his saw. If he catches me one, shame on me and so on. That's a much better system than: he hooked you, youre dead.
Waiting for BHVR to change Bubba's chainsaw attack to a "special attack" and make this specifically not work against recently unhooked Survivors or something.
    Bubbas saw is a special attack
Endurance already protects you from Bubba, even through his chainsaw
    He can double hit you is what I mean
    If he revs his chainsaw immediately behind you, he can hit you twice in the same charge assuming there's no cover nearby
        Not if are sprint bursting.
            This would require you to time your Sprint Burst amazingly well and I'll be real honest: Most Survivors won't be able to do it in the scenario you're proposing. They'd have to WALK up to the hook and have it saved and ready and while a lot of people will walk to hooks to save it, a lot wouldn't.
So what would the advantage of using Bubba be after that.

Like for real, what‚Äôs his power doing other than that?
    Really easy insta downs, aoe power, going though pallets really fast.
        It's also a pretty solid chase/loop tool or denier. If someone is trying to hover a pallet they have to choose to drop it early or risk getting hit trying to get the stun. And people really underestimate how far you can go with all three charges, I've caught a lot of people out as they leave a loop expecting me to run out of steam before I catch them.
            Haven't played in awhile didn't he have a add on that gives extra distance on good timing hitting your charges
        As a Bubba main myself, his power is not an easy instadown if you know your window techs. He has legitimately zero map pressure. His strength comes from having a strong chase and the ability to wipe pallets out quickly, but if you have 2 other medium skill teammates and an acorn on your team he will lose all his gens. Its why bad bubbas facecamp: he can't harass more than 1 or 2 survivors consistently.
    You know you can chase with him normally and still win games, playing against a bubba who doesn't camp is actually fun.  


But because camping right now is so easy with him everyone is doing that because he is the easiest face camping killer.
    Bubba has an incredibly strong chase power:  It gives him a speed boost, allows him to insta-down survivors,  allows for multiple downs in a single usage, it instantly breaks pallets/walls, and if used properly can completely ignore the endurance effect.  Also, attempting to use a locker to avoid Bubba's chainsaw is a huge risk in and of itself.  The timings of his tantrums can vary based on a few things, and unless the survivor can identify it immediately, chances are they will get grabbed coming out of the locker.  Lastly, while perk dependent, Bubba is one of the few killers that can turn the shack into an absolute death trap if he is using Bamboozle properly.

Bubba is an incredibly versatile killer.  He garnered this reputation because of bad apples choosing to face camp.  That doesn't mean every Bubba does it.
I genuinely hope they get that part right. I feel like it should stop the bar filling up if survivors are really close, because where else is the killer supposed to go at that point?
    If survivors are close and in a chase I'd say. That way if a killer gets looped near the hooked survivor the killer won't be punished for just playing the game at that point while, simultaneously, if a survivor is sneaking up on the hook it won't punish the hooked survivor in the off chance that the sneaking survivor gets caught.
        I‚Äôm down with that. If the survivor at any point gets in a chase (or ‚Äúcaught‚Äù) and doesn‚Äôt leave the area, then they stop the bar from filling up, regardless of standing still to stop chase or whatever. Any good SWF already has tactics to get survivors off a hook with a killer nearby. Those are the people that will easily find a way to abuse a system like this. Punish them and the face campers and I‚Äôm very happy, but hopefully don‚Äôt punish the nuanced situations.
            Yup! I love the idea of punishing killers for AFK camping but anyone who has played killer for any period of time have ran into the 'bully squads' who aggressively go after hooks with multiple flashlights, flashbangs, boil overs, flip flops, and more.

If you gave them this then I could 100% see them taking advantage of it which is just entirely not the point. If the killer is making an effort to play the game (i.e. chasing someone) then this system shouldn't be active at that point in time.
        Then survivors would literally just do what they did the last time the devs tried to add something like this and work on gens near the hook and then hide from the killer to stop a chase from occurring. The condition can't, and shouldn't ever be that the bar only stops if the killer is chasing someone near the hook. This is the issue with mechanics like this, they tried them before and they were so abused they didn't even make it out of the PTB. I can't say I would be surprised if that's exactly what happens with this mechanic.
            I hope this idea gets nuked. Bully squads are already a pain to deal with...
    Trying to answer your question in good faith: commit to the survivor(s) swarming, right? In theory that's what should be encouraged. (I'm in favor of the bar slowing/stopping if survivors try to swarm the hook)
        Yeah, I‚Äôm mostly referring to the SWF swarm tactics, where you‚Äôve just hooked a player and see two other people lingering around. You should not be punished for pressuring them to make a move when 3/4 of the team are right there. I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre 12 yards away. They‚Äôve shown what their plan is. If you go chase one then the other immediately gets the unhook, when if you stay there (Which you weren‚Äôt planning on doing,) you now justifiably have pressure while they‚Äôre going to do they‚Äôre best to take that pressure away.
            This is my only issue with the change, with how it's currently described

It's a good foundation, I'm just hoping they can work out the kinks.
            Ok, got it, I'm on board.
        The problem is if more than 1 person comes and you‚Äôre in a good zone for them chasing will destroy you in some circumstances
            Right; now, *not* chasing will destroy you even more, because you'll lose your hook pressure. So, you'll want to take the lesser evil: Chasing.

I'm generally okay with proxy camping, but you should be focused on at least *two* things at once, even if that includes the hook. That can even be simple things like kicking pallets to create deadzones. Hovering at one spot and going "Unhook so I can have a free hit. I won't chase you when you're within 100m of a pallet." is still basically just camping.
As a solo queue player or is basically useless if a killer wants to tunnel someone they are hitting that survivor right off the hook 9/10 times, so otr is instantly gone.
    Nah nah, I mean in the specific situations where someone unhooked 20s ago, comes to fuck with your hook and has a minute of Off The Record. It's not super rare for me to be hooking someone and I get into a stalemate where someone with OTR is just standing at the hook, acting as bait because they know they're invincible.
        Then don't take the bait? That's 2 people not doing anything.
            The worse thing they can do is intentionally body blocking so I can't get the other survivor knowing full well I can't outplay it (especially in certain maps). I'm playing Billy so they obviously do it so I can't insta down their teammate. Like at this point what am I supposed to do aside from tunneling the unhooked survivor? The unhooker already got enough distance.
    That is not true lol most killers that tunnel do not hit you off hook unless they know for sure that you have otr.
        I mean making sure dead hard is off the table when a chase starts after someone is unhooked is a huge plus for killers. This mechanic would be a good change if ds was still useful.
    Yeah i don't know why people think off the record is so good everytime i used it and went against an actual tunneling/face camping killer they just hit you right when they unhook you so your endurance is gone the moment you touch the ground.
This is a massive crutch to both sides. Killer should never camp without a reason. (EGC, survivors being close w/o doing gens)
As survivors should never swarm the hook when killer is camping, correct play is to smash gens as much as you can while survivor X is being camped
    only one small objection but I do think they said the whole mechanic would deactivate in endgame collapse.
Basement should be reworked anyway
    How?
        basement only exists because back in the day when a hook was broken it was permanent, so they added the basement so that there was a spot that you could always hook someone. the least they should do is add a second entrance to the basement.

the scummiest of killers can literally just body block the stairs to wait out the bt.
            100% they should double the exits.

maybe one outside and one inside the building it spawns in? 

Or maybe just keep the one stairs but double the size. Make it so there are 2 hooks on each side of the stairs. All hooks would be facing the staircase and then there would be a place to slip under the stairs between the two sides. Worst case you hide in the basement till everyone finishes the gens, then you die because they are still camping the stairs. But at least you wasted more of the killers time. 

I think I will conceptualize that big basement and post it later.
                thats a bit too radical bro
            I don't think it needs (or should have) a second entrance; the *point* of the basement is it is *supposed to be dangerous* because it is a Killer-sided place to be.

I don't think Killers can "actually" body block the basement, but someone will have to take a hit to get past them in some cases.
                the point of the basement is the unsabotagable hooks it has no other purpose and is not an excuse for a killer to be an asshole.
        It‚Äôs just a badly designed area. Basically any killer can get to it from out of terror radius before anyone is far from the basement to a loopable area, it‚Äôs easy to block someone on the stairs to ignore unhook endurance, and is extremely easy to facecamp.

All this, because you went down moderately close to either main building or shack, or the killer ran Agitation, a perk anyone can get because it‚Äôs on Trapper.
            Tbf, the basement is something to be feared. Adding a second entrance would take that away imo
        Honestly it doesn't really need a rework, it should just be gone. What healthy things does it encourage in the game, genuinely? It's a spot that generates boringness, as far as I can tell.
            It adds balance to the main buildings / killer shack, giving more of a risk to what are usually very powerful loops. It also gurantees hooks that are unable to be sabotaged or broken, preventing complete anti-hook builds from making the game unplayable to the killer.
            It generates boredom, easier camping and BMing, more likely to be downed right after being unhooked.

I wouldn't say the basements are terrible, but nothing good comes from having them as part of the game.
                Quit trying to make your loops even more op survivor main
                    The basement has nothing to do with loops
it still encourages the killer to just sit at the top of basement stairs, they might as well be facecamping at that point. so yeah, that playstyle also needs to be addressed as they aren't participating in normal gameplay.
It‚Äôs soooo easy for a killer to get a surv to basement, why should that be lethal? Hook camping ruins the game for everyone whether it‚Äôs in basement or not. Should definitely effect standing at the top on the stairs.
hahaha  no,     everytime some op/toxic    perk/item gets disabled or nerfed into the ground people are bringing them out and abusing them as hard as they can before the change happens.  


So you can except killers actually doing more face camps until the change.
Bruh you just know people who are unapologetic/serial campers are just gonna camp harder now because they know they might no longer have it in the near future lol
Campers certainly have a lot of time to learn how to play
    Let's just hope Bully squads learn that too and stop harassing the killers like here

https://twitter.com/S1niiK/status/1657678689084100610

basically, even if the killer play fair, the survivors won't, from my experience since 2016
it can still be scratched, like many things were
Just like the Mori update and basekit Unbreakable
Right, because players need daddy BHVR to come bail them out whenever they don't like the killer killing them in a way they find distasteful.

I wonder if they'll add in mechanics on the killer side that make survivors run, vault, and repair slower, the longer they loop and slam gens.

I don't particularly care what they're doing except in instances where survivors flood the hook and the final kill of a game. Base kit BT for free practically forces you to secure your kill, and any competent survivor group can juggle hits and body block to make the rescue successful. I also have skepticism of how well the feature is coded and its interaction with multi-floor maps. Good survivors are already smart enough to make strong use of the tools available to them, and killers often have to make decisions to break chase early and quickly because of safety of a particular zone and so on. Imagine what happens when a survivor starts looping above/below a hooked survivor while the remaining players continue slamming gens. The hooked survivor gets to unhook for free, even at a slowed rate, or the chased survivor gets a free pass because he's going to an area that's safe/loopable to the point where the survivor gets the free unhook.

The problem I have with something like this is the control being exerted over players. There are multiple gameplay strategies that people take issue with for one reason or another, but all fall within the rules of the game. Interfering with that based on the incessant whining of a particular side is a really bad idea because everyone will be for it until their side is on the receiving end.
Before you get all excited, they've promised this before in one of their roadmaps. Lots of things end up never seeing the light of day after they announce it, you can go back and always find 2-3 things they say are "coming at the end of the year!" and they never did. 

Cross progression....they actually gave that one a specific date even lol.
There is always a last hurrah, on both sides
then won't that just encourage the devs to push out the basekit unbreakable?
    Not really. Facecamping is unhealthy because the person being facecamped has absolutely no chance of escape given the killer is playing a camping character like Bubba, hence the new system. 

There‚Äôs plenty of systems currently in the game that allow the counter of slugging, and trying to camp a slug is significantly slower than camping a hook.

Aside from that the main killers who can take advantage of slugging are high mobility/action killers like Blight and Nurse, and chances are a killer main who is displaced by the new anti face camp system is not going to be the type of person to play those killers in that way
Idk that really wasn't a good change, with the correct format this could be a really good change. Obvs the face camping cohort will be enraged, the only legitimate issue I can see is endgame hooking. If you're kinda close to an open gate you don't have much of a choice than to proxy camp or its just an escape, I suppose by that point you've lost the game already so idk. Excited for the change could be good.
    Btw they've got egc covered this feature according to them will disable in egc.
        Nice think that's fair to killers, it makes the endgame chases more interesting too add a bit more fear.
            Yup, exactly.
        It should disable when all gens are finished rather than egc.  Survivors can just 99 gates for literally zero penalty.  If the gates are 99, they may as well be open, so facecamping whatever kills you've guaranteed in that situation is still kosher.
    I completely agree. I hope it doesn't flop, if its correctly implemented it could be one of the healthiest changes for the game up there with basekit bt.
Disagree.  UB being base kit has a lot more harm to general gameplay to try and address slugging when face camping is a far more specific issue that has much less of an impact if/when addressed.
    Exactly, I didn't mean to say that they're equal and therefore other would also flop,
my bad.
Bruh you cannot be calling behavior's solution needlessly convoluted and then in the same comment suggest hooks randomly teleport mid hook progress.

Lmao.

        Because giving someone a free unhook has got to be one of the stupidest things you could ever do to ease the whining of players about a gameplay tactic they're discontent with. If you want players to not camp, which is in no way against the rules of the game, then you have to make other options more attractive, not install some moronic punitive measure.
            >If you want players to not camp, which is in no way against the rules of the game,

If the devs are actively trying to punish face camping, I think it's safe to say that it, at the very least, goes against the devs wishes.

Making face camping straight up against the roles is a very tricky thing to do, if they wanted to, because you'd have people potentially getting bans for protecting a swarmed hook.
                > If the devs are actively trying to punish face camping, I think it's safe to say that it, at the very least, goes against the devs wishes.

Or, they're catering, once again, to the survivor player base. It's a numbers game at the end of the day, after all. If it were never intended to be an allowed or legitimized strategy, it would've been programmed that way from the start. Now, there *have* been things that were in need of fixing, Trapper traps directly underneath hooked survivor's feet, for instance, and they've been fixed. Addressing an issue is not the same as addressing an entire gameplay element. 

> Making face camping straight up against the roles is a very tricky thing to do, if they wanted to, because you'd have people potentially getting bans for protecting a swarmed hook.

Correct, which is why you leave players to their own devices and take the coddling countermeasures out of the equation entirely. If a player is to be punished for his actions, let it be in the way his game turns out. I don't think survivors should be so emboldened as to run into the killer's face and provoke him, but they should be allowed to do so. If they manage to capture his attention, but get camped to death for it, then that's what they have to accept. You have to be completely brainless and stupid to think you somehow deserve a "fair shot at escaping" if you pull something like that. Similarly, if you sit on top of someone as Leatherface holding your chainsaw, you should expect every generator on the map to go up as the survivors work with impunity. You'd have to be likewise brainless and stupid to think you somehow deserve a longer game or more time to chase and kill survivors if you pull something like that.

I don't particularly enjoy camping from either side, but I dislike even more the concept that gameplay elements that are deemed via social convention to be dishonorable or inconveniencing have outside power and constraints used on it. That's a really bad precedent to set. If something is not expressly against the rules of the game, then it's considered fair play, regardless of how cutthroat of a tactic it may be. 

You may not enjoy being camped to death, but if I have you on the hook in a position where I have quick access to multiple generators and can simultaneously defend all of them, all you're doing is punishing my smart and advantageous play because of someone's irritation at their own disadvantaged position. Killers already have to put out a disproportionately higher amount of effort as a role, and even more so considering the power of survivors in this game, so when I manage to swing things into my favor, it's bullshit that any outside force would undermine that, particularly when it's gained through forming a daisy chain temper tantrum. Sure, this leads to the door being open to people being face camped at 5 gens 30 seconds into the match if they're unfortunate enough to go down that quickly, but that's the risk you run, and once you start this external control, the line inevitably gets pushed more and more.
            They just *changed* the rules of the game. Because it‚Äôs a game. That can change.

Now, pray they don‚Äôt change them any further.
                No, they didn't. If they were to change the rules, it would be reportable and bannable. Find me something that expressly states "thou shalt not camp". They're enacting punitive gameplay elements for camping through this proposed feature, but that doesn't mean the rules are changing.

By that logic, we might as well assume tunneling is against the rules because of Decisive Strike and Off the Record.
                    You are fixating on the word "rules", while also incorrectly representing it.

"Rules" can refer to general game design terms, like "The rules for Dead Hard allow you to use it only after you've been unhooked". Video games are not like sports where they can sweep in a referee to yell "Camping!" Mechanics, often also known as rules, are their way of enforcing general behaviors that make the game more fun.

You're like the guy insisting they bring back TDM in a shooter, because you can't just camp in a corner to get kills in an objective-based game mode. Face it; the rules changed, and you need to change your play style with them.
                        > You are fixating on the word "rules", while also incorrectly representing it.

No, I'm using the word as it is. *You* are incorrectly representing it with the following:

> "Rules" can refer to general game design terms, like "The rules for Dead Hard allow you to use it only after you've been unhooked".

Rules for activation of a perk and rules that govern gameplay are in no way mutually exclusive. What activates something might be "governed by a set of parameters", but that's not anywhere close to "you may not use exploits or bugs that break the game's design". I can't believe I'm actually having to explain that.

> Video games are not like sports where they can sweep in a referee to yell "Camping!"

Of course not, but they *can*, however, sweep in a referee to yell "GLITCH EXPLOIT! BUG ABUSE! HACKS OR CHEATS USED!"

> Mechanics, often also known as rules, are their way of enforcing general behaviors that make the game more fun.

Mechanics are not rules. Again, I'm flabbergasted that this has to be explained, and that you're honestly trying to make that stretch. Saying that there's a rule governing how fast movement speed is coded in the game is the same as a rule governing not being able use external programs to augment your speed has got to be one of the most laughable attempts at rationalization I've ever heard. And more fun for whom? Survivors? That sure seems to be the prevailing theme here. I'm sure killers are going to have plenty of fun not being able to play defense under this ridiculous design change while simultaneously being castigated as immoral people. The assumption is all camping is face camping, which is as stupid as this proposal. 

> You're like the guy insisting they bring back TDM in a shooter, because you can't just camp in a corner to get kills in an objective-based game mode.

No, I'm the guy that says "let players play however they see fit". I'm the guy that says lay the rules of the game, and then get out of the way. I'm the guy that says there are multiple ways to play a game, and whether or not you find it pleasing doesn't make a difference. I'm the guy that says "in this objective-based game mode, if I decide to choose to zerg the bomb site or play slowly and methodically, that's my choice. If I want to play patiently and let my opponents overextend and pick them off to reduce their numbers advantage, then that's my prerogative. If I want to run in guns a-blazin' because I'm grossly outnumbered and I don't want to play out 10 minutes of slow pushing and corner clearing, then that's my prerogative, and you complaining about my recklessness has no weight except what *you* choose to give it".

> Face it; the rules changed, and you need to change your play style with them.

There's no real adaptation for me to make, save for no longer being able to defend hooks. I guess if survivors fuck up their gen pathing and end up in a 3 gen, then I'm gonna be forced to either walk far away to hook them, leaving him wide open for easy rescue, hook him in the middle of the 3 gen, but watch helplessly as he escapes for free, or hook him in the 3 gen, and be forced to leave the area while the other survivors leave him sitting on the hook, possibly with Reassurance, while they finish their last gen because I can't be near the hook and they're using the hooked survivor as a shield. I don't indiscriminately face camp hooks because it's not helpful for the overall goal for killer. If I have a defensible position that puts the ball in my court, I do so, but if I don't have anything to defend, then I go hunting for my next chase. 

I suspect the heart of the problem with survivors disliking camping is the timing and method. I haven't heard a great many complaints about hard camping a hook during EGC, but hear plenty of complaints of hard camping at 5 gens. Nobody's saying their frustration isn't warranted, but I'm most definitely saying their frustration at someone playing something poorly doesn't warrant outside intervention or moralizing.
    ‚ÄúGosh, I sure hate having to mind my distance from hooks. It‚Äôs so dumb to have to stay so far out to avoid letting people unhook themse-‚Äú

*Mystical entity sound effect*

‚ÄúFelix got moved over there!? Oh my god! They‚Äôve got two guys over there just about to stick a gen! See!? He‚Äôs already unhooked and safe! They stuck the gen! They double healed him!‚Äù

I think this self-unhook solution is definitely the way to go.
        Plus like it's not even the first time killers have to be mindful of hook distance in relation to other players.  Survivors actively playing to help each other are already more than capable of getting unhooks without trading.

So the killer already has to think against competent teams.
>Camping killers just get to tunnel out someone faster as the survivor attempts to unhook themselves only to realize the killer is still right there and they're not getting away.

The difference though, is that this would have happened anyways but now the other survivors don't have to attempt to trade or potentially end up with 2 people downed. They can just stay on gens now while the killer camps.
    [deleted]
        I mean, anyone decent at the game is going to see they‚Äôre being face camped, watch the meter fill, and wait until they‚Äôre about to hit stage 2 before they rip it. They‚Äôre not going to be there for ‚Äúless‚Äù time.

Then the killer is guaranteed to waste 2 minutes staring at them (not even including the time in the intermediary chases) while 3 people are hard committing generators.
Honestly yeah that's how you punish face camping. One change I would do to your suggestion is make it so the gauge will pause when the killer is in chase
Hook progression stopping is a moronic idea. Did you not see how abused it got when it got added as an activateable perk? I don‚Äôt want to be punished cause some annoying feng decided to chase near hook.
    No, I didn‚Äôt. Can you link me to a video of hook pausing being abused?
This needs more upvotes. Genuinely way better idea and could actually fix how boring it is when you get tunneled out.
Except they specifically state if there's a survivor near then the bar slows down.

Chasing someone near a hooked player 100% benefits you more then it benefits them right now, this change is looking to fix that so that a hooked player doesn't get screwed because a killer doesn't want to leave the hook, that's all. If you're not hook camping then this shouldn't effect you.
    It shouldn't benefit the hooked player at all. Even if the slows the meter down, it still punishes the killer for doing exactly what this change is wanting which is to not camp the hooked survivor.

Imagine you're a killer who hooked a survivor and then you leave the hook. Mission accomplished but then your next survivor just runs to the hook and starts looping you around the hooked survivor. All this does is fill the 'camp' meter even though the killer isn't camping.

It needs to stop completely when someone is getting chased nearby. Not hiding nearby, but actively in a chase. That way waiting to spring a quick unhook doesn't punish the hooked survivor while chasing someone who jumped the gun won't punish the killer.
        >It shouldn't benefit the hooked player at all

This is literally what we have in the game right now. Someone gets hooked, and weather the killer face camps or the survivors loop near hook, *all of that leads to the hooked player losing a state or dying*. And they have no say or control over it.

All this change is doing is giving the hooked survivor a way to get off hook if they have no other option. 

>It needs to stop completely when someone is getting chased nearby. Not hiding nearby, but actively in a chase.

I disagree. If you're activating chase and you're still close enough to the hook to where this meter would be charging, then it should still be going. The killer is making a choice to be near the hook, which makes it VERY difficult to get unhooks, that's exactly what this meter is for.

And if there's enough survivors near hook to where the killer would want to stay next to it anyways, the the meter does slow down. All this is going to punish is players staying very close to the hook for extended periods of time, nobody else.
            Then all a survivor has to do is run to the hooked survivor during chase to punish the killer. That's not a decision, it's not a strategy for the killer, it's just outright punishment that the killer has zero control over.

That's counterintuitive for the game.

Under what I'm talking about, if the killer decides to run around looking for survivors then that's a choice. If the other survivors decide to engage near hook then that's a choice.

Under what you're proposing there is no choice because the best strategy will almost always be: Take killer to hooked survivor to punish them both in time and getting a survivor off hook.
                And we go back to my first comment:

The meter slows down if there's a survivor near.

How fast exactly do you think this meter is filling up to think that looping the killer near hook is going to be a viable strat? Do you think it's like 10 second meter or something?

And besides, lets make one thing clear: looping the killer near another downed/hooked survivor is literally one of the worst things a survivor can do. if you get a downed player near the hook that's usually just a GG. Having a meter that slowly fills up that lets someone get off hook after an extended period of time won't change that, and looping near hook isn't going to be viable.

Remember, this meter isn't a frontline defense, it's meant as a last resort for if the hooked player is getting relentlessly facecamped. They don't want it to effect people NOT face camping, and I think you're just imagining the worst possible scenario of giving everyone basekit deliverance if a killer stays near hook for 5 seconds.
                    It's posts like this that make me glad that the majority of people here aren't on the design team because you're advocating for the killer to be punished for doing anything but camping. I'm not really sure how this fact eludes you or how unintuitive it is from understanding what is happening in the game state but honestly I'm not really going to exert any more effort here. You've got salty survivor syndrome all over you so Imma head out.

But hey, we'll see how it plays out when it hits the PTB later this year.
                        Homie what are you talking about haha. I'm not salty about anything and I'm not advocating for anything.

I don't want the killer to get punished for playing the game normally, neither does BHVR. All this change does is make it so if the killer stays very close to hook, then the hooked survivor can get a way off hook without having to sit there for 2 minutes and die. Seems like a pretty darn reasonable change to make.

All the killer has to do to prevent this is...not stay right next to the hook for a long time. It's that easy. It just sounds to me like you want to be able to camp hooks, which unfortunately is not what BHVR or the majority of the community wants.
                    Don‚Äôt bother debating him. ‚ÄúLooping near the hook‚Äù is a parrot phrase that hobbyist facecampers use to shut down discussion.

If they ever actually tried to play a pallet or moonwalked to hide their red stain and knew how chases work, they would know it is a hilariously misleading notion.
                >Under what you're proposing there is no choice because the best strategy will almost always be: Take killer to hooked survivor to punish them both in time and getting a survivor off hook.

Do we even know how slow it goes or how long it takes? If having a survivor around makes it significant slower, then this is an awful 'tactic'

So instead of leading the killer away so someone can make a save, you decide to waste time by:

\- Not doing gens

\- Risk getting knocked next to a hooked survivor (better hope there is a good loop nearby or you'll die pretty quick)

\- Not allowing the hooked survivor to be rescued
            > Someone gets hooked, and weather the killer face camps or the survivors loop near hook, all of that leads to the hooked player losing a state or dying. And they have no say or control over it.

Correct, they don't, *nor should they*. If you found yourself hooked, you're now completely powerless over your fate unless you have Deliverance at the ready. Sure, it sucks if you get one hooked because of one reason or another, but that's the risk you take when you load into a game. You're not entitled to any specific amount of time or outcome, and whether or not you find your death circumstances palatable or not is irrelevant.

> All this change is doing is giving the hooked survivor a way to get off hook if they have no other option.

Meaning they're being given a free second or third chance (depending on design and circumstances) that's unearned, and through doing so, placing Marionette strings on the killer. I wonder when the day comes that survivors get a few of these to favor the killer side of things.

> The killer is making a choice to be near the hook, which makes it VERY difficult to get unhooks, that's exactly what this meter is for.

If this isn't the most nonsensical take I've ever heard, I don't know what is. How small-minded does one have to be to *actually* rationalize this particular point in the way you just tried to. I'm not going to insult your intelligence here, but you've reached a pretty low point with this one. Think of the immense power in chases survivors *already* have with the strength of tiles and their prevalence and spawn patterns. Chases, particularly against M1 killers, can last 90 seconds or more with relative ease, granted the survivors aren't braindead trash (in which case, you shouldn't balance anything around them anyway). If the survivor leads the chase near the hook and is skilled enough at looping, then the killer is in a lose-lose situation if he continues to chase. This basically forces the killer to break chase anytime the survivor runs that direction. This harkens back to the era of infinites, and the middle finger survivors would give you as they ran to the Safety Tree/Magic School Bus/etc. Good luck getting killers to play the game in that case.

> And if there's enough survivors near hook to where the killer would want to stay next to it anyways, the the meter does slow down. All this is going to punish is players staying very close to the hook for extended periods of time, nobody else.

That slowdown better be pretty damn significant, or else you'll just end up with survivors dancing on the edge of safety. The amount of power this puts in the hands of survivors could be absolutely unreal, and SWF is already completely stupid in terms of the power imbalance that already exists between survivor and killer. 

> And besides, lets make one thing clear: looping the killer near another downed/hooked survivor is literally one of the worst things a survivor can do.

Except when they have a safe zone and a survivor that can freely unhook themselves because of this stupid "fairness" mechanic.

> I don't want the killer to get punished for playing the game normally, neither does BHVR.

Camping *is* a normal part, as is tunneling, as is gen rushing, as is bully squad strats, and unless you're willing to curtail the power of those things, then your hypocritical diatribe is worthless. *Nothing* in the official rules of the game says "and when you unhook, you *must* leave the area **immediately**".

> All the killer has to do to prevent this is...not stay right next to the hook for a long time. It's that easy.

Sure. So when I get a survivor hooked in an area of multiple generators that I can defend all pretty well simultaneously, I now have to abandon my position and go sit in the corner of the map with my hand down my pants. God forbid I defend my position, try securing a kill, and put any momentum in my side. Heavens no, that might make some childish survivor player cry their eyeballs out.

> It just sounds to me like you want to be able to camp hooks, which unfortunately is not what BHVR or the majority of the community wants.

Oh I *do* love a good character argument. I mean, it's possible that someone could just have a logical or rational viewpoint on a particular thing, but it's best to assume they're just a bad person, just in case. I guess seeing something from a principled perspective and opposing it because of that just isn't feasible. Yes, I'm being sarcastic here, because you have to put on some very serious blinders to not realize that if you invoke power to change or remove gameplay strategies, in any direction, there will likely come a time when that power is used *against* you.

Imagine the outrage if any of the commonly complained about survivor elements were treated this way. Survivor-biased players would lose their hive-minds if SWF was removed, extra generators were added, or any other point complained about whether or not its complaints are warranted.

EDIT: Another user making his emotional appeal and tucking tail and blocking me. Apparently valuing principles of player freedom in choice of how to play is a hot take. Who knew?
                I can *feel* the anger you clearly had while typing this. Really appreciate the insults by the way, very cool of you.

This change is giving people who were going to have their games ruined, another chance. It's encouraging killers to actually engage with the full game instead of just camping. It's a good thing no matter how much you personally feel entitled to camping for kills in this game.

The fact that you said people aren't entitlted to any specific outcome is one of the most unempathetic takes I've read on this sub. You really should try to remember that the people you're playing against *are people,* and your desire to win in a casual game that doesn't record or rank wins, shouldn't supercede someones desire to have a chance at having fun. 

Yes as a matter of fact, people should be entitled to matches where someone doesn't single them out and ruin their match, matches where they can get the chance to have fun, win or lose. Same way killers should be entitled to not getting infinite looped, and dealing with infinite and quick self healing, win or lose. This isn't the wild west where everyone fights for their own experience, it's a *game* and it's up to the devs to make sure everyone can have fun.

You seem to be forgetting that *this is not a competitive game*. There is no ranked mode, there is no ranked ladder, you can't see your MMR, there's no significant reward for winning, the game doesn't even define what a win is. Playing to win at all costs is passable in games that focus heavily on competition with ranked ladders and such (you know, e-sports titles), but dbd is not that. It's a casual game that's supposed to be fun.

As such, getting camped out at 5 gens isn't fun, this change is trying to remedy that. And guess what, if it's problematic it will be tuned until it's fine. That's what tests are for. I think you're *far* too caught up in the competitive aspects of this game and are forgetting that most of us are just here for some good fun.

Don't bother responding, because I'm blocking you. You're clearly not fit to be having a rational discussion about this.
    Slows but doesn't stop completely.  
Also these kind of radius mechanics in the game so far have been either spheres or infinitely tall cylinders so on The Game and Midwhich survivors will abuse free deliverances out of it by trying to get chases to above or below the hook.  
If the hook is on Midwich in an inner courtyard next to the wall - you will count as "close to hook" if you are in the classroom behind, despite the walking distance to the hook being a long path.
        I think you're overblowing how fast this meter is going to be filling up, and how far away it will work lol. You're describing it like it'll fill up in 10 seconds even if the killer is on a different floor or in a different room, which I highly doubt is the intention.

They're not tryna give everyone basekit deliverance, they're trying to stop face camping. If you're not face camping then you have nothing to worry about.
            They literally say it fills up through floors and it can result in unintended punishment for killers. I don't trust BHVR to implement this correctly.
                Yes, I meant that it won't fill up quickly if they're far enough. Yes if you're just one room over it'll probably still be filling up, but it's gonna be very slow.
                    How slow do you think it's gonna be? My guess is it'll probably be the same as wiggle bar so like 16 seconds. It's pretty easy to loop a killer for 16 seconds around a hook.
                        There's no way they're gonna make it 16 seconds even if it's JUST the killer face camping.

And besides, if someone is looping near the hook then the bar fills up much more slowly. Survivors being near slow it down, remember?
The finisher mori had legit huge issues though. 

For once thing, if all 4 survcivors went down really early, everyone just died with no counter to it. Bad. 

Everyone getting a free Unbreakable was bad for killers like oni, myers and twins who realy on slugging. 

&#x200B;

It had a good core, but it had plenty of issues.
    > For once thing, if all 4 survcivors went down really early, everyone just died with no counter to it.

I mean, if that happens currently the game's pretty much over anyways, unless someone brought UB. With the proposed change they could at least get a chance, unless they all went down in >40 seconds.


> Everyone getting a free Unbreakable was bad for killers like oni, myers and twins who realy on slugging.

The recovery time got increased though, it went from 30 seconds to 40/45 (?) seconds... If you needed to slug for more than that I feel like it's OK to get punished for it.

UB (perk) was the main issue, but again, it's something that can get worked around, like making it a one time use still or have it work like Built to Last in which every subsequent recovery is less effective.

Again, the concept needed work, but I feel like the overall idea was fine, targeting the most annoying types of slugging.
        The idea i thought was fine but, but it defently needing more time in the oven is all.
        I've had multiple games where everyone has gone down but because my power struggle builds runs unbreakable I've been able to pick myself back up and we eventually won, I'd be so sad if they ever added that finisher mori the way they were planning it.
I didn‚Äôt think it would have been that hard. Make it so the last survivor mori (the yellow one) is built in the kit.
>anything that targets their unhealthy play-styles is bad.

have you ever thought why they use 'unhealthy' playstyles, or why are these so effective?
If the distance is correct, even "dipping in and out" would just be proximity camping, which is fair strategy (3 gen situation mostly)  and certainly not "face camping" as they go out their way to say this is meant to deter.
    Absolutely! I‚Äôm excited/curious to see how it‚Äôs implemented, whether both killer and survivor can see a visual radius of it, aswell as how large the radius is. Hopefully it‚Äôs done well as to not be completely useless or ridiculously overpowered
That's still bad especially on smaller maps. It could happen incidentally or survivors can use their hooked teammate at as a semi safe zone.

It would punish you for even going to check to see if there's a survivor going for the unhook.
Ooooof course, they just refuse to take away the killer‚Äôs free kill for facecamping in endgame lol
  
I get there‚Äôs nothing else to do but that doesn‚Äôt require giving a consolation prize for just having someone hooked in endgame.
  
Edit:  people seem to be really up in arms about this.  My main issue is not that camping EXISTS in endgame.  I get that it‚Äôs clearly the only thing a killer CAN do right now.  My problem is that it becomes STRONGER in endgame because they purposely disable any protection against it.  In that sense, camping as a strategy is REWARDED in endgame as opposed to any other time.
  
While we‚Äôre on the topic, yes, I hate hatch too.  It incentivizes both sides playing shitty (hiding while your teammate dies, and slugging for a 4k) and would be better off being reworked into a ‚Äúfinal chase‚Äù mechanic heavily favoring the killer‚Äôs side.
    I mean unhooking yourself in endgame is basically guaranteed escape. Good teamwork is too.

If a killer has someone hooked in endgame, they're allowed to have that pressure. I don't see how it's fair that once the gates are open the killer is helpless. I think it's balanced the way it currently is.
        Survs want those free endgame escapes, so they can heal up, then wait to teabag the killer in the gate.
    So sorry that the gates being open doesn't mean you get an auto-win.

The only objective left for the killer at that point IS the hook. If you get caught during EGC then that's on you. The whole point then is if your team will come to get you or not. If you could just deli yourself off then the killer might as well just AFK the moment the gates open.
        That‚Äôs fine and dandy, but please explain why camping needs to become MORE effective in endgame?
            Because, as the devs already said, the killer has no other objective. During the regular game the killer has gens to protect and the survivors has no where to go if they get caught.

But during the EGC the survivors can escape to 100% safety and the killer really only has one objective once someone is hooked: the hooked survivor. If the killer leaves that hook you know, I know, and everyone else knows that the odds of the killer getting anyone else are relatively low.

So punishing the killer for playing to their only objective isn't fair or good for the game. Like sucks that you got caught, it's what happens during that stage.
    So what would we do? Just chase you to gate yet someone freely unhooks?
        Whatever you feel like.  Not that hard of a concept.  Try to catch someone out, force them out of the gate, or stand there and they unhook themselves.
  
Or, y‚Äôknow, don‚Äôt let them reach that phase of the game to begin with if you think you ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù a kill.
            Okay, I‚Äôll just tunnel out harder than. This just gives an incentive to slow down Gens even more which I‚Äôm all for. To not let them get to the end phase.
                As if you wouldn‚Äôt already do that.  At least the perks to prevent that actually work up until endgame.
    Oh it's not free, I've rescued and been rescued from endgame facecamps quite a number of times.
        It‚Äôs very free as long as you run any killer with STBFL or a chase power.
    > I get there‚Äôs nothing else to do but that doesn‚Äôt require giving a consolation prize for just having someone hooked in endgame.

I suppose you feel differently about hatch being a consolation prize as well.
        Nope, hatch has been dumb as shit as long as it‚Äôs existed and, like the disabling of anti tunnel perks in endgame, incentives shitty gameplay like letting your teammate die for hatch or slugging to prevent a hatch escape.  Would be better to do away with it and rethink the system.  
  
Ideally, we‚Äôd just get rid of the whole ‚Äúprotection perks disable in endgame‚Äù and then rework hatch to some sort of ‚Äúfinal chase‚Äù mechanic heavily weighted in the killer‚Äôs favor.
I 100% agree with this. The meta is changed enough where it wouldn‚Äôt be run by *everybody*, but it‚Äôd actually have a purpose unlike its current version.
if DS gets reverted, i want CoB and Pain Res get reverted also
While I agree that would be the strategic take, I would say that the impulsive take is more likely to take over. Why? Because what's more fun? Actually interacting with the map, or hanging doing nothing on the hook? People will opt for the chance to unhook themselves and I think killers will capitalize on that fact. Given, this is just a prediction, it's hard to say without hard data what the tendency will be; what we do know is that under the current meta it's been highly favorable to tunnel somebody out of the match.
    Survivors spend their whole game *buying time* for their teammates to do other things by leading the killer on chases. Some of them even appreciate hook time as a brief "time out" from having to chase. I really think you misunderstand the psychology of playing survivor.
        I don't, I have nearly 6k hours in this game, probably majority as survivor.   
Of course survivors try to waste time, but the moment that it becomes a 3v1, they're severely disadvantaged and that's the main reason why killers play in the way that they do. While say a well-coordinated swf will take the strategic option, most people will opt for the more interactive approach because it's personally more fun than not doing anything. Games do not last long enough for there to be the 'let me take a break incentive'. I think you really misunderstand the psychology of playing survivor.
Why should the bar fill at all? Survivors shouldn't lead a killer to an active hook and should be punished harder for that.
    I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs so that if you‚Äôve been getting hard facecamped and your bar is on like 90% you can still get the effect if one of your teammates is a moron.
    The problem is the one who gets punished is still the one on hook, not the one who lead the killer there
True, but now all other survivors know the person on hook can unhook, themselves, letting them crank gens as fast as possible.  


Meanwhile, the survivor on the hook will unhook themselves last moment before hitting stage two, do a bit of chase with basekit BT and then repeat on the 2nd hookstage.

    No it doesn't, you can easily double hit a unhooked survivor as bubba in a single sweep with addons
    Bubba main. Not really that hard, just need to time it.
    bubba can still catch up to sb
    Not even almost impossible. Bubba picks up a lot of speed when he's using the chainsaw. You'll get downed again quickly as sure as night follows day
>I would wager for the past year, they've been prototyping various anti-camping mechanisms before settling on this one. Highly doubt this is their first attempt at it.

have you played this game long? do you even remember the last patch before the PTB? 

>Then chase them.

What I mean here is the survivor doesn't come close enough to commit, but far enough away to make the chase worthless.

>The fact that it doesn't fix literally every killer imbalance shouldn't be a reason not to do it. Even for leatherface, while it's going to be easier to facecamp than most of the roster, it's still going to be harder than it was before since survivors no longer need to unhook.

but the fact that it won't work on the most widely used face camper has to be an issue.
It's originally from world of warcraft iirc, there's two factions/races that couldn't understand each other so in game some letters got mixed around, lols or something like that was changed into kekw for the other side. This is all just based off of memory though
Its a twitch emote, from a third party app.
    I don't think twitch emotes work on Reddit
It's something cringe zoomers say that's adopted from Twitch chat, which, when input in chat, shows an emoji of man laughing. 

People who use this as a form of expression are typically young, have high anxiety, and boast mediocre social skills. 

They're pretty monkaS.

    \>a man laughing

Dude, it's Juan Joya Borja (rip), this is hardly a zoomer thing, his iconic laughter became popular on the internet almost a decade ago, and the emote just used his face
        I don't know anyone over 30 yrs old that uses this in regular text conversation (outside of twitch chat) to express emotion.

But the 4% is banned because it adds an element of luck. This is a guaranteed chance like deli so I think it would be allowed.
    I think a lot of people in the comp community understand that camping at the root of it is a strategy to employ. BHVR is making this change for the aspect of fun, rather than strategy. Sometimes, facecamping a survivor when gens aren't completed, or proxying a surv in an area with active gens, IS the best option.

This is at least my opinion on the changes. Good change against boring pub killers though lol.
        Eh it's a strategy with counters like......... nothing lol especially if it's billy or something. Kinda boring that sometimes killers only need 6 hooks to win or something and so they just face camp their first down and the match is already over no matter what the survs do. Also ignoring game mechanics because killers would prefer staring at a survivor for 60-120 seconds is kinda stupid, i'm sure killers can get buffed in different ways like perk bans and stuff rather than ignoring the ability to unhook yourself guaranteed.
            matches are often mirrored for both teams so they have the same win conditions. Likewise, if you go down early enough vs a billy you probably should get punished for it. Survs can certainly win but we factor both hook states and gens getting done for point scoring.
Yeah I guess you‚Äôre right
Yeah. Face camping is always favoured towards the killer- ***if survivors go for the save.*** If not? 1 or maybe 2k with an effortless escape for the other survivors that played it properly.

Proxy is all down to skill though and it's a fairly even matchup since now you won't be able to fall back onto face camping if you fuck up. You pretty much have to send multiple survivors without making it obvious that there are multiple coming. I've noticed players don't like adapting new strategies much though so it's likely quite favoured towards killer role still.

***But as we all know as indisputable truth (apparently), you can't expect any coordination from solo survivors so anything that requires teamwork is automatically impossible to counter.***
There's nothing you really *can* do to completely nullify camping. Camping is something that's inherent of the whole design of the game with players becoming stationary objectives.

I'm not saying that this will do nothing. It will stop face camping, the thing that many players complain about and find boring, but at the same time it will train even the most beginner killer players to be more efficient at camping.

"Worse" killers who ***only*** face camp will be erased from the game, essentially. Which is good really. They'll end up becoming even more effective killers though.

Escaping proxy camping is down to skill so it's a bit more balanced than face camping but higher skilled killers will come out on top if they can get a proxy inside of a 3-gen just about every time.
It‚Äôs the same as when they wanted to let survivors get off the ground without perks.
You‚Äôre right. Chasing does, but you ever go against those swfs that basically throw themselves at the hook to unhook their friend? 
Like they‚Äôll smash out 4 gens in the least amount of time possible, but get dumb when you camp their friend.
    No, I don't have intimate knowledge of how dumb people get when I camp their friends. Because I don't camp.

Meanwhile, I've had games as Deathslinger where my first hook was with 1 gen remaining, and I still made a comeback and got a 4k.
        I think when you play enough killer you experience any type of match you can think of. I‚Äôve had plenty of game go just how you explained. 

I know that some people that play killer can use camping as the only play style, but I think of it as a tool in the chest that you can use when needed.
Just go read my replies to the other guy
People have made a great point that because it only slows when other survivors around it encourages people to loop around hooked teammates to fuck the killer.
Still a buff to survivors like basekit bt was.
If it's not there's still even more issues with it, still the end game collapse. And what about all the hook pause perks? Is Kinship just completely pointless now? Like, there's so many issues with adding something like this. Instead it should simply be "Moving to second hook state allows the Survivor to stun the killer for 3 seconds if within 6 meters and escape the hook but be affected by the Broken status effect for 30 seconds"

So basically a different Deliverance where you have to take 2 hook stages to activate.  


The End Game is my main issue. A LOT of games especially on weaker killers, getting a single kill often requires face camping them during that stage. Otherwise you're not getting even 1 kill, and having 3 other people makes saving a possibility, but also a risk. Facecamping before 5 gens are done yeah, something needs to be done about that. But not in the end game.
    So real quick breaking down each point in this post

\- Disabled once the exit gates are powered, killers only objective at that point is the hook which they said it does disable during the endgame and when survivors swarm the hook.

\- They said the bar fills up slowly when the killer is further away so Kinship and Camaraderie will still be good, extending your phase 1 and 2 as to give more time for your unhook bar to go up against say a proxying basement trapper who slightly leaves to get traps etc.

\- You do not need to take 2 hook stages, they said the bar fills up based on killer proximity to hook they didn't mention it taking a full stage which ties back into the Kinship/Camaraderie
        Tiny correction, it gets disabled when the gates are powered, not when opened, meaning survivors can't abuse 99 gates to get free unhooks in the endgame.
        Okay the first two points are good. I am glad to hear that.  


The third point however, was simply my own little idea for an anti-facecamp idea, not actually what they're doing.
            Aa gotcha, thought maybe you knew something i didn't
What about in EGC?
    Doesn‚Äôt work when exit gates are powered
        Cool, cool.
So a Survivor on top of the SH school should get a free escape because I was chasing someone on a lower floor while 2 others pound out gens? Great logic from the Survivor mains as always.
    Who said that?
        The devs, because the range doesn't respect flooring. Probably because they can't code for crap. This is ridiculous, so many hooks are clustered around high traffic zones or near gens, so Killers are now punished when chases lead them near hooks so this idiotic meter builds?
            Before heading deeper down into the salt mine you might wanna wait for the actual mechanic to come ATLEAST to the PTB, youre being very pessimistic on the competence of the devs and the impact of this new mechanic on your game enjoyment
                Because 7 years of incompetent game design and clear favoritism for the Survivor side give all the reason in the world to be quite judgemental of their intent and performance.
Nice straw man. If You can‚Äôt see the abuse this will bring up, you‚Äôre blind. Especially with a swf.  Chase a survivor into the radius and free unhook
    Nope, the timer slows to a crawl if a surv is near, but hey let‚Äôs make shit up right?
        And you don‚Äôt see an issue with that? And I haven‚Äôt listened to the stream. I‚Äôm going off what OP says
            No I don‚Äôt see an issue, why would you want survivors to horde around a hook with no penalty?
                Hold on. I think I‚Äôm misunderstanding you. I understood it as when the survivors are around the hook, the hook timer slows down. Is that not the case?
            "i haven't listened to the stream" then maybe don't share your uninformed opinion on it?
Shouldn't be active once the grns are done. 99ing doors is already super strong as it is.
You‚Äôre not wrong there, but this poses another problem: how many randos do you see using practical judgment when they have a ‚Äúget out of jail free card‚Äù?
Y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt getting it, and it shows.
    Looks like you aren‚Äôt getting it. Even tho I explained it very well üíÄ
Probably not but the design of the game doesn't encourage them to do much else
Honestly this change is just going to make me tunnel people harder and slug.
Thanks couldn‚Äôt watch live stream when it happened.

Survivors win hook stands off now then if it just slows and doesn‚Äôt pause hmmm.
Seriously? Fucking finally
Correct. Insidious camping would still very much be a thing.
Wesker: *Sweats nervously*
    Why?
        40 meter terror radius
            They said the radius of the hook. Not killer. Monstrous shrine works this way too. Punishing individual killers would make no sense.
                I am aware. I was explaining the joke that I thought you might not have gotten, even if the joke is not applicable in this situation because the radius for camping is at 16m.
BT used to only activate if it happened in the TR and stealth killers would use their undetectable to counter just that...  
Not that you didn't necessarily know that already. Just buttressing your statement.
    I did know, but I‚Äôm hoping that they learned something from that! Can‚Äôt see them making that mistake this time, insidious is a well established camping tool already so if they‚Äôve somehow not thought of that I would be surprised.
        Unfortunately committing the same mistake is very BHVR
            Gonna sound crazy here, but I think Behaviour has geniunely gotten *better* as a developer.  I don't see this only being linked to the TR. Basement Bubba is likely one of the major camping tactics they want to counter.
                They've gotten better for sure, but they also make the same boneheaded mistakes over and over sometimes.
                    You could say that there's a Merciless Storm of them.
                        Sadako is my favorite please don't activate my ptsd lol
                They replaced the person in charge of balancing and they seem much more competent? The recent meta shakeup seems quite positive.
                    Positive if you only play Survivor. Whatever idiot is in charge of balancing this mess clearly has one priority, and it's make Killer unplayable while giving Survivors free wins at all costs at this point. Even the so called Survivor 'nerf' recently nerfed Killers harder than anything else in ages, gutting tons of perks and effectively removing them from play entirely, while Survivor healing was barely touched with the lightest of possible wrist slaps, and most of the actual nerfs that were supposed to happen instead were screamed and cried and whined away, showing, ultimately, this game is beyond help. The devs are insanely biased, and when they're not, the larger community can simply throw a fit and get what they want as the devs will bend the knee.

Hit the nail on the head bud. I don't think there's a way to recover from it when the survivor-only players just cry about every little inconvenience and get it fixed since that's a majority of the playerbase. 

The killer-only players do it too, but it's drowned out because it's maybe 20% of the playerbase. Flashlights caused seizures in some killer players because they could be spammed, and the survivor-only players threw a  fit over flashlights being "nerfed." üòë

It was literally hurting players, and I think that's the real reason people used the flashlight spam, to annoy or injure the player, not the killer.
                        I'm having an easy time with perks such as Sloppy Butcher, Nowhere to Hide, Jolt, and Safe the Best for Last. I highly recommend these. Slowdown isn't necessary anymore and it's much better.
Hmmm. I like them doing something about face camping but it feels the guy on the hook could therefore call the position of a stealth killer easily. Guess it'll just depend on the radius size.
There is also hooks next to the stairs if I remember right on some variations of the game.
Definitely.  Surprisingly when i camped there nobody took the plunge that I expected but was convinced would be to obvious.
[deleted]
    With agitation and iron grasp I can get to basement from near half the map on some maps. It's still a massive choke point and this doesn't even solve that because you still have to leave basement and run into the killer losing at least half your borrowed time timer and against trapper doesn't even help then.
    Basement is a very strong hook spot regardless. Many killer powers allow you to abuse how predictable it is, and it‚Äôs very easy to defend even without actually facecamping by just patrolling relatively near it. 

Survivors may make a mistake (although let‚Äôs be real it‚Äôs not that difficult to get hooked in the basement) but the Killer simply sitting infront of the hook should *also* be punished for making the mistake of not properly pressuring the team and just trying to cheese out one kill.
    i don't know what gave you the idea that getting hooked in the basement is a Survivor mistake? it's as much of a mistake as going down at all basement is an outdated mecanic only served a purpose when hooks used to be permanently sabotaged it's not an excuse for the killer to be an asshole.
It already is. They‚Äôve nerfed perks (ex: awakened awareness) because nurse players would exploit them with their power. BHVR refuses to rework nurse and instead prefer to balance the game around her. Take your head out of the sand and see the planned platitudes for what they are.
    Starstruck was never nerfed cause of Nurse, you're thinking of Awakened Awareness. Which they could honestly revert the change since Nurse can no longer use Starstruck.
    Without a complete Nurse Rework, the best solution for BHVR IS to balance the game over balancing Nurse herself.
No matter what balancing changes you do the nurse, she will still be able to counter basically the whole looping aspect of the game by going through walls

It does suck that perks need to be nerfed from what they could be if she wasn't in the game though...
ü§Ø
Hopefully this stops teammates from lingering around the hook and actually motivates them to do gens
    Yeah, I personally think that's the issue. I'd rather have a constant killer aura reveal on hook without perks
Plus now the person getting face camped can actually reset and try chase again if they have DS/BT/Secondwind, burning even more of the killer‚Äôs time.
    I mean against most killers it's going to be ok.  Against a bubba though it is super easy to burn through borrowed time or off the record.  I imagine that it will make the person die faster than if they just sat on the hook against bubba
Right, you wouldn‚Äôt even need to reassure them until stage 2 if the killer is camping so that‚Äôs very good gen efficiency
    Get Reassurance for both stages to max out survivor's time efficiency.

Second Wind, Lithe, DS, Blood Rush etc 

does it suck to still run a build to avoid camping? Yes... but I can see how some players or SWF could try to have fun with this
        Absolutely
If Killer is face camping for 2 minutes yet have plenty of time to get 2 more kills, those must be absurdly fast chases
    Most face campers get kills by grabbing people trying to get the hook or downing them after
    Depends on when the killer gets the down and if kindred is being used, 2 minutes is 120 seconds.  
If the killer downs the survivor at 5 gens even if the other 3 have their gens at 45 seconds (50%) they still need another 45 seconds to finish them and then at least 90 seconds to finish one of the 2 remaining (one gets worked by 1 person, the other by 2) 90+45 its 135, by that time the killer has 15 seconds to find someone and start a new chase and this is not taking on acount distance traveled to another gen or perks  like Deadlock.  
This assuming kindred is in play and the 3 survivors know the killer is camping, if they dont at least one or two will go check the hook, see the killer camping and then going back, increasing the overall time needed to fix all gens remaining, add NOED into the mix to get a very easy down once the gens are done and you can almost guarantee 2 or 3 kills without putting that much effort except on the first chase.  


Even if you get the down at 4 gens is very easy to get 3 kills if you facecamp using NOED and Deadlock.
Not till they get rid of that BS annoying black bubble
True but imo the problem with camping is the killer doesnt get one kill, they get easily 2/3 or even 4 sometimes.  


I dont have that much of a problem with the killer getting one kill if they decide to camp, it sucks but honestly it would be really hard to find a method where that doesnt happen and cant be abused without overhauling the entire hook system, I think having the killer getting a pity kill its the lesser evil in this instance.  


I do have a problem with the killer winning the match just because they downed someone at 4/5 gens and decided to stand still for 2 minutes, especially against solos who cant tell eachother whats happening and must go to the hook to learn they have to rush gens.
It will still buy you time to get to a nearby tile or give your team 1 extra minute to finish gens and get out
    3 seconds is enough to get you two feet. Any ranged or speed killer eats that
        3 seconds is still more time for your teammates to knock out gens.  Not including time for killer to pick you up and take you to a hook either. Any time you can buy your team while being facecamped is precious.  With dead hard you can extend those 3 seconds into potentially minutes
            You went from 1 minute to 3 seconds real quick
                And yes, it activates for one minute but as soon as you do a conspicuous action it deactivates
                And yes, it‚Äôs 3 second stun off the shoulder, one of which is spent rolling off the shoulder.
                1 minute is if the killer decides to play around DS, aka, dont pick you up until 1 minute.
            And again, it‚Äôs useless without a companion perk. You can‚Äôt change the argument to ‚Äúwith deadhard‚Äù when deadhard+DS is a new concept to the argument. DS, without any helpers is garbage.
                DS is still a pretty good perk, as in much better than most other perks, it just isn't the god tier perk it used to be, if your team is efficient on gens even the few seconds that it gets you are useful and can change the outcome of a game and it only gets stronger if you pair it with other perks like dead hard or off the record
                    That‚Äôs the thing it can‚Äôt stand alone. And if your team isn‚Äôt doing gens in the first place it‚Äôs buying dead time. If you only play in solo queue it‚Äôs kind of a wasted perk slot. I guess I can concede if I had a team it would be different. I‚Äôve come to realize as a survivor the game sucks without friends to enjoy the game with. I mainly play killer
                        It's ok alone and amazing combined so that's what most people do. Solo queue isn't really the issue it's just that the average player is trash at the game, and the game happens to be killer sided if you put average players against average players (as in bad vs bad). At least when playing with friends communication let's you compensate for individual bad decisions and playing a game with friends is always more fun, that's honestly how I think you are supposed to play the game, either as survivor with friends or as killer if you are solo
        Skill issue
            Who said I run DS? Ain‚Äôt nobody
Bubbas saw is a special attack
He can double hit you is what I mean
If he revs his chainsaw immediately behind you, he can hit you twice in the same charge assuming there's no cover nearby
    Not if are sprint bursting.
        This would require you to time your Sprint Burst amazingly well and I'll be real honest: Most Survivors won't be able to do it in the scenario you're proposing. They'd have to WALK up to the hook and have it saved and ready and while a lot of people will walk to hooks to save it, a lot wouldn't.
Really easy insta downs, aoe power, going though pallets really fast.
    It's also a pretty solid chase/loop tool or denier. If someone is trying to hover a pallet they have to choose to drop it early or risk getting hit trying to get the stun. And people really underestimate how far you can go with all three charges, I've caught a lot of people out as they leave a loop expecting me to run out of steam before I catch them.
        Haven't played in awhile didn't he have a add on that gives extra distance on good timing hitting your charges
    As a Bubba main myself, his power is not an easy instadown if you know your window techs. He has legitimately zero map pressure. His strength comes from having a strong chase and the ability to wipe pallets out quickly, but if you have 2 other medium skill teammates and an acorn on your team he will lose all his gens. Its why bad bubbas facecamp: he can't harass more than 1 or 2 survivors consistently.
You know you can chase with him normally and still win games, playing against a bubba who doesn't camp is actually fun.  


But because camping right now is so easy with him everyone is doing that because he is the easiest face camping killer.
Bubba has an incredibly strong chase power:  It gives him a speed boost, allows him to insta-down survivors,  allows for multiple downs in a single usage, it instantly breaks pallets/walls, and if used properly can completely ignore the endurance effect.  Also, attempting to use a locker to avoid Bubba's chainsaw is a huge risk in and of itself.  The timings of his tantrums can vary based on a few things, and unless the survivor can identify it immediately, chances are they will get grabbed coming out of the locker.  Lastly, while perk dependent, Bubba is one of the few killers that can turn the shack into an absolute death trap if he is using Bamboozle properly.

Bubba is an incredibly versatile killer.  He garnered this reputation because of bad apples choosing to face camp.  That doesn't mean every Bubba does it.
If survivors are close and in a chase I'd say. That way if a killer gets looped near the hooked survivor the killer won't be punished for just playing the game at that point while, simultaneously, if a survivor is sneaking up on the hook it won't punish the hooked survivor in the off chance that the sneaking survivor gets caught.
    I‚Äôm down with that. If the survivor at any point gets in a chase (or ‚Äúcaught‚Äù) and doesn‚Äôt leave the area, then they stop the bar from filling up, regardless of standing still to stop chase or whatever. Any good SWF already has tactics to get survivors off a hook with a killer nearby. Those are the people that will easily find a way to abuse a system like this. Punish them and the face campers and I‚Äôm very happy, but hopefully don‚Äôt punish the nuanced situations.
        Yup! I love the idea of punishing killers for AFK camping but anyone who has played killer for any period of time have ran into the 'bully squads' who aggressively go after hooks with multiple flashlights, flashbangs, boil overs, flip flops, and more.

If you gave them this then I could 100% see them taking advantage of it which is just entirely not the point. If the killer is making an effort to play the game (i.e. chasing someone) then this system shouldn't be active at that point in time.
    Then survivors would literally just do what they did the last time the devs tried to add something like this and work on gens near the hook and then hide from the killer to stop a chase from occurring. The condition can't, and shouldn't ever be that the bar only stops if the killer is chasing someone near the hook. This is the issue with mechanics like this, they tried them before and they were so abused they didn't even make it out of the PTB. I can't say I would be surprised if that's exactly what happens with this mechanic.
        I hope this idea gets nuked. Bully squads are already a pain to deal with...
Trying to answer your question in good faith: commit to the survivor(s) swarming, right? In theory that's what should be encouraged. (I'm in favor of the bar slowing/stopping if survivors try to swarm the hook)
    Yeah, I‚Äôm mostly referring to the SWF swarm tactics, where you‚Äôve just hooked a player and see two other people lingering around. You should not be punished for pressuring them to make a move when 3/4 of the team are right there. I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre 12 yards away. They‚Äôve shown what their plan is. If you go chase one then the other immediately gets the unhook, when if you stay there (Which you weren‚Äôt planning on doing,) you now justifiably have pressure while they‚Äôre going to do they‚Äôre best to take that pressure away.
        This is my only issue with the change, with how it's currently described

It's a good foundation, I'm just hoping they can work out the kinks.
        Ok, got it, I'm on board.
    The problem is if more than 1 person comes and you‚Äôre in a good zone for them chasing will destroy you in some circumstances
        Right; now, *not* chasing will destroy you even more, because you'll lose your hook pressure. So, you'll want to take the lesser evil: Chasing.

I'm generally okay with proxy camping, but you should be focused on at least *two* things at once, even if that includes the hook. That can even be simple things like kicking pallets to create deadzones. Hovering at one spot and going "Unhook so I can have a free hit. I won't chase you when you're within 100m of a pallet." is still basically just camping.
Nah nah, I mean in the specific situations where someone unhooked 20s ago, comes to fuck with your hook and has a minute of Off The Record. It's not super rare for me to be hooking someone and I get into a stalemate where someone with OTR is just standing at the hook, acting as bait because they know they're invincible.
    Then don't take the bait? That's 2 people not doing anything.
        The worse thing they can do is intentionally body blocking so I can't get the other survivor knowing full well I can't outplay it (especially in certain maps). I'm playing Billy so they obviously do it so I can't insta down their teammate. Like at this point what am I supposed to do aside from tunneling the unhooked survivor? The unhooker already got enough distance.
That is not true lol most killers that tunnel do not hit you off hook unless they know for sure that you have otr.
    I mean making sure dead hard is off the table when a chase starts after someone is unhooked is a huge plus for killers. This mechanic would be a good change if ds was still useful.
Yeah i don't know why people think off the record is so good everytime i used it and went against an actual tunneling/face camping killer they just hit you right when they unhook you so your endurance is gone the moment you touch the ground.
only one small objection but I do think they said the whole mechanic would deactivate in endgame collapse.
How?
    basement only exists because back in the day when a hook was broken it was permanent, so they added the basement so that there was a spot that you could always hook someone. the least they should do is add a second entrance to the basement.

the scummiest of killers can literally just body block the stairs to wait out the bt.
        100% they should double the exits.

maybe one outside and one inside the building it spawns in? 

Or maybe just keep the one stairs but double the size. Make it so there are 2 hooks on each side of the stairs. All hooks would be facing the staircase and then there would be a place to slip under the stairs between the two sides. Worst case you hide in the basement till everyone finishes the gens, then you die because they are still camping the stairs. But at least you wasted more of the killers time. 

I think I will conceptualize that big basement and post it later.
            thats a bit too radical bro
        I don't think it needs (or should have) a second entrance; the *point* of the basement is it is *supposed to be dangerous* because it is a Killer-sided place to be.

I don't think Killers can "actually" body block the basement, but someone will have to take a hit to get past them in some cases.
            the point of the basement is the unsabotagable hooks it has no other purpose and is not an excuse for a killer to be an asshole.
    It‚Äôs just a badly designed area. Basically any killer can get to it from out of terror radius before anyone is far from the basement to a loopable area, it‚Äôs easy to block someone on the stairs to ignore unhook endurance, and is extremely easy to facecamp.

All this, because you went down moderately close to either main building or shack, or the killer ran Agitation, a perk anyone can get because it‚Äôs on Trapper.
        Tbf, the basement is something to be feared. Adding a second entrance would take that away imo
    Honestly it doesn't really need a rework, it should just be gone. What healthy things does it encourage in the game, genuinely? It's a spot that generates boringness, as far as I can tell.
        It adds balance to the main buildings / killer shack, giving more of a risk to what are usually very powerful loops. It also gurantees hooks that are unable to be sabotaged or broken, preventing complete anti-hook builds from making the game unplayable to the killer.
        It generates boredom, easier camping and BMing, more likely to be downed right after being unhooked.

I wouldn't say the basements are terrible, but nothing good comes from having them as part of the game.
            Quit trying to make your loops even more op survivor main
                The basement has nothing to do with loops
Let's just hope Bully squads learn that too and stop harassing the killers like here

https://twitter.com/S1niiK/status/1657678689084100610

basically, even if the killer play fair, the survivors won't, from my experience since 2016
Not really. Facecamping is unhealthy because the person being facecamped has absolutely no chance of escape given the killer is playing a camping character like Bubba, hence the new system. 

There‚Äôs plenty of systems currently in the game that allow the counter of slugging, and trying to camp a slug is significantly slower than camping a hook.

Aside from that the main killers who can take advantage of slugging are high mobility/action killers like Blight and Nurse, and chances are a killer main who is displaced by the new anti face camp system is not going to be the type of person to play those killers in that way
Btw they've got egc covered this feature according to them will disable in egc.
    Nice think that's fair to killers, it makes the endgame chases more interesting too add a bit more fear.
        Yup, exactly.
    It should disable when all gens are finished rather than egc.  Survivors can just 99 gates for literally zero penalty.  If the gates are 99, they may as well be open, so facecamping whatever kills you've guaranteed in that situation is still kosher.
I completely agree. I hope it doesn't flop, if its correctly implemented it could be one of the healthiest changes for the game up there with basekit bt.
Exactly, I didn't mean to say that they're equal and therefore other would also flop,
my bad.

    Because giving someone a free unhook has got to be one of the stupidest things you could ever do to ease the whining of players about a gameplay tactic they're discontent with. If you want players to not camp, which is in no way against the rules of the game, then you have to make other options more attractive, not install some moronic punitive measure.
        >If you want players to not camp, which is in no way against the rules of the game,

If the devs are actively trying to punish face camping, I think it's safe to say that it, at the very least, goes against the devs wishes.

Making face camping straight up against the roles is a very tricky thing to do, if they wanted to, because you'd have people potentially getting bans for protecting a swarmed hook.
            > If the devs are actively trying to punish face camping, I think it's safe to say that it, at the very least, goes against the devs wishes.

Or, they're catering, once again, to the survivor player base. It's a numbers game at the end of the day, after all. If it were never intended to be an allowed or legitimized strategy, it would've been programmed that way from the start. Now, there *have* been things that were in need of fixing, Trapper traps directly underneath hooked survivor's feet, for instance, and they've been fixed. Addressing an issue is not the same as addressing an entire gameplay element. 

> Making face camping straight up against the roles is a very tricky thing to do, if they wanted to, because you'd have people potentially getting bans for protecting a swarmed hook.

Correct, which is why you leave players to their own devices and take the coddling countermeasures out of the equation entirely. If a player is to be punished for his actions, let it be in the way his game turns out. I don't think survivors should be so emboldened as to run into the killer's face and provoke him, but they should be allowed to do so. If they manage to capture his attention, but get camped to death for it, then that's what they have to accept. You have to be completely brainless and stupid to think you somehow deserve a "fair shot at escaping" if you pull something like that. Similarly, if you sit on top of someone as Leatherface holding your chainsaw, you should expect every generator on the map to go up as the survivors work with impunity. You'd have to be likewise brainless and stupid to think you somehow deserve a longer game or more time to chase and kill survivors if you pull something like that.

I don't particularly enjoy camping from either side, but I dislike even more the concept that gameplay elements that are deemed via social convention to be dishonorable or inconveniencing have outside power and constraints used on it. That's a really bad precedent to set. If something is not expressly against the rules of the game, then it's considered fair play, regardless of how cutthroat of a tactic it may be. 

You may not enjoy being camped to death, but if I have you on the hook in a position where I have quick access to multiple generators and can simultaneously defend all of them, all you're doing is punishing my smart and advantageous play because of someone's irritation at their own disadvantaged position. Killers already have to put out a disproportionately higher amount of effort as a role, and even more so considering the power of survivors in this game, so when I manage to swing things into my favor, it's bullshit that any outside force would undermine that, particularly when it's gained through forming a daisy chain temper tantrum. Sure, this leads to the door being open to people being face camped at 5 gens 30 seconds into the match if they're unfortunate enough to go down that quickly, but that's the risk you run, and once you start this external control, the line inevitably gets pushed more and more.
        They just *changed* the rules of the game. Because it‚Äôs a game. That can change.

Now, pray they don‚Äôt change them any further.
            No, they didn't. If they were to change the rules, it would be reportable and bannable. Find me something that expressly states "thou shalt not camp". They're enacting punitive gameplay elements for camping through this proposed feature, but that doesn't mean the rules are changing.

By that logic, we might as well assume tunneling is against the rules because of Decisive Strike and Off the Record.
                You are fixating on the word "rules", while also incorrectly representing it.

"Rules" can refer to general game design terms, like "The rules for Dead Hard allow you to use it only after you've been unhooked". Video games are not like sports where they can sweep in a referee to yell "Camping!" Mechanics, often also known as rules, are their way of enforcing general behaviors that make the game more fun.

You're like the guy insisting they bring back TDM in a shooter, because you can't just camp in a corner to get kills in an objective-based game mode. Face it; the rules changed, and you need to change your play style with them.
                    > You are fixating on the word "rules", while also incorrectly representing it.

No, I'm using the word as it is. *You* are incorrectly representing it with the following:

> "Rules" can refer to general game design terms, like "The rules for Dead Hard allow you to use it only after you've been unhooked".

Rules for activation of a perk and rules that govern gameplay are in no way mutually exclusive. What activates something might be "governed by a set of parameters", but that's not anywhere close to "you may not use exploits or bugs that break the game's design". I can't believe I'm actually having to explain that.

> Video games are not like sports where they can sweep in a referee to yell "Camping!"

Of course not, but they *can*, however, sweep in a referee to yell "GLITCH EXPLOIT! BUG ABUSE! HACKS OR CHEATS USED!"

> Mechanics, often also known as rules, are their way of enforcing general behaviors that make the game more fun.

Mechanics are not rules. Again, I'm flabbergasted that this has to be explained, and that you're honestly trying to make that stretch. Saying that there's a rule governing how fast movement speed is coded in the game is the same as a rule governing not being able use external programs to augment your speed has got to be one of the most laughable attempts at rationalization I've ever heard. And more fun for whom? Survivors? That sure seems to be the prevailing theme here. I'm sure killers are going to have plenty of fun not being able to play defense under this ridiculous design change while simultaneously being castigated as immoral people. The assumption is all camping is face camping, which is as stupid as this proposal. 

> You're like the guy insisting they bring back TDM in a shooter, because you can't just camp in a corner to get kills in an objective-based game mode.

No, I'm the guy that says "let players play however they see fit". I'm the guy that says lay the rules of the game, and then get out of the way. I'm the guy that says there are multiple ways to play a game, and whether or not you find it pleasing doesn't make a difference. I'm the guy that says "in this objective-based game mode, if I decide to choose to zerg the bomb site or play slowly and methodically, that's my choice. If I want to play patiently and let my opponents overextend and pick them off to reduce their numbers advantage, then that's my prerogative. If I want to run in guns a-blazin' because I'm grossly outnumbered and I don't want to play out 10 minutes of slow pushing and corner clearing, then that's my prerogative, and you complaining about my recklessness has no weight except what *you* choose to give it".

> Face it; the rules changed, and you need to change your play style with them.

There's no real adaptation for me to make, save for no longer being able to defend hooks. I guess if survivors fuck up their gen pathing and end up in a 3 gen, then I'm gonna be forced to either walk far away to hook them, leaving him wide open for easy rescue, hook him in the middle of the 3 gen, but watch helplessly as he escapes for free, or hook him in the 3 gen, and be forced to leave the area while the other survivors leave him sitting on the hook, possibly with Reassurance, while they finish their last gen because I can't be near the hook and they're using the hooked survivor as a shield. I don't indiscriminately face camp hooks because it's not helpful for the overall goal for killer. If I have a defensible position that puts the ball in my court, I do so, but if I don't have anything to defend, then I go hunting for my next chase. 

I suspect the heart of the problem with survivors disliking camping is the timing and method. I haven't heard a great many complaints about hard camping a hook during EGC, but hear plenty of complaints of hard camping at 5 gens. Nobody's saying their frustration isn't warranted, but I'm most definitely saying their frustration at someone playing something poorly doesn't warrant outside intervention or moralizing.
‚ÄúGosh, I sure hate having to mind my distance from hooks. It‚Äôs so dumb to have to stay so far out to avoid letting people unhook themse-‚Äú

*Mystical entity sound effect*

‚ÄúFelix got moved over there!? Oh my god! They‚Äôve got two guys over there just about to stick a gen! See!? He‚Äôs already unhooked and safe! They stuck the gen! They double healed him!‚Äù

I think this self-unhook solution is definitely the way to go.
    Plus like it's not even the first time killers have to be mindful of hook distance in relation to other players.  Survivors actively playing to help each other are already more than capable of getting unhooks without trading.

So the killer already has to think against competent teams.
[deleted]
    I mean, anyone decent at the game is going to see they‚Äôre being face camped, watch the meter fill, and wait until they‚Äôre about to hit stage 2 before they rip it. They‚Äôre not going to be there for ‚Äúless‚Äù time.

Then the killer is guaranteed to waste 2 minutes staring at them (not even including the time in the intermediary chases) while 3 people are hard committing generators.
No, I didn‚Äôt. Can you link me to a video of hook pausing being abused?
It shouldn't benefit the hooked player at all. Even if the slows the meter down, it still punishes the killer for doing exactly what this change is wanting which is to not camp the hooked survivor.

Imagine you're a killer who hooked a survivor and then you leave the hook. Mission accomplished but then your next survivor just runs to the hook and starts looping you around the hooked survivor. All this does is fill the 'camp' meter even though the killer isn't camping.

It needs to stop completely when someone is getting chased nearby. Not hiding nearby, but actively in a chase. That way waiting to spring a quick unhook doesn't punish the hooked survivor while chasing someone who jumped the gun won't punish the killer.
    >It shouldn't benefit the hooked player at all

This is literally what we have in the game right now. Someone gets hooked, and weather the killer face camps or the survivors loop near hook, *all of that leads to the hooked player losing a state or dying*. And they have no say or control over it.

All this change is doing is giving the hooked survivor a way to get off hook if they have no other option. 

>It needs to stop completely when someone is getting chased nearby. Not hiding nearby, but actively in a chase.

I disagree. If you're activating chase and you're still close enough to the hook to where this meter would be charging, then it should still be going. The killer is making a choice to be near the hook, which makes it VERY difficult to get unhooks, that's exactly what this meter is for.

And if there's enough survivors near hook to where the killer would want to stay next to it anyways, the the meter does slow down. All this is going to punish is players staying very close to the hook for extended periods of time, nobody else.
        Then all a survivor has to do is run to the hooked survivor during chase to punish the killer. That's not a decision, it's not a strategy for the killer, it's just outright punishment that the killer has zero control over.

That's counterintuitive for the game.

Under what I'm talking about, if the killer decides to run around looking for survivors then that's a choice. If the other survivors decide to engage near hook then that's a choice.

Under what you're proposing there is no choice because the best strategy will almost always be: Take killer to hooked survivor to punish them both in time and getting a survivor off hook.
            And we go back to my first comment:

The meter slows down if there's a survivor near.

How fast exactly do you think this meter is filling up to think that looping the killer near hook is going to be a viable strat? Do you think it's like 10 second meter or something?

And besides, lets make one thing clear: looping the killer near another downed/hooked survivor is literally one of the worst things a survivor can do. if you get a downed player near the hook that's usually just a GG. Having a meter that slowly fills up that lets someone get off hook after an extended period of time won't change that, and looping near hook isn't going to be viable.

Remember, this meter isn't a frontline defense, it's meant as a last resort for if the hooked player is getting relentlessly facecamped. They don't want it to effect people NOT face camping, and I think you're just imagining the worst possible scenario of giving everyone basekit deliverance if a killer stays near hook for 5 seconds.
                It's posts like this that make me glad that the majority of people here aren't on the design team because you're advocating for the killer to be punished for doing anything but camping. I'm not really sure how this fact eludes you or how unintuitive it is from understanding what is happening in the game state but honestly I'm not really going to exert any more effort here. You've got salty survivor syndrome all over you so Imma head out.

But hey, we'll see how it plays out when it hits the PTB later this year.
                    Homie what are you talking about haha. I'm not salty about anything and I'm not advocating for anything.

I don't want the killer to get punished for playing the game normally, neither does BHVR. All this change does is make it so if the killer stays very close to hook, then the hooked survivor can get a way off hook without having to sit there for 2 minutes and die. Seems like a pretty darn reasonable change to make.

All the killer has to do to prevent this is...not stay right next to the hook for a long time. It's that easy. It just sounds to me like you want to be able to camp hooks, which unfortunately is not what BHVR or the majority of the community wants.
                Don‚Äôt bother debating him. ‚ÄúLooping near the hook‚Äù is a parrot phrase that hobbyist facecampers use to shut down discussion.

If they ever actually tried to play a pallet or moonwalked to hide their red stain and knew how chases work, they would know it is a hilariously misleading notion.
            >Under what you're proposing there is no choice because the best strategy will almost always be: Take killer to hooked survivor to punish them both in time and getting a survivor off hook.

Do we even know how slow it goes or how long it takes? If having a survivor around makes it significant slower, then this is an awful 'tactic'

So instead of leading the killer away so someone can make a save, you decide to waste time by:

\- Not doing gens

\- Risk getting knocked next to a hooked survivor (better hope there is a good loop nearby or you'll die pretty quick)

\- Not allowing the hooked survivor to be rescued
        > Someone gets hooked, and weather the killer face camps or the survivors loop near hook, all of that leads to the hooked player losing a state or dying. And they have no say or control over it.

Correct, they don't, *nor should they*. If you found yourself hooked, you're now completely powerless over your fate unless you have Deliverance at the ready. Sure, it sucks if you get one hooked because of one reason or another, but that's the risk you take when you load into a game. You're not entitled to any specific amount of time or outcome, and whether or not you find your death circumstances palatable or not is irrelevant.

> All this change is doing is giving the hooked survivor a way to get off hook if they have no other option.

Meaning they're being given a free second or third chance (depending on design and circumstances) that's unearned, and through doing so, placing Marionette strings on the killer. I wonder when the day comes that survivors get a few of these to favor the killer side of things.

> The killer is making a choice to be near the hook, which makes it VERY difficult to get unhooks, that's exactly what this meter is for.

If this isn't the most nonsensical take I've ever heard, I don't know what is. How small-minded does one have to be to *actually* rationalize this particular point in the way you just tried to. I'm not going to insult your intelligence here, but you've reached a pretty low point with this one. Think of the immense power in chases survivors *already* have with the strength of tiles and their prevalence and spawn patterns. Chases, particularly against M1 killers, can last 90 seconds or more with relative ease, granted the survivors aren't braindead trash (in which case, you shouldn't balance anything around them anyway). If the survivor leads the chase near the hook and is skilled enough at looping, then the killer is in a lose-lose situation if he continues to chase. This basically forces the killer to break chase anytime the survivor runs that direction. This harkens back to the era of infinites, and the middle finger survivors would give you as they ran to the Safety Tree/Magic School Bus/etc. Good luck getting killers to play the game in that case.

> And if there's enough survivors near hook to where the killer would want to stay next to it anyways, the the meter does slow down. All this is going to punish is players staying very close to the hook for extended periods of time, nobody else.

That slowdown better be pretty damn significant, or else you'll just end up with survivors dancing on the edge of safety. The amount of power this puts in the hands of survivors could be absolutely unreal, and SWF is already completely stupid in terms of the power imbalance that already exists between survivor and killer. 

> And besides, lets make one thing clear: looping the killer near another downed/hooked survivor is literally one of the worst things a survivor can do.

Except when they have a safe zone and a survivor that can freely unhook themselves because of this stupid "fairness" mechanic.

> I don't want the killer to get punished for playing the game normally, neither does BHVR.

Camping *is* a normal part, as is tunneling, as is gen rushing, as is bully squad strats, and unless you're willing to curtail the power of those things, then your hypocritical diatribe is worthless. *Nothing* in the official rules of the game says "and when you unhook, you *must* leave the area **immediately**".

> All the killer has to do to prevent this is...not stay right next to the hook for a long time. It's that easy.

Sure. So when I get a survivor hooked in an area of multiple generators that I can defend all pretty well simultaneously, I now have to abandon my position and go sit in the corner of the map with my hand down my pants. God forbid I defend my position, try securing a kill, and put any momentum in my side. Heavens no, that might make some childish survivor player cry their eyeballs out.

> It just sounds to me like you want to be able to camp hooks, which unfortunately is not what BHVR or the majority of the community wants.

Oh I *do* love a good character argument. I mean, it's possible that someone could just have a logical or rational viewpoint on a particular thing, but it's best to assume they're just a bad person, just in case. I guess seeing something from a principled perspective and opposing it because of that just isn't feasible. Yes, I'm being sarcastic here, because you have to put on some very serious blinders to not realize that if you invoke power to change or remove gameplay strategies, in any direction, there will likely come a time when that power is used *against* you.

Imagine the outrage if any of the commonly complained about survivor elements were treated this way. Survivor-biased players would lose their hive-minds if SWF was removed, extra generators were added, or any other point complained about whether or not its complaints are warranted.

EDIT: Another user making his emotional appeal and tucking tail and blocking me. Apparently valuing principles of player freedom in choice of how to play is a hot take. Who knew?
            I can *feel* the anger you clearly had while typing this. Really appreciate the insults by the way, very cool of you.

This change is giving people who were going to have their games ruined, another chance. It's encouraging killers to actually engage with the full game instead of just camping. It's a good thing no matter how much you personally feel entitled to camping for kills in this game.

The fact that you said people aren't entitlted to any specific outcome is one of the most unempathetic takes I've read on this sub. You really should try to remember that the people you're playing against *are people,* and your desire to win in a casual game that doesn't record or rank wins, shouldn't supercede someones desire to have a chance at having fun. 

Yes as a matter of fact, people should be entitled to matches where someone doesn't single them out and ruin their match, matches where they can get the chance to have fun, win or lose. Same way killers should be entitled to not getting infinite looped, and dealing with infinite and quick self healing, win or lose. This isn't the wild west where everyone fights for their own experience, it's a *game* and it's up to the devs to make sure everyone can have fun.

You seem to be forgetting that *this is not a competitive game*. There is no ranked mode, there is no ranked ladder, you can't see your MMR, there's no significant reward for winning, the game doesn't even define what a win is. Playing to win at all costs is passable in games that focus heavily on competition with ranked ladders and such (you know, e-sports titles), but dbd is not that. It's a casual game that's supposed to be fun.

As such, getting camped out at 5 gens isn't fun, this change is trying to remedy that. And guess what, if it's problematic it will be tuned until it's fine. That's what tests are for. I think you're *far* too caught up in the competitive aspects of this game and are forgetting that most of us are just here for some good fun.

Don't bother responding, because I'm blocking you. You're clearly not fit to be having a rational discussion about this.
Slows but doesn't stop completely.  
Also these kind of radius mechanics in the game so far have been either spheres or infinitely tall cylinders so on The Game and Midwhich survivors will abuse free deliverances out of it by trying to get chases to above or below the hook.  
If the hook is on Midwich in an inner courtyard next to the wall - you will count as "close to hook" if you are in the classroom behind, despite the walking distance to the hook being a long path.
    I think you're overblowing how fast this meter is going to be filling up, and how far away it will work lol. You're describing it like it'll fill up in 10 seconds even if the killer is on a different floor or in a different room, which I highly doubt is the intention.

They're not tryna give everyone basekit deliverance, they're trying to stop face camping. If you're not face camping then you have nothing to worry about.
        They literally say it fills up through floors and it can result in unintended punishment for killers. I don't trust BHVR to implement this correctly.
            Yes, I meant that it won't fill up quickly if they're far enough. Yes if you're just one room over it'll probably still be filling up, but it's gonna be very slow.
                How slow do you think it's gonna be? My guess is it'll probably be the same as wiggle bar so like 16 seconds. It's pretty easy to loop a killer for 16 seconds around a hook.
                    There's no way they're gonna make it 16 seconds even if it's JUST the killer face camping.

And besides, if someone is looping near the hook then the bar fills up much more slowly. Survivors being near slow it down, remember?
> For once thing, if all 4 survcivors went down really early, everyone just died with no counter to it.

I mean, if that happens currently the game's pretty much over anyways, unless someone brought UB. With the proposed change they could at least get a chance, unless they all went down in >40 seconds.


> Everyone getting a free Unbreakable was bad for killers like oni, myers and twins who realy on slugging.

The recovery time got increased though, it went from 30 seconds to 40/45 (?) seconds... If you needed to slug for more than that I feel like it's OK to get punished for it.

UB (perk) was the main issue, but again, it's something that can get worked around, like making it a one time use still or have it work like Built to Last in which every subsequent recovery is less effective.

Again, the concept needed work, but I feel like the overall idea was fine, targeting the most annoying types of slugging.
    The idea i thought was fine but, but it defently needing more time in the oven is all.
    I've had multiple games where everyone has gone down but because my power struggle builds runs unbreakable I've been able to pick myself back up and we eventually won, I'd be so sad if they ever added that finisher mori the way they were planning it.
Absolutely! I‚Äôm excited/curious to see how it‚Äôs implemented, whether both killer and survivor can see a visual radius of it, aswell as how large the radius is. Hopefully it‚Äôs done well as to not be completely useless or ridiculously overpowered
I mean unhooking yourself in endgame is basically guaranteed escape. Good teamwork is too.

If a killer has someone hooked in endgame, they're allowed to have that pressure. I don't see how it's fair that once the gates are open the killer is helpless. I think it's balanced the way it currently is.
    Survs want those free endgame escapes, so they can heal up, then wait to teabag the killer in the gate.
So sorry that the gates being open doesn't mean you get an auto-win.

The only objective left for the killer at that point IS the hook. If you get caught during EGC then that's on you. The whole point then is if your team will come to get you or not. If you could just deli yourself off then the killer might as well just AFK the moment the gates open.
    That‚Äôs fine and dandy, but please explain why camping needs to become MORE effective in endgame?
        Because, as the devs already said, the killer has no other objective. During the regular game the killer has gens to protect and the survivors has no where to go if they get caught.

But during the EGC the survivors can escape to 100% safety and the killer really only has one objective once someone is hooked: the hooked survivor. If the killer leaves that hook you know, I know, and everyone else knows that the odds of the killer getting anyone else are relatively low.

So punishing the killer for playing to their only objective isn't fair or good for the game. Like sucks that you got caught, it's what happens during that stage.
So what would we do? Just chase you to gate yet someone freely unhooks?
    Whatever you feel like.  Not that hard of a concept.  Try to catch someone out, force them out of the gate, or stand there and they unhook themselves.
  
Or, y‚Äôknow, don‚Äôt let them reach that phase of the game to begin with if you think you ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù a kill.
        Okay, I‚Äôll just tunnel out harder than. This just gives an incentive to slow down Gens even more which I‚Äôm all for. To not let them get to the end phase.
            As if you wouldn‚Äôt already do that.  At least the perks to prevent that actually work up until endgame.
Oh it's not free, I've rescued and been rescued from endgame facecamps quite a number of times.
    It‚Äôs very free as long as you run any killer with STBFL or a chase power.
> I get there‚Äôs nothing else to do but that doesn‚Äôt require giving a consolation prize for just having someone hooked in endgame.

I suppose you feel differently about hatch being a consolation prize as well.
    Nope, hatch has been dumb as shit as long as it‚Äôs existed and, like the disabling of anti tunnel perks in endgame, incentives shitty gameplay like letting your teammate die for hatch or slugging to prevent a hatch escape.  Would be better to do away with it and rethink the system.  
  
Ideally, we‚Äôd just get rid of the whole ‚Äúprotection perks disable in endgame‚Äù and then rework hatch to some sort of ‚Äúfinal chase‚Äù mechanic heavily weighted in the killer‚Äôs favor.
Survivors spend their whole game *buying time* for their teammates to do other things by leading the killer on chases. Some of them even appreciate hook time as a brief "time out" from having to chase. I really think you misunderstand the psychology of playing survivor.
    I don't, I have nearly 6k hours in this game, probably majority as survivor.   
Of course survivors try to waste time, but the moment that it becomes a 3v1, they're severely disadvantaged and that's the main reason why killers play in the way that they do. While say a well-coordinated swf will take the strategic option, most people will opt for the more interactive approach because it's personally more fun than not doing anything. Games do not last long enough for there to be the 'let me take a break incentive'. I think you really misunderstand the psychology of playing survivor.
I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs so that if you‚Äôve been getting hard facecamped and your bar is on like 90% you can still get the effect if one of your teammates is a moron.
The problem is the one who gets punished is still the one on hook, not the one who lead the killer there

No it doesn't, you can easily double hit a unhooked survivor as bubba in a single sweep with addons
Bubba main. Not really that hard, just need to time it.
bubba can still catch up to sb
Not even almost impossible. Bubba picks up a lot of speed when he's using the chainsaw. You'll get downed again quickly as sure as night follows day

            LOOK, IM TRYING MY BEST TO FIT IN WITH YOU FELLOW KIDS
My self confidence
    Your ignorance and inabiliy to get a new script...
I think a lot of people in the comp community understand that camping at the root of it is a strategy to employ. BHVR is making this change for the aspect of fun, rather than strategy. Sometimes, facecamping a survivor when gens aren't completed, or proxying a surv in an area with active gens, IS the best option.

This is at least my opinion on the changes. Good change against boring pub killers though lol.
    Eh it's a strategy with counters like......... nothing lol especially if it's billy or something. Kinda boring that sometimes killers only need 6 hooks to win or something and so they just face camp their first down and the match is already over no matter what the survs do. Also ignoring game mechanics because killers would prefer staring at a survivor for 60-120 seconds is kinda stupid, i'm sure killers can get buffed in different ways like perk bans and stuff rather than ignoring the ability to unhook yourself guaranteed.
        matches are often mirrored for both teams so they have the same win conditions. Likewise, if you go down early enough vs a billy you probably should get punished for it. Survs can certainly win but we factor both hook states and gens getting done for point scoring.
No, I don't have intimate knowledge of how dumb people get when I camp their friends. Because I don't camp.

Meanwhile, I've had games as Deathslinger where my first hook was with 1 gen remaining, and I still made a comeback and got a 4k.
    I think when you play enough killer you experience any type of match you can think of. I‚Äôve had plenty of game go just how you explained. 

I know that some people that play killer can use camping as the only play style, but I think of it as a tool in the chest that you can use when needed.
So real quick breaking down each point in this post

\- Disabled once the exit gates are powered, killers only objective at that point is the hook which they said it does disable during the endgame and when survivors swarm the hook.

\- They said the bar fills up slowly when the killer is further away so Kinship and Camaraderie will still be good, extending your phase 1 and 2 as to give more time for your unhook bar to go up against say a proxying basement trapper who slightly leaves to get traps etc.

\- You do not need to take 2 hook stages, they said the bar fills up based on killer proximity to hook they didn't mention it taking a full stage which ties back into the Kinship/Camaraderie
    Tiny correction, it gets disabled when the gates are powered, not when opened, meaning survivors can't abuse 99 gates to get free unhooks in the endgame.
    Okay the first two points are good. I am glad to hear that.  


The third point however, was simply my own little idea for an anti-facecamp idea, not actually what they're doing.
        Aa gotcha, thought maybe you knew something i didn't
Doesn‚Äôt work when exit gates are powered
    Cool, cool.
Who said that?
    The devs, because the range doesn't respect flooring. Probably because they can't code for crap. This is ridiculous, so many hooks are clustered around high traffic zones or near gens, so Killers are now punished when chases lead them near hooks so this idiotic meter builds?
        Before heading deeper down into the salt mine you might wanna wait for the actual mechanic to come ATLEAST to the PTB, youre being very pessimistic on the competence of the devs and the impact of this new mechanic on your game enjoyment
            Because 7 years of incompetent game design and clear favoritism for the Survivor side give all the reason in the world to be quite judgemental of their intent and performance.
Nope, the timer slows to a crawl if a surv is near, but hey let‚Äôs make shit up right?
    And you don‚Äôt see an issue with that? And I haven‚Äôt listened to the stream. I‚Äôm going off what OP says
        No I don‚Äôt see an issue, why would you want survivors to horde around a hook with no penalty?
            Hold on. I think I‚Äôm misunderstanding you. I understood it as when the survivors are around the hook, the hook timer slows down. Is that not the case?
        "i haven't listened to the stream" then maybe don't share your uninformed opinion on it?
Looks like you aren‚Äôt getting it. Even tho I explained it very well üíÄ
Why?
    40 meter terror radius
        They said the radius of the hook. Not killer. Monstrous shrine works this way too. Punishing individual killers would make no sense.
            I am aware. I was explaining the joke that I thought you might not have gotten, even if the joke is not applicable in this situation because the radius for camping is at 16m.
I did know, but I‚Äôm hoping that they learned something from that! Can‚Äôt see them making that mistake this time, insidious is a well established camping tool already so if they‚Äôve somehow not thought of that I would be surprised.
    Unfortunately committing the same mistake is very BHVR
        Gonna sound crazy here, but I think Behaviour has geniunely gotten *better* as a developer.  I don't see this only being linked to the TR. Basement Bubba is likely one of the major camping tactics they want to counter.
            They've gotten better for sure, but they also make the same boneheaded mistakes over and over sometimes.
                You could say that there's a Merciless Storm of them.
                    Sadako is my favorite please don't activate my ptsd lol
            They replaced the person in charge of balancing and they seem much more competent? The recent meta shakeup seems quite positive.
                Positive if you only play Survivor. Whatever idiot is in charge of balancing this mess clearly has one priority, and it's make Killer unplayable while giving Survivors free wins at all costs at this point. Even the so called Survivor 'nerf' recently nerfed Killers harder than anything else in ages, gutting tons of perks and effectively removing them from play entirely, while Survivor healing was barely touched with the lightest of possible wrist slaps, and most of the actual nerfs that were supposed to happen instead were screamed and cried and whined away, showing, ultimately, this game is beyond help. The devs are insanely biased, and when they're not, the larger community can simply throw a fit and get what they want as the devs will bend the knee.

Hit the nail on the head bud. I don't think there's a way to recover from it when the survivor-only players just cry about every little inconvenience and get it fixed since that's a majority of the playerbase. 

The killer-only players do it too, but it's drowned out because it's maybe 20% of the playerbase. Flashlights caused seizures in some killer players because they could be spammed, and the survivor-only players threw a  fit over flashlights being "nerfed." üòë

It was literally hurting players, and I think that's the real reason people used the flashlight spam, to annoy or injure the player, not the killer.
                    I'm having an easy time with perks such as Sloppy Butcher, Nowhere to Hide, Jolt, and Safe the Best for Last. I highly recommend these. Slowdown isn't necessary anymore and it's much better.
With agitation and iron grasp I can get to basement from near half the map on some maps. It's still a massive choke point and this doesn't even solve that because you still have to leave basement and run into the killer losing at least half your borrowed time timer and against trapper doesn't even help then.
Basement is a very strong hook spot regardless. Many killer powers allow you to abuse how predictable it is, and it‚Äôs very easy to defend even without actually facecamping by just patrolling relatively near it. 

Survivors may make a mistake (although let‚Äôs be real it‚Äôs not that difficult to get hooked in the basement) but the Killer simply sitting infront of the hook should *also* be punished for making the mistake of not properly pressuring the team and just trying to cheese out one kill.
i don't know what gave you the idea that getting hooked in the basement is a Survivor mistake? it's as much of a mistake as going down at all basement is an outdated mecanic only served a purpose when hooks used to be permanently sabotaged it's not an excuse for the killer to be an asshole.
Starstruck was never nerfed cause of Nurse, you're thinking of Awakened Awareness. Which they could honestly revert the change since Nurse can no longer use Starstruck.
Without a complete Nurse Rework, the best solution for BHVR IS to balance the game over balancing Nurse herself.
No matter what balancing changes you do the nurse, she will still be able to counter basically the whole looping aspect of the game by going through walls

It does suck that perks need to be nerfed from what they could be if she wasn't in the game though...
Yeah, I personally think that's the issue. I'd rather have a constant killer aura reveal on hook without perks
I mean against most killers it's going to be ok.  Against a bubba though it is super easy to burn through borrowed time or off the record.  I imagine that it will make the person die faster than if they just sat on the hook against bubba
Get Reassurance for both stages to max out survivor's time efficiency.

Second Wind, Lithe, DS, Blood Rush etc 

does it suck to still run a build to avoid camping? Yes... but I can see how some players or SWF could try to have fun with this
    Absolutely
Most face campers get kills by grabbing people trying to get the hook or downing them after
Depends on when the killer gets the down and if kindred is being used, 2 minutes is 120 seconds.  
If the killer downs the survivor at 5 gens even if the other 3 have their gens at 45 seconds (50%) they still need another 45 seconds to finish them and then at least 90 seconds to finish one of the 2 remaining (one gets worked by 1 person, the other by 2) 90+45 its 135, by that time the killer has 15 seconds to find someone and start a new chase and this is not taking on acount distance traveled to another gen or perks  like Deadlock.  
This assuming kindred is in play and the 3 survivors know the killer is camping, if they dont at least one or two will go check the hook, see the killer camping and then going back, increasing the overall time needed to fix all gens remaining, add NOED into the mix to get a very easy down once the gens are done and you can almost guarantee 2 or 3 kills without putting that much effort except on the first chase.  


Even if you get the down at 4 gens is very easy to get 3 kills if you facecamp using NOED and Deadlock.
3 seconds is enough to get you two feet. Any ranged or speed killer eats that
    3 seconds is still more time for your teammates to knock out gens.  Not including time for killer to pick you up and take you to a hook either. Any time you can buy your team while being facecamped is precious.  With dead hard you can extend those 3 seconds into potentially minutes
        You went from 1 minute to 3 seconds real quick
            And yes, it activates for one minute but as soon as you do a conspicuous action it deactivates
            And yes, it‚Äôs 3 second stun off the shoulder, one of which is spent rolling off the shoulder.
            1 minute is if the killer decides to play around DS, aka, dont pick you up until 1 minute.
        And again, it‚Äôs useless without a companion perk. You can‚Äôt change the argument to ‚Äúwith deadhard‚Äù when deadhard+DS is a new concept to the argument. DS, without any helpers is garbage.
            DS is still a pretty good perk, as in much better than most other perks, it just isn't the god tier perk it used to be, if your team is efficient on gens even the few seconds that it gets you are useful and can change the outcome of a game and it only gets stronger if you pair it with other perks like dead hard or off the record
                That‚Äôs the thing it can‚Äôt stand alone. And if your team isn‚Äôt doing gens in the first place it‚Äôs buying dead time. If you only play in solo queue it‚Äôs kind of a wasted perk slot. I guess I can concede if I had a team it would be different. I‚Äôve come to realize as a survivor the game sucks without friends to enjoy the game with. I mainly play killer
                    It's ok alone and amazing combined so that's what most people do. Solo queue isn't really the issue it's just that the average player is trash at the game, and the game happens to be killer sided if you put average players against average players (as in bad vs bad). At least when playing with friends communication let's you compensate for individual bad decisions and playing a game with friends is always more fun, that's honestly how I think you are supposed to play the game, either as survivor with friends or as killer if you are solo
    Skill issue
        Who said I run DS? Ain‚Äôt nobody
Not if are sprint bursting.
    This would require you to time your Sprint Burst amazingly well and I'll be real honest: Most Survivors won't be able to do it in the scenario you're proposing. They'd have to WALK up to the hook and have it saved and ready and while a lot of people will walk to hooks to save it, a lot wouldn't.
It's also a pretty solid chase/loop tool or denier. If someone is trying to hover a pallet they have to choose to drop it early or risk getting hit trying to get the stun. And people really underestimate how far you can go with all three charges, I've caught a lot of people out as they leave a loop expecting me to run out of steam before I catch them.
    Haven't played in awhile didn't he have a add on that gives extra distance on good timing hitting your charges
As a Bubba main myself, his power is not an easy instadown if you know your window techs. He has legitimately zero map pressure. His strength comes from having a strong chase and the ability to wipe pallets out quickly, but if you have 2 other medium skill teammates and an acorn on your team he will lose all his gens. Its why bad bubbas facecamp: he can't harass more than 1 or 2 survivors consistently.
I‚Äôm down with that. If the survivor at any point gets in a chase (or ‚Äúcaught‚Äù) and doesn‚Äôt leave the area, then they stop the bar from filling up, regardless of standing still to stop chase or whatever. Any good SWF already has tactics to get survivors off a hook with a killer nearby. Those are the people that will easily find a way to abuse a system like this. Punish them and the face campers and I‚Äôm very happy, but hopefully don‚Äôt punish the nuanced situations.
    Yup! I love the idea of punishing killers for AFK camping but anyone who has played killer for any period of time have ran into the 'bully squads' who aggressively go after hooks with multiple flashlights, flashbangs, boil overs, flip flops, and more.

If you gave them this then I could 100% see them taking advantage of it which is just entirely not the point. If the killer is making an effort to play the game (i.e. chasing someone) then this system shouldn't be active at that point in time.
Then survivors would literally just do what they did the last time the devs tried to add something like this and work on gens near the hook and then hide from the killer to stop a chase from occurring. The condition can't, and shouldn't ever be that the bar only stops if the killer is chasing someone near the hook. This is the issue with mechanics like this, they tried them before and they were so abused they didn't even make it out of the PTB. I can't say I would be surprised if that's exactly what happens with this mechanic.
    I hope this idea gets nuked. Bully squads are already a pain to deal with...
Yeah, I‚Äôm mostly referring to the SWF swarm tactics, where you‚Äôve just hooked a player and see two other people lingering around. You should not be punished for pressuring them to make a move when 3/4 of the team are right there. I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre 12 yards away. They‚Äôve shown what their plan is. If you go chase one then the other immediately gets the unhook, when if you stay there (Which you weren‚Äôt planning on doing,) you now justifiably have pressure while they‚Äôre going to do they‚Äôre best to take that pressure away.
    This is my only issue with the change, with how it's currently described

It's a good foundation, I'm just hoping they can work out the kinks.
    Ok, got it, I'm on board.
The problem is if more than 1 person comes and you‚Äôre in a good zone for them chasing will destroy you in some circumstances
    Right; now, *not* chasing will destroy you even more, because you'll lose your hook pressure. So, you'll want to take the lesser evil: Chasing.

I'm generally okay with proxy camping, but you should be focused on at least *two* things at once, even if that includes the hook. That can even be simple things like kicking pallets to create deadzones. Hovering at one spot and going "Unhook so I can have a free hit. I won't chase you when you're within 100m of a pallet." is still basically just camping.
Then don't take the bait? That's 2 people not doing anything.
    The worse thing they can do is intentionally body blocking so I can't get the other survivor knowing full well I can't outplay it (especially in certain maps). I'm playing Billy so they obviously do it so I can't insta down their teammate. Like at this point what am I supposed to do aside from tunneling the unhooked survivor? The unhooker already got enough distance.
I mean making sure dead hard is off the table when a chase starts after someone is unhooked is a huge plus for killers. This mechanic would be a good change if ds was still useful.
basement only exists because back in the day when a hook was broken it was permanent, so they added the basement so that there was a spot that you could always hook someone. the least they should do is add a second entrance to the basement.

the scummiest of killers can literally just body block the stairs to wait out the bt.
    100% they should double the exits.

maybe one outside and one inside the building it spawns in? 

Or maybe just keep the one stairs but double the size. Make it so there are 2 hooks on each side of the stairs. All hooks would be facing the staircase and then there would be a place to slip under the stairs between the two sides. Worst case you hide in the basement till everyone finishes the gens, then you die because they are still camping the stairs. But at least you wasted more of the killers time. 

I think I will conceptualize that big basement and post it later.
        thats a bit too radical bro
    I don't think it needs (or should have) a second entrance; the *point* of the basement is it is *supposed to be dangerous* because it is a Killer-sided place to be.

I don't think Killers can "actually" body block the basement, but someone will have to take a hit to get past them in some cases.
        the point of the basement is the unsabotagable hooks it has no other purpose and is not an excuse for a killer to be an asshole.
It‚Äôs just a badly designed area. Basically any killer can get to it from out of terror radius before anyone is far from the basement to a loopable area, it‚Äôs easy to block someone on the stairs to ignore unhook endurance, and is extremely easy to facecamp.

All this, because you went down moderately close to either main building or shack, or the killer ran Agitation, a perk anyone can get because it‚Äôs on Trapper.
    Tbf, the basement is something to be feared. Adding a second entrance would take that away imo
Honestly it doesn't really need a rework, it should just be gone. What healthy things does it encourage in the game, genuinely? It's a spot that generates boringness, as far as I can tell.
    It adds balance to the main buildings / killer shack, giving more of a risk to what are usually very powerful loops. It also gurantees hooks that are unable to be sabotaged or broken, preventing complete anti-hook builds from making the game unplayable to the killer.
    It generates boredom, easier camping and BMing, more likely to be downed right after being unhooked.

I wouldn't say the basements are terrible, but nothing good comes from having them as part of the game.
        Quit trying to make your loops even more op survivor main
            The basement has nothing to do with loops
Nice think that's fair to killers, it makes the endgame chases more interesting too add a bit more fear.
    Yup, exactly.
It should disable when all gens are finished rather than egc.  Survivors can just 99 gates for literally zero penalty.  If the gates are 99, they may as well be open, so facecamping whatever kills you've guaranteed in that situation is still kosher.

Because giving someone a free unhook has got to be one of the stupidest things you could ever do to ease the whining of players about a gameplay tactic they're discontent with. If you want players to not camp, which is in no way against the rules of the game, then you have to make other options more attractive, not install some moronic punitive measure.
    >If you want players to not camp, which is in no way against the rules of the game,

If the devs are actively trying to punish face camping, I think it's safe to say that it, at the very least, goes against the devs wishes.

Making face camping straight up against the roles is a very tricky thing to do, if they wanted to, because you'd have people potentially getting bans for protecting a swarmed hook.
        > If the devs are actively trying to punish face camping, I think it's safe to say that it, at the very least, goes against the devs wishes.

Or, they're catering, once again, to the survivor player base. It's a numbers game at the end of the day, after all. If it were never intended to be an allowed or legitimized strategy, it would've been programmed that way from the start. Now, there *have* been things that were in need of fixing, Trapper traps directly underneath hooked survivor's feet, for instance, and they've been fixed. Addressing an issue is not the same as addressing an entire gameplay element. 

> Making face camping straight up against the roles is a very tricky thing to do, if they wanted to, because you'd have people potentially getting bans for protecting a swarmed hook.

Correct, which is why you leave players to their own devices and take the coddling countermeasures out of the equation entirely. If a player is to be punished for his actions, let it be in the way his game turns out. I don't think survivors should be so emboldened as to run into the killer's face and provoke him, but they should be allowed to do so. If they manage to capture his attention, but get camped to death for it, then that's what they have to accept. You have to be completely brainless and stupid to think you somehow deserve a "fair shot at escaping" if you pull something like that. Similarly, if you sit on top of someone as Leatherface holding your chainsaw, you should expect every generator on the map to go up as the survivors work with impunity. You'd have to be likewise brainless and stupid to think you somehow deserve a longer game or more time to chase and kill survivors if you pull something like that.

I don't particularly enjoy camping from either side, but I dislike even more the concept that gameplay elements that are deemed via social convention to be dishonorable or inconveniencing have outside power and constraints used on it. That's a really bad precedent to set. If something is not expressly against the rules of the game, then it's considered fair play, regardless of how cutthroat of a tactic it may be. 

You may not enjoy being camped to death, but if I have you on the hook in a position where I have quick access to multiple generators and can simultaneously defend all of them, all you're doing is punishing my smart and advantageous play because of someone's irritation at their own disadvantaged position. Killers already have to put out a disproportionately higher amount of effort as a role, and even more so considering the power of survivors in this game, so when I manage to swing things into my favor, it's bullshit that any outside force would undermine that, particularly when it's gained through forming a daisy chain temper tantrum. Sure, this leads to the door being open to people being face camped at 5 gens 30 seconds into the match if they're unfortunate enough to go down that quickly, but that's the risk you run, and once you start this external control, the line inevitably gets pushed more and more.
    They just *changed* the rules of the game. Because it‚Äôs a game. That can change.

Now, pray they don‚Äôt change them any further.
        No, they didn't. If they were to change the rules, it would be reportable and bannable. Find me something that expressly states "thou shalt not camp". They're enacting punitive gameplay elements for camping through this proposed feature, but that doesn't mean the rules are changing.

By that logic, we might as well assume tunneling is against the rules because of Decisive Strike and Off the Record.
            You are fixating on the word "rules", while also incorrectly representing it.

"Rules" can refer to general game design terms, like "The rules for Dead Hard allow you to use it only after you've been unhooked". Video games are not like sports where they can sweep in a referee to yell "Camping!" Mechanics, often also known as rules, are their way of enforcing general behaviors that make the game more fun.

You're like the guy insisting they bring back TDM in a shooter, because you can't just camp in a corner to get kills in an objective-based game mode. Face it; the rules changed, and you need to change your play style with them.
                > You are fixating on the word "rules", while also incorrectly representing it.

No, I'm using the word as it is. *You* are incorrectly representing it with the following:

> "Rules" can refer to general game design terms, like "The rules for Dead Hard allow you to use it only after you've been unhooked".

Rules for activation of a perk and rules that govern gameplay are in no way mutually exclusive. What activates something might be "governed by a set of parameters", but that's not anywhere close to "you may not use exploits or bugs that break the game's design". I can't believe I'm actually having to explain that.

> Video games are not like sports where they can sweep in a referee to yell "Camping!"

Of course not, but they *can*, however, sweep in a referee to yell "GLITCH EXPLOIT! BUG ABUSE! HACKS OR CHEATS USED!"

> Mechanics, often also known as rules, are their way of enforcing general behaviors that make the game more fun.

Mechanics are not rules. Again, I'm flabbergasted that this has to be explained, and that you're honestly trying to make that stretch. Saying that there's a rule governing how fast movement speed is coded in the game is the same as a rule governing not being able use external programs to augment your speed has got to be one of the most laughable attempts at rationalization I've ever heard. And more fun for whom? Survivors? That sure seems to be the prevailing theme here. I'm sure killers are going to have plenty of fun not being able to play defense under this ridiculous design change while simultaneously being castigated as immoral people. The assumption is all camping is face camping, which is as stupid as this proposal. 

> You're like the guy insisting they bring back TDM in a shooter, because you can't just camp in a corner to get kills in an objective-based game mode.

No, I'm the guy that says "let players play however they see fit". I'm the guy that says lay the rules of the game, and then get out of the way. I'm the guy that says there are multiple ways to play a game, and whether or not you find it pleasing doesn't make a difference. I'm the guy that says "in this objective-based game mode, if I decide to choose to zerg the bomb site or play slowly and methodically, that's my choice. If I want to play patiently and let my opponents overextend and pick them off to reduce their numbers advantage, then that's my prerogative. If I want to run in guns a-blazin' because I'm grossly outnumbered and I don't want to play out 10 minutes of slow pushing and corner clearing, then that's my prerogative, and you complaining about my recklessness has no weight except what *you* choose to give it".

> Face it; the rules changed, and you need to change your play style with them.

There's no real adaptation for me to make, save for no longer being able to defend hooks. I guess if survivors fuck up their gen pathing and end up in a 3 gen, then I'm gonna be forced to either walk far away to hook them, leaving him wide open for easy rescue, hook him in the middle of the 3 gen, but watch helplessly as he escapes for free, or hook him in the 3 gen, and be forced to leave the area while the other survivors leave him sitting on the hook, possibly with Reassurance, while they finish their last gen because I can't be near the hook and they're using the hooked survivor as a shield. I don't indiscriminately face camp hooks because it's not helpful for the overall goal for killer. If I have a defensible position that puts the ball in my court, I do so, but if I don't have anything to defend, then I go hunting for my next chase. 

I suspect the heart of the problem with survivors disliking camping is the timing and method. I haven't heard a great many complaints about hard camping a hook during EGC, but hear plenty of complaints of hard camping at 5 gens. Nobody's saying their frustration isn't warranted, but I'm most definitely saying their frustration at someone playing something poorly doesn't warrant outside intervention or moralizing.
Plus like it's not even the first time killers have to be mindful of hook distance in relation to other players.  Survivors actively playing to help each other are already more than capable of getting unhooks without trading.

So the killer already has to think against competent teams.
I mean, anyone decent at the game is going to see they‚Äôre being face camped, watch the meter fill, and wait until they‚Äôre about to hit stage 2 before they rip it. They‚Äôre not going to be there for ‚Äúless‚Äù time.

Then the killer is guaranteed to waste 2 minutes staring at them (not even including the time in the intermediary chases) while 3 people are hard committing generators.
>It shouldn't benefit the hooked player at all

This is literally what we have in the game right now. Someone gets hooked, and weather the killer face camps or the survivors loop near hook, *all of that leads to the hooked player losing a state or dying*. And they have no say or control over it.

All this change is doing is giving the hooked survivor a way to get off hook if they have no other option. 

>It needs to stop completely when someone is getting chased nearby. Not hiding nearby, but actively in a chase.

I disagree. If you're activating chase and you're still close enough to the hook to where this meter would be charging, then it should still be going. The killer is making a choice to be near the hook, which makes it VERY difficult to get unhooks, that's exactly what this meter is for.

And if there's enough survivors near hook to where the killer would want to stay next to it anyways, the the meter does slow down. All this is going to punish is players staying very close to the hook for extended periods of time, nobody else.
    Then all a survivor has to do is run to the hooked survivor during chase to punish the killer. That's not a decision, it's not a strategy for the killer, it's just outright punishment that the killer has zero control over.

That's counterintuitive for the game.

Under what I'm talking about, if the killer decides to run around looking for survivors then that's a choice. If the other survivors decide to engage near hook then that's a choice.

Under what you're proposing there is no choice because the best strategy will almost always be: Take killer to hooked survivor to punish them both in time and getting a survivor off hook.
        And we go back to my first comment:

The meter slows down if there's a survivor near.

How fast exactly do you think this meter is filling up to think that looping the killer near hook is going to be a viable strat? Do you think it's like 10 second meter or something?

And besides, lets make one thing clear: looping the killer near another downed/hooked survivor is literally one of the worst things a survivor can do. if you get a downed player near the hook that's usually just a GG. Having a meter that slowly fills up that lets someone get off hook after an extended period of time won't change that, and looping near hook isn't going to be viable.

Remember, this meter isn't a frontline defense, it's meant as a last resort for if the hooked player is getting relentlessly facecamped. They don't want it to effect people NOT face camping, and I think you're just imagining the worst possible scenario of giving everyone basekit deliverance if a killer stays near hook for 5 seconds.
            It's posts like this that make me glad that the majority of people here aren't on the design team because you're advocating for the killer to be punished for doing anything but camping. I'm not really sure how this fact eludes you or how unintuitive it is from understanding what is happening in the game state but honestly I'm not really going to exert any more effort here. You've got salty survivor syndrome all over you so Imma head out.

But hey, we'll see how it plays out when it hits the PTB later this year.
                Homie what are you talking about haha. I'm not salty about anything and I'm not advocating for anything.

I don't want the killer to get punished for playing the game normally, neither does BHVR. All this change does is make it so if the killer stays very close to hook, then the hooked survivor can get a way off hook without having to sit there for 2 minutes and die. Seems like a pretty darn reasonable change to make.

All the killer has to do to prevent this is...not stay right next to the hook for a long time. It's that easy. It just sounds to me like you want to be able to camp hooks, which unfortunately is not what BHVR or the majority of the community wants.
            Don‚Äôt bother debating him. ‚ÄúLooping near the hook‚Äù is a parrot phrase that hobbyist facecampers use to shut down discussion.

If they ever actually tried to play a pallet or moonwalked to hide their red stain and knew how chases work, they would know it is a hilariously misleading notion.
        >Under what you're proposing there is no choice because the best strategy will almost always be: Take killer to hooked survivor to punish them both in time and getting a survivor off hook.

Do we even know how slow it goes or how long it takes? If having a survivor around makes it significant slower, then this is an awful 'tactic'

So instead of leading the killer away so someone can make a save, you decide to waste time by:

\- Not doing gens

\- Risk getting knocked next to a hooked survivor (better hope there is a good loop nearby or you'll die pretty quick)

\- Not allowing the hooked survivor to be rescued
    > Someone gets hooked, and weather the killer face camps or the survivors loop near hook, all of that leads to the hooked player losing a state or dying. And they have no say or control over it.

Correct, they don't, *nor should they*. If you found yourself hooked, you're now completely powerless over your fate unless you have Deliverance at the ready. Sure, it sucks if you get one hooked because of one reason or another, but that's the risk you take when you load into a game. You're not entitled to any specific amount of time or outcome, and whether or not you find your death circumstances palatable or not is irrelevant.

> All this change is doing is giving the hooked survivor a way to get off hook if they have no other option.

Meaning they're being given a free second or third chance (depending on design and circumstances) that's unearned, and through doing so, placing Marionette strings on the killer. I wonder when the day comes that survivors get a few of these to favor the killer side of things.

> The killer is making a choice to be near the hook, which makes it VERY difficult to get unhooks, that's exactly what this meter is for.

If this isn't the most nonsensical take I've ever heard, I don't know what is. How small-minded does one have to be to *actually* rationalize this particular point in the way you just tried to. I'm not going to insult your intelligence here, but you've reached a pretty low point with this one. Think of the immense power in chases survivors *already* have with the strength of tiles and their prevalence and spawn patterns. Chases, particularly against M1 killers, can last 90 seconds or more with relative ease, granted the survivors aren't braindead trash (in which case, you shouldn't balance anything around them anyway). If the survivor leads the chase near the hook and is skilled enough at looping, then the killer is in a lose-lose situation if he continues to chase. This basically forces the killer to break chase anytime the survivor runs that direction. This harkens back to the era of infinites, and the middle finger survivors would give you as they ran to the Safety Tree/Magic School Bus/etc. Good luck getting killers to play the game in that case.

> And if there's enough survivors near hook to where the killer would want to stay next to it anyways, the the meter does slow down. All this is going to punish is players staying very close to the hook for extended periods of time, nobody else.

That slowdown better be pretty damn significant, or else you'll just end up with survivors dancing on the edge of safety. The amount of power this puts in the hands of survivors could be absolutely unreal, and SWF is already completely stupid in terms of the power imbalance that already exists between survivor and killer. 

> And besides, lets make one thing clear: looping the killer near another downed/hooked survivor is literally one of the worst things a survivor can do.

Except when they have a safe zone and a survivor that can freely unhook themselves because of this stupid "fairness" mechanic.

> I don't want the killer to get punished for playing the game normally, neither does BHVR.

Camping *is* a normal part, as is tunneling, as is gen rushing, as is bully squad strats, and unless you're willing to curtail the power of those things, then your hypocritical diatribe is worthless. *Nothing* in the official rules of the game says "and when you unhook, you *must* leave the area **immediately**".

> All the killer has to do to prevent this is...not stay right next to the hook for a long time. It's that easy.

Sure. So when I get a survivor hooked in an area of multiple generators that I can defend all pretty well simultaneously, I now have to abandon my position and go sit in the corner of the map with my hand down my pants. God forbid I defend my position, try securing a kill, and put any momentum in my side. Heavens no, that might make some childish survivor player cry their eyeballs out.

> It just sounds to me like you want to be able to camp hooks, which unfortunately is not what BHVR or the majority of the community wants.

Oh I *do* love a good character argument. I mean, it's possible that someone could just have a logical or rational viewpoint on a particular thing, but it's best to assume they're just a bad person, just in case. I guess seeing something from a principled perspective and opposing it because of that just isn't feasible. Yes, I'm being sarcastic here, because you have to put on some very serious blinders to not realize that if you invoke power to change or remove gameplay strategies, in any direction, there will likely come a time when that power is used *against* you.

Imagine the outrage if any of the commonly complained about survivor elements were treated this way. Survivor-biased players would lose their hive-minds if SWF was removed, extra generators were added, or any other point complained about whether or not its complaints are warranted.

EDIT: Another user making his emotional appeal and tucking tail and blocking me. Apparently valuing principles of player freedom in choice of how to play is a hot take. Who knew?
        I can *feel* the anger you clearly had while typing this. Really appreciate the insults by the way, very cool of you.

This change is giving people who were going to have their games ruined, another chance. It's encouraging killers to actually engage with the full game instead of just camping. It's a good thing no matter how much you personally feel entitled to camping for kills in this game.

The fact that you said people aren't entitlted to any specific outcome is one of the most unempathetic takes I've read on this sub. You really should try to remember that the people you're playing against *are people,* and your desire to win in a casual game that doesn't record or rank wins, shouldn't supercede someones desire to have a chance at having fun. 

Yes as a matter of fact, people should be entitled to matches where someone doesn't single them out and ruin their match, matches where they can get the chance to have fun, win or lose. Same way killers should be entitled to not getting infinite looped, and dealing with infinite and quick self healing, win or lose. This isn't the wild west where everyone fights for their own experience, it's a *game* and it's up to the devs to make sure everyone can have fun.

You seem to be forgetting that *this is not a competitive game*. There is no ranked mode, there is no ranked ladder, you can't see your MMR, there's no significant reward for winning, the game doesn't even define what a win is. Playing to win at all costs is passable in games that focus heavily on competition with ranked ladders and such (you know, e-sports titles), but dbd is not that. It's a casual game that's supposed to be fun.

As such, getting camped out at 5 gens isn't fun, this change is trying to remedy that. And guess what, if it's problematic it will be tuned until it's fine. That's what tests are for. I think you're *far* too caught up in the competitive aspects of this game and are forgetting that most of us are just here for some good fun.

Don't bother responding, because I'm blocking you. You're clearly not fit to be having a rational discussion about this.
I think you're overblowing how fast this meter is going to be filling up, and how far away it will work lol. You're describing it like it'll fill up in 10 seconds even if the killer is on a different floor or in a different room, which I highly doubt is the intention.

They're not tryna give everyone basekit deliverance, they're trying to stop face camping. If you're not face camping then you have nothing to worry about.
    They literally say it fills up through floors and it can result in unintended punishment for killers. I don't trust BHVR to implement this correctly.
        Yes, I meant that it won't fill up quickly if they're far enough. Yes if you're just one room over it'll probably still be filling up, but it's gonna be very slow.
            How slow do you think it's gonna be? My guess is it'll probably be the same as wiggle bar so like 16 seconds. It's pretty easy to loop a killer for 16 seconds around a hook.
                There's no way they're gonna make it 16 seconds even if it's JUST the killer face camping.

And besides, if someone is looping near the hook then the bar fills up much more slowly. Survivors being near slow it down, remember?
The idea i thought was fine but, but it defently needing more time in the oven is all.
I've had multiple games where everyone has gone down but because my power struggle builds runs unbreakable I've been able to pick myself back up and we eventually won, I'd be so sad if they ever added that finisher mori the way they were planning it.
Survs want those free endgame escapes, so they can heal up, then wait to teabag the killer in the gate.
That‚Äôs fine and dandy, but please explain why camping needs to become MORE effective in endgame?
    Because, as the devs already said, the killer has no other objective. During the regular game the killer has gens to protect and the survivors has no where to go if they get caught.

But during the EGC the survivors can escape to 100% safety and the killer really only has one objective once someone is hooked: the hooked survivor. If the killer leaves that hook you know, I know, and everyone else knows that the odds of the killer getting anyone else are relatively low.

So punishing the killer for playing to their only objective isn't fair or good for the game. Like sucks that you got caught, it's what happens during that stage.
Whatever you feel like.  Not that hard of a concept.  Try to catch someone out, force them out of the gate, or stand there and they unhook themselves.
  
Or, y‚Äôknow, don‚Äôt let them reach that phase of the game to begin with if you think you ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù a kill.
    Okay, I‚Äôll just tunnel out harder than. This just gives an incentive to slow down Gens even more which I‚Äôm all for. To not let them get to the end phase.
        As if you wouldn‚Äôt already do that.  At least the perks to prevent that actually work up until endgame.
It‚Äôs very free as long as you run any killer with STBFL or a chase power.
Nope, hatch has been dumb as shit as long as it‚Äôs existed and, like the disabling of anti tunnel perks in endgame, incentives shitty gameplay like letting your teammate die for hatch or slugging to prevent a hatch escape.  Would be better to do away with it and rethink the system.  
  
Ideally, we‚Äôd just get rid of the whole ‚Äúprotection perks disable in endgame‚Äù and then rework hatch to some sort of ‚Äúfinal chase‚Äù mechanic heavily weighted in the killer‚Äôs favor.
I don't, I have nearly 6k hours in this game, probably majority as survivor.   
Of course survivors try to waste time, but the moment that it becomes a 3v1, they're severely disadvantaged and that's the main reason why killers play in the way that they do. While say a well-coordinated swf will take the strategic option, most people will opt for the more interactive approach because it's personally more fun than not doing anything. Games do not last long enough for there to be the 'let me take a break incentive'. I think you really misunderstand the psychology of playing survivor.
I don't know anyone over 30 yrs old that uses this in regular text conversation (outside of twitch chat) to express emotion.
    [deleted]
        Calm down, dude
I mean, that was the point, omegaLUL
    Not how you write OMEGALUL btw
        LOOK, IM TRYING MY BEST TO FIT IN WITH YOU FELLOW KIDS
Your ignorance and inabiliy to get a new script...
Eh it's a strategy with counters like......... nothing lol especially if it's billy or something. Kinda boring that sometimes killers only need 6 hooks to win or something and so they just face camp their first down and the match is already over no matter what the survs do. Also ignoring game mechanics because killers would prefer staring at a survivor for 60-120 seconds is kinda stupid, i'm sure killers can get buffed in different ways like perk bans and stuff rather than ignoring the ability to unhook yourself guaranteed.
    matches are often mirrored for both teams so they have the same win conditions. Likewise, if you go down early enough vs a billy you probably should get punished for it. Survs can certainly win but we factor both hook states and gens getting done for point scoring.
I think when you play enough killer you experience any type of match you can think of. I‚Äôve had plenty of game go just how you explained. 

I know that some people that play killer can use camping as the only play style, but I think of it as a tool in the chest that you can use when needed.
Tiny correction, it gets disabled when the gates are powered, not when opened, meaning survivors can't abuse 99 gates to get free unhooks in the endgame.
Okay the first two points are good. I am glad to hear that.  


The third point however, was simply my own little idea for an anti-facecamp idea, not actually what they're doing.
    Aa gotcha, thought maybe you knew something i didn't
Cool, cool.
The devs, because the range doesn't respect flooring. Probably because they can't code for crap. This is ridiculous, so many hooks are clustered around high traffic zones or near gens, so Killers are now punished when chases lead them near hooks so this idiotic meter builds?
    Before heading deeper down into the salt mine you might wanna wait for the actual mechanic to come ATLEAST to the PTB, youre being very pessimistic on the competence of the devs and the impact of this new mechanic on your game enjoyment
        Because 7 years of incompetent game design and clear favoritism for the Survivor side give all the reason in the world to be quite judgemental of their intent and performance.
And you don‚Äôt see an issue with that? And I haven‚Äôt listened to the stream. I‚Äôm going off what OP says
    No I don‚Äôt see an issue, why would you want survivors to horde around a hook with no penalty?
        Hold on. I think I‚Äôm misunderstanding you. I understood it as when the survivors are around the hook, the hook timer slows down. Is that not the case?
    "i haven't listened to the stream" then maybe don't share your uninformed opinion on it?
40 meter terror radius
    They said the radius of the hook. Not killer. Monstrous shrine works this way too. Punishing individual killers would make no sense.
        I am aware. I was explaining the joke that I thought you might not have gotten, even if the joke is not applicable in this situation because the radius for camping is at 16m.
Unfortunately committing the same mistake is very BHVR
    Gonna sound crazy here, but I think Behaviour has geniunely gotten *better* as a developer.  I don't see this only being linked to the TR. Basement Bubba is likely one of the major camping tactics they want to counter.
        They've gotten better for sure, but they also make the same boneheaded mistakes over and over sometimes.
            You could say that there's a Merciless Storm of them.
                Sadako is my favorite please don't activate my ptsd lol
        They replaced the person in charge of balancing and they seem much more competent? The recent meta shakeup seems quite positive.
            Positive if you only play Survivor. Whatever idiot is in charge of balancing this mess clearly has one priority, and it's make Killer unplayable while giving Survivors free wins at all costs at this point. Even the so called Survivor 'nerf' recently nerfed Killers harder than anything else in ages, gutting tons of perks and effectively removing them from play entirely, while Survivor healing was barely touched with the lightest of possible wrist slaps, and most of the actual nerfs that were supposed to happen instead were screamed and cried and whined away, showing, ultimately, this game is beyond help. The devs are insanely biased, and when they're not, the larger community can simply throw a fit and get what they want as the devs will bend the knee.

Hit the nail on the head bud. I don't think there's a way to recover from it when the survivor-only players just cry about every little inconvenience and get it fixed since that's a majority of the playerbase. 

The killer-only players do it too, but it's drowned out because it's maybe 20% of the playerbase. Flashlights caused seizures in some killer players because they could be spammed, and the survivor-only players threw a  fit over flashlights being "nerfed." üòë

It was literally hurting players, and I think that's the real reason people used the flashlight spam, to annoy or injure the player, not the killer.
                I'm having an easy time with perks such as Sloppy Butcher, Nowhere to Hide, Jolt, and Safe the Best for Last. I highly recommend these. Slowdown isn't necessary anymore and it's much better.
Absolutely
3 seconds is still more time for your teammates to knock out gens.  Not including time for killer to pick you up and take you to a hook either. Any time you can buy your team while being facecamped is precious.  With dead hard you can extend those 3 seconds into potentially minutes
    You went from 1 minute to 3 seconds real quick
        And yes, it activates for one minute but as soon as you do a conspicuous action it deactivates
        And yes, it‚Äôs 3 second stun off the shoulder, one of which is spent rolling off the shoulder.
        1 minute is if the killer decides to play around DS, aka, dont pick you up until 1 minute.
    And again, it‚Äôs useless without a companion perk. You can‚Äôt change the argument to ‚Äúwith deadhard‚Äù when deadhard+DS is a new concept to the argument. DS, without any helpers is garbage.
        DS is still a pretty good perk, as in much better than most other perks, it just isn't the god tier perk it used to be, if your team is efficient on gens even the few seconds that it gets you are useful and can change the outcome of a game and it only gets stronger if you pair it with other perks like dead hard or off the record
            That‚Äôs the thing it can‚Äôt stand alone. And if your team isn‚Äôt doing gens in the first place it‚Äôs buying dead time. If you only play in solo queue it‚Äôs kind of a wasted perk slot. I guess I can concede if I had a team it would be different. I‚Äôve come to realize as a survivor the game sucks without friends to enjoy the game with. I mainly play killer
                It's ok alone and amazing combined so that's what most people do. Solo queue isn't really the issue it's just that the average player is trash at the game, and the game happens to be killer sided if you put average players against average players (as in bad vs bad). At least when playing with friends communication let's you compensate for individual bad decisions and playing a game with friends is always more fun, that's honestly how I think you are supposed to play the game, either as survivor with friends or as killer if you are solo
Skill issue
    Who said I run DS? Ain‚Äôt nobody
This would require you to time your Sprint Burst amazingly well and I'll be real honest: Most Survivors won't be able to do it in the scenario you're proposing. They'd have to WALK up to the hook and have it saved and ready and while a lot of people will walk to hooks to save it, a lot wouldn't.
Haven't played in awhile didn't he have a add on that gives extra distance on good timing hitting your charges
Yup! I love the idea of punishing killers for AFK camping but anyone who has played killer for any period of time have ran into the 'bully squads' who aggressively go after hooks with multiple flashlights, flashbangs, boil overs, flip flops, and more.

If you gave them this then I could 100% see them taking advantage of it which is just entirely not the point. If the killer is making an effort to play the game (i.e. chasing someone) then this system shouldn't be active at that point in time.
I hope this idea gets nuked. Bully squads are already a pain to deal with...
This is my only issue with the change, with how it's currently described

It's a good foundation, I'm just hoping they can work out the kinks.
Ok, got it, I'm on board.
Right; now, *not* chasing will destroy you even more, because you'll lose your hook pressure. So, you'll want to take the lesser evil: Chasing.

I'm generally okay with proxy camping, but you should be focused on at least *two* things at once, even if that includes the hook. That can even be simple things like kicking pallets to create deadzones. Hovering at one spot and going "Unhook so I can have a free hit. I won't chase you when you're within 100m of a pallet." is still basically just camping.
The worse thing they can do is intentionally body blocking so I can't get the other survivor knowing full well I can't outplay it (especially in certain maps). I'm playing Billy so they obviously do it so I can't insta down their teammate. Like at this point what am I supposed to do aside from tunneling the unhooked survivor? The unhooker already got enough distance.
100% they should double the exits.

maybe one outside and one inside the building it spawns in? 

Or maybe just keep the one stairs but double the size. Make it so there are 2 hooks on each side of the stairs. All hooks would be facing the staircase and then there would be a place to slip under the stairs between the two sides. Worst case you hide in the basement till everyone finishes the gens, then you die because they are still camping the stairs. But at least you wasted more of the killers time. 

I think I will conceptualize that big basement and post it later.
    thats a bit too radical bro
I don't think it needs (or should have) a second entrance; the *point* of the basement is it is *supposed to be dangerous* because it is a Killer-sided place to be.

I don't think Killers can "actually" body block the basement, but someone will have to take a hit to get past them in some cases.
    the point of the basement is the unsabotagable hooks it has no other purpose and is not an excuse for a killer to be an asshole.
Tbf, the basement is something to be feared. Adding a second entrance would take that away imo
It adds balance to the main buildings / killer shack, giving more of a risk to what are usually very powerful loops. It also gurantees hooks that are unable to be sabotaged or broken, preventing complete anti-hook builds from making the game unplayable to the killer.
It generates boredom, easier camping and BMing, more likely to be downed right after being unhooked.

I wouldn't say the basements are terrible, but nothing good comes from having them as part of the game.
    Quit trying to make your loops even more op survivor main
        The basement has nothing to do with loops
Yup, exactly.
>If you want players to not camp, which is in no way against the rules of the game,

If the devs are actively trying to punish face camping, I think it's safe to say that it, at the very least, goes against the devs wishes.

Making face camping straight up against the roles is a very tricky thing to do, if they wanted to, because you'd have people potentially getting bans for protecting a swarmed hook.
    > If the devs are actively trying to punish face camping, I think it's safe to say that it, at the very least, goes against the devs wishes.

Or, they're catering, once again, to the survivor player base. It's a numbers game at the end of the day, after all. If it were never intended to be an allowed or legitimized strategy, it would've been programmed that way from the start. Now, there *have* been things that were in need of fixing, Trapper traps directly underneath hooked survivor's feet, for instance, and they've been fixed. Addressing an issue is not the same as addressing an entire gameplay element. 

> Making face camping straight up against the roles is a very tricky thing to do, if they wanted to, because you'd have people potentially getting bans for protecting a swarmed hook.

Correct, which is why you leave players to their own devices and take the coddling countermeasures out of the equation entirely. If a player is to be punished for his actions, let it be in the way his game turns out. I don't think survivors should be so emboldened as to run into the killer's face and provoke him, but they should be allowed to do so. If they manage to capture his attention, but get camped to death for it, then that's what they have to accept. You have to be completely brainless and stupid to think you somehow deserve a "fair shot at escaping" if you pull something like that. Similarly, if you sit on top of someone as Leatherface holding your chainsaw, you should expect every generator on the map to go up as the survivors work with impunity. You'd have to be likewise brainless and stupid to think you somehow deserve a longer game or more time to chase and kill survivors if you pull something like that.

I don't particularly enjoy camping from either side, but I dislike even more the concept that gameplay elements that are deemed via social convention to be dishonorable or inconveniencing have outside power and constraints used on it. That's a really bad precedent to set. If something is not expressly against the rules of the game, then it's considered fair play, regardless of how cutthroat of a tactic it may be. 

You may not enjoy being camped to death, but if I have you on the hook in a position where I have quick access to multiple generators and can simultaneously defend all of them, all you're doing is punishing my smart and advantageous play because of someone's irritation at their own disadvantaged position. Killers already have to put out a disproportionately higher amount of effort as a role, and even more so considering the power of survivors in this game, so when I manage to swing things into my favor, it's bullshit that any outside force would undermine that, particularly when it's gained through forming a daisy chain temper tantrum. Sure, this leads to the door being open to people being face camped at 5 gens 30 seconds into the match if they're unfortunate enough to go down that quickly, but that's the risk you run, and once you start this external control, the line inevitably gets pushed more and more.
They just *changed* the rules of the game. Because it‚Äôs a game. That can change.

Now, pray they don‚Äôt change them any further.
    No, they didn't. If they were to change the rules, it would be reportable and bannable. Find me something that expressly states "thou shalt not camp". They're enacting punitive gameplay elements for camping through this proposed feature, but that doesn't mean the rules are changing.

By that logic, we might as well assume tunneling is against the rules because of Decisive Strike and Off the Record.
        You are fixating on the word "rules", while also incorrectly representing it.

"Rules" can refer to general game design terms, like "The rules for Dead Hard allow you to use it only after you've been unhooked". Video games are not like sports where they can sweep in a referee to yell "Camping!" Mechanics, often also known as rules, are their way of enforcing general behaviors that make the game more fun.

You're like the guy insisting they bring back TDM in a shooter, because you can't just camp in a corner to get kills in an objective-based game mode. Face it; the rules changed, and you need to change your play style with them.
            > You are fixating on the word "rules", while also incorrectly representing it.

No, I'm using the word as it is. *You* are incorrectly representing it with the following:

> "Rules" can refer to general game design terms, like "The rules for Dead Hard allow you to use it only after you've been unhooked".

Rules for activation of a perk and rules that govern gameplay are in no way mutually exclusive. What activates something might be "governed by a set of parameters", but that's not anywhere close to "you may not use exploits or bugs that break the game's design". I can't believe I'm actually having to explain that.

> Video games are not like sports where they can sweep in a referee to yell "Camping!"

Of course not, but they *can*, however, sweep in a referee to yell "GLITCH EXPLOIT! BUG ABUSE! HACKS OR CHEATS USED!"

> Mechanics, often also known as rules, are their way of enforcing general behaviors that make the game more fun.

Mechanics are not rules. Again, I'm flabbergasted that this has to be explained, and that you're honestly trying to make that stretch. Saying that there's a rule governing how fast movement speed is coded in the game is the same as a rule governing not being able use external programs to augment your speed has got to be one of the most laughable attempts at rationalization I've ever heard. And more fun for whom? Survivors? That sure seems to be the prevailing theme here. I'm sure killers are going to have plenty of fun not being able to play defense under this ridiculous design change while simultaneously being castigated as immoral people. The assumption is all camping is face camping, which is as stupid as this proposal. 

> You're like the guy insisting they bring back TDM in a shooter, because you can't just camp in a corner to get kills in an objective-based game mode.

No, I'm the guy that says "let players play however they see fit". I'm the guy that says lay the rules of the game, and then get out of the way. I'm the guy that says there are multiple ways to play a game, and whether or not you find it pleasing doesn't make a difference. I'm the guy that says "in this objective-based game mode, if I decide to choose to zerg the bomb site or play slowly and methodically, that's my choice. If I want to play patiently and let my opponents overextend and pick them off to reduce their numbers advantage, then that's my prerogative. If I want to run in guns a-blazin' because I'm grossly outnumbered and I don't want to play out 10 minutes of slow pushing and corner clearing, then that's my prerogative, and you complaining about my recklessness has no weight except what *you* choose to give it".

> Face it; the rules changed, and you need to change your play style with them.

There's no real adaptation for me to make, save for no longer being able to defend hooks. I guess if survivors fuck up their gen pathing and end up in a 3 gen, then I'm gonna be forced to either walk far away to hook them, leaving him wide open for easy rescue, hook him in the middle of the 3 gen, but watch helplessly as he escapes for free, or hook him in the 3 gen, and be forced to leave the area while the other survivors leave him sitting on the hook, possibly with Reassurance, while they finish their last gen because I can't be near the hook and they're using the hooked survivor as a shield. I don't indiscriminately face camp hooks because it's not helpful for the overall goal for killer. If I have a defensible position that puts the ball in my court, I do so, but if I don't have anything to defend, then I go hunting for my next chase. 

I suspect the heart of the problem with survivors disliking camping is the timing and method. I haven't heard a great many complaints about hard camping a hook during EGC, but hear plenty of complaints of hard camping at 5 gens. Nobody's saying their frustration isn't warranted, but I'm most definitely saying their frustration at someone playing something poorly doesn't warrant outside intervention or moralizing.
Then all a survivor has to do is run to the hooked survivor during chase to punish the killer. That's not a decision, it's not a strategy for the killer, it's just outright punishment that the killer has zero control over.

That's counterintuitive for the game.

Under what I'm talking about, if the killer decides to run around looking for survivors then that's a choice. If the other survivors decide to engage near hook then that's a choice.

Under what you're proposing there is no choice because the best strategy will almost always be: Take killer to hooked survivor to punish them both in time and getting a survivor off hook.
    And we go back to my first comment:

The meter slows down if there's a survivor near.

How fast exactly do you think this meter is filling up to think that looping the killer near hook is going to be a viable strat? Do you think it's like 10 second meter or something?

And besides, lets make one thing clear: looping the killer near another downed/hooked survivor is literally one of the worst things a survivor can do. if you get a downed player near the hook that's usually just a GG. Having a meter that slowly fills up that lets someone get off hook after an extended period of time won't change that, and looping near hook isn't going to be viable.

Remember, this meter isn't a frontline defense, it's meant as a last resort for if the hooked player is getting relentlessly facecamped. They don't want it to effect people NOT face camping, and I think you're just imagining the worst possible scenario of giving everyone basekit deliverance if a killer stays near hook for 5 seconds.
        It's posts like this that make me glad that the majority of people here aren't on the design team because you're advocating for the killer to be punished for doing anything but camping. I'm not really sure how this fact eludes you or how unintuitive it is from understanding what is happening in the game state but honestly I'm not really going to exert any more effort here. You've got salty survivor syndrome all over you so Imma head out.

But hey, we'll see how it plays out when it hits the PTB later this year.
            Homie what are you talking about haha. I'm not salty about anything and I'm not advocating for anything.

I don't want the killer to get punished for playing the game normally, neither does BHVR. All this change does is make it so if the killer stays very close to hook, then the hooked survivor can get a way off hook without having to sit there for 2 minutes and die. Seems like a pretty darn reasonable change to make.

All the killer has to do to prevent this is...not stay right next to the hook for a long time. It's that easy. It just sounds to me like you want to be able to camp hooks, which unfortunately is not what BHVR or the majority of the community wants.
        Don‚Äôt bother debating him. ‚ÄúLooping near the hook‚Äù is a parrot phrase that hobbyist facecampers use to shut down discussion.

If they ever actually tried to play a pallet or moonwalked to hide their red stain and knew how chases work, they would know it is a hilariously misleading notion.
    >Under what you're proposing there is no choice because the best strategy will almost always be: Take killer to hooked survivor to punish them both in time and getting a survivor off hook.

Do we even know how slow it goes or how long it takes? If having a survivor around makes it significant slower, then this is an awful 'tactic'

So instead of leading the killer away so someone can make a save, you decide to waste time by:

\- Not doing gens

\- Risk getting knocked next to a hooked survivor (better hope there is a good loop nearby or you'll die pretty quick)

\- Not allowing the hooked survivor to be rescued
> Someone gets hooked, and weather the killer face camps or the survivors loop near hook, all of that leads to the hooked player losing a state or dying. And they have no say or control over it.

Correct, they don't, *nor should they*. If you found yourself hooked, you're now completely powerless over your fate unless you have Deliverance at the ready. Sure, it sucks if you get one hooked because of one reason or another, but that's the risk you take when you load into a game. You're not entitled to any specific amount of time or outcome, and whether or not you find your death circumstances palatable or not is irrelevant.

> All this change is doing is giving the hooked survivor a way to get off hook if they have no other option.

Meaning they're being given a free second or third chance (depending on design and circumstances) that's unearned, and through doing so, placing Marionette strings on the killer. I wonder when the day comes that survivors get a few of these to favor the killer side of things.

> The killer is making a choice to be near the hook, which makes it VERY difficult to get unhooks, that's exactly what this meter is for.

If this isn't the most nonsensical take I've ever heard, I don't know what is. How small-minded does one have to be to *actually* rationalize this particular point in the way you just tried to. I'm not going to insult your intelligence here, but you've reached a pretty low point with this one. Think of the immense power in chases survivors *already* have with the strength of tiles and their prevalence and spawn patterns. Chases, particularly against M1 killers, can last 90 seconds or more with relative ease, granted the survivors aren't braindead trash (in which case, you shouldn't balance anything around them anyway). If the survivor leads the chase near the hook and is skilled enough at looping, then the killer is in a lose-lose situation if he continues to chase. This basically forces the killer to break chase anytime the survivor runs that direction. This harkens back to the era of infinites, and the middle finger survivors would give you as they ran to the Safety Tree/Magic School Bus/etc. Good luck getting killers to play the game in that case.

> And if there's enough survivors near hook to where the killer would want to stay next to it anyways, the the meter does slow down. All this is going to punish is players staying very close to the hook for extended periods of time, nobody else.

That slowdown better be pretty damn significant, or else you'll just end up with survivors dancing on the edge of safety. The amount of power this puts in the hands of survivors could be absolutely unreal, and SWF is already completely stupid in terms of the power imbalance that already exists between survivor and killer. 

> And besides, lets make one thing clear: looping the killer near another downed/hooked survivor is literally one of the worst things a survivor can do.

Except when they have a safe zone and a survivor that can freely unhook themselves because of this stupid "fairness" mechanic.

> I don't want the killer to get punished for playing the game normally, neither does BHVR.

Camping *is* a normal part, as is tunneling, as is gen rushing, as is bully squad strats, and unless you're willing to curtail the power of those things, then your hypocritical diatribe is worthless. *Nothing* in the official rules of the game says "and when you unhook, you *must* leave the area **immediately**".

> All the killer has to do to prevent this is...not stay right next to the hook for a long time. It's that easy.

Sure. So when I get a survivor hooked in an area of multiple generators that I can defend all pretty well simultaneously, I now have to abandon my position and go sit in the corner of the map with my hand down my pants. God forbid I defend my position, try securing a kill, and put any momentum in my side. Heavens no, that might make some childish survivor player cry their eyeballs out.

> It just sounds to me like you want to be able to camp hooks, which unfortunately is not what BHVR or the majority of the community wants.

Oh I *do* love a good character argument. I mean, it's possible that someone could just have a logical or rational viewpoint on a particular thing, but it's best to assume they're just a bad person, just in case. I guess seeing something from a principled perspective and opposing it because of that just isn't feasible. Yes, I'm being sarcastic here, because you have to put on some very serious blinders to not realize that if you invoke power to change or remove gameplay strategies, in any direction, there will likely come a time when that power is used *against* you.

Imagine the outrage if any of the commonly complained about survivor elements were treated this way. Survivor-biased players would lose their hive-minds if SWF was removed, extra generators were added, or any other point complained about whether or not its complaints are warranted.

EDIT: Another user making his emotional appeal and tucking tail and blocking me. Apparently valuing principles of player freedom in choice of how to play is a hot take. Who knew?
    I can *feel* the anger you clearly had while typing this. Really appreciate the insults by the way, very cool of you.

This change is giving people who were going to have their games ruined, another chance. It's encouraging killers to actually engage with the full game instead of just camping. It's a good thing no matter how much you personally feel entitled to camping for kills in this game.

The fact that you said people aren't entitlted to any specific outcome is one of the most unempathetic takes I've read on this sub. You really should try to remember that the people you're playing against *are people,* and your desire to win in a casual game that doesn't record or rank wins, shouldn't supercede someones desire to have a chance at having fun. 

Yes as a matter of fact, people should be entitled to matches where someone doesn't single them out and ruin their match, matches where they can get the chance to have fun, win or lose. Same way killers should be entitled to not getting infinite looped, and dealing with infinite and quick self healing, win or lose. This isn't the wild west where everyone fights for their own experience, it's a *game* and it's up to the devs to make sure everyone can have fun.

You seem to be forgetting that *this is not a competitive game*. There is no ranked mode, there is no ranked ladder, you can't see your MMR, there's no significant reward for winning, the game doesn't even define what a win is. Playing to win at all costs is passable in games that focus heavily on competition with ranked ladders and such (you know, e-sports titles), but dbd is not that. It's a casual game that's supposed to be fun.

As such, getting camped out at 5 gens isn't fun, this change is trying to remedy that. And guess what, if it's problematic it will be tuned until it's fine. That's what tests are for. I think you're *far* too caught up in the competitive aspects of this game and are forgetting that most of us are just here for some good fun.

Don't bother responding, because I'm blocking you. You're clearly not fit to be having a rational discussion about this.
They literally say it fills up through floors and it can result in unintended punishment for killers. I don't trust BHVR to implement this correctly.
    Yes, I meant that it won't fill up quickly if they're far enough. Yes if you're just one room over it'll probably still be filling up, but it's gonna be very slow.
        How slow do you think it's gonna be? My guess is it'll probably be the same as wiggle bar so like 16 seconds. It's pretty easy to loop a killer for 16 seconds around a hook.
            There's no way they're gonna make it 16 seconds even if it's JUST the killer face camping.

And besides, if someone is looping near the hook then the bar fills up much more slowly. Survivors being near slow it down, remember?
Because, as the devs already said, the killer has no other objective. During the regular game the killer has gens to protect and the survivors has no where to go if they get caught.

But during the EGC the survivors can escape to 100% safety and the killer really only has one objective once someone is hooked: the hooked survivor. If the killer leaves that hook you know, I know, and everyone else knows that the odds of the killer getting anyone else are relatively low.

So punishing the killer for playing to their only objective isn't fair or good for the game. Like sucks that you got caught, it's what happens during that stage.
Okay, I‚Äôll just tunnel out harder than. This just gives an incentive to slow down Gens even more which I‚Äôm all for. To not let them get to the end phase.
    As if you wouldn‚Äôt already do that.  At least the perks to prevent that actually work up until endgame.
[deleted]
    Calm down, dude
Not how you write OMEGALUL btw
    LOOK, IM TRYING MY BEST TO FIT IN WITH YOU FELLOW KIDS
matches are often mirrored for both teams so they have the same win conditions. Likewise, if you go down early enough vs a billy you probably should get punished for it. Survs can certainly win but we factor both hook states and gens getting done for point scoring.
Aa gotcha, thought maybe you knew something i didn't
Before heading deeper down into the salt mine you might wanna wait for the actual mechanic to come ATLEAST to the PTB, youre being very pessimistic on the competence of the devs and the impact of this new mechanic on your game enjoyment
    Because 7 years of incompetent game design and clear favoritism for the Survivor side give all the reason in the world to be quite judgemental of their intent and performance.
No I don‚Äôt see an issue, why would you want survivors to horde around a hook with no penalty?
    Hold on. I think I‚Äôm misunderstanding you. I understood it as when the survivors are around the hook, the hook timer slows down. Is that not the case?
"i haven't listened to the stream" then maybe don't share your uninformed opinion on it?
They said the radius of the hook. Not killer. Monstrous shrine works this way too. Punishing individual killers would make no sense.
    I am aware. I was explaining the joke that I thought you might not have gotten, even if the joke is not applicable in this situation because the radius for camping is at 16m.
Gonna sound crazy here, but I think Behaviour has geniunely gotten *better* as a developer.  I don't see this only being linked to the TR. Basement Bubba is likely one of the major camping tactics they want to counter.
    They've gotten better for sure, but they also make the same boneheaded mistakes over and over sometimes.
        You could say that there's a Merciless Storm of them.
            Sadako is my favorite please don't activate my ptsd lol
    They replaced the person in charge of balancing and they seem much more competent? The recent meta shakeup seems quite positive.
        Positive if you only play Survivor. Whatever idiot is in charge of balancing this mess clearly has one priority, and it's make Killer unplayable while giving Survivors free wins at all costs at this point. Even the so called Survivor 'nerf' recently nerfed Killers harder than anything else in ages, gutting tons of perks and effectively removing them from play entirely, while Survivor healing was barely touched with the lightest of possible wrist slaps, and most of the actual nerfs that were supposed to happen instead were screamed and cried and whined away, showing, ultimately, this game is beyond help. The devs are insanely biased, and when they're not, the larger community can simply throw a fit and get what they want as the devs will bend the knee.

Hit the nail on the head bud. I don't think there's a way to recover from it when the survivor-only players just cry about every little inconvenience and get it fixed since that's a majority of the playerbase. 

The killer-only players do it too, but it's drowned out because it's maybe 20% of the playerbase. Flashlights caused seizures in some killer players because they could be spammed, and the survivor-only players threw a  fit over flashlights being "nerfed." üòë

It was literally hurting players, and I think that's the real reason people used the flashlight spam, to annoy or injure the player, not the killer.
            I'm having an easy time with perks such as Sloppy Butcher, Nowhere to Hide, Jolt, and Safe the Best for Last. I highly recommend these. Slowdown isn't necessary anymore and it's much better.
You went from 1 minute to 3 seconds real quick
    And yes, it activates for one minute but as soon as you do a conspicuous action it deactivates
    And yes, it‚Äôs 3 second stun off the shoulder, one of which is spent rolling off the shoulder.
    1 minute is if the killer decides to play around DS, aka, dont pick you up until 1 minute.
And again, it‚Äôs useless without a companion perk. You can‚Äôt change the argument to ‚Äúwith deadhard‚Äù when deadhard+DS is a new concept to the argument. DS, without any helpers is garbage.
    DS is still a pretty good perk, as in much better than most other perks, it just isn't the god tier perk it used to be, if your team is efficient on gens even the few seconds that it gets you are useful and can change the outcome of a game and it only gets stronger if you pair it with other perks like dead hard or off the record
        That‚Äôs the thing it can‚Äôt stand alone. And if your team isn‚Äôt doing gens in the first place it‚Äôs buying dead time. If you only play in solo queue it‚Äôs kind of a wasted perk slot. I guess I can concede if I had a team it would be different. I‚Äôve come to realize as a survivor the game sucks without friends to enjoy the game with. I mainly play killer
            It's ok alone and amazing combined so that's what most people do. Solo queue isn't really the issue it's just that the average player is trash at the game, and the game happens to be killer sided if you put average players against average players (as in bad vs bad). At least when playing with friends communication let's you compensate for individual bad decisions and playing a game with friends is always more fun, that's honestly how I think you are supposed to play the game, either as survivor with friends or as killer if you are solo
Who said I run DS? Ain‚Äôt nobody
thats a bit too radical bro
the point of the basement is the unsabotagable hooks it has no other purpose and is not an excuse for a killer to be an asshole.
Quit trying to make your loops even more op survivor main
    The basement has nothing to do with loops
> If the devs are actively trying to punish face camping, I think it's safe to say that it, at the very least, goes against the devs wishes.

Or, they're catering, once again, to the survivor player base. It's a numbers game at the end of the day, after all. If it were never intended to be an allowed or legitimized strategy, it would've been programmed that way from the start. Now, there *have* been things that were in need of fixing, Trapper traps directly underneath hooked survivor's feet, for instance, and they've been fixed. Addressing an issue is not the same as addressing an entire gameplay element. 

> Making face camping straight up against the roles is a very tricky thing to do, if they wanted to, because you'd have people potentially getting bans for protecting a swarmed hook.

Correct, which is why you leave players to their own devices and take the coddling countermeasures out of the equation entirely. If a player is to be punished for his actions, let it be in the way his game turns out. I don't think survivors should be so emboldened as to run into the killer's face and provoke him, but they should be allowed to do so. If they manage to capture his attention, but get camped to death for it, then that's what they have to accept. You have to be completely brainless and stupid to think you somehow deserve a "fair shot at escaping" if you pull something like that. Similarly, if you sit on top of someone as Leatherface holding your chainsaw, you should expect every generator on the map to go up as the survivors work with impunity. You'd have to be likewise brainless and stupid to think you somehow deserve a longer game or more time to chase and kill survivors if you pull something like that.

I don't particularly enjoy camping from either side, but I dislike even more the concept that gameplay elements that are deemed via social convention to be dishonorable or inconveniencing have outside power and constraints used on it. That's a really bad precedent to set. If something is not expressly against the rules of the game, then it's considered fair play, regardless of how cutthroat of a tactic it may be. 

You may not enjoy being camped to death, but if I have you on the hook in a position where I have quick access to multiple generators and can simultaneously defend all of them, all you're doing is punishing my smart and advantageous play because of someone's irritation at their own disadvantaged position. Killers already have to put out a disproportionately higher amount of effort as a role, and even more so considering the power of survivors in this game, so when I manage to swing things into my favor, it's bullshit that any outside force would undermine that, particularly when it's gained through forming a daisy chain temper tantrum. Sure, this leads to the door being open to people being face camped at 5 gens 30 seconds into the match if they're unfortunate enough to go down that quickly, but that's the risk you run, and once you start this external control, the line inevitably gets pushed more and more.
No, they didn't. If they were to change the rules, it would be reportable and bannable. Find me something that expressly states "thou shalt not camp". They're enacting punitive gameplay elements for camping through this proposed feature, but that doesn't mean the rules are changing.

By that logic, we might as well assume tunneling is against the rules because of Decisive Strike and Off the Record.

There's no real adaptation for me to make, save for no longer being able to defend hooks. I guess if survivors fuck up their gen pathing and end up in a 3 gen, then I'm gonna be forced to either walk far away to hook them, leaving him wide open for easy rescue, hook him in the middle of the 3 gen, but watch helplessly as he escapes for free, or hook him in the 3 gen, and be forced to leave the area while the other survivors leave him sitting on the hook, possibly with Reassurance, while they finish their last gen because I can't be near the hook and they're using the hooked survivor as a shield. I don't indiscriminately face camp hooks because it's not helpful for the overall goal for killer.

And we go back to my first comment:

The meter slows down if there's a survivor near.

How fast exactly do you think this meter is filling up to think that looping the killer near hook is going to be a viable strat? Do you think it's like 10 second meter or something?

And besides, lets make one thing clear: looping the killer near another downed/hooked survivor is literally one of the worst things a survivor can do. if you get a downed player near the hook that's usually just a GG. Having a meter that slowly fills up that lets someone get off hook after an extended period of time won't change that, and looping near hook isn't going to be viable.

Remember, this meter isn't a frontline defense, it's meant as a last resort for if the hooked player is getting relentlessly facecamped. They don't want it to effect people NOT face camping, and I think you're just imagining the worst possible scenario of giving everyone basekit deliverance if a killer stays near hook for 5 seconds.
    It's posts like this that make me glad that the majority of people here aren't on the design team because you're advocating for the killer to be punished for doing anything but camping. I'm not really sure how this fact eludes you or how unintuitive it is from understanding what is happening in the game state but honestly I'm not really going to exert any more effort here. You've got salty survivor syndrome all over you so Imma head out.

But hey, we'll see how it plays out when it hits the PTB later this year.
        Homie what are you talking about haha. I'm not salty about anything and I'm not advocating for anything.

I don't want the killer to get punished for playing the game normally, neither does BHVR. All this change does is make it so if the killer stays very close to hook, then the hooked survivor can get a way off hook without having to sit there for 2 minutes and die. Seems like a pretty darn reasonable change to make.

All the killer has to do to prevent this is...not stay right next to the hook for a long time. It's that easy. It just sounds to me like you want to be able to camp hooks, which unfortunately is not what BHVR or the majority of the community wants.
    Don‚Äôt bother debating him. ‚ÄúLooping near the hook‚Äù is a parrot phrase that hobbyist facecampers use to shut down discussion.

If they ever actually tried to play a pallet or moonwalked to hide their red stain and knew how chases work, they would know it is a hilariously misleading notion.
>Under what you're proposing there is no choice because the best strategy will almost always be: Take killer to hooked survivor to punish them both in time and getting a survivor off hook.

Do we even know how slow it goes or how long it takes? If having a survivor around makes it significant slower, then this is an awful 'tactic'

So instead of leading the killer away so someone can make a save, you decide to waste time by:

\- Not doing gens

\- Risk getting knocked next to a hooked survivor (better hope there is a good loop nearby or you'll die pretty quick)

\- Not allowing the hooked survivor to be rescued
I can *feel* the anger you clearly had while typing this. Really appreciate the insults by the way, very cool of you.

This change is giving people who were going to have their games ruined, another chance. It's encouraging killers to actually engage with the full game instead of just camping. It's a good thing no matter how much you personally feel entitled to camping for kills in this game.

The fact that you said people aren't entitlted to any specific outcome is one of the most unempathetic takes I've read on this sub. You really should try to remember that the people you're playing against *are people,* and your desire to win in a casual game that doesn't record or rank wins, shouldn't supercede someones desire to have a chance at having fun. 

Yes as a matter of fact, people should be entitled to matches where someone doesn't single them out and ruin their match, matches where they can get the chance to have fun, win or lose. Same way killers should be entitled to not getting infinite looped, and dealing with infinite and quick self healing, win or lose. This isn't the wild west where everyone fights for their own experience, it's a *game* and it's up to the devs to make sure everyone can have fun.

You seem to be forgetting that *this is not a competitive game*. There is no ranked mode, there is no ranked ladder, you can't see your MMR, there's no significant reward for winning, the game doesn't even define what a win is. Playing to win at all costs is passable in games that focus heavily on competition with ranked ladders and such (you know, e-sports titles), but dbd is not that. It's a casual game that's supposed to be fun.

As such, getting camped out at 5 gens isn't fun, this change is trying to remedy that. And guess what, if it's problematic it will be tuned until it's fine. That's what tests are for. I think you're *far* too caught up in the competitive aspects of this game and are forgetting that most of us are just here for some good fun.

Don't bother responding, because I'm blocking you. You're clearly not fit to be having a rational discussion about this.
Yes, I meant that it won't fill up quickly if they're far enough. Yes if you're just one room over it'll probably still be filling up, but it's gonna be very slow.
    How slow do you think it's gonna be? My guess is it'll probably be the same as wiggle bar so like 16 seconds. It's pretty easy to loop a killer for 16 seconds around a hook.
        There's no way they're gonna make it 16 seconds even if it's JUST the killer face camping.

And besides, if someone is looping near the hook then the bar fills up much more slowly. Survivors being near slow it down, remember?
As if you wouldn‚Äôt already do that.  At least the perks to prevent that actually work up until endgame.
Calm down, dude
LOOK, IM TRYING MY BEST TO FIT IN WITH YOU FELLOW KIDS
Because 7 years of incompetent game design and clear favoritism for the Survivor side give all the reason in the world to be quite judgemental of their intent and performance.
Hold on. I think I‚Äôm misunderstanding you. I understood it as when the survivors are around the hook, the hook timer slows down. Is that not the case?
I am aware. I was explaining the joke that I thought you might not have gotten, even if the joke is not applicable in this situation because the radius for camping is at 16m.
They've gotten better for sure, but they also make the same boneheaded mistakes over and over sometimes.
    You could say that there's a Merciless Storm of them.
        Sadako is my favorite please don't activate my ptsd lol
They replaced the person in charge of balancing and they seem much more competent? The recent meta shakeup seems quite positive.
    Positive if you only play Survivor. Whatever idiot is in charge of balancing this mess clearly has one priority, and it's make Killer unplayable while giving Survivors free wins at all costs at this point. Even the so called Survivor 'nerf' recently nerfed Killers harder than anything else in ages, gutting tons of perks and effectively removing them from play entirely, while Survivor healing was barely touched with the lightest of possible wrist slaps, and most of the actual nerfs that were supposed to happen instead were screamed and cried and whined away, showing, ultimately, this game is beyond help. The devs are insanely biased, and when they're not, the larger community can simply throw a fit and get what they want as the devs will bend the knee.

Hit the nail on the head bud. I don't think there's a way to recover from it when the survivor-only players just cry about every little inconvenience and get it fixed since that's a majority of the playerbase. 

The killer-only players do it too, but it's drowned out because it's maybe 20% of the playerbase. Flashlights caused seizures in some killer players because they could be spammed, and the survivor-only players threw a  fit over flashlights being "nerfed." üòë

It was literally hurting players, and I think that's the real reason people used the flashlight spam, to annoy or injure the player, not the killer.
        I'm having an easy time with perks such as Sloppy Butcher, Nowhere to Hide, Jolt, and Safe the Best for Last. I highly recommend these. Slowdown isn't necessary anymore and it's much better.
And yes, it activates for one minute but as soon as you do a conspicuous action it deactivates
And yes, it‚Äôs 3 second stun off the shoulder, one of which is spent rolling off the shoulder.
1 minute is if the killer decides to play around DS, aka, dont pick you up until 1 minute.
DS is still a pretty good perk, as in much better than most other perks, it just isn't the god tier perk it used to be, if your team is efficient on gens even the few seconds that it gets you are useful and can change the outcome of a game and it only gets stronger if you pair it with other perks like dead hard or off the record
    That‚Äôs the thing it can‚Äôt stand alone. And if your team isn‚Äôt doing gens in the first place it‚Äôs buying dead time. If you only play in solo queue it‚Äôs kind of a wasted perk slot. I guess I can concede if I had a team it would be different. I‚Äôve come to realize as a survivor the game sucks without friends to enjoy the game with. I mainly play killer
        It's ok alone and amazing combined so that's what most people do. Solo queue isn't really the issue it's just that the average player is trash at the game, and the game happens to be killer sided if you put average players against average players (as in bad vs bad). At least when playing with friends communication let's you compensate for individual bad decisions and playing a game with friends is always more fun, that's honestly how I think you are supposed to play the game, either as survivor with friends or as killer if you are solo
The basement has nothing to do with loops
You are fixating on the word "rules", while also incorrectly representing it.

"Rules" can refer to general game design terms, like "The rules for Dead Hard allow you to use it only after you've been unhooked". Video games are not like sports where they can sweep in a referee to yell "Camping!" Mechanics, often also known as rules, are their way of enforcing general behaviors that make the game more fun.

You're like the guy insisting they bring back TDM in a shooter, because you can't just camp in a corner to get kills in an objective-based game mode. Face it; the rules changed, and you need to change your play style with them.
    > You are fixating on the word "rules", while also incorrectly representing it.

No, I'm using the word as it is. *You* are incorrectly representing it with the following:

> "Rules" can refer to general game design terms, like "The rules for Dead Hard allow you to use it only after you've been unhooked".

Rules for activation of a perk and rules that govern gameplay are in no way mutually exclusive. What activates something might be "governed by a set of parameters", but that's not anywhere close to "you may not use exploits or bugs that break the game's design". I can't believe I'm actually having to explain that.

> Video games are not like sports where they can sweep in a referee to yell "Camping!"

Of course not, but they *can*, however, sweep in a referee to yell "GLITCH EXPLOIT! BUG ABUSE! HACKS OR CHEATS USED!"

> Mechanics, often also known as rules, are their way of enforcing general behaviors that make the game more fun.

Mechanics are not rules. Again, I'm flabbergasted that this has to be explained, and that you're honestly trying to make that stretch. Saying that there's a rule governing how fast movement speed is coded in the game is the same as a rule governing not being able use external programs to augment your speed has got to be one of the most laughable attempts at rationalization I've ever heard. And more fun for whom? Survivors? That sure seems to be the prevailing theme here. I'm sure killers are going to have plenty of fun not being able to play defense under this ridiculous design change while simultaneously being castigated as immoral people. The assumption is all camping is face camping, which is as stupid as this proposal. 

> You're like the guy insisting they bring back TDM in a shooter, because you can't just camp in a corner to get kills in an objective-based game mode.

No, I'm the guy that says "let players play however they see fit". I'm the guy that says lay the rules of the game, and then get out of the way. I'm the guy that says there are multiple ways to play a game, and whether or not you find it pleasing doesn't make a difference. I'm the guy that says "in this objective-based game mode, if I decide to choose to zerg the bomb site or play slowly and methodically, that's my choice. If I want to play patiently and let my opponents overextend and pick them off to reduce their numbers advantage, then that's my prerogative. If I want to run in guns a-blazin' because I'm grossly outnumbered and I don't want to play out 10 minutes of slow pushing and corner clearing, then that's my prerogative, and you complaining about my recklessness has no weight except what *you* choose to give it".

> Face it; the rules changed, and you need to change your play style with them.

There's no real adaptation for me to make, save for no longer being able to defend hooks. I guess if survivors fuck up their gen pathing and end up in a 3 gen, then I'm gonna be forced to either walk far away to hook them, leaving him wide open for easy rescue, hook him in the middle of the 3 gen, but watch helplessly as he escapes for free, or hook him in the 3 gen, and be forced to leave the area while the other survivors leave him sitting on the hook, possibly with Reassurance, while they finish their last gen because I can't be near the hook and they're using the hooked survivor as a shield. I don't indiscriminately face camp hooks because it's not helpful for the overall goal for killer. If I have a defensible position that puts the ball in my court, I do so, but if I don't have anything to defend, then I go hunting for my next chase. 

I suspect the heart of the problem with survivors disliking camping is the timing and method. I haven't heard a great many complaints about hard camping a hook during EGC, but hear plenty of complaints of hard camping at 5 gens.
