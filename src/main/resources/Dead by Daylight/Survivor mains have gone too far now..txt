[[Survivor mains have gone too far now.]]


I was at work the other day and I was thinking to myself about those god damn survivors escaping while I'm stuck at work. I was cursing to myself about those pesky survivors. Mumbling to myself about how I was going to rip them to pieces, I was laughing maniacally to myself, screaming about all the blood! 


Next thing I know, my manager pulls me into his office and says there have been customer complaints and asked for an explanation. 


It's pretty clear what is going on. Those god damn survivors are so tired of getting slaughtered by me that they found out where I work, posed as customers and complained about me to management in order to get revenge! They have gone too far this time!


they background playered to your manager
Survivors have gone too far. I have been shaking all day, trying not to let survivors‚Äô nonsense get under my skin during this fine weekend. Today I saw a guy running in the woods wearing a flashlight hat. I mean this is my spare time for god‚Äôs sake, but it ends now. I‚Äôm firing up the game as I‚Äôm writing this inspired by your post.

Blind me, ye gremlin! I DARE YOU. I won‚Äôt even bring Lightborn, this is personal now.
            I don't even use flashlights and I'm about to clickity-click away. FLASHLIGHT WARS üî¶‚ö° come at me hehehe

And bring you a cake offering for your cake day üéÇ

    Happy Cake day!
        Thank ü•≥
            Happy cake day x2
Your manager has FTP+Buckle Up. Tunnel him and Mori him, the entity commands.
I found this funny lol idk why people are taking it serious. It‚Äôs a shit post.
    Easy mistake to make, though. I've seen a few Killer Mains on here that sound like this and mean it.

Not many, but more than zero is too many lol
        I think it happens with anyone that just plays one side of this game
This reminds me of a time when I was listening to Dead by Daylight on Twitch though headphones, and a woman pulled me aside and asked if I was okay. I was confused and she mentioned she could hear me just repetitively listening to screams as I worked.
    Low key, I absolutely love this. I fall asleep to screams ^_^
        I felt like the Trickster for an hour afterward. lmao
Nah, man, that was me. Sorry but, I didn‚Äôt want salmon. I said it three times.
    This wedding is horseshit
        Gunna have to make up for it at the Catalina Wine Mixer.
I, too, am schizophrenic
The entity looking at this guy rn:üòà
Everywhere I look... Flashlights. My retinas are constantly on fire...YOU DOGGONE SURVIVORS!!
I felt you unfairly tunneled me so I called your boss to complain.  He seemed  a bit taken aback that I kept referring to him as The Entity but he can't fool me.  I hope it came through over the phone that I was rapidly crouching up and down during the call.  I'm sure he could see my aura, at least.
You joke but some people actually talk about the other side like it's a personal grudge.
stupid survivors standing in the lobby, I bet they're talking to each other about escaping, how rude!
This is 199% real
Jason, look me in the eyes


You slugged them, didn't you?


Jason?¬†

most sane killer main

                Oh no. I'm not going to sacrifice you. I'm going to make sure you bleed out until I mori you üòà
                    have fun finding me as I crawl off and hide in a bush to die.
üòÇüòÇ
u dont wanna see me when im angery üòà
10/10

lol, I loved reading through this.
As one of those Survivor Mains, I can confirm that this is true. üòÅ
New copypasta just dropped
Isn't killers mains still the winning team when it comes to percentages and ratios though? I mean look what they did to the Texas Cowboys!
your manager sounds like a survivor main
Ngl I'm high and this was weird asf to me LOL
Most sane main killer:
I just played the game and the survivors had the balls to repair a gen. I was so pissed.
I think you have schizophrenia
Relatable.
I know right we're such a freaking Cock Tease.
Honestly, being a Killer in DBD would be a retail worker's dream job. Survivor tbag you at every pallet? Tunnel them the fuck out without management reprimanding you . Salty Survivor in eng game chat mad about a perk you brought that countered their perk? Deal with it.
lol
I know this is meant as a joke but I've had multiple death threats and stalkers going after friends and family, leaving comments on every review I ever wrote for other games, etc from my Steam profile before - all entirely from survivors.  I will say it's not as bad as it used to be, but I've never seen anything like it from other games and I've played multiple full loot pvp titles.

I've also never had a killer do anything even remotely equivalent.  There are definitely people who play who would absolutely try to destroy your real life if they had a way to, and cannot separate gaming fiction from reality.
    Consider these factors

1. There's more survivors each match, therefore more likely to come across toxic survivors than toxic killers. 
2. In my opinion i think its easier as a noob to get the basic mechanics of killer than the basic mechanics of survivor, therefore i think all in all that creates more salt amongst noobie survivors 
3. People who play in groups in games are often more toxic because mob mentality, so if you get a swif there's a higher likelihood of toxicity 
4. Survivors can die no matter how good they are playing, often at least one person dies. It could be you depsite how good you did that match. So that could also increase salt. 

I think the side of community that is all "wah wah survivors toxic and bad" "wah wah killers toxic and bad" is so childish. 
Like its really simple, some survivors are toxic, some killers are toxic. Some survivors are amazing, some killers are amazing. So why bother trying to argue who is more toxic, it's impossible to know and it doesn't even matter, each side is not a hivemind
    i think that the survivor side has some of the worst people this community has to offer. not only do some of them only play to make the game as unenjoyable as possible for the killer but theyll harass you on your profile REGARDLESS of the outcome of the game. have had dudes comment heinous shit on my steam profile after i lost lol. been lucky enough to not experience anything like you but it honestly wouldn't surprise me if it did happen.
