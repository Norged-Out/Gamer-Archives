[[For everyone complaining about wrath just play amulet]]





Amulet is really fun and actually takes skill to pilot which is why I climbed to GM with it but the wrath match up is all up to whether you draw orchid's examination hall and meowsker's especially when going second.

You need Mum's for dealing with the snake girl so they can't start fusing wrath turn 3 and then Plum's so that you don't die to garnet rondo and the 1pp 3 dmg and all the other damage they can shit out. Meowskers is needed to trade early so that they can't chip your health away. I've also found that wing beats of prayer doesn't really matter for surviving unless I evolved Laina so that I can heal for 3 when I have 5pp followers destroyed.

I've been able to get by the skin of my teeth a bunch of time so I know how to navigate the matchup but losing to a wrath high roll always feels awful since it's so easy for them to get Chimera to 3pp.
    If you play 3 wishing chalice (which I do and I 100% recommend), you double your chances of being able to deal with weapon tamer turn 2. Ez replace with meus in OP’s list.
        I'll try it out if I ever want to get to GM1 I didn't really think of replacing of anything since its a pretty tight list.
So what's the plan against wrath exactly because when I was learning the deck I was struggling to beat urias ai as wolf and urias meant angel plan wasn't possible
    Hope they don't realize they have to go for more than just spamming Chimera and Rondo. In other words, hope the throw away all damage cards instantly and don't try to go for OTK.
    Urias Ai is too powerful man, his dice devils always heal for 6
    Urias is cut from most list except sometimes as a one of but there is a plan for him. If they ever do play him always try to trade away your board and don't leave stuff up in hopes you can go face.

I would try to get a min of 3 angle fires in hand then play angel popping 3 different amulets to try and have a mega burn if they aren't at 20hp. If I'm finding that to hard I'll rely on the fact urias draws them 2 each turn and just play heal cards only (mom, holy serpent, plum's, peace [spell only don't play the amulets late game unless you can remove it] and angle just for the big body and heals) to just stay alive and bc they draw more cards then you they lose.

Not sure where you're getting that impression but 3x Elena is the norm, with people sometimes reducing to 2 copies. Urias is virtually mandatory for Wrath to have a chance against Shadow.
            Must be outdated knowledge because wrath was cutting elena until machina shadow bece a thing a one of the token spells became the best cards against machina
                Have they started re-adding her? I haven't seen her much on ladder or the event and I do know the recent jcg lists had cut her entirely from most lists.
                    She required to have a chance at beating machina otherwise the shield soaks too much damage and them spamming followers damage will rack up and urias effect might end up doing more damage than chimera
4/5 games in group A were wrath (one forest that messed up the combo) and I've had a fairly easy time with them. I've had some fast wraths who activated turn 3 going first with Chimera in hand. 

Main game plan is just heal through the burn and keep up a ward at all times. I had games where I would sit at 8-11 health then heal back up to 18-20 with a few wards on board and even reached a point against 2 wrath players where they had less than 3 cards and left after they knew they couldn't kill me before decking.
Card list pls

        Welp im blind. Ty op
Yep. The strongest thing about wrath outside the highroll is that evolve blood exists. Sucks to mull for wrath and find a completely different gameplan...
Where is the deck list op

        my bad, was on mobile, didn't realize there was 2
Given this kind of advice, you might as well play Laina. Probably has a better chance to just heal through Wrath burn.
    I do run one copy of her she definitely helps with the heal but isn't mandatory and she is sometimes useless against other match ups.
19 Legendaries and 12 gold cards.


Not everyone has 77,000+ vials lying around!


Not faulting you of course, have fun; but I can't help but laugh thinking all the way back to the "Glob" haven days where people thought that those decklists were ridiculously expensive (at close to 40k vials) and to see how "far" we've come : D
Gee Bill! How come your mom lets you run 19 Legendaries in your deck?
