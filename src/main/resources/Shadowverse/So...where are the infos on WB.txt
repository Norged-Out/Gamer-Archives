[[So...where are the infos on WB]]


title, the game is set to come out at most in 5 months (delay notwithstanding atm) and yet we only had the presentation on the new features of the game. Cy should be aiming to sell the game atm esp since they reveal NOT making the move to wb could be a viable option


I think they had no other choice.

They announced it too early, but they had to otherwise people would wonder what is happening after this final set. They couldn't just put out sets like normal and then go "oh btw the game is ending" and then going silent only to then announce WB.
So they had to bridge the gap between SV ending and what that means, and getting eyes on WB. They can't just move up WB to be sooner, so announcing it earlier was the only option.

What they should be doing though is filling in this time with little details. Nothing major but something, because this gap is big.
Rage 2024 summer grand finals we will be getting some kind of worlds beyond news this was in there last live stream when they announced Heros of shadowverse
Why would they overhype a game while their current product is still being played and in rotation? They will most likely begin giving more information at the start of June when they have nothing else to begin marketting since SV1 would have had their mini released by then for about a month.

Overhype is more dangerous marketting than underhype. How many games have you scene hype up then not release for too long only to fade away. Its been proven time and time again that you want to hype something into an immediate release.

That's why for years now they changed to the expansion reveal format of reveal expansion -> card reveals over the next 1-2 weeks -> drop update immediately afterwards. 

Hype fizzles out faster than you can generate it so you want good pacing. This has been proven for a long time now so why would they change up a working formula they're comfortable with?
    While I do agree that overhype is a thing (I'm typically 1st to call this out) the issue here is that the game is supposedly out on a handful of month and other than the shadowverse community nobody knows it's coming and even the community is basicly in the dark as to what to expect. Heck japanesses esport team are folding because they don't know if going into wb is a good idea
        The simple answer is money. They refuse yo truly advertise WB until shadowverse is through the selling period for it's last set. Until the midset sale has ended I wouldn't expect a hint of WB since naturally players would start saving g money for WB, or even decide to get off the treadmill since it creates an exit point. Better to wait and naturally have the end of one roll into the start of the other with the promise the first will still be available. There isn't even anything in game yet to advertise this is the last set to make sure sales aren't impacted...
        But what difference would it be from risking overhype by doing it now versus June trying to get to a wider audience? It's still the same result regardless of what audience you're targetting.

If anything, it's actually riskier to advertise to that possible new audience you want to convert into players without having a product for them to immediately play.

Sure they could probably reveal a few mechanics and cards in drips right now like they do for SVE over the next 3 months and the people who come to reddit would still try/play the game. But a player who you're trying to convince come to the game? They would burn out on hype way quicker. 

And TBF the lack of communication only really impacts those who will still play the game anyway. Also Cygames has always been bad with communicating their esports plan even to the organizations who attempted to be in the ecosystem. That's a part (of a big systemic issue) that caused many of the other pro teams to leave overtime for the western scene. Or... Even avoid also joining in. 

That is a systemic issue that we agree on here but I definitely think Cygames is doing the best course of action here from their end as a business managing their marketting timing for the game as a product.

The esports side is a marketting tool to retain player attention rather than to draw people in. That was proven when we weren't getting conversion from other CCG's on the market during the WGP for $1 million. Despite having the largest prizepool to chase for a digital CCG it didn't convert anyone from Hearthstone, LOR (which barely had a prizepool in the first place), or Gwent. Despite 2/3 having a much smaller competitive circuit in comparison to what Cygames set up. So point in case - Esports is for retainment not converting.
I don't think marketing WB right now is the best time when it's not available for months, and they currently have a product they're trying to sell that's available right now and will continue to be available after WB releases. There's this current expansion with its battle pass, the mini-expansion, and story chapters for the last new content in SV1 as well as random Shadowverse Flame puzzle cosmetics that potentially might come out. For the Shadowverse IP overall, the Shadowverse Flame anime is still ongoing, and all its systems are still rooted in SV1, as well as Armed Dragon being a playable Unlimited deck, so in a way, SV1 is still getting advertised for at least another 10 weeks or so with upcoming episodes. On top of that, they plan to continue to release paid battle passes with new leaders even after WB releases.

Also, we don't have a lot of points of reference in general for "marketing the sequel CCG to a currently available one that hasn't shutdown," especially in this case where both games will be concurrently available for a while. Stuff like Princess Connect RE:Dive for another Cygames IP with a game sequel or Duelyst II for a CCG example, they were made after the original shutdown and not made while the original was running and successful enough to CONTINUE running it even after the sequel releases. Even things like Master Duel vs. Duel Links or Pokemon TCG Live vs. Pocket are completely separate formats that play completely differently, whereas SV1 vs. World Beyond is very much one directly building up from the other.

They needed to announce WB to explain why SV1 is getting Resurgent cards and no more development or collabs, which is why they made the announcement so early. I imagine we'll hear more about the game when SV1 has no more new gameplay content to hype up.
Marketing cycles for mobile games are hella short these days
In order to squeeze the last bits of money they can with the last expansion it makes sense to not market the new game. Why would anyone want to spend money if the company itself is hyping up what is essentially the death of the older game? It's an obvious business strategy kinda thing.

Sure, they can choose to hype up WB but SV isn't like Call of Duty where they need to yell around and get the kids to hype up, forget about the old game and migrate to the new one. 

The medium of card games are fun because they can potentially change and evolve overtime (for better or worse). A charm that is lost once the game sunsets. Not to mention in SV's case, it is going to sunset with a small amount of viable decks when looking from an "overall pov". Like if mtg sunsets, not that I can see it happening, they still have such a massive card pool of viable playstyles that it can still be interesting. But in SV? We have an "unwritten rule" that only particular decks from each classes is worth playable and nothing else. A rule that is only "updated" when new expansions comes out...which we are no longer going to get here.

So if SV players want to play continue playing SV the card game and not get bored to death by eventually unchanging metas (even custom rotations can only liven it up so much), they are going to have to migrate to the new one. Simple as.
I got a feeling there wont be a western release for worlds beyond.
    SV 2 is scheduled to release with international language. Even the Switch game and evolve got an English release.
    They would be dumb. There is a target audience and they physical game is doing well in the west. Besides, even the easy is lacking news. I predict we hear nothing until the mini set sale ends to milk casuals as much as possible. I don't even think there is anything in game about this being the last set yet...
    Why would they announce it in english then.
    Yeah they probably just translated all the WB news into English for, uhhhh, English-only speakers living in Japan.
