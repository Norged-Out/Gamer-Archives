[[Illari feels worse than ever. It's time for the balance team to finally do something about this hero!]]


Secondary healing buff of 10 HPS is barely noticeable and makes no difference, what makes difference on the other hand is that totally weird and unnecessary primary nerf! They keep messing up with the muscle memory of her primary and it's fire-rate. In match it definitely feel much worse than it sounds on paper. Her primary feels so weird and clunky to use now and it's just sad that she was nerfed for no actual reason at all. This hero is struggling for 3 seasons now and last thing she needed is a nerf of any kind and especially not something like this.

It looks to me like she was a filler release and like it's a failed design that they don't know what to do with. Do they want a Support like Zen, that offers good damage but limited healing or do they want a Support that has good healing numbers with potent damage. Are they forgetting that she offers no utility and that she only heals and does damage? For how long will she be in this limbo where she is NOT ALLOWED to be good or excel at anything? Will they ever figure out what they want with her or is she not allowed to be popular for the reasons we all know? Because i am dropping her too!


I think that her heal beam might feel better if it was longer range. Part of the struggle when I play her is that the heal beam is super good on tanks, but you have to play so far away from them that they can’t use it. If the heal was long enough that it actually allowed her to play from long range, I think the character would feel a lot better
    Totally agree. I don’t get why they haven’t done that already.
        Tbh they could even do something cool with it, like scale up the healing value the further you are from your target. Could be interesting Bc it rewards really good tracking at long range
            I think I like the reverse of this better. It would increase her skill ceiling because you'd have to decide between safe positioning and minor heal or risky positioning and major heal. Either way a length increase is needed
    It should also peirce allies. It’s a super thin beam so it would allow for high points like maybe being pretty good if your team is in grav, or one person isn’t blocking heals for someone on critical
I did like how her gun was feeling just before this most recent nerf. At that point though, she was basically just a dps character with a healing pylon. The problem they have is there’s nothing interesting about her magic marker heal ray or auto healing pylon, so when they mess with her dps - what’s left fun-wise? Bad design.
    It’s not a bad design, it’s poor execution on balance front. She’s quite well designed.
        As someone that plays her primarily, her design is still bad. Too many things that make no sense together on one character.
        Elaborate? Because it's of very popular opinion that she is poorly designed.
            I feel like Reddit throws around “bad design” so quickly when upon release everyone was praising her as a simple well designed hero. It’s crazy as soon as a hero sees several nerfs to their core gameplay it becomes an argument of hero design vs. poor balance changes.

I think people expect to keep pylon in one spot when she’s supposed to be played more reactionary and move pylon to fit current team positional needs as opposed to the team bunkering on her pylon. That’s bad gameplay, not bad design. Gutting pylon has made her feel worse to play, I will concede, but it does not by default make her a badly designed character. You allow pylon to do healing, and while it’s healing, it gives her an opening to do damage. I seriously question how that is so horribly designed? It’s not IDEAL on a support hero but there are other support heroes that do similar things but still play vastly different.

The recent change defeats the purpose of the entire characters core design when you become more reliant on the beam over good pylon placement. You lose damage because it forces her to focus more on a better outcome with healing beam.
                Your first point of everyone saying she was well designed on release is ignoring how humans operate. First impressions don't actually mean anything. We learned how through probably millions of hours of experience that she's not that well designed. Overwatch is a very nuanced game and no one really knew how well designed they were from the start. 

Her whole kit is contradictory. She's best played on an off angle away from team. But she's too vulnerable so she has to selfishly use pylon for herself. Couple this with her healing being extremely short range and very limited, combined with below average mobility. She's similar to brig in terms of bad design. Fundamentally they are farrrrrrr too niche to ever be used in 99 percent of matches and when they are, they are usually overpowered. Sym, Widow, and ball are kind of the same, but to a lesser degree. 

Completely reworking her pylon and heal are the only path forward if they ever hope to fix her(a year from now optimistically). There is no such thing as good pylon placement due to how she is designed. If you play close to team and have "good pylon placement", you are playing wrong. The correct positioning for illari is on a semi-deep off angle to maximize her damage potential. But she simply is too easy to dive/rush. If you play with the team you are basically throwing.
            First time seeing someone say she is poorly designed
                Most players only have a surface level understanding of overwatch
        She's boring as shit 
I actually quite like her the way she is. 

What i find the most important when playing her, is to always change the location of the healing pylon. If you get pushed back, directly place it further behind. If you can push, place the healing pylon more upfront. The long cooldown is really bad and reduces your heal output quite a lot. Thats why its important that its never get shot at and you can easily place it anywhere you like. But if it gets destroyed your healing goes quite down a lot for the long cooldown time.
    I feel like a good buff could be to decrease the cooldown when you throw an undamaged pylon down. That way re-placing pylons becomes easier and Illari becomes more nimble
        If you throw a healing pylon, and its not getting damaged the cooldown to throw the next one is relatively short (like 4 seconds?). Or am I misunderstanding something?
            I believe it’s 6 seconds but I could be wrong. Just make it 2-3 seconds imo as long as it’s undamaged
    I agree that she’s fun as is, but the problem is that she sucks ass and is the worst support character by far right now
    100% i also feel like people play her wrong damage wise. Her ability to substantial damage immediately to anyone she sees makes her extremely good at repeling the enemy group. Two shots to just about any character will force them to retreat and recover. This is really good when you use it against healers because when the healer retreats, the tank can't push. I think people are trying to get kills with her but her main goal should really be focusing people until they retreat and then moving to the next target to try to get the tank vulnerable. Once the tank is dead her speed gives her good opportunities to chase weakened oponents down.
    Even when it's out the Pylon has such a low value now. It's value is greatly exaggerated and it gets destroyed by literally anything now.
        this is not true at all, i think maybe you need to improve your pylon placement and awareness
        its value is pretty much distracting the enemy team because they have to look at it and destory it
        What do you mean with low value?   
If you compare the healing pylon alone to lets say a mercy.

Mercy does 55 heal a second. Healing Pylon does 37.5 heal per second. Only a 17,5 /s difference, for a freaking turret. And then you have her normal weapon which does 115 heal per second...  
  
And the healing pylon automatically switches heal target. Mercy doesn't.

I don't really see something negative, also compared to other heros not only mercy.
They need to maker her laser louder, lower pitch and have reverb. But for real i think shes pretty good, you just need like 60% accuracy on healing and damage to make her viable. Predict when they are going to break through the choke so you can rotate your pylon. 

Maybe an idea for a change could be to give her a slight healing buff when the pylon gets shot down? Or buff her boop? She feels like she is lacking on utility a little.
The increased charge rate on her gun killed her and entirely for me. Feels like ass to play
I thought she was fine last patch tbh
    2nd half of the season, yeah. Mostly fine. But now she isn't.
The primary fire charge rate on her April Fools change feels nice. It felt clunky playing her after that mode ended, and now with the nerf, it is even worse. I won't mind a damage nerf as long as she has that charge rate.
she’s fine?? i mean as an illari main i wouldn’t mind if she got buffed but i think she’s fine as of right now
I played her for the first time this season after being away from the game for many months and I thought she felt great! Consistent pick up kills with a huge hit scan bullet, her turret offers a ton of healing, the right click healing pretty much just for topping people off and the knockback/ mobility is so useful on a support. Sad to hear she used to feel even better, wish I got to play her then
    Her damage at launch was busted. Think larger than Hanzo-size projectile radius but with hitscan. She was insanely good against flankers.
        It was the same size as Hanzo but still goofy for a hitscan
I main illari and I won't say she is in a perfect spot but first, if you can't notice 10 hps im sorry but that's on you. 

>This hero is struggling for 3 seasons now and last thing she needed is a nerf of any kind and especially not something like this.

They want supports not to deal that much damage and that's ok, that's also why it wasn't a nerf but an adjustment since her overall power level is fine

>Are they forgetting that she offers no utility and that she only heals and does damage?

Besides the slow on ult on knockback on shift, that's why she deals a lot of both damage and healing, her primary is very consistent even if the dps isn't insane while pylon and secondary do for a lot of burst healing and some over time(over 150 hps for 3 seconds is not low, like at all)
    They downvote you because you’re right.
Skill issue
    This is the root issue for most "buff X hero" posts
Honestly, I don't see why they don't let her gun charge up to 80 damage. It would make her a little more different from the other supports. I feel like this change made her feel a bit more like Ana.
seconded. i can see what the devs were going for but they messed it up. illari has such little healing output, even with the pylon up. i could see it being fine if she had great damage output, but what she has now isn’t enough to even it out. it’s a bummer too because i love her design and i think she could be great with a real rework.
    She literally does the most healing in the game.
    >illari has such little healing output

Lmao
        No one past silver lets a pylon live for more than a millisecond
            if it's placed poorly, yes. 

I play Illari in high gold and still have an uptime of ~70%. Your number 1 job as Illari is to micro manage the fuck out of your pylon. Learning the throw arc, what walls you can stick it sideways on, sightlines, when the enemy is about to push, etc are all super important.
            Pylon heals 37.5 per sec, her secondary is 115 even if it has a recharge, her healing isn't low you are just bad at tracking/pylon positioning
                I don’t even use Illari and when I have one in my team I pray they become those aimbot illari’s hitting headshots only. Her heals are alright when I have used her but what she does Moira does better.
IDEA TO BUFF HER WITHOUT REWOKRING HER ENTIRE KIT: you know how her shift is her self boost jump ability? what if, allies hit in the blast get a buff that lets them do the same ability WITHOUT any of the knockback if they jump within the next 4 seconds (half the cd of her ability)  
this gives her and her allies all the ability to gain highground and have vertical mobility and horizontal jump mobility AKA being the only support to provide mobility boosts OTHER then lucio!!!  
EDIT: the point is to give her some utility, sure her gun feels clicky i dont disagree but i wish she had some utility (AND THAT THEY BUFFED HER MELEE TO DO MORE DAMAGE, like now we have venture with a drill but illari swinging a sword is the same damage as junkrat punching someone....)  
EDIT 2: also i wish her pilon with 100 hp was not the size OF A PERSON, i wish it was like 1/2 the size and harder to hit...
I disagree, I play a bunch of Illari and I can kinda stomp lobbies with her ,given a decent team

I will say tho, you can't really play her as a main support for most situations, she does not have reliable heals, and so is more of a situational pick for me
I wish they just left her projectile size alone initially. It just feels bad to play her. I got the muscle memory down and then they fucked it and never felt like it returned to proper form.

I do see a ton of people playing her lately though, her impact is minimal to moderate usually
Make her heal beam damage and burn enemies. 

Make anyone caught in her sunburst to catch on fire.

Make her rifle full auto with charged shots during her ult.
Expecting Blizzard to care about anything other than banning people for saying naughty words is silly!
I seriously want this kind of post to stop. The subreddit isn't an activist platform for lobbying and it's every fucking day.

All these posts should just go in the rage megathread.
If it were me, i'd rework her so that pylon is immortal as long as Illari is alive, and perhaps dies when she does. Pylon is simply too vulnerable to work in combat, but if it stuck around as long as she did it would have far more use, and allow her to contribute to DPS even with the lower damage gun because she wouldn't have to focus on secondary fire healing. Almost like it's a zen orb in its "fire and forget" style, albeit one you have to move to keep up with the team.
    Making something immortal doesn't resolve any issues. You have now made a decent ability OP if it can't be destroyed. And literally making her a healbot that could toss that out, then just hide away while the pylon does her healing for her. 

IF...and that's a BIG IF, they ever did something like this they would have to make the healing output of the pylon even lower then it already is. It just wouldn't be fair any other way.
        If the illari just throws in the healing turret then plays keepaway, they're doing a fraction of what other supports could do. It's not op to allow illari to heal without the turret being destroyed to my eyes anymore than it's op we can't shoot anas rifle out of her hands, or mercy's staff, or shoot zens orb off. If it only exists so long as illari exists, that's the same as all other supports, that they can only heal so long as they are alive. It would be like an improved version of zens healing orb, compensated for by her not having discord orb or quite as good DPS, and the turret only covering an area.
            Would not be an improved version of Zen's healing. You move from los, and healing orb goes away. And it only affects one person, not the whole team. \*No other supports cast something and then run and hide while still being able to heal. But let's break down what you think the other support can do.

Ana: Has to be in los to shoot her gun to heal you. Or, relative los for the nade to heal.  
Baptiste: Los for his pop all heal. His grenade can heal outside of los, but only in a VERY close distance.  
Brigitte: Nope, los again.  
Kiriko: Definitely los.  
Mercy: Can break los for a decent amount of time while the healing staff is on. Still los to start healing.  
Lucio: A lamp post will break his aoe healing.  
\*Moira: This is the only one that can get away with the healing orb outside of los, and obviously it's on a cool down and drains.  
Zen: Healing orb...can briefly go outside of los once applied, but not for very long. Also, only one target per orb.

How about, stop relying on her pylon so much. Heals 30 per .45 seconds. While her weapon can heal 115 per second and less then a 3 second recharge time unless you completely deplete it.

Doesn't matter how you see, thankfully you are not on the developer team. By your logic of an immortal pylon, we should also let Torb have an immortal Turret. I mean, it should exist as long as he does right?
    I think a better way would be allowing her to heal it
    Did u forget what happened in s6 when her pylon had 200 health. Pylon when active is when of the best abilities in the game
        She's fundamentally changed since then. Besides that, if no one has to waste time shooting the turret, they can shoot the illari instead, which solves the same problem of removing the turret.
            "Fundamentally changed" The main thing that's has changed is her pylon because it's so powerful it got it's health reduced and it's cooldown increased outside of that she is largely the same. If you legitimately think a immortal pylon is a good idea basically having a third support idek what to say.
                There is a difference between "immortal pylon" and "Pylon that's only around when Illari is alive."

Any support in this game will win the fight for their team if they are not killed. If Illari is only using her turret to heal, she will do far less healing than other comparable supports. If she is using her healing beam too, then she is close to the fight and vulnerable to being attacked, and is not dpsing. 

I can see an argument for "make it invulnerable but reduce it's output." But even as it is now, the pylon isn't outpacing the healing of other supports healing except zen.  Its 37.5 healing per second. Slightly more than Zens orb. Bringing it down to Zens 30hps seems like it would be a fair tradeoff, given the additional benefits a zen brings.
                    Illari will be basically immortal as well. Her pylon was responsible from removing all dive character from the meta. For basically the only two seasons in OW2 Tracer wasnt played in Pro overwatch was because of her pylon. The meta was probably the worst in the game.
                        It does almost half the healing of a moira orb. A moira orb doesn't make the team immortal while near it, or remove all dive characters from the meta. You can absolutely kill an illari without killing her pylon right now, and that wouldn't change with this.
                            Moria orb has a cooldown wtf r u saying.
                                What im saying is, a passive 37.5 hps while near her turret (That's only hitting her while shes being attacked, and goes away when she dies.) is not going to prevent Illari from getting killed by anyone.
                                    It will make her extremely hard to kill. Just like we saw in S6 and S7 we will go back to another boring sustain meta this time worse because U can't shoot the pylon
    If they kept it immortal they would reduce the healing numbers by a lot to balance this. I don’t think it would be the right change for her. I don’t play her so I could be wrong, but a change I would like to see is her beam able to go through more than 1 ally.
    Idk, I do feel like tracking and managing pylon is a part of what makes illari a higher skilled hero. I find that as long as I track it and consistently move it when needed, I can keep it put for ages and pump out healing like crazy.

>For how long will she be in this limbo where she is NOT ALLOWED to be good or excel at anything?

Wdym, for a while she was dominating top level and tourneys. The only thing that really killed her was season 9 HP changes, and even then she was still viable. Yeah she's pretty bad rn, but I think the devs had reason for what they did
I have literally zero remorse for Illari players that I see in QP, because they should just go play DPS. Bozo energy from them.
Totally agree. I don’t get why they haven’t done that already.
    Tbh they could even do something cool with it, like scale up the healing value the further you are from your target. Could be interesting Bc it rewards really good tracking at long range
        I think I like the reverse of this better. It would increase her skill ceiling because you'd have to decide between safe positioning and minor heal or risky positioning and major heal. Either way a length increase is needed
It should also peirce allies. It’s a super thin beam so it would allow for high points like maybe being pretty good if your team is in grav, or one person isn’t blocking heals for someone on critical

Its 37.5 healing per second. Slightly more than Zens orb. Bringing it down to Zens 30hps seems like it would be a fair tradeoff, given the additional benefits a zen brings.
                Illari will be basically immortal as well. Her pylon was responsible from removing all dive character from the meta. For basically the only two seasons in OW2 Tracer wasnt played in Pro overwatch was because of her pylon. The meta was probably the worst in the game.
                    It does almost half the healing of a moira orb. A moira orb doesn't make the team immortal while near it, or remove all dive characters from the meta. You can absolutely kill an illari without killing her pylon right now, and that wouldn't change with this.
                        Moria orb has a cooldown wtf r u saying.
                            What im saying is, a passive 37.5 hps while near her turret (That's only hitting her while shes being attacked, and goes away when she dies.) is not going to prevent Illari from getting killed by anyone.
                                It will make her extremely hard to kill. Just like we saw in S6 and S7 we will go back to another boring sustain meta this time worse because U can't shoot the pylon
If they kept it immortal they would reduce the healing numbers by a lot to balance this. I don’t think it would be the right change for her. I don’t play her so I could be wrong, but a change I would like to see is her beam able to go through more than 1 ally.
Idk, I do feel like tracking and managing pylon is a part of what makes illari a higher skilled hero. I find that as long as I track it and consistently move it when needed, I can keep it put for ages and pump out healing like crazy.
Tbh they could even do something cool with it, like scale up the healing value the further you are from your target. Could be interesting Bc it rewards really good tracking at long range
    I think I like the reverse of this better. It would increase her skill ceiling because you'd have to decide between safe positioning and minor heal or risky positioning and major heal. Either way a length increase is needed
As someone that plays her primarily, her design is still bad. Too many things that make no sense together on one character.
Elaborate? Because it's of very popular opinion that she is poorly designed.
    I feel like Reddit throws around “bad design” so quickly when upon release everyone was praising her as a simple well designed hero. It’s crazy as soon as a hero sees several nerfs to their core gameplay it becomes an argument of hero design vs. poor balance changes.

I think people expect to keep pylon in one spot when she’s supposed to be played more reactionary and move pylon to fit current team positional needs as opposed to the team bunkering on her pylon. That’s bad gameplay, not bad design. Gutting pylon has made her feel worse to play, I will concede, but it does not by default make her a badly designed character. You allow pylon to do healing, and while it’s healing, it gives her an opening to do damage. I seriously question how that is so horribly designed? It’s not IDEAL on a support hero but there are other support heroes that do similar things but still play vastly different.

The recent change defeats the purpose of the entire characters core design when you become more reliant on the beam over good pylon placement. You lose damage because it forces her to focus more on a better outcome with healing beam.
        Your first point of everyone saying she was well designed on release is ignoring how humans operate. First impressions don't actually mean anything. We learned how through probably millions of hours of experience that she's not that well designed. Overwatch is a very nuanced game and no one really knew how well designed they were from the start. 

Her whole kit is contradictory. She's best played on an off angle away from team. But she's too vulnerable so she has to selfishly use pylon for herself. Couple this with her healing being extremely short range and very limited, combined with below average mobility. She's similar to brig in terms of bad design. Fundamentally they are farrrrrrr too niche to ever be used in 99 percent of matches and when they are, they are usually overpowered. Sym, Widow, and ball are kind of the same, but to a lesser degree. 

Completely reworking her pylon and heal are the only path forward if they ever hope to fix her(a year from now optimistically). There is no such thing as good pylon placement due to how she is designed. If you play close to team and have "good pylon placement", you are playing wrong. The correct positioning for illari is on a semi-deep off angle to maximize her damage potential. But she simply is too easy to dive/rush. If you play with the team you are basically throwing.
    First time seeing someone say she is poorly designed
        Most players only have a surface level understanding of overwatch
She's boring as shit 
If you throw a healing pylon, and its not getting damaged the cooldown to throw the next one is relatively short (like 4 seconds?). Or am I misunderstanding something?
    I believe it’s 6 seconds but I could be wrong. Just make it 2-3 seconds imo as long as it’s undamaged
this is not true at all, i think maybe you need to improve your pylon placement and awareness
its value is pretty much distracting the enemy team because they have to look at it and destory it
What do you mean with low value?   
If you compare the healing pylon alone to lets say a mercy.

Mercy does 55 heal a second. Healing Pylon does 37.5 heal per second. Only a 17,5 /s difference, for a freaking turret. And then you have her normal weapon which does 115 heal per second...  
  
And the healing pylon automatically switches heal target. Mercy doesn't.

I don't really see something negative, also compared to other heros not only mercy.
It was the same size as Hanzo but still goofy for a hitscan
No one past silver lets a pylon live for more than a millisecond
    if it's placed poorly, yes. 

I play Illari in high gold and still have an uptime of ~70%. Your number 1 job as Illari is to micro manage the fuck out of your pylon. Learning the throw arc, what walls you can stick it sideways on, sightlines, when the enemy is about to push, etc are all super important.
    Pylon heals 37.5 per sec, her secondary is 115 even if it has a recharge, her healing isn't low you are just bad at tracking/pylon positioning
        I don’t even use Illari and when I have one in my team I pray they become those aimbot illari’s hitting headshots only. Her heals are alright when I have used her but what she does Moira does better.
If the illari just throws in the healing turret then plays keepaway, they're doing a fraction of what other supports could do. It's not op to allow illari to heal without the turret being destroyed to my eyes anymore than it's op we can't shoot anas rifle out of her hands, or mercy's staff, or shoot zens orb off. If it only exists so long as illari exists, that's the same as all other supports, that they can only heal so long as they are alive. It would be like an improved version of zens healing orb, compensated for by her not having discord orb or quite as good DPS, and the turret only covering an area.
    Would not be an improved version of Zen's healing. You move from los, and healing orb goes away. And it only affects one person, not the whole team. \*No other supports cast something and then run and hide while still being able to heal. But let's break down what you think the other support can do.

Ana: Has to be in los to shoot her gun to heal you. Or, relative los for the nade to heal.  
Baptiste: Los for his pop all heal. His grenade can heal outside of los, but only in a VERY close distance.  
Brigitte: Nope, los again.  
Kiriko: Definitely los.  
Mercy: Can break los for a decent amount of time while the healing staff is on. Still los to start healing.  
Lucio: A lamp post will break his aoe healing.  
\*Moira: This is the only one that can get away with the healing orb outside of los, and obviously it's on a cool down and drains.  
Zen: Healing orb...can briefly go outside of los once applied, but not for very long. Also, only one target per orb.

How about, stop relying on her pylon so much. Heals 30 per .45 seconds. While her weapon can heal 115 per second and less then a 3 second recharge time unless you completely deplete it.

Doesn't matter how you see, thankfully you are not on the developer team. By your logic of an immortal pylon, we should also let Torb have an immortal Turret. I mean, it should exist as long as he does right?
She's fundamentally changed since then. Besides that, if no one has to waste time shooting the turret, they can shoot the illari instead, which solves the same problem of removing the turret.
    "Fundamentally changed" The main thing that's has changed is her pylon because it's so powerful it got it's health reduced and it's cooldown increased outside of that she is largely the same. If you legitimately think a immortal pylon is a good idea basically having a third support idek what to say.
        There is a difference between "immortal pylon" and "Pylon that's only around when Illari is alive."

Any support in this game will win the fight for their team if they are not killed. If Illari is only using her turret to heal, she will do far less healing than other comparable supports. If she is using her healing beam too, then she is close to the fight and vulnerable to being attacked, and is not dpsing.
