[[Most expensive overwatch item ]]


This is the most expensive thing in Overwatch! Hashimoto don't mess around. 

Worth it? ðŸ˜‚


You paint the spray in the spawn to flex and some dude covers it with the default overwatch spray
    Sounds like a no brainer for me
    i leave the def spray equipped on my mains just to do this
        I shall be following in your footsteps in my next match
    Level Up !
    I keep forgetting to change the default spray xD
    I have the default spray equipped just for this reason
    Default Overwatch spray supremacy !!!
Huhâ€¦ why can you use prism stones or whatever to buy a spray? Why does it cost more than a mythic? 

Im confusion
    it's probably supposed to be Credits or Coins but it glitched
        It's most likely client side. So the Server will probably charge you for the correct currency anyway.
            only one way to find out!!1!
        Try it op :)
        Yeah, just yesterday, Blackwatch Moira was being sold in the hero gallery for 1500 OWL tokens lmao
    It's just a bug! 100$ spray is super funny to me
        Apex Legens Prices right there
            Thats cheap by apex standards
                Bruh new heirloom costs $300 hard to say it is cheap.
                    What new heirloom? There isnt one out rn, also all heirlooms and mythic skins cost $500
                        Under Shadow Society even and it is out.
                            There is a mythic skin for that event and im pretty sure its $150
            Valorant even
        With the way things are getting priced i'd believe if it wasnt a bug
It barley looks like a legendary skin
    The screenshot is showing the spray, not the skin. It only makes it more ironic.
    Personally I don't think it even looks like a skin at all.
    Hope it have some custom voicelines at least
    Itâ€™s cuz youâ€™re right at best epic.
    Rye put effort into making a legendary when you can make an epic and call it a legendary
        rye indeed local city wok owner
        I corn hardly believe it
Probably a bug
    Yeah I checked in game, and its 100 coins, so 1$
With how many currencies are in play I am honestly impressed it took this long for a bug like this.
Worth
    2 thousand for a skin is worth yup ðŸ¤£ blizzard is ruthless but i guess dollar earning people pay for it
        2 thousand what?
            2 thousand liras (TL) because not everyone earns dollar or lives in america you know?? Idk why i got downvoted i am just telling that i aint giving my 2 weeks of salary for one skin xd
                USD is the default currency used to talk about money online and in international trade, even if you don't use it where you live. Just saying a random amount of money without context will make people confused or assume USD.

Also the "Worth" comment you responded to was most likely sarcastic and the commenter doesn't actually think a spray is worth that much money 

Cheers
                    I literally said "dollar earning people buy it", made it obvious i was talking about another curreny bruhh
I'm lost, how much is that currency worth?
    2000 lira which is 120 dollars so yeah people need to give up food to buy a skin ðŸ¤£
        2000 lira is $61 to be $120 it has to be 3,901.96 lira.
Huge difference.
            Doesnt matter no average person can afford both let alone a game but a 1 skin
    That would be $120 (aud)
        the oops spray is the most expensive as that requires 50 hero items unlocked for a single hero
