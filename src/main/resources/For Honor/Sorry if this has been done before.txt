**For Honor and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice**

*I both love and fear it at the same time D:*

But I'd take it if it means having the wolf shinobi as a guest character, or an NPC boss ala Prince of Persia
    An arena where Shinobi would actually be viable? I welcome it.
        Im pretty new and have bought and played shinobi fairly fine, in what way is he not viable?
            2 things I can think of is he is very easily interrupted, and has unreliable mixups
    And stamina is replaced by the posture system.
        JJ recovering the entire team’s posture... uh oh
    The gamemode is just carousel of death with isshin in the center killing people.
        Have you seen the guy that modded all the enemies in the game to be Isshin and randomised all the item locations? The real final boss was the 27-monkey Isshins above the poison river
            Maybe the *real* final boss was this gun I found along the way!

-Isshin, entering phase two
                27 Isshins with guns. I think I’d cry. And since they were based off the monkeys, they’d all have really low frame rates. Good god, it’d be an anime *slash* ‘you’re already dead’ scene
    Unironically would love to have the posture system.
    Sekiro in For Honor: the moment you’re out of stamina and he guard breaks or parries you, you die
    Dude, I’ve just been playing Sekiro as well. I’d love for the two to fuse, think about how awesome the gank scenes would be if you could whip out your magnetic loaded umbrella and follow up with Projected Force. Ugh, I need to see that
For honor and overwatch

Well ain this just 30 genjis

For honor and dark souls 3

*I like where this is going*
    No you can't poke with a nobushi midir. Stop it. Bad u/Noobie_xD
        *if it bleeds we can kill it*
            jokes on you midir is immune to bleed
                Jokes on you, even with enough poopy damage, anything in dark bowls dies :3.

Seroously, people that do those 30 minute barefisted fights are nuts.
                    You think that's nuts? Try the dude who did Midir bare fist with SL1 AND NG+7.
                        There's people who poop throw only to kid bosses. There's the dude that played the game using bananas as controllers. The community is beautiful.
                Is he immune to guardbreak. Just spam guardbreak and keep stabbing him in the kidney.
        Literally fighting midir right now
    For honor and bloodborne for me lol
        The souls game I like is code vain
    SAME! Hm.... It's a small world
    Football Manager/ Stardew Valley

I'm leading chickens goats and cows to a world cup victory?

For honor and pokemon.... could be a cool dark soulesque game where we hunt dangerous pokemon or a cool medieval pokemon game
    Gonna catch all the sheeps
        Just don't try to count them
    hardcore Monster Hunter
    That wouldn’t be fun. Pokémon are OP. One has an iq of 5000. Another is hotter than the surface of the sun.
Halo and GTA
    Basically the Master Chief goes around and robs banks
        or they go the spinoff route similar to odst where 3 misfits end up being drafted into some army corps...or alternatively are rebels fighting against the unsc?
For honor and Destiny. That actually might be fun
    Imagine 6 guys killing Atraks with a sword... WAIT A MINUTE.
        *Status: Incredibilis*
    [removed]
        And they are almost Immortal
    You're in the crucible

You hear a Behemoth titan shout something in angry latin and pop his super 

Koko soko starts playing

*oh no*
        Honestly if they just replaced the behemoth with a zoomin’ Cent yelling “incredibilis!” whilst punching us I wouldn’t be mad
     

Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Knights in Ashveld. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Apollyon. From what I can gather she commands the Black Stone legion from a big castle outside of Rubicon. She's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defences, take this beast out, and break their grip on Ashveld.
    Gryphon uses Felwinter’s Lie and Stasis
For honor and r6siege wont go well
    warden gets a suit and a shotgun

valkyrie gets some black eyes
        Warlord with montagne’s shield an pistol
            Warlond would be blitz, montagne would be conq
                But blitz is shit rn
                    *sad blitz main sounds*
                Nah I’m pretty sure Warden would be Warden
                    Nah, he would definetly be warden
    I prefer to think about this as a R6Seige style game with For Honor characters and settings, so there are large doors that you need Shugo to bust open, windows that shinobi can poof through, destructible walls to throw enemies through, traps that each hero can set up, etc.
        A medieval TacSim sounds like an awesome gamemode. Call it Siege and put it in the same Playlist as Breach, where you, well, _siege_ an enemy fortress, and each hero has a unique ability that helps them take control, or protect.
        "Big fucking hole coming right up"  
-Shugoki
    That sounds like a job for Tachanka

    Regardless there’s still a Valkyrie
Far cry primal and for honor, so basically the native American faction some people want.
    You mean the Vikings aren't already cavemen?
        At least the cavemen in primal have shoes and sometimes where pelts over their chest, unlike the poverty stricken cavemen in for honor.
            fuck the vikings, all my homies hate the vikings.

                There have been 34 renditions of Nobushi with cat ears, if you wanna see them all just look up Nobushi r34
For Honor and Shadow of War

Holy fuck, a nemesis system here would be really cool for arcade mode.
    A game where you play as Apollyon, rising through the ranks and choosing to kill or add heroes to your army with the SoW nemesis system would be dope, especially if it had the siege battles as well.
        I need it
        HOOK IT UP TO MY VEINS
        Even more if it had the Assassins Creed thing where you create choke points, or something new entirely where you create your own fortresses.
    I was close to having the same result, sadly I decided to play 1 game of Town of Salem before going to bed

        JJ b-hopping about to kraber your ass
            Then restoring ‘stamina’ and refilling ammo without reloading
    It makes me really happy to hear people are still playing Titanfall 2. Such an incredible game!
        Bro, apparently there's a multiplayer, or something? I've never seen it, though. Too busy playing that _campaign._
    Just replied with titanfall 2 and apex lmao
Dear God, dead by daylight and darkest dungeon... RUIN AS COME TO OUR FOG WHISPERS. Do you remember our memorable generator? Opulent and almost 1 tapped?
    I imagine the Darkest Dungeon playstyle, but the DBD killers added as bosses
Yay, a combination of Minecraft bedrock edition and Minecraft java edition!
    That’s just the OG minecraft pocket edition
Mine is for honor and jojo bizarre adventure eyes of haven

Fallout 76 and war thunder...
    So buggy as fuck and leaving me with hundreds of hours of gameplay that I question," was it really worth it" while simultaneously knowing it was for the friends and experience I made along the way.
        Or it could be "War Thunder, but in Post Apocalyptic Scrap Vehicles". So, basically Crossout, but with flight and no building.
Destiny 2 and Dark Souls 3

Gonna put a Celestial straight through Midirs head
Lol and Apex, it could be rly interesting
    [deleted]
        Everybody gangsta till shugo hits the jump pad
            Just needs to square the landing and he’ll wipe out everyone in a 2 mile radius
        While that's definitely a funny image, pretty sure LoL and Apex both dont include Conq or Shugoshugo.
Red dead and for honor boah. Parry this you dirty rat

Mordhau and Rainbow six: Siege, so basically just For Honor.
For honor and Star Wars Battle Front 2
This meme is so OLD godamn.
Like [this](https://c.files.bbci.co.uk/171A5/production/_96992649_daininjuries976.jpg), because I just got back into the game for the first time in over two years.
For honour and bloodborne….soooo just pirate?

A for honor setting but a bit like ghost recon wildlands?

Rainbow 6 and Apex. Fuse it is then
Uncharted 3 and terraria would turn out to be a very interesting combo
Skate 3 and Eso, I think that would just be dragons pulling kickflips .

Last of us part 2 and Star Wars BF2. What have I created?!
for honor and cyber punk

for honor and ghost of tsushima........I like that idea.
For Honor and Civilization 6...

So is it just Civ but not going past the medieval era? Or is it For Honor with resource elements and nukes?
Destiny 2, and Control

I just popped the biggest boner
Valheim and Kingdom Come Deliverance... Tbh I'm not sure how I feel about this. The first boss in Valheim would absolutely destroy Henry, but murdering greylings would become much more satisfying.
Cyberpunk and disco elysium. I'm not sure what to expect.
Genshin Impact and War Thunder…interesting
Fall Guys mixed with Vermintide 2... I could dig that.
Titanfall 2 and Ace Combat 7. Squadrons of titans. Instead of Rot and Gelb with Typhoons and Su-35s, we got Tones and Ions.
For honor and the walking dead saints and sinners. Intriguing

Dead Space 2 and Pajama Sam 2. I don't even know how to start imagining that.
Valhiem and pathfinder kingmaker, hmmm... would probably be really cool if valhiem had magic gear, spellcasting, and classes.

Pathfinder kingmaker however would do very poorly with valhiem mechanics. I don't imagine a turn based game would do well withbuilding mechanics.
Elite Dangerous and Valheim... thats a combination
League of Legends and Pokemon.... Sorry y'all I guess I'm responsible for Pokemon Unite
Absolver and A.O.T 2, don't know how that would work

Call of Duty and Magic the Gathering?

"Alright, in response to your Precision Airstrike I tap 2 to play Camping 12 Year Old"
For Honor and Age of Empires, doesn‘t sound too bad
Bravely default 2 and rocket league... I can’t even imagine.
Loop Hero and Bridge Builder: Portal. That’s an interesting combo.

Prominence poker and rainbowsixseige
For honor and Forza horizon... interesting
For honor and outer worlds
Skyrim and, uhhh...Animal...Crossing...

So basically Skyrim except you can actually decorate your house and have shit stay where you put it...this actually might not be so bad.

Gears 5 and For Honor
Gears of war and destiny
FH and Apex Legends. This could be interesting
For honor and battlefront 2
Rainbow Six Siege and Sea of Thieves

The toxicity would be so strong
Dude I would fucking love to see the Zenith from terraria in a far cry game, fuck or any of the cool ranged weapons in far cry
For honor and monster hunter, interesting
Fallout 4 and AC Valhalla. This’ll be interesting.
Foe honor and assassins creed 2. Hm sounds like the return of the AC event for me (seriously tho ubi please)
For honor and minecraft, polar opposites, a good balance
For Honor X Darkest Dungeon already gets dope fan art so
For Honor and Animal Crossing: New Horizons

I don't know exactly where this is going and I'm not sure if I should be excited or terrified.
Outer Worlds and Apex Legends. I’m for it.
I’d be murdering innocent creatures on a boat designed for ghost people with a giant sword
For Honor and Final Fantasy XIV. Curiously not the first time I considered this crossover, first time though involved also crossing over with LoZ: Breath of the Wild. It was a very very VERY interesting thing.

That said, for just FFXIV and For Honor, I'd totally love to play a Miqo'te kensei or a Viera Orochi.
The Doom Slayer becomes the most overpowered hero in the game.

Doom and Ghost of Tsushima, does this mean only sword and no gun?
For honor and God of war 3
For Honor and Valheim. This'll be weird
Call of Duty: Monster Hunter World War 2

I mean a FPS monster hunter could be cool but only if the guns are equally as outrageous as the original game
I wonder if anti terrorism in the Middle Ages is just witch hunts or theirs actual need for siege team
Hollow Knight and Warzone. Imagine a bunch of Hollow Knights with MP5's running around

For honor and subnautica
It was For Honor and… Brawlhalla? I don't know how that'd even work.
Rust & Warzone.... Yeah I think we would call that, PLANET WAR
Warthunder and Stardew Valley...

I gotta admit that my otherwise great imagination is having great troubles mixing these two.
Monster Hunter World and Division 2

Sigh* If only...
Apex and titanfall 2... So titanfall 3? Lol
Yakuza kiwami 2 
For honor 
XD
Mate, same
RDR2 and gear city lmao
Witcher 3 and Crusader Kings 3. 

That actually sounds good
Ghost of Tsushima and Super Mario Odyssey

Hmmm
For Honor and Crusader Kings 3  
so.. a character based grand strategy fighting game? wat

I would love to see how this would.. "work"
Skyrim and Classic Star Wars Battlefront 2

&#x200B;

I honestly have no idea how this would play out, but okay.
Diablo 3 and Halo... That's just Doom, man.
For honor and Elite Dangerous. Idek man
Dead cells and persona 5, I think joker may need to watch his head
Hunie pop and hearthstone
Apex legends and Destiny... Not really the most interresting but yeah.
these aren’t the last two games i’ve played, but i always wanted a destiny with no mans sky type game.
Skyrim and rocket league, i cant picture this
For honor and genshin...
I know what ima do now
Guilty gear and smash bros. God I wish
Valheim and Knights of the Old Republic...I could work with that
Uh...Smash Ultimate and Tetris 99?

Interesting...
Doom eternal and For Honor. That sounds fun
Animal Crossing and Kingdoms Of Amalur
God Eater 3 and Fire Emblem 3 Houses.
Arknights and Katamari Damacy, huh.

Yeah I can't even imagine this one.
For Honor and Dragon Ball FighterZ...

Now I'm just imaging characters like Kensei, Tiandi, and Warmonger doing huge ass long-winded combos in an 2.5D anime-esqe style.
Bloodborne and DayZ, I am terrified
Dark souls remastered and league of legends
Dark souls 3 and ghost of tsushima? Sounds like sekiro but not as good
For honor and Valhalla
Destiny 2 and Total War Three Kingdoms ....

 

Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cao Cao in China. So let's get to taking out his command, one by one. Cai Mao. From what I can gather he commands the Massive Fleet from an Imperial Flagship outside of Red Cliffs. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defences, take this fleet out, and break their grip on Southlands.
Destiny 2 and Pokemon, interesting
Oh no rocket league and overwatch
That’s would be a sick skin/event
For Honor and Overwatch for me, Reinhardt about to slap with some unblockable hyper Armor
Stellaris and Pokemon Go.
Europa universalis 4 and fortnite
GLAD WITH THE TRIDENT 💀💀
Rainbow Six Siege and Tetris, I don't know how I feel about that
CSGO and Valorant..........so valorant????
Fallout 4 and apex. Hmm interesting combo
For honor and gta, I don’t think this is a good idea
For Honor and Jedi Fallen order so bassically Star Wars for honor
Payday 2 and PUBG, uhhhh...

You could either loot and then rob a bank, or you could be robbing from bank to bank, and at some of the banks you meet other robber, and you fight to the death

Something like that, yeah
Destiny 2 and Cyberpunk....fuck yea
I made a Minecraft mod based on For Honor... Derailed almost instantly but still, 635 persons have heard Minecraft Steve yelling INCREDIBILIS and I find it glorious
Escape from Tarkov and Apex Legends... thatd be an interesting one for sure
For Honor and Destiny 2, interesting mix
Assassins creed oddesy and for honor, so no difference
Final fantasy 7 and Ratchet and Clank
The courier running "people" over
Red Dead 2, and for honor. Oh no
Gears of war 3 was my OG competitive game, I’d spend hours perfecting my shots and wall bounces, I was going crazy on there !
For honor and Crusader Kings 3......sounds pretty fun ngl
Spore GA and Overwatch would be interesting...
I don’t know why, but Destiny and For Honor seems like something that would totally be a guilty pleasure for me.
red dead flappy bird
Shadow of War an RDR2.
For honor and halo
Destiny 2 and Doom Eternal
For Honor and Apex Legends...
Destiny 2 and Remnant: From the Ashes.

Hell yeah.
Bloodborne and animal crossing

FUCK YEAH
Skull girls and crusader kings 3 uhhhhhh
Xcom 2 and Apex Legends? Sign me up.
Monster hunter rise (demo edition) and splatoon 2... i would be interested to see how that would turn out
Halo and Assassins Creed
For Honor and Dying Light. Need I say more.
Escape from Tarkov and Satisfactory are going to be an interesting mix.
Unfortunately stuck with mobile games due to PC out cold, but arknights and guardian tales sounds like a sweet combo
Friday the 13th and doom eternal....
For Honor and Absolver. I don’t think much changed
World of Warcraft and Endzone... maybe?
Sniper elite 4 just after rage quitting for honor
Hearts of iron IV and Fallout New Vegas
Days Gone and Fallout New Vegas. That would be very cool, not gonna lie
Halo 4 and Titanfall 2...
Man I would absolutely kill to pilot a Covenant Titan, that would kick ASS
For Honor and Ark...
Yakuza and Persona 5 what a combination
Need for speed shift and assassin's creed origins lol
Ghost Recon Wildland x Apex Legends

Wildlands but with an Apex overhaul?
Hunt show down and Rainbow six siege
For honor and rainbow six siege. So basically im stuck with two games I hate but still play daily. Two games with the most retarded dev teams that just for some reason don't die.
Um guys I got madden 21 and for honor lol
For Honor and Loop Hero.

Could be a neat rogue game, I suppose.
Doom Eternal and No Man's Sky. Oof
Hollow knight and terraria. Hmm
Ooh, GTA and For Honor
Star Wars: Squadrons and technically Warframe if you count clicking it by accident otherwise No Man's Sky, so either which way I'm flying a spaceship.
How would you mix For-Honor and Star Wars squadrons?
War hammer and cyberpunk.

So nothing in either has really changed. But I do wonder how you would play an rts/fps hybrid.
Humankind odyssey and for honor.

Yeah returning to monke for me.
For Honor and Valheim... intriguing.
For honor and ff7. Ok
Dayz and elder scrolls online
Animal Crossing & No Man's Sky....

That could be good!
An arena where Shinobi would actually be viable? I welcome it.
    Im pretty new and have bought and played shinobi fairly fine, in what way is he not viable?
        2 things I can think of is he is very easily interrupted, and has unreliable mixups
And stamina is replaced by the posture system.
    JJ recovering the entire team’s posture... uh oh
The gamemode is just carousel of death with isshin in the center killing people.
    Have you seen the guy that modded all the enemies in the game to be Isshin and randomised all the item locations? The real final boss was the 27-monkey Isshins above the poison river
        Maybe the *real* final boss was this gun I found along the way!

-Isshin, entering phase two
            27 Isshins with guns. I think I’d cry. And since they were based off the monkeys, they’d all have really low frame rates. Good god, it’d be an anime *slash* ‘you’re already dead’ scene
Unironically would love to have the posture system.
Sekiro in For Honor: the moment you’re out of stamina and he guard breaks or parries you, you die
Dude, I’ve just been playing Sekiro as well. I’d love for the two to fuse, think about how awesome the gank scenes would be if you could whip out your magnetic loaded umbrella and follow up with Projected Force. Ugh, I need to see that
Shughogki
    \*Dragon blading orochi intensifies

        jokes on you midir is immune to bleed
            Jokes on you, even with enough poopy damage, anything in dark bowls dies :3.

Seroously, people that do those 30 minute barefisted fights are nuts.
                You think that's nuts? Try the dude who did Midir bare fist with SL1 AND NG+7.
                    There's people who poop throw only to kid bosses. There's the dude that played the game using bananas as controllers. The community is beautiful.
            Is he immune to guardbreak. Just spam guardbreak and keep stabbing him in the kidney.
    Literally fighting midir right now
For honor and bloodborne for me lol

hardcore Monster Hunter
That wouldn’t be fun. Pokémon are OP. One has an iq of 5000. Another is hotter than the surface of the sun.
Basically the Master Chief goes around and robs banks
    or they go the spinoff route similar to odst where 3 misfits end up being drafted into some army corps...or alternatively are rebels fighting against the unsc?
Imagine 6 guys killing Atraks with a sword... WAIT A MINUTE.
    *Status: Incredibilis*

    And they are almost Immortal
You're in the crucible

You hear a Behemoth titan shout something in angry latin and pop his super 

Koko soko starts playing

*oh no*
    Honestly if they just replaced the behemoth with a zoomin’ Cent yelling “incredibilis!” whilst punching us I wouldn’t be mad
 

Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Knights in Ashveld. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Apollyon. From what I can gather she commands the Black Stone legion from a big castle outside of Rubicon. She's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defences, take this beast out, and break their grip on Ashveld.
Gryphon uses Felwinter’s Lie and Stasis

            Nah I’m pretty sure Warden would be Warden
                Nah, he would definetly be warden
I prefer to think about this as a R6Seige style game with For Honor characters and settings, so there are large doors that you need Shugo to bust open, windows that shinobi can poof through, destructible walls to throw enemies through, traps that each hero can set up, etc.
    A medieval TacSim sounds like an awesome gamemode. Call it Siege and put it in the same Playlist as Breach, where you, well, _siege_ an enemy fortress, and each hero has a unique ability that helps them take control, or protect.
    "Big fucking hole coming right up"

A game where you play as Apollyon, rising through the ranks and choosing to kill or add heroes to your army with the SoW nemesis system would be dope, especially if it had the siege battles as well.
    I need it
    HOOK IT UP TO MY VEINS
    Even more if it had the Assassins Creed thing where you create choke points, or something new entirely where you create your own fortresses.
I was close to having the same result, sadly I decided to play 1 game of Town of Salem before going to bed

Yes, but you have to pay hundreds of bucks for Nobushi.
Well, one game is a wonderful, open ended, unscripted and fun game, the other one is RDR2. So, hopefully a next gen rimworld.
**Tenno...**

#SKOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
Apollyon and Flowey would be great murder friends, I feel.
Actually sounds fun
Ok now I want a skin for lawbringer that it's just undyne
