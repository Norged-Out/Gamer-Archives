I swear this game is shit and good at the same time that's its trully something
    bipolar: the game

Am I the greatest in the world today? Or am I so busy scrambling to rally my team that I climb a ladder into all four of my enemies
        What are teammates?
            People who you run in to save but then run away instead of helping
                You mean those emoting bots that stay on kne point
                    Yeah, those things is that what we call them. I just call them thrash pieces, not good enough to be trash cans
            A pile of lies and secrets
    It's because this game has so much potential ,and when it's good IT'S GOOD, but it's just made by people who have no clue how to make a good game.
        Tbf no one's ever made a game like this so it's not like they had something to build off of, but also tbf this game's existed for four fucking years and you'd think by now they'd know what they're doing. They should know what works and what doesn't by now, and what the players want, but they continue to make changes that don't help the game and that no one asked for. They make good changes too, but also too many shit changes. Honestly I just want the tg changes and new hero already. Hopefully they don't fuck anything up next season
            bro thank god someone said it. whenever i say shit like this all i get are twelve year olds saying "lol you're just shit at the game lol"
                The same twelve year olds who play characters they only press R1 with.
                    exactly
            I find it particularly amusing that after three years they created a character who's sole purpose was to have incredibly high HP and trade hits with impunity. Then they slowly realized that was a poor design and rather than rebuilding, they just nerfed and nerfed until Kiri went from S to B tier.
                I feel as though Ubi's balancing rarely looks at the core issues that a certain character or moveset has, and addresses it from there, but instead uses amateurish fixes which hammer out the problems occasionally but usually just ruin the character. And either way, the core problem usually persists, and the 'fix' best case scenario is messy.

That said, I love the game and I have an immense amount of fun playing it. I don't have that many day to day complaints, either.
                    I think the big issue is it's MUCH easier to simply adjust a variable than to retool a kit.
                Hay. While hito could have used more work, B tier with ubi nerfs isn't all that bad.
Just look at Shinobi for example.
                    I have better luck with shinobi purely because nobody knows how to fight him, and his 10 meter slappings somehow don't teach people to close the gap
                    Or most assassins for that matter. 

The only ones that are even mildly successful are zerk and shaman, and shaman was nerfed really hard after S4. She used to be able to track around corners with her neck bite.
            Spittin facts
            The og devs knew what they were doing the new devs don’t play their game and don’t understand the game they play the game at a beginner level and build things with that knowledge which is legit nothing
                I cant say they did

Having playing the early days of the beta and the game it self

It was in a far worse state than its in now
                Would actually explain why they nerfed hito and jorm when neither character really needed it
                    Bruh...
                    Jorm needed the nerf to balance him more but they messed up the nerf and made him bad hito didn’t need the kick speed nerf only to switch the punish to a light for the non charged and heavy for charged her superior light wasn’t really an issue but it was spam able and people complained the devs don’t understand how to balance and those characters are the result I mean look at centi he has lost his uniqueness they nerfed shinobi to the ground nerfed  shugoki for no reason really it did nothing and they are planning a combat rework august six which will be the end of forhonor on console and will hopefully get the dev team removed
                        Bro, use punctuation. That was so hard to read.
                            I apologize, punctuation wasn’t my biggest concern there
            I agree, there needs to be more melee-combat multiplayer games so when a studio decides to do one people actually k ow what they're doing
            Time for For Honor 2??
                For glory?
                    Yes. I like that.
            It probably doesnt help UBI doesnt asign a large team to for honor due to it not being their top spot game
            *fucks up everything next season*
        I'm just stunned that no competitor has shown up.
            It's such a great concept that it's really a shame that no one else has done it
                Absolver?
                    nah that game failed to be "for honor killer"
                    Haven't played that one is it anything like for honor?
                        If for honor was open world and more about martial arts?
                            That sounds great
                                It’s an indie game though
        I mean steep was alright
        I feel the same way about War Thunder
        Bruh its ubi. Siege far cry etc. Are good games.
    You can’t get too into it (like battle royales). It will never be perfectly balanced, but I’ve never played a game this consistently for this long. I absolutely love it. Just gotta know to step away aha.
        Im 2k hours in and i constantly fucking hate playing it but id still rather play this than mordhaus combat
            I don’t get why people keep playing this game if they hate it?
                Its like a rage drug, feels good at first then its spirals down
    The Destiny paradox
    How do I get that jorm name and helm too?
        Go on pc and there should be a change flair thing on the right wen youre on the fh sub
            Cheers
    So every Ubisoft game?
I’m feeling burnt out atm just playing for daily missions and to see how many times i can recustomise one character
    You should stop playing for a bit. The daily missions only give you a little bit if steel and xp
        The dailies give you more Steel than individual contract orders though...? 500 and 300 vs the nickels and dimes.
            Well yea but i was saying that so he doesn't feel like hes missing out on a lot by not playing every day
    I feel this occasionally, too. Just stop playing for a few days, maybe a week. It sounds like you’re letting the dailies trick you into playing even though you don’t want to. Don’t let any video game do that to you.
        Nah they aren’t just one of those times, I’ve put more time into for honor than any other game and a few of my friends have pretty much gotten over it but I still enjoy it, I’ve burnt out before but I’m kinda just playing doing what ever and if I feel like I’m gonna rage or get frustrated I’m not committed enough to try n power through so I just let it be for a bit and come back later
Reflex Guard, all i have to say.
    Unpunishable bashes, all I have to say.
        Every bash should work like Valkyrie's. Confirmed GB on miss unless the basher follows up with a light or a heavy.
That way even heroes without a dodge can punish a bash.

Edit: Added heavy
            She can follow up with a heavy to (preferred option for me). It’s safer since her GB vulnerability is 100ms on chain heavies
                Yeah I should've mentioned the heavy as well. She still has options even after a miss while others just have to recover from it. But if the opponent makes the right read they get the punish. It makes the whole bash system a lot more fun and fair than it is on the others like BP or Conq who are basically safe from those who don't have a dodge attack.

And yeah that GB vuln buff to her chained heavy is godlike. I don't like mentioning it much tho because I feel like it wasn't intended. Don't want it to get nerfed :P
                    I feel it is true on Black Prior. I often miss the bash but still get a light off because people try to guard break.
                    If you make a solid read on BPs and Conqs bash, you get a Free GB. Same with Warlords too.
                        Bit how are you supposed to do that, its just guessing, you cant react! 

Entirely unrelated, this game is bad, everthing is reactable, this leads to turteling, the game needs more reads, ~~my favourite streamer said~~ thats my absolutely original opinion.

This subreddit in a nutshell.
                            Alot of people on this sub either have no idea what they talking about, or circlejerk things they hear youtuber say

Still they wouldnt be wrong about turtling. On higher levels turtling is a major problem and its a reason im getting real tired of this game. I don't wanna stare at people
            I agree but with different reasons. I like the punishable aspect AND the ability to followup with a heavy for safety to outsmart the enemy being too aggressive to punish. For this reason, I love Tiandi.
                I feel like Tiandi is everything Orochi should’ve been, minus the deflects. This is also including the lack of reflex guard since I think it’s a pretty unnecessary part of the game.
            I think the follow up light is annoying because unless you parry the light which it is simple I must be honest it’s still annoying
            Comment of the year right here. Would do so much to make the game more fun. Fighting BP and Conq is such a chore
            That ain’t a good trade tho, being punished by a heavy for missing a light&some minor stam damage. Every hero should have some answe, whether it be a dodge attack, dodge bash, or something different like with BP. 

Afaik, the heroes who have no answer to bashes are cent, shugo, hito, jorm, and warlord
            Preach man
        Non guarantee deflects, all I have to say.
        You calling BP?
            If I get hit with the light, I eat the bash. If I dodge the light I eat the bash. If I parry the light, I get a heavy, but the cycle just starts all over again.
                That’s not even his strongest mixup.

One confirmed bash by Bp puts you in a 50/50 between unreactable bash and guardbreak for either light damage and stamina pause + drain or guardbreak for heavy damage and stamina damage if they try using a dodge attack (yes most dodge attacks are too slow due to BPs frame advantage after a confirmed bash.) 

This is what I’m referring to.
                    But I never see that. Every BP I face in a duel EXCLUSIVELY does the light/bash/light combo.

I'd like to seen any other mixup, even if it is unreactable.
                        hey at least now you can actually dodge the bash if you didn't block the light in time, too bad it took them like what, 9 months to fix that?
                        Not a lot of people know how busted the bash really is.

It’s very prominent in grandmaster duels though just for how safe and strong it is.
                            I mean, I am a BP main, and ppl counter the bash fairly easy if you know what to do. First, ppl can parry the light attack and then your fucked. Second, ppl can back step dodge, and GB. Not as easy to get off, but when ppl do it... your fucked.
                                This is incorrect.

What I’m referring to isn’t a neutral bash. It’s the bash mixup after a landed bash.

bps bash light grants a very generous frame advantage to the bp, it’s the followup bash that’s strong.

It’s a 50/50 between UNREACTABLE bash or guard break. 

What you are referring to is anything from neutral. 

Getting hit by bps bash and the followup mixup isn’t neutral, it’s an entirely different mixup of its own. You cannot light attack out of this mixup unless you have a 400ms light. Dodge attacks except those with a 100ms input window are too slow but are still interrupted by a slightly delayed bash rather than a buffered bash. 

Tldr: the mixup after a landed bash from Bp is a 50/50 between buffered bash and guardbreak as the bash is unreactable and only dodged on prediction (doesn’t help that Bp still has a variable timed bash either.) basically wardens “vortex” but stronger.

Edit: also any of black priors bashes can only be guardbroken on a prediction dodge, I.e a dodge before the bash is even initiated.
                    but you can just light him out of his forward dodge
                        You cannot.

If Bp lands a bash light the following mixup is a 50/50 between unreactable bash or guard break thanks to frame advantage. 


Test it yourself, if you aren’t playing a character with a 400ms light or zone (orochi can interrupt too) the only counter is a prediction dodge attack or flip. 

Even if you dodge the bash it cannot be punished if you don’t have a dodge attack with a 100ms startup.
                            if BP does another bash after landing the previous one then you can just stuff him out of it even with a buffered 500ms light
                                Due to frame advantage anything slower than a buffered 400ms too light/zone or orochis top light/zone will be interrupted by a buffered Bp bash. Meaning if you don’t have one of those you have to play into the mixup as there is no way to counter it (buffered dodge attacks with a 100ms input timing into dodge works as well but only for some faster dodge attacks.)
                            Just dont get hit by the first bash, I promise it's fairly easy to avoid. I'll leave this link here about BP from Freeze
https://youtu.be/dlKDl4RhHJg
        My favorite one is when a warden flys past me. Gets the wrong read. And i still whiff my gb letting him get 30.or 40 if wall. 4 times in a row.
        Guardbreak. 'Nuff said.
            You forgot the /s. And This sub is filled with mindless people. F
                To be fair, theres a lot of people with some odd misconceptions about too.
    I adapted to it and now I am unable play non reflex guard characters. Fuck haha
        All I want is to be able to manually hold guard in a given direction with reflex guard. But there's no way to hold in a direction with a mouse. Feels bad.
        Reflect guard is what Orochi has, right?
            Yeah
                Orochi and shinobi are my favs
    Just give it to everyone. Why should you be able to block an attack without even holding your controller?
        HAHA that's a good point
    Reflex Guard, all or nothing
    I disagree. I like my reflex gaurd
        I only dislike reflex guard cause i honestly am doodoo at this game
    Fingers crossed they take that piece of shit mechanic out of the game with the mid season combat update
    How is reflex guard a problem?
        It just makes a character more difficult without an upside or advantage. Even if there are special moves you can do such as bleed then you are still better off with every other character, because they got the same stuff or a better moveset.
            I think the original intention was to make assassins squishier since they have deflect moves, which promote turtling. Reflex guard makes turtling harder.
            I don't understand how it's more difficult? How often do you leave your guard in place for it to matter? It honestly just seems like like fluff to me and can't say I've ever considered it to make any difference.
                Oh it makes a difference alright. I cannot even begin to describe how many times reflex guard has gotten me killed. 

I like to leave my guard top when fighting opponents such as shaolin since his top light is faster than his side lights. Reflex guard? Nah fam, no can do, you gotta move your mouse around like a crack addict. This is just one of the many many problems. Most issues arise in 1vX situations. 

Also, you cannot possibly deny that reflex guard does not make it more difficult to play the game, it is certainly not just "fluff". Gladiator and shinobi both have shorter duration reflex guard than other assassins. 
Guard switching will always cause a 100 ms window of free damage, so assassins are always at a disadvantage when being ganked. 
After every block with reflex guard you must refresh the guard since it goes back to neutral. 
You also can't keep holding left on controller to keep your guard left. This part is very very hard on mouse since you only have so much mousemat. 

These are just some of the problems with reflex guard, but there are many more.
                    My second most played is an assasin and I've never once got hit since maybe my first 2 hours in game and it being because of reflex guard. I play on PC but on controller it sounds like it's a mouse problem. It's genuinely never once affected me on controller once I figured out how it works.
                        Everything ive listed are proven bugs and problems that affect evey system. The fact that youve "never been hit" makes me thinn you're lying through your teeth or you've barely played.
                            Clearly said never been hit because of reflex guard but if you're gonna act in bad faith feel free to go elsewhere.
                                My bad, I misinterpreted what you wrote, but my point still stands.

Reflex guard serves little to no purpose, and although you may not have been negatively influenced by it, it is undeniable that giving certain characters reflex guard  serves little to no purpose in this stage of the game.

Only two assassins are considered "strong" while all others are rather weak. It is not only unfair, it is completely redundant to keep reflex guard in the game. It is a remnant of the past, and back then it served a purpose, but now it does not. 

Standardizing all guards is something I feel would positively improve the game by a rather large amount. Whether making all guards into reflex or static is a whole other discussion.
                                    >Reflex guard serves little to no purpose, and although you may not have been negatively influenced by it, it is undeniable that giving certain characters reflex guard  serves little to no purpose in this stage of the game.

Sure I agree it's pretty much just fluff at this point.

\> Only two assassins are considered "strong" while all others are rather  weak. It is not only unfair, it is completely redundant to keep reflex  guard in the game. It is a remnant of the past, and back then it served a  purpose, but now it does not.

Given from what good players say reflex guard being removed wouldn't affect balance whatsoever.

\> Standardizing all guards is something I feel would positively improve  the game by a rather large amount. Whether making all guards into reflex  or static is a whole other discussion.

This is a pretty compelling argument from a game dev point tbh standardisation is a very good thing for base mechanics. That said I wouldn't hate it if they kept it as a Beserker only feature.
        Im just bad at reinputting directional block haha
It seems as if every character has their own way of being annoying.
    Exactly. I don't think any are OP because they can all be annoying as hell if the player knows what they're doing. That being said, fuck Cent, Nobu, and Shugo in particular for me
        Fuck JJ, BP and Conq in particular for me
            Fuck anything that kills me in a way I don’t like for me in particular
                Fuck Shaman players who play her the way I play her
                    Facts tho, I pray I never meet a shaman who plays like i do
                Might as well be the motto of our community tbh
        I have hated all of those characters at one point. Then I played them and learned their timings and strategies to beat them.
            That's why I dropped my hard earned 10k steel into Cent after switching from xbox to PC. Gotta learn how to dodge that 5m punch. I swear Shugo's grab will get me every single time until I play him til I'm bored
                I don’t know why I refuse to pick up Kensei after all these years and know I’ll continue to suck against him until I do
                    I'm the same. I've only had it for <6 months, but I see no fun in kensei, and I get seriously pissed when I get outplayed by one. Maybe I'll grab a 6 pack and give it a go tonight
        What about Warden shoulder hit/GB  bullshit
            You know, I liked warden a lot early on. Still a solid choice, although I prefer raider in the vanguard group. I didn't realize how cancerous the shoulder bash was until like a week ago
        Well speaking as a nobushi main, nobushi is overly weak as shit it most situations. I do agree with cent and shugoki being annoying. Cent especially in ganks
        Fuck shaman and her hp restoring bull shit ways out of stamina" ok well i just killed my *hears shamen* welp goodbye life
        I don't like Nuxia, Aramusha, and Warlord in particular. Nuxia is basically just "here's everything you learned, fuck you. Have a good fight!" Aramusha is hard for me to counter for some reason, don't know why. And Warlord. I despise Warlord. I just can't get over his stupid hyper-armor everything spam. I hate valkyrie too.
    Ikr, when you play them or they are your teammate it's fine but when they are your opponent it suddenly becomes annoying, this goes for every single hero lmao.

Shinobi: The ultimate quarantine hero.
- Wears a face mask
- Social distancing attacks
    Shinobi is the hero of FH, promoting safe and respectful bloodshed.

Too bad he will quite literally never receive the rework he desperately needs. He could save others from death but not himself smh...
This unbalanced, glitchy, laggy excuse of a videogame remains my favorite even after 168 reps and probably over 200 hours of gameplay (excluding campaign runs).

I love the concept, the artstyle and the uniqueness of the art of battle system mixed with the goofiness of emotes, effects, meme executions and those nail-bitting moments where both teams are breaking and a true 4v4 takes place in a secluded corner of the map.

Truly an experience I cannot get anywhere else and I don't see myself stopping from playing it, despite its flaws, because For Honor is a flawed masterpiece in my eyes.

**But yeah, you're not wrong...**
    in my opinion games like for honor are the best game... skyrim is another buggy mess that comes to mind for being a great game.
        Except the bugs in Skyrim are funny instead of infuriating lol
            Well, it's not pvp, right? If it was, would it be infuriating?
    Flawed masterpiece is a perfect description of this game.
I wonder how many games I can do this with...

For honor clearly

Rainbow Six siege

Ark survival

...theres fewer then I thought
    ARK must be THE worst by like a mile though.
        Fucking gigas and their food stats to low to actually heal their 20000 hp and being better when they're wild
    War Thunder. Dear god...
        *ptsd flash backs*
    I mean that's 2 Ubi games, so there's a pattern
        Ubi does do that a lot
Tiff incoming?
    Oh yes!!! It’s only a matter of time
    What is that?
        Tiff is a moderator in this sub infamous for taking down a shitload of posts.

Inb4 tiff
The game is both amazing and shit at the same time.
The biggest reason why i think the game is shit is the lack of direction from ubi itself. As a first project, FH was meant to be a realistic medieval warfare game (basically Mordhau) with the 3 factions. But later it was changed to be an arena fighter with heroes, then they tried making it into a moba/e-sport with the wu-lin, and by this point the game is 90% fantasy, the characters look more like dark souls bosses instead of medieval warriors and there are giant snakes and ghosts and demons and firebenders and so on.

So basically, i'd say that Ubi confused itself beyond repair, and now its too late to make significant aesthetic/gameplay changes without having half of the fanbase leaving the game because of it ( take the TG changes and all the butthurt ppl about it as an example).

I think its safe to say that if they want FH to be "alive" they're better off launching a sequel already, instead of defibrilating the corpse for any longer.
    I just really don't like the magic/fantasy elements. Even stuff like a sword appearing out of nowhere for certain executions still bothers me. I'd still be playing if not for all that crap.

On a different note - I don't understand how some UI elements are still a mess (stuff like revive icons blocking fight indicators etc).
        Yes. The fucking revive icons should just be fucking transparent while you're locked on, them and the other button prompts and the healing zone symbol. I don't understand why they didn't do this when they fixed the rest of the ui. The other completely fucked thing that makes no sense to me is the goddamn lock system. How the fuck has this game existed for nearly four years and one of the most integral features to the fight system is still broken? It's literally as simple as making the right and left sticks swap you left and right (obv there'd be different buttons for pc), and swapping you to the person most directly behind you when you flicker the lock.
        Thought I was the only one
            So this is what it feels like, when doves cry!
It’s shit but it’s golden shit
Still pissed about arcade mode
    Newbie here. What really is arcade mode? I didnt buy the expansion so I cant even access it
        I'm shite and hardly play so take this with a grain of salt, but it is essentially linked duels or small sided fights. They will have various bonuses and penalties applied to mix it up a bit. There is an apparently procedurally generated story that usually makes zero sense. The difficulty can be all over the map.

To me it is such a wasted opportunity. When it was first announced I had envisioned kind of a dungeon crawl sort of thing with the larger non-duel maps, with some sort of scenario story to give it more meaning.
        You and a friend vs some AI that very much enhoy making your life a living hell. It is decent practice though.
    What's arcade mode? /s
        You vs Ai with modifiers like damage boost or low health With a chance of exclusive loot if win

It’s not really good but at least I can find crimson conquest
    I'm still pissed that arcade mode perfectly highlighted how free damage is the prime bullshit holding the game back, but somehow the community only sees free damage abuse for what it is when the bots do it.
        “Free damage”?
            Damage that can't be avoided, like parry riposte, deflect, certain class counters.  The arcade bots use and abuse them to the point where you can only beat them by playing in a very specific, tedious,and boring way.  The community agrees almost unanimously that its bullshit.

I've been making the same arguement that *moderately* skilled PC players can reach that level since the parry-into-guardbreak nightmare that was late season 1.  After which point they've basically beat the game's mechanics and opponent skill becomes fairly irrelevant.   

They claim the bots are frustratingly near-unbeatable, but when I point out that some players fight the exact same way, I'm looked at like a conspiracy theorist.
                So what? Take out parries, deflects, parry counters? None of these are “free damage”, they rely on the attacking player being countered, and every single one of these things you’ve mentioned can be avoided by pressing the feint button.

I get the point about it being unfun when the AI do it, and they do indeed input read and make it literally impossible to “fool” them, but I think the point that “the community unanimously agrees on” is the frustration with input reading and bots feinting attacks that cannot be feinted, not the AI usage of basic game mechanics. Extending the claim to players is ridiculous imo, they’re humans, and they *do* make mistakes.
                    You can't react to a parry, you have to guess that it's going to happen and plan the feint in advance.  Otherwise the other player gets their damage off just for winning a quicktime event.  It takes agency away from the attacking player and massively disincentivizes using most of the game's movesets.  When parry crutching was at its worst, all *hIGh lEVeL pLAy* players had a long list of movesets they would *never* under *any* circumstances use, because they were "risky" as in, easy to parry. Parry actively undermines the class system.


I'm not advocating that free damage abilities be removed, just that their follow ups simply be reactable.  Nuxia's deflect is great.  It can be blocked on reaction, but the nux can change its direction making it harder to react to.  Parry should remove the victim's ability to attack for about the duration of a top heavy, allowing the parryer the opportunity to attack, but not a guarantee of damage.  Use it as a momentum shift if someone is battering you, not as a godamned I-win button.

Imagine how much faster, intense, and *skill-based* fights would be if every ability had skill checks on both players?  If you could block the parry riposte, it would change the game.  You could use your whole moveset again. You wouldn't be terrified to attack when your health is low.
                        Uh yeah, guessing what the opponent is going to do is literally one of the largest points of this game, and it will become even more prevalent with the combat changes coming in August. Feints are meant to bait, not to reverse an attack, and a feint happy opponent is easily punished. About the only thing I can agree on is that parry punishes are way too high on some characters.

I’m a little confused as to why you’d defend Nuxia’s deflect when it’s one of the worst in the game. If your changes were to come through why would anyone bother deflecting if it gives the same shitty reward as a parry? If anything your proposed changes disincentivize using movesets more than the current game. Why in gods name would you want to make more things in this game reactable when we know what that meta looks like, and have been spending 3+ years trying to get away from it? Deflects are high risk high reward moves, whereas this proposed change would turn it into a high risk move with potentially no reward- what’s the point?

Just sounds like both players would be parrying each others attacks all game and blocking their riposte. No offense but this is one of the worst ideas I’ve ever heard.
                            You can't see all the new opportunities that would open up when your movesets can't be hard countered. All you can think of is "if we can't get free damage after a parry, nothing will ever die!".  You're clearly the type where, if parry just broke one day due to some glitch like the warden instakill thing that one patch, your entire playstyle would just crumble.  You wouldn't know what to do.  That's pathetic, and I clearly won't get through to you.  

Back in season 1, when I railed against parry-into-guardbreak, the most common argument was "but that's the game!".  They were so used to their easy win strat that they couldn't see past it.  You're exactly like them, and time will prove you wrong too.
                                Idk man, only one of us here is asking for the entire parry / punish system to be rebuilt to accommodate their playstyle, sounds like you’re just shit at the game honestly but go off
                                    And then you litterally reword the "but that's the game!" argument.
ill explain it in words we all understand:

onatanishio, tenebris, miserum, audaces fortuna iuvat, ad mortem inumicus.

Agreed
They crossed the line when they added a teleporting monkey man, used to be pretty grounded in a sense of realism. Now we have giant snakes in the sky, and time-bending assholes, and people glowing all colours of the rainbow.
    True. For Honor used to have a unique theme, *juust* the right line between realism and fantasy. And then they decided to water down/remove most of what made the game interesting for me.
    There was very little realism in for honor since day one
        which is why I said ''sense of realism'' it was literally how they advertised it at launch.
Shitty matchmaking (apparently it's skill based which is why  me a rep 30 is obviously being placed with heroes higher than my overall rep) and literally no balance between heroes.
Shit is shit!👇
Hilariously true, take my upvote
This "shit game" I've put in almost 2,600 hours into. Hell no it ain't perfect, but it's one of a kind and I'll be damned if there is a game that's even half of what this game is.
Doge attacks the can be fainted into another dodge attack constantly *Cough* *cough* fuck you tiandi
    Just gotta soft feint your top heavy into a top heavy.
    Throw a heavy halfway through, feint into GB if they shift into another dodge
    That's pretty easy to counter actually
I... can’t actually say that isn’t true 

Damn
I still think we need deleting fire
Just remove reflex guard and all is good
    Not trying to argue but I dont ever have an issue with it
        Well what gamemode do you play the most
            Mostly breach and some ranked duels
    You're not an assassin.  Stop playing them.
        I main glad
            That explains everything.
Nyet, game is fine.
This sub has 100% always been the worst part of the game. From the start.
I still love it because I stopped playing it daily.
Level 3 bots. All I have to say.
This meme is wrong and if you disagree I'll shinobi chain-scythe your face.
The game is fun when shit works
I fucking love it, then they change literally anything and for a solid month I'm like "unplayable"


Then I found out that theres 70 prestige thingies and my highest is at the third and I'm like FUCK ME
Unrelated but whenever I see the top picture I remember someone saying it looks like they are staging an intervention for Kensei.
Both of them arguing about the zweihander knight
I think the guardbreak mechanic is just broken and should be taken out. In some cases it can easily be replaced with stun, however it would kind of be hard with the centurion if gb was removed. I can't tell you how many times I successfully GB someone, go through the animation and then they chain off of their successful GB. When they successfully gb me and then the game says I GB them, I usually don't do anything because of surprise😂
I haven't played in a long while.  I don't hate it by any means, but it gets repetitive.  Battle Passes were a good idea implemented too late, they would have been good some time ago.

I was also in that spot where I was too good for Bots but too bad for PvP.  I can't mindgame in this game for the life of me, so feints and stopping guard breaks like decent players seem to be able to do, I couldn't do them right.  No doubt I am worse now having been gone so long.
    Battle pass should have stayed in fortnite where it belongs
All I’m saying is get your CENT to rep 8 before aug 6th that dude definitely getting nerfed
its probably the dedicated servers
When did we agree on that?!
I still appreciate that lawbringer who's about to fuckin vibecheck someone into the next life.
Honestly something we can ALL agree on every fucking hero sucks ass to fight don’t know how they did it but the made the best and worst combat as the same time
Truer memes have never been made lol
If Shugoki and Cent were in this then this picture would be perfect.
The game is good, there is just certain characters that suck to play against
I see things havent changed in the years I havent played.
I'm surprised this didn't get tiff'd

Is he feeling alright? Did anyone go check on him?
    Tiffed?
        One of the mods on this subreddit is very well known for removing memes/ criticisms from the subreddit by citing rule 4. Their name is tiff92
This is gold
Balancing. Thats all
oh hey gods
    Yo
How is the game shit?
    Its shit when you fight your opponent, their ping and the ubisoft servers all at once
no game is good
why do we still play this game
    One of a kind
Hello Gods heart, i saw this on iF
“Just don’t get hit by the first bash”

Did you just tell me to git gud? Lmao. 


Obviously everyone can just react to a bash with variable timings.
This is pretty universal in all gaming communities. It's easy to identify when there is a problem, but you've got to know a good bit about game design theory, things like Bartle's Taxonomy, skill reward balance, behavioral incentives, and such to really be able to find a root cause.
This game really does have some of the best fighting mechanics ever, but still shit. The worse part is I have no idea how to make it better.
I know why it’s shit, look in the mirror🤡
Sometimes i feel like im the only person who just loves this game. Then again i hate meta and avoid it completely
This game is not shit

The servers are
And we will never come to and agreement we’re al just gonna keep playing and complaining
This game fucking sucks!!! 

"Yes."
I got asked yesterday why I play a game that makes me angry and I- I don't know
Why is everyone so horny for FH2 when at the same time, everyone agrees that "they are shit developers and dont know anything about their game or their playerbase blabla"

How can they say that Ubi has no idea how to develop a game when those people have stuck with the game for years and had fun with it. Screw all of you ungrateful little peepees
Honestly after 280 ish hours in that game, and 330 hours in rocket league, and 100 ish hours in Destiny 2 Crucible I can defo say that my only gripe with that game is progression reward, i don't even mind only playing dominion and siege modes forever 

Like i remember staying up at 4am (during uni vacations mind you I'm not an addict lol) trying to win those last 2 rocket league matches to get to the next category (gold IIRC)

With for honor there's just nothing like that... I'm not a hard core ranked player either, i only play Crucible for Quest rewards and better Gear, but that's exactly it "progression reward" that's actually useful
Pay to win overpriced,Ubisoft
If this game was properly balanced it’d be fucking amazing.
I know the game is messed up at times but you have to appreciate that the combat system is one of, if not the best systems of all games. It's so in depth, you have to play mind games with your opponent and really think about each move or sequence of moves your gonna make. 

Unless you're Lawbringer and you get one bash then take 90-100% of their health. I don't like Lawbringer.
League of legends and for honor are both amazing bad games
Oh boi, I can already hear the Dev/FH white knights sweating above their keyboards and wright an entire essay why for honor is a good game and the devs are good and we are spoiled clueless dicks who throw shit at them, also saying that we are the reason devs dont show a lot to the community because they are afraid of oir "reactions" and we need to "learn" the game or other bullshit they can think of.
God I love this shitty community 😂
For honor players are like smokers, we know its destroying us but we do not care
Shit things about the game currently: faction "wars", steel costs, steel rewards, xp gain w/o champions buff, no separate draft mode for 1 picks and bans, current stam costs and unbalanced damage, unbalanced DLC hero kits, in game scoreboard, Minion lane in Dom, revenge, score point distribution, GBing minions, feats, ledging mechanics, unbalanced HP pools, GB vulnerabilities..

Good things about the game: fashion.
The game is alright but it has so much lost potential
You’re either playing a fun close and exciting objective-based game of dominion where you fight a mix of chaotic 2v2s, 3v3s and occasional asymmetric 2v1s; or you’re getting 4v1’d and you have every negative status effect in the game and now you’re at 2% health .00004 milliseconds before your team starts breaking. Maybe you’re playing a 1v1 against someone you can barely beat or barely beats you, but he was fun to play and you both queue up again with each other eager to try a new hero or play style; or you’re facing a sweaty 1,000 rep basement dweller who’s mastered every single frame of your attacks and is already planning what attacks you’ll use in round 3 who will spam “wow!” during the entirety of his execution.
What if......it simply wasnt
Reflex guard and light spamming orochi cucks
I haven't played in a long ass time, I actually quit when that one cool dude stopped doing the live community streams and handed it over to the awkward dude with really cringe-like social skills.  I was planning on trying to come back but is it true that there have literally be no new characters or anything announced since Marching Fire or w/e it is was announced? *EDIT* Looking for a reason to come back here, please gimme some knowledge.
    We have gotten four heroes, that can be male or female, after Marching Fire was released. A good sword and shield knight, a now mediocre maskari samurai, a hammer viking that is only good in team modes, and a qiang dao wu lin that is ok only in teammodes. 

But the knight is edgy as they can possibly be, the samurai sounds like she eats cigars for dinner, the viking likes to take away your ability to have children, and the Wu lin is prone to getting parried a lot
Clearly, this game is shit because you can only bring 4 executions and 2 emotes with you.

I want to bring way more into the game!

I NEED an emote wheel

And the ability to assign multiple executions to the same button, then when you execute someone, it'll select one of the assigned executions at random
This post could have been: why emote spamming is gold
Which emote spamming is gold
Revenge.
    You like ganking people, don’t you?
        No lil boi I get ganked all the time thank you very much it’s no skill and prolly what your custom to but not me...
            Yeah getting ganked is what I’m used to most the time, which is why I love revenge and I think it’s perfectly balanced as all things should be.
                You clearly aren’t the same skill as me if you think that ..
                    Care to elaborate what’s so bad about it? I want to know what you think.

    Lightspam is a playstyle created by parry.  Suffer the storm you helped create, *warden*.
        I don’t do that aids bash light spam. I mostly use heavies and feigning. It’s more honorable.
You all should really be ashamed of yourself thinking that way! A disgrace to any gaming community. This game is great and is not only made of potential as many of you say. If you think that way then stop bothering people like us who enjoy that game. This toxic behaviour is beyond comparison and this meme has to die for good.

By all that is good: Stop hating the game
Any Viking character, except maybe Valk make the game pretty shitty, fight me
    Care to explain?
        Two words, hyper armor
            Hyper armour OP? You must think Shugoki is top tier then. XD
            So four. That are all easily punishable
            I see where you're coming from
    Raider used to be too good compared to others so he had to be toned down a little, he's fine now after the nerfs (idk why did they feel the need to delete the stun but i guess only epic parry man gets a decent stun)

Warlord only should have his charge changed so friendly attacks interrupt it, other than that he's ok

Zerker just forces a lot of reads and that's it, he doesn't even have a bash

Highlander in his current state is a complete joke but if people don't dodge roll everything he does he's pretty good 

Shaman bite gank is busted but so is the nature of coordinated ganks, other than that maybe her bite deals too much damage but she's fine

Jorm can go fuck himself i'm not gonna defend him

&#x200B;

Most knights are really unfun to fight though
    Vikings really dont have many BS mechanics with their characters. All of them are fairly manageable once you learn their movesets.
Can we stop being a shitty self depricating community for once
bipolar: the game

Am I the greatest in the world today? Or am I so busy scrambling to rally my team that I climb a ladder into all four of my enemies
    What are teammates?
        People who you run in to save but then run away instead of helping
            You mean those emoting bots that stay on kne point
                Yeah, those things is that what we call them. I just call them thrash pieces, not good enough to be trash cans
        A pile of lies and secrets
It's because this game has so much potential ,and when it's good IT'S GOOD, but it's just made by people who have no clue how to make a good game.
    Tbf no one's ever made a game like this so it's not like they had something to build off of, but also tbf this game's existed for four fucking years and you'd think by now they'd know what they're doing. They should know what works and what doesn't by now, and what the players want, but they continue to make changes that don't help the game and that no one asked for. They make good changes too, but also too many shit changes. Honestly I just want the tg changes and new hero already. Hopefully they don't fuck anything up next season
        bro thank god someone said it. whenever i say shit like this all i get are twelve year olds saying "lol you're just shit at the game lol"
            The same twelve year olds who play characters they only press R1 with.
                exactly
        I find it particularly amusing that after three years they created a character who's sole purpose was to have incredibly high HP and trade hits with impunity. Then they slowly realized that was a poor design and rather than rebuilding, they just nerfed and nerfed until Kiri went from S to B tier.
            I feel as though Ubi's balancing rarely looks at the core issues that a certain character or moveset has, and addresses it from there, but instead uses amateurish fixes which hammer out the problems occasionally but usually just ruin the character. And either way, the core problem usually persists, and the 'fix' best case scenario is messy.

That said, I love the game and I have an immense amount of fun playing it. I don't have that many day to day complaints, either.
                I think the big issue is it's MUCH easier to simply adjust a variable than to retool a kit.
            Hay. While hito could have used more work, B tier with ubi nerfs isn't all that bad.
Just look at Shinobi for example.
                I have better luck with shinobi purely because nobody knows how to fight him, and his 10 meter slappings somehow don't teach people to close the gap
                Or most assassins for that matter. 

The only ones that are even mildly successful are zerk and shaman, and shaman was nerfed really hard after S4. She used to be able to track around corners with her neck bite.
        Spittin facts
        The og devs knew what they were doing the new devs don’t play their game and don’t understand the game they play the game at a beginner level and build things with that knowledge which is legit nothing
            I cant say they did

Having playing the early days of the beta and the game it self

It was in a far worse state than its in now
            Would actually explain why they nerfed hito and jorm when neither character really needed it
                Bruh...
                Jorm needed the nerf to balance him more but they messed up the nerf and made him bad hito didn’t need the kick speed nerf only to switch the punish to a light for the non charged and heavy for charged her superior light wasn’t really an issue but it was spam able and people complained the devs don’t understand how to balance and those characters are the result I mean look at centi he has lost his uniqueness they nerfed shinobi to the ground nerfed  shugoki for no reason really it did nothing and they are planning a combat rework august six which will be the end of forhonor on console and will hopefully get the dev team removed
                    Bro, use punctuation. That was so hard to read.
                        I apologize, punctuation wasn’t my biggest concern there
        I agree, there needs to be more melee-combat multiplayer games so when a studio decides to do one people actually k ow what they're doing
        Time for For Honor 2??
            For glory?
                Yes. I like that.
        It probably doesnt help UBI doesnt asign a large team to for honor due to it not being their top spot game
        *fucks up everything next season*
    I'm just stunned that no competitor has shown up.
        It's such a great concept that it's really a shame that no one else has done it
            Absolver?
                nah that game failed to be "for honor killer"
                Haven't played that one is it anything like for honor?
                    If for honor was open world and more about martial arts?
                        That sounds great
                            It’s an indie game though
    I mean steep was alright
    I feel the same way about War Thunder
    Bruh its ubi. Siege far cry etc. Are good games.
You can’t get too into it (like battle royales). It will never be perfectly balanced, but I’ve never played a game this consistently for this long. I absolutely love it. Just gotta know to step away aha.
    Im 2k hours in and i constantly fucking hate playing it but id still rather play this than mordhaus combat
        I don’t get why people keep playing this game if they hate it?
            Its like a rage drug, feels good at first then its spirals down

How do I get that jorm name and helm too?
    Go on pc and there should be a change flair thing on the right wen youre on the fh sub
        Cheers
So every Ubisoft game?
You should stop playing for a bit. The daily missions only give you a little bit if steel and xp
    The dailies give you more Steel than individual contract orders though...? 500 and 300 vs the nickels and dimes.
        Well yea but i was saying that so he doesn't feel like hes missing out on a lot by not playing every day
I feel this occasionally, too. Just stop playing for a few days, maybe a week. It sounds like you’re letting the dailies trick you into playing even though you don’t want to. Don’t let any video game do that to you.
    Nah they aren’t just one of those times, I’ve put more time into for honor than any other game and a few of my friends have pretty much gotten over it but I still enjoy it, I’ve burnt out before but I’m kinda just playing doing what ever and if I feel like I’m gonna rage or get frustrated I’m not committed enough to try n power through so I just let it be for a bit and come back later
Unpunishable bashes, all I have to say.
    Every bash should work like Valkyrie's. Confirmed GB on miss unless the basher follows up with a light or a heavy.
That way even heroes without a dodge can punish a bash.

Edit: Added heavy
        She can follow up with a heavy to (preferred option for me). It’s safer since her GB vulnerability is 100ms on chain heavies
            Yeah I should've mentioned the heavy as well. She still has options even after a miss while others just have to recover from it. But if the opponent makes the right read they get the punish. It makes the whole bash system a lot more fun and fair than it is on the others like BP or Conq who are basically safe from those who don't have a dodge attack.

And yeah that GB vuln buff to her chained heavy is godlike. I don't like mentioning it much tho because I feel like it wasn't intended. Don't want it to get nerfed :P
                I feel it is true on Black Prior. I often miss the bash but still get a light off because people try to guard break.
                If you make a solid read on BPs and Conqs bash, you get a Free GB. Same with Warlords too.
                    Bit how are you supposed to do that, its just guessing, you cant react! 

Entirely unrelated, this game is bad, everthing is reactable, this leads to turteling, the game needs more reads, ~~my favourite streamer said~~ thats my absolutely original opinion.

This subreddit in a nutshell.
                        Alot of people on this sub either have no idea what they talking about, or circlejerk things they hear youtuber say

Still they wouldnt be wrong about turtling. On higher levels turtling is a major problem and its a reason im getting real tired of this game. I don't wanna stare at people
        I agree but with different reasons. I like the punishable aspect AND the ability to followup with a heavy for safety to outsmart the enemy being too aggressive to punish. For this reason, I love Tiandi.
            I feel like Tiandi is everything Orochi should’ve been, minus the deflects. This is also including the lack of reflex guard since I think it’s a pretty unnecessary part of the game.
        I think the follow up light is annoying because unless you parry the light which it is simple I must be honest it’s still annoying
        Comment of the year right here. Would do so much to make the game more fun. Fighting BP and Conq is such a chore
        That ain’t a good trade tho, being punished by a heavy for missing a light&some minor stam damage. Every hero should have some answe, whether it be a dodge attack, dodge bash, or something different like with BP. 

Afaik, the heroes who have no answer to bashes are cent, shugo, hito, jorm, and warlord
        Preach man
    Non guarantee deflects, all I have to say.
    You calling BP?
        If I get hit with the light, I eat the bash. If I dodge the light I eat the bash. If I parry the light, I get a heavy, but the cycle just starts all over again.
            That’s not even his strongest mixup.

One confirmed bash by Bp puts you in a 50/50 between unreactable bash and guardbreak for either light damage and stamina pause + drain or guardbreak for heavy damage and stamina damage if they try using a dodge attack (yes most dodge attacks are too slow due to BPs frame advantage after a confirmed bash.) 

This is what I’m referring to.
                But I never see that. Every BP I face in a duel EXCLUSIVELY does the light/bash/light combo.

I'd like to seen any other mixup, even if it is unreactable.
                    hey at least now you can actually dodge the bash if you didn't block the light in time, too bad it took them like what, 9 months to fix that?
                    Not a lot of people know how busted the bash really is.

It’s very prominent in grandmaster duels though just for how safe and strong it is.
                        I mean, I am a BP main, and ppl counter the bash fairly easy if you know what to do. First, ppl can parry the light attack and then your fucked. Second, ppl can back step dodge, and GB. Not as easy to get off, but when ppl do it... your fucked.
                            This is incorrect.

What I’m referring to isn’t a neutral bash. It’s the bash mixup after a landed bash.

bps bash light grants a very generous frame advantage to the bp, it’s the followup bash that’s strong.

It’s a 50/50 between UNREACTABLE bash or guard break. 

What you are referring to is anything from neutral. 

Getting hit by bps bash and the followup mixup isn’t neutral, it’s an entirely different mixup of its own. You cannot light attack out of this mixup unless you have a 400ms light. Dodge attacks except those with a 100ms input window are too slow but are still interrupted by a slightly delayed bash rather than a buffered bash. 

Tldr: the mixup after a landed bash from Bp is a 50/50 between buffered bash and guardbreak as the bash is unreactable and only dodged on prediction (doesn’t help that Bp still has a variable timed bash either.) basically wardens “vortex” but stronger.

Edit: also any of black priors bashes can only be guardbroken on a prediction dodge, I.e a dodge before the bash is even initiated.
                but you can just light him out of his forward dodge
                    You cannot.

If Bp lands a bash light the following mixup is a 50/50 between unreactable bash or guard break thanks to frame advantage. 


Test it yourself, if you aren’t playing a character with a 400ms light or zone (orochi can interrupt too) the only counter is a prediction dodge attack or flip. 

Even if you dodge the bash it cannot be punished if you don’t have a dodge attack with a 100ms startup.
                        if BP does another bash after landing the previous one then you can just stuff him out of it even with a buffered 500ms light
                            Due to frame advantage anything slower than a buffered 400ms too light/zone or orochis top light/zone will be interrupted by a buffered Bp bash. Meaning if you don’t have one of those you have to play into the mixup as there is no way to counter it (buffered dodge attacks with a 100ms input timing into dodge works as well but only for some faster dodge attacks.)
                        Just dont get hit by the first bash, I promise it's fairly easy to avoid. I'll leave this link here about BP from Freeze

    My favorite one is when a warden flys past me. Gets the wrong read. And i still whiff my gb letting him get 30.or 40 if wall. 4 times in a row.
    Guardbreak. 'Nuff said.
        You forgot the /s. And This sub is filled with mindless people. F
            To be fair, theres a lot of people with some odd misconceptions about too.
I adapted to it and now I am unable play non reflex guard characters. Fuck haha
    All I want is to be able to manually hold guard in a given direction with reflex guard. But there's no way to hold in a direction with a mouse. Feels bad.
    Reflect guard is what Orochi has, right?
        Yeah
            Orochi and shinobi are my favs
Just give it to everyone. Why should you be able to block an attack without even holding your controller?
    HAHA that's a good point
Reflex Guard, all or nothing
I disagree. I like my reflex gaurd
    I only dislike reflex guard cause i honestly am doodoo at this game
Fingers crossed they take that piece of shit mechanic out of the game with the mid season combat update
How is reflex guard a problem?
    It just makes a character more difficult without an upside or advantage. Even if there are special moves you can do such as bleed then you are still better off with every other character, because they got the same stuff or a better moveset.
        I think the original intention was to make assassins squishier since they have deflect moves, which promote turtling. Reflex guard makes turtling harder.
        I don't understand how it's more difficult? How often do you leave your guard in place for it to matter? It honestly just seems like like fluff to me and can't say I've ever considered it to make any difference.
            Oh it makes a difference alright. I cannot even begin to describe how many times reflex guard has gotten me killed. 

I like to leave my guard top when fighting opponents such as shaolin since his top light is faster than his side lights. Reflex guard? Nah fam, no can do, you gotta move your mouse around like a crack addict. This is just one of the many many problems. Most issues arise in 1vX situations. 

Also, you cannot possibly deny that reflex guard does not make it more difficult to play the game, it is certainly not just "fluff". Gladiator and shinobi both have shorter duration reflex guard than other assassins. 
Guard switching will always cause a 100 ms window of free damage, so assassins are always at a disadvantage when being ganked. 
After every block with reflex guard you must refresh the guard since it goes back to neutral. 
You also can't keep holding left on controller to keep your guard left. This part is very very hard on mouse since you only have so much mousemat. 

These are just some of the problems with reflex guard, but there are many more.
                My second most played is an assasin and I've never once got hit since maybe my first 2 hours in game and it being because of reflex guard. I play on PC but on controller it sounds like it's a mouse problem. It's genuinely never once affected me on controller once I figured out how it works.
                    Everything ive listed are proven bugs and problems that affect evey system. The fact that youve "never been hit" makes me thinn you're lying through your teeth or you've barely played.
                        Clearly said never been hit because of reflex guard but if you're gonna act in bad faith feel free to go elsewhere.
                            My bad, I misinterpreted what you wrote, but my point still stands.

Reflex guard serves little to no purpose, and although you may not have been negatively influenced by it, it is undeniable that giving certain characters reflex guard  serves little to no purpose in this stage of the game.

Only two assassins are considered "strong" while all others are rather weak. It is not only unfair, it is completely redundant to keep reflex guard in the game. It is a remnant of the past, and back then it served a purpose, but now it does not. 

Standardizing all guards is something I feel would positively improve the game by a rather large amount. Whether making all guards into reflex or static is a whole other discussion.
                                >Reflex guard serves little to no purpose, and although you may not have been negatively influenced by it, it is undeniable that giving certain characters reflex guard  serves little to no purpose in this stage of the game.

Sure I agree it's pretty much just fluff at this point.

\> Only two assassins are considered "strong" while all others are rather  weak. It is not only unfair, it is completely redundant to keep reflex  guard in the game. It is a remnant of the past, and back then it served a  purpose, but now it does not.

Given from what good players say reflex guard being removed wouldn't affect balance whatsoever.

\> Standardizing all guards is something I feel would positively improve  the game by a rather large amount. Whether making all guards into reflex  or static is a whole other discussion.

This is a pretty compelling argument from a game dev point tbh standardisation is a very good thing for base mechanics. That said I wouldn't hate it if they kept it as a Beserker only feature.
    Im just bad at reinputting directional block haha
Exactly. I don't think any are OP because they can all be annoying as hell if the player knows what they're doing. That being said, fuck Cent, Nobu, and Shugo in particular for me
    Fuck JJ, BP and Conq in particular for me
        Fuck anything that kills me in a way I don’t like for me in particular
            Fuck Shaman players who play her the way I play her
                Facts tho, I pray I never meet a shaman who plays like i do
            Might as well be the motto of our community tbh
    I have hated all of those characters at one point. Then I played them and learned their timings and strategies to beat them.
        That's why I dropped my hard earned 10k steel into Cent after switching from xbox to PC. Gotta learn how to dodge that 5m punch. I swear Shugo's grab will get me every single time until I play him til I'm bored
            I don’t know why I refuse to pick up Kensei after all these years and know I’ll continue to suck against him until I do
                I'm the same. I've only had it for <6 months, but I see no fun in kensei, and I get seriously pissed when I get outplayed by one. Maybe I'll grab a 6 pack and give it a go tonight
    What about Warden shoulder hit/GB  bullshit
        You know, I liked warden a lot early on. Still a solid choice, although I prefer raider in the vanguard group. I didn't realize how cancerous the shoulder bash was until like a week ago
    Well speaking as a nobushi main, nobushi is overly weak as shit it most situations. I do agree with cent and shugoki being annoying. Cent especially in ganks
    Fuck shaman and her hp restoring bull shit ways out of stamina" ok well i just killed my *hears shamen* welp goodbye life
    I don't like Nuxia, Aramusha, and Warlord in particular. Nuxia is basically just "here's everything you learned, fuck you. Have a good fight!" Aramusha is hard for me to counter for some reason, don't know why. And Warlord. I despise Warlord. I just can't get over his stupid hyper-armor everything spam. I hate valkyrie too.
Ikr, when you play them or they are your teammate it's fine but when they are your opponent it suddenly becomes annoying, this goes for every single hero lmao.

Shinobi is the hero of FH, promoting safe and respectful bloodshed.

Too bad he will quite literally never receive the rework he desperately needs. He could save others from death but not himself smh...
in my opinion games like for honor are the best game... skyrim is another buggy mess that comes to mind for being a great game.
    Except the bugs in Skyrim are funny instead of infuriating lol
        Well, it's not pvp, right? If it was, would it be infuriating?
Flawed masterpiece is a perfect description of this game.
ARK must be THE worst by like a mile though.
    Fucking gigas and their food stats to low to actually heal their 20000 hp and being better when they're wild

    Im no maso...*looks at my nobushi play time* okay maybe you are onto something
I just really don't like the magic/fantasy elements. Even stuff like a sword appearing out of nowhere for certain executions still bothers me. I'd still be playing if not for all that crap.

On a different note - I don't understand how some UI elements are still a mess (stuff like revive icons blocking fight indicators etc).
    Yes. The fucking revive icons should just be fucking transparent while you're locked on, them and the other button prompts and the healing zone symbol. I don't understand why they didn't do this when they fixed the rest of the ui. The other completely fucked thing that makes no sense to me is the goddamn lock system. How the fuck has this game existed for nearly four years and one of the most integral features to the fight system is still broken? It's literally as simple as making the right and left sticks swap you left and right (obv there'd be different buttons for pc), and swapping you to the person most directly behind you when you flicker the lock.
    Thought I was the only one
        So this is what it feels like, when doves cry!
Newbie here. What really is arcade mode? I didnt buy the expansion so I cant even access it
    I'm shite and hardly play so take this with a grain of salt, but it is essentially linked duels or small sided fights. They will have various bonuses and penalties applied to mix it up a bit. There is an apparently procedurally generated story that usually makes zero sense. The difficulty can be all over the map.

To me it is such a wasted opportunity. When it was first announced I had envisioned kind of a dungeon crawl sort of thing with the larger non-duel maps, with some sort of scenario story to give it more meaning.
    You and a friend vs some AI that very much enhoy making your life a living hell. It is decent practice though.
What's arcade mode? /s
    You vs Ai with modifiers like damage boost or low health With a chance of exclusive loot if win

It’s not really good but at least I can find crimson conquest
I'm still pissed that arcade mode perfectly highlighted how free damage is the prime bullshit holding the game back, but somehow the community only sees free damage abuse for what it is when the bots do it.
    “Free damage”?
        Damage that can't be avoided, like parry riposte, deflect, certain class counters.  The arcade bots use and abuse them to the point where you can only beat them by playing in a very specific, tedious,and boring way.  The community agrees almost unanimously that its bullshit.

I've been making the same arguement that *moderately* skilled PC players can reach that level since the parry-into-guardbreak nightmare that was late season 1.  After which point they've basically beat the game's mechanics and opponent skill becomes fairly irrelevant.   

They claim the bots are frustratingly near-unbeatable, but when I point out that some players fight the exact same way, I'm looked at like a conspiracy theorist.
            So what? Take out parries, deflects, parry counters? None of these are “free damage”, they rely on the attacking player being countered, and every single one of these things you’ve mentioned can be avoided by pressing the feint button.

I get the point about it being unfun when the AI do it, and they do indeed input read and make it literally impossible to “fool” them, but I think the point that “the community unanimously agrees on” is the frustration with input reading and bots feinting attacks that cannot be feinted, not the AI usage of basic game mechanics. Extending the claim to players is ridiculous imo, they’re humans, and they *do* make mistakes.
                You can't react to a parry, you have to guess that it's going to happen and plan the feint in advance.  Otherwise the other player gets their damage off just for winning a quicktime event.  It takes agency away from the attacking player and massively disincentivizes using most of the game's movesets.  When parry crutching was at its worst, all *hIGh lEVeL pLAy* players had a long list of movesets they would *never* under *any* circumstances use, because they were "risky" as in, easy to parry. Parry actively undermines the class system.


I'm not advocating that free damage abilities be removed, just that their follow ups simply be reactable.  Nuxia's deflect is great.  It can be blocked on reaction, but the nux can change its direction making it harder to react to.  Parry should remove the victim's ability to attack for about the duration of a top heavy, allowing the parryer the opportunity to attack, but not a guarantee of damage.  Use it as a momentum shift if someone is battering you, not as a godamned I-win button.

Imagine how much faster, intense, and *skill-based* fights would be if every ability had skill checks on both players?  If you could block the parry riposte, it would change the game.  You could use your whole moveset again. You wouldn't be terrified to attack when your health is low.
                    Uh yeah, guessing what the opponent is going to do is literally one of the largest points of this game, and it will become even more prevalent with the combat changes coming in August. Feints are meant to bait, not to reverse an attack, and a feint happy opponent is easily punished. About the only thing I can agree on is that parry punishes are way too high on some characters.

I’m a little confused as to why you’d defend Nuxia’s deflect when it’s one of the worst in the game. If your changes were to come through why would anyone bother deflecting if it gives the same shitty reward as a parry? If anything your proposed changes disincentivize using movesets more than the current game. Why in gods name would you want to make more things in this game reactable when we know what that meta looks like, and have been spending 3+ years trying to get away from it? Deflects are high risk high reward moves, whereas this proposed change would turn it into a high risk move with potentially no reward- what’s the point?

Just sounds like both players would be parrying each others attacks all game and blocking their riposte. No offense but this is one of the worst ideas I’ve ever heard.
                        You can't see all the new opportunities that would open up when your movesets can't be hard countered. All you can think of is "if we can't get free damage after a parry, nothing will ever die!".  You're clearly the type where, if parry just broke one day due to some glitch like the warden instakill thing that one patch, your entire playstyle would just crumble.  You wouldn't know what to do.  That's pathetic, and I clearly won't get through to you.  

Back in season 1, when I railed against parry-into-guardbreak, the most common argument was "but that's the game!".  They were so used to their easy win strat that they couldn't see past it.  You're exactly like them, and time will prove you wrong too.
                            Idk man, only one of us here is asking for the entire parry / punish system to be rebuilt to accommodate their playstyle, sounds like you’re just shit at the game honestly but go off
                                And then you litterally reword the "but that's the game!" argument.
You missed

incredibilis yeah a 50/50 crutch like hitokiris.
True. For Honor used to have a unique theme, *juust* the right line between realism and fantasy. And then they decided to water down/remove most of what made the game interesting for me.
There was very little realism in for honor since day one
    which is why I said ''sense of realism'' it was literally how they advertised it at launch.
Just gotta soft feint your top heavy into a top heavy.
Throw a heavy halfway through, feint into GB if they shift into another dodge
That's pretty easy to counter actually
Not trying to argue but I dont ever have an issue with it
    Well what gamemode do you play the most
        Mostly breach and some ranked duels
You're not an assassin.  Stop playing them.
    I main glad
        That explains everything.

We have gotten four heroes, that can be male or female, after Marching Fire was released. A good sword and shield knight, a now mediocre maskari samurai, a hammer viking that is only good in team modes, and a qiang dao wu lin that is ok only in teammodes. 

But the knight is edgy as they can possibly be, the samurai sounds like she eats cigars for dinner, the viking likes to take away your ability to have children, and the Wu lin is prone to getting parried a lot
You like ganking people, don’t you?
    No lil boi I get ganked all the time thank you very much it’s no skill and prolly what your custom to but not me...
        Yeah getting ganked is what I’m used to most the time, which is why I love revenge and I think it’s perfectly balanced as all things should be.
            You clearly aren’t the same skill as me if you think that ..
                Care to elaborate what’s so bad about it? I want to know what you think.

Lightspam is a playstyle created by parry.  Suffer the storm you helped create, *warden*.
    I don’t do that aids bash light spam. I mostly use heavies and feigning. It’s more honorable.
Care to explain?
    Two words, hyper armor
        Hyper armour OP? You must think Shugoki is top tier then. XD
        So four. That are all easily punishable
        I see where you're coming from
Raider used to be too good compared to others so he had to be toned down a little, he's fine now after the nerfs (idk why did they feel the need to delete the stun but i guess only epic parry man gets a decent stun)

Warlord only should have his charge changed so friendly attacks interrupt it, other than that he's ok

Zerker just forces a lot of reads and that's it, he doesn't even have a bash

Highlander in his current state is a complete joke but if people don't dodge roll everything he does he's pretty good 

Shaman bite gank is busted but so is the nature of coordinated ganks, other than that maybe her bite deals too much damage but she's fine

Jorm can go fuck himself i'm not gonna defend him

&#x200B;

Most knights are really unfun to fight though
Vikings really dont have many BS mechanics with their characters. All of them are fairly manageable once you learn their movesets.
What are teammates?
    People who you run in to save but then run away instead of helping
        You mean those emoting bots that stay on kne point
            Yeah, those things is that what we call them. I just call them thrash pieces, not good enough to be trash cans
    A pile of lies and secrets
Tbf no one's ever made a game like this so it's not like they had something to build off of, but also tbf this game's existed for four fucking years and you'd think by now they'd know what they're doing. They should know what works and what doesn't by now, and what the players want, but they continue to make changes that don't help the game and that no one asked for. They make good changes too, but also too many shit changes. Honestly I just want the tg changes and new hero already. Hopefully they don't fuck anything up next season
    bro thank god someone said it. whenever i say shit like this all i get are twelve year olds saying "lol you're just shit at the game lol"
        The same twelve year olds who play characters they only press R1 with.
            exactly
    I find it particularly amusing that after three years they created a character who's sole purpose was to have incredibly high HP and trade hits with impunity. Then they slowly realized that was a poor design and rather than rebuilding, they just nerfed and nerfed until Kiri went from S to B tier.
        I feel as though Ubi's balancing rarely looks at the core issues that a certain character or moveset has, and addresses it from there, but instead uses amateurish fixes which hammer out the problems occasionally but usually just ruin the character. And either way, the core problem usually persists, and the 'fix' best case scenario is messy.

That said, I love the game and I have an immense amount of fun playing it. I don't have that many day to day complaints, either.
            I think the big issue is it's MUCH easier to simply adjust a variable than to retool a kit.
        Hay. While hito could have used more work, B tier with ubi nerfs isn't all that bad.
Just look at Shinobi for example.
            I have better luck with shinobi purely because nobody knows how to fight him, and his 10 meter slappings somehow don't teach people to close the gap
            Or most assassins for that matter. 

The only ones that are even mildly successful are zerk and shaman, and shaman was nerfed really hard after S4. She used to be able to track around corners with her neck bite.
    Spittin facts
    The og devs knew what they were doing the new devs don’t play their game and don’t understand the game they play the game at a beginner level and build things with that knowledge which is legit nothing
        I cant say they did

Having playing the early days of the beta and the game it self

It was in a far worse state than its in now
        Would actually explain why they nerfed hito and jorm when neither character really needed it
            Bruh...
            Jorm needed the nerf to balance him more but they messed up the nerf and made him bad hito didn’t need the kick speed nerf only to switch the punish to a light for the non charged and heavy for charged her superior light wasn’t really an issue but it was spam able and people complained the devs don’t understand how to balance and those characters are the result I mean look at centi he has lost his uniqueness they nerfed shinobi to the ground nerfed  shugoki for no reason really it did nothing and they are planning a combat rework august six which will be the end of forhonor on console and will hopefully get the dev team removed
                Bro, use punctuation. That was so hard to read.
                    I apologize, punctuation wasn’t my biggest concern there
    I agree, there needs to be more melee-combat multiplayer games so when a studio decides to do one people actually k ow what they're doing
    Time for For Honor 2??
        For glory?
            Yes. I like that.
    It probably doesnt help UBI doesnt asign a large team to for honor due to it not being their top spot game
    *fucks up everything next season*
I'm just stunned that no competitor has shown up.
    It's such a great concept that it's really a shame that no one else has done it
        Absolver?
            nah that game failed to be "for honor killer"
            Haven't played that one is it anything like for honor?
                If for honor was open world and more about martial arts?
                    That sounds great
                        It’s an indie game though
I mean steep was alright
I feel the same way about War Thunder
Bruh its ubi. Siege far cry etc. Are good games.
Im 2k hours in and i constantly fucking hate playing it but id still rather play this than mordhaus combat
    I don’t get why people keep playing this game if they hate it?
        Its like a rage drug, feels good at first then its spirals down
Go on pc and there should be a change flair thing on the right wen youre on the fh sub
    Cheers
The dailies give you more Steel than individual contract orders though...? 500 and 300 vs the nickels and dimes.
    Well yea but i was saying that so he doesn't feel like hes missing out on a lot by not playing every day
Nah they aren’t just one of those times, I’ve put more time into for honor than any other game and a few of my friends have pretty much gotten over it but I still enjoy it, I’ve burnt out before but I’m kinda just playing doing what ever and if I feel like I’m gonna rage or get frustrated I’m not committed enough to try n power through so I just let it be for a bit and come back later
Every bash should work like Valkyrie's. Confirmed GB on miss unless the basher follows up with a light or a heavy.
That way even heroes without a dodge can punish a bash.

Edit: Added heavy
    She can follow up with a heavy to (preferred option for me). It’s safer since her GB vulnerability is 100ms on chain heavies
        Yeah I should've mentioned the heavy as well. She still has options even after a miss while others just have to recover from it. But if the opponent makes the right read they get the punish. It makes the whole bash system a lot more fun and fair than it is on the others like BP or Conq who are basically safe from those who don't have a dodge attack.

And yeah that GB vuln buff to her chained heavy is godlike. I don't like mentioning it much tho because I feel like it wasn't intended. Don't want it to get nerfed :P
            I feel it is true on Black Prior. I often miss the bash but still get a light off because people try to guard break.
            If you make a solid read on BPs and Conqs bash, you get a Free GB. Same with Warlords too.
                Bit how are you supposed to do that, its just guessing, you cant react! 

Entirely unrelated, this game is bad, everthing is reactable, this leads to turteling, the game needs more reads, ~~my favourite streamer said~~ thats my absolutely original opinion.

This subreddit in a nutshell.
                    Alot of people on this sub either have no idea what they talking about, or circlejerk things they hear youtuber say

Still they wouldnt be wrong about turtling. On higher levels turtling is a major problem and its a reason im getting real tired of this game. I don't wanna stare at people
    I agree but with different reasons. I like the punishable aspect AND the ability to followup with a heavy for safety to outsmart the enemy being too aggressive to punish. For this reason, I love Tiandi.
        I feel like Tiandi is everything Orochi should’ve been, minus the deflects. This is also including the lack of reflex guard since I think it’s a pretty unnecessary part of the game.
    I think the follow up light is annoying because unless you parry the light which it is simple I must be honest it’s still annoying
    Comment of the year right here. Would do so much to make the game more fun. Fighting BP and Conq is such a chore
    That ain’t a good trade tho, being punished by a heavy for missing a light&some minor stam damage. Every hero should have some answe, whether it be a dodge attack, dodge bash, or something different like with BP. 

Afaik, the heroes who have no answer to bashes are cent, shugo, hito, jorm, and warlord
    Preach man
Non guarantee deflects, all I have to say.
You calling BP?
    If I get hit with the light, I eat the bash. If I dodge the light I eat the bash. If I parry the light, I get a heavy, but the cycle just starts all over again.
        That’s not even his strongest mixup.

One confirmed bash by Bp puts you in a 50/50 between unreactable bash and guardbreak for either light damage and stamina pause + drain or guardbreak for heavy damage and stamina damage if they try using a dodge attack (yes most dodge attacks are too slow due to BPs frame advantage after a confirmed bash.) 

This is what I’m referring to.
            But I never see that. Every BP I face in a duel EXCLUSIVELY does the light/bash/light combo.

I'd like to seen any other mixup, even if it is unreactable.
                hey at least now you can actually dodge the bash if you didn't block the light in time, too bad it took them like what, 9 months to fix that?
                Not a lot of people know how busted the bash really is.

It’s very prominent in grandmaster duels though just for how safe and strong it is.
                    I mean, I am a BP main, and ppl counter the bash fairly easy if you know what to do. First, ppl can parry the light attack and then your fucked. Second, ppl can back step dodge, and GB. Not as easy to get off, but when ppl do it... your fucked.
                        This is incorrect.

What I’m referring to isn’t a neutral bash. It’s the bash mixup after a landed bash.

bps bash light grants a very generous frame advantage to the bp, it’s the followup bash that’s strong.

It’s a 50/50 between UNREACTABLE bash or guard break. 

What you are referring to is anything from neutral. 

Getting hit by bps bash and the followup mixup isn’t neutral, it’s an entirely different mixup of its own. You cannot light attack out of this mixup unless you have a 400ms light. Dodge attacks except those with a 100ms input window are too slow but are still interrupted by a slightly delayed bash rather than a buffered bash. 

Tldr: the mixup after a landed bash from Bp is a 50/50 between buffered bash and guardbreak as the bash is unreactable and only dodged on prediction (doesn’t help that Bp still has a variable timed bash either.) basically wardens “vortex” but stronger.

Edit: also any of black priors bashes can only be guardbroken on a prediction dodge, I.e a dodge before the bash is even initiated.
            but you can just light him out of his forward dodge
                You cannot.

If Bp lands a bash light the following mixup is a 50/50 between unreactable bash or guard break thanks to frame advantage. 


Test it yourself, if you aren’t playing a character with a 400ms light or zone (orochi can interrupt too) the only counter is a prediction dodge attack or flip. 

Even if you dodge the bash it cannot be punished if you don’t have a dodge attack with a 100ms startup.
                    if BP does another bash after landing the previous one then you can just stuff him out of it even with a buffered 500ms light
                        Due to frame advantage anything slower than a buffered 400ms too light/zone or orochis top light/zone will be interrupted by a buffered Bp bash. Meaning if you don’t have one of those you have to play into the mixup as there is no way to counter it (buffered dodge attacks with a 100ms input timing into dodge works as well but only for some faster dodge attacks.)
                    Just dont get hit by the first bash, I promise it's fairly easy to avoid. I'll leave this link here about BP from Freeze
https://youtu.be/dlKDl4RhHJg
My favorite one is when a warden flys past me. Gets the wrong read. And i still whiff my gb letting him get 30.or 40 if wall. 4 times in a row.
Guardbreak. 'Nuff said.
    You forgot the /s. And This sub is filled with mindless people. F
        To be fair, theres a lot of people with some odd misconceptions about too.
All I want is to be able to manually hold guard in a given direction with reflex guard. But there's no way to hold in a direction with a mouse. Feels bad.
Reflect guard is what Orochi has, right?
    Yeah
        Orochi and shinobi are my favs
HAHA that's a good point
I only dislike reflex guard cause i honestly am doodoo at this game
It just makes a character more difficult without an upside or advantage. Even if there are special moves you can do such as bleed then you are still better off with every other character, because they got the same stuff or a better moveset.
    I think the original intention was to make assassins squishier since they have deflect moves, which promote turtling. Reflex guard makes turtling harder.
    I don't understand how it's more difficult? How often do you leave your guard in place for it to matter? It honestly just seems like like fluff to me and can't say I've ever considered it to make any difference.
        Oh it makes a difference alright. I cannot even begin to describe how many times reflex guard has gotten me killed. 

I like to leave my guard top when fighting opponents such as shaolin since his top light is faster than his side lights. Reflex guard? Nah fam, no can do, you gotta move your mouse around like a crack addict. This is just one of the many many problems. Most issues arise in 1vX situations. 

Also, you cannot possibly deny that reflex guard does not make it more difficult to play the game, it is certainly not just "fluff". Gladiator and shinobi both have shorter duration reflex guard than other assassins. 
Guard switching will always cause a 100 ms window of free damage, so assassins are always at a disadvantage when being ganked. 
After every block with reflex guard you must refresh the guard since it goes back to neutral. 
You also can't keep holding left on controller to keep your guard left. This part is very very hard on mouse since you only have so much mousemat. 

These are just some of the problems with reflex guard, but there are many more.
            My second most played is an assasin and I've never once got hit since maybe my first 2 hours in game and it being because of reflex guard. I play on PC but on controller it sounds like it's a mouse problem. It's genuinely never once affected me on controller once I figured out how it works.
                Everything ive listed are proven bugs and problems that affect evey system. The fact that youve "never been hit" makes me thinn you're lying through your teeth or you've barely played.
                    Clearly said never been hit because of reflex guard but if you're gonna act in bad faith feel free to go elsewhere.
                        My bad, I misinterpreted what you wrote, but my point still stands.

Reflex guard serves little to no purpose, and although you may not have been negatively influenced by it, it is undeniable that giving certain characters reflex guard  serves little to no purpose in this stage of the game.

Only two assassins are considered "strong" while all others are rather weak. It is not only unfair, it is completely redundant to keep reflex guard in the game. It is a remnant of the past, and back then it served a purpose, but now it does not. 

Standardizing all guards is something I feel would positively improve the game by a rather large amount. Whether making all guards into reflex or static is a whole other discussion.
                            >Reflex guard serves little to no purpose, and although you may not have been negatively influenced by it, it is undeniable that giving certain characters reflex guard  serves little to no purpose in this stage of the game.

Sure I agree it's pretty much just fluff at this point.

\> Only two assassins are considered "strong" while all others are rather  weak. It is not only unfair, it is completely redundant to keep reflex  guard in the game. It is a remnant of the past, and back then it served a  purpose, but now it does not.

Given from what good players say reflex guard being removed wouldn't affect balance whatsoever.

\> Standardizing all guards is something I feel would positively improve  the game by a rather large amount. Whether making all guards into reflex  or static is a whole other discussion.

This is a pretty compelling argument from a game dev point tbh standardisation is a very good thing for base mechanics. That said I wouldn't hate it if they kept it as a Beserker only feature.
Im just bad at reinputting directional block haha
Fuck JJ, BP and Conq in particular for me
    Fuck anything that kills me in a way I don’t like for me in particular
        Fuck Shaman players who play her the way I play her
            Facts tho, I pray I never meet a shaman who plays like i do
        Might as well be the motto of our community tbh
I have hated all of those characters at one point. Then I played them and learned their timings and strategies to beat them.
    That's why I dropped my hard earned 10k steel into Cent after switching from xbox to PC. Gotta learn how to dodge that 5m punch. I swear Shugo's grab will get me every single time until I play him til I'm bored
        I don’t know why I refuse to pick up Kensei after all these years and know I’ll continue to suck against him until I do
            I'm the same. I've only had it for <6 months, but I see no fun in kensei, and I get seriously pissed when I get outplayed by one. Maybe I'll grab a 6 pack and give it a go tonight
What about Warden shoulder hit/GB  bullshit
    You know, I liked warden a lot early on. Still a solid choice, although I prefer raider in the vanguard group. I didn't realize how cancerous the shoulder bash was until like a week ago
Well speaking as a nobushi main, nobushi is overly weak as shit it most situations. I do agree with cent and shugoki being annoying. Cent especially in ganks
Fuck shaman and her hp restoring bull shit ways out of stamina" ok well i just killed my *hears shamen* welp goodbye life
I don't like Nuxia, Aramusha, and Warlord in particular. Nuxia is basically just "here's everything you learned, fuck you. Have a good fight!" Aramusha is hard for me to counter for some reason, don't know why. And Warlord. I despise Warlord. I just can't get over his stupid hyper-armor everything spam. I hate valkyrie too.
Except the bugs in Skyrim are funny instead of infuriating lol
    Well, it's not pvp, right? If it was, would it be infuriating?
Fucking gigas and their food stats to low to actually heal their 20000 hp and being better when they're wild
*ptsd flash backs*
Ubi does do that a lot
Tiff is a moderator in this sub infamous for taking down a shitload of posts.

It's a bit of a meme, because it's very inconsistent on which shitposts they decide to remove
Im no maso...*looks at my nobushi play time* okay maybe you are onto something
Yes. The fucking revive icons should just be fucking transparent while you're locked on, them and the other button prompts and the healing zone symbol. I don't understand why they didn't do this when they fixed the rest of the ui. The other completely fucked thing that makes no sense to me is the goddamn lock system. How the fuck has this game existed for nearly four years and one of the most integral features to the fight system is still broken? It's literally as simple as making the right and left sticks swap you left and right (obv there'd be different buttons for pc), and swapping you to the person most directly behind you when you flicker the lock.
Thought I was the only one
    So this is what it feels like, when doves cry!
I'm shite and hardly play so take this with a grain of salt, but it is essentially linked duels or small sided fights. They will have various bonuses and penalties applied to mix it up a bit. There is an apparently procedurally generated story that usually makes zero sense. The difficulty can be all over the map.

To me it is such a wasted opportunity. When it was first announced I had envisioned kind of a dungeon crawl sort of thing with the larger non-duel maps, with some sort of scenario story to give it more meaning.
You and a friend vs some AI that very much enhoy making your life a living hell. It is decent practice though.
You vs Ai with modifiers like damage boost or low health With a chance of exclusive loot if win

It’s not really good but at least I can find crimson conquest
“Free damage”?
    Damage that can't be avoided, like parry riposte, deflect, certain class counters.  The arcade bots use and abuse them to the point where you can only beat them by playing in a very specific, tedious,and boring way.  The community agrees almost unanimously that its bullshit.

I've been making the same arguement that *moderately* skilled PC players can reach that level since the parry-into-guardbreak nightmare that was late season 1.  After which point they've basically beat the game's mechanics and opponent skill becomes fairly irrelevant.   

They claim the bots are frustratingly near-unbeatable, but when I point out that some players fight the exact same way, I'm looked at like a conspiracy theorist.
        So what? Take out parries, deflects, parry counters? None of these are “free damage”, they rely on the attacking player being countered, and every single one of these things you’ve mentioned can be avoided by pressing the feint button.

I get the point about it being unfun when the AI do it, and they do indeed input read and make it literally impossible to “fool” them, but I think the point that “the community unanimously agrees on” is the frustration with input reading and bots feinting attacks that cannot be feinted, not the AI usage of basic game mechanics. Extending the claim to players is ridiculous imo, they’re humans, and they *do* make mistakes.
            You can't react to a parry, you have to guess that it's going to happen and plan the feint in advance.  Otherwise the other player gets their damage off just for winning a quicktime event.  It takes agency away from the attacking player and massively disincentivizes using most of the game's movesets.  When parry crutching was at its worst, all *hIGh lEVeL pLAy* players had a long list of movesets they would *never* under *any* circumstances use, because they were "risky" as in, easy to parry. Parry actively undermines the class system.


I'm not advocating that free damage abilities be removed, just that their follow ups simply be reactable.  Nuxia's deflect is great.  It can be blocked on reaction, but the nux can change its direction making it harder to react to.  Parry should remove the victim's ability to attack for about the duration of a top heavy, allowing the parryer the opportunity to attack, but not a guarantee of damage.  Use it as a momentum shift if someone is battering you, not as a godamned I-win button.

Imagine how much faster, intense, and *skill-based* fights would be if every ability had skill checks on both players?  If you could block the parry riposte, it would change the game.  You could use your whole moveset again. You wouldn't be terrified to attack when your health is low.
                Uh yeah, guessing what the opponent is going to do is literally one of the largest points of this game, and it will become even more prevalent with the combat changes coming in August. Feints are meant to bait, not to reverse an attack, and a feint happy opponent is easily punished. About the only thing I can agree on is that parry punishes are way too high on some characters.

I’m a little confused as to why you’d defend Nuxia’s deflect when it’s one of the worst in the game. If your changes were to come through why would anyone bother deflecting if it gives the same shitty reward as a parry? If anything your proposed changes disincentivize using movesets more than the current game. Why in gods name would you want to make more things in this game reactable when we know what that meta looks like, and have been spending 3+ years trying to get away from it? Deflects are high risk high reward moves, whereas this proposed change would turn it into a high risk move with potentially no reward- what’s the point?

Just sounds like both players would be parrying each others attacks all game and blocking their riposte. No offense but this is one of the worst ideas I’ve ever heard.
                    You can't see all the new opportunities that would open up when your movesets can't be hard countered. All you can think of is "if we can't get free damage after a parry, nothing will ever die!".  You're clearly the type where, if parry just broke one day due to some glitch like the warden instakill thing that one patch, your entire playstyle would just crumble.  You wouldn't know what to do.  That's pathetic, and I clearly won't get through to you.  

Back in season 1, when I railed against parry-into-guardbreak, the most common argument was "but that's the game!".  They were so used to their easy win strat that they couldn't see past it.  You're exactly like them, and time will prove you wrong too.
                        Idk man, only one of us here is asking for the entire parry / punish system to be rebuilt to accommodate their playstyle, sounds like you’re just shit at the game honestly but go off
                            And then you litterally reword the "but that's the game!" argument.
conqueror i feel like he isnt op anymore, hes slow for todays standards and depend on easy reads for the oponents, hes like buddy and bp is buzz lightyear

bro thank god someone said it. whenever i say shit like this all i get are twelve year olds saying "lol you're just shit at the game lol"
    The same twelve year olds who play characters they only press R1 with.
        exactly
I find it particularly amusing that after three years they created a character who's sole purpose was to have incredibly high HP and trade hits with impunity. Then they slowly realized that was a poor design and rather than rebuilding, they just nerfed and nerfed until Kiri went from S to B tier.
    I feel as though Ubi's balancing rarely looks at the core issues that a certain character or moveset has, and addresses it from there, but instead uses amateurish fixes which hammer out the problems occasionally but usually just ruin the character. And either way, the core problem usually persists, and the 'fix' best case scenario is messy.

That said, I love the game and I have an immense amount of fun playing it. I don't have that many day to day complaints, either.
        I think the big issue is it's MUCH easier to simply adjust a variable than to retool a kit.
    Hay. While hito could have used more work, B tier with ubi nerfs isn't all that bad.
Just look at Shinobi for example.
        I have better luck with shinobi purely because nobody knows how to fight him, and his 10 meter slappings somehow don't teach people to close the gap
        Or most assassins for that matter. 

The only ones that are even mildly successful are zerk and shaman, and shaman was nerfed really hard after S4. She used to be able to track around corners with her neck bite.
Spittin facts
The og devs knew what they were doing the new devs don’t play their game and don’t understand the game they play the game at a beginner level and build things with that knowledge which is legit nothing
    I cant say they did

Having playing the early days of the beta and the game it self

It was in a far worse state than its in now
    Would actually explain why they nerfed hito and jorm when neither character really needed it
        Bruh...
        Jorm needed the nerf to balance him more but they messed up the nerf and made him bad hito didn’t need the kick speed nerf only to switch the punish to a light for the non charged and heavy for charged her superior light wasn’t really an issue but it was spam able and people complained the devs don’t understand how to balance and those characters are the result I mean look at centi he has lost his uniqueness they nerfed shinobi to the ground nerfed  shugoki for no reason really it did nothing and they are planning a combat rework august six which will be the end of forhonor on console and will hopefully get the dev team removed
            Bro, use punctuation. That was so hard to read.
                I apologize, punctuation wasn’t my biggest concern there
I agree, there needs to be more melee-combat multiplayer games so when a studio decides to do one people actually k ow what they're doing
Time for For Honor 2??
    For glory?
        Yes. I like that.
It probably doesnt help UBI doesnt asign a large team to for honor due to it not being their top spot game
*fucks up everything next season*
It's such a great concept that it's really a shame that no one else has done it
    Absolver?
        nah that game failed to be "for honor killer"
        Haven't played that one is it anything like for honor?
            If for honor was open world and more about martial arts?
                That sounds great
                    It’s an indie game though
I don’t get why people keep playing this game if they hate it?
    Its like a rage drug, feels good at first then its spirals down
Cheers
Well yea but i was saying that so he doesn't feel like hes missing out on a lot by not playing every day
She can follow up with a heavy to (preferred option for me). It’s safer since her GB vulnerability is 100ms on chain heavies
    Yeah I should've mentioned the heavy as well. She still has options even after a miss while others just have to recover from it. But if the opponent makes the right read they get the punish. It makes the whole bash system a lot more fun and fair than it is on the others like BP or Conq who are basically safe from those who don't have a dodge attack.

And yeah that GB vuln buff to her chained heavy is godlike. I don't like mentioning it much tho because I feel like it wasn't intended. Don't want it to get nerfed :P
        I feel it is true on Black Prior. I often miss the bash but still get a light off because people try to guard break.
        If you make a solid read on BPs and Conqs bash, you get a Free GB. Same with Warlords too.
            Bit how are you supposed to do that, its just guessing, you cant react! 

Entirely unrelated, this game is bad, everthing is reactable, this leads to turteling, the game needs more reads, ~~my favourite streamer said~~ thats my absolutely original opinion.

What I’m referring to isn’t a neutral bash. It’s the bash mixup after a landed bash.

bps bash light grants a very generous frame advantage to the bp, it’s the followup bash that’s strong.

It’s a 50/50 between UNREACTABLE bash or guard break. 

What you are referring to is anything from neutral. 

Getting hit by bps bash and the followup mixup isn’t neutral, it’s an entirely different mixup of its own. You cannot light attack out of this mixup unless you have a 400ms light. Dodge attacks except those with a 100ms input window are too slow but are still interrupted by a slightly delayed bash rather than a buffered bash. 

Tldr: the mixup after a landed bash from Bp is a 50/50 between buffered bash and guardbreak as the bash is unreactable and only dodged on prediction (doesn’t help that Bp still has a variable timed bash either.) basically wardens “vortex” but stronger.

Edit: also any of black priors bashes can only be guardbroken on a prediction dodge, I.e a dodge before the bash is even initiated.
        but you can just light him out of his forward dodge
            You cannot.

If Bp lands a bash light the following mixup is a 50/50 between unreactable bash or guard break thanks to frame advantage. 


Test it yourself, if you aren’t playing a character with a 400ms light or zone (orochi can interrupt too) the only counter is a prediction dodge attack or flip. 

Even if you dodge the bash it cannot be punished if you don’t have a dodge attack with a 100ms startup.
                if BP does another bash after landing the previous one then you can just stuff him out of it even with a buffered 500ms light
                    Due to frame advantage anything slower than a buffered 400ms too light/zone or orochis top light/zone will be interrupted by a buffered Bp bash. Meaning if you don’t have one of those you have to play into the mixup as there is no way to counter it (buffered dodge attacks with a 100ms input timing into dodge works as well but only for some faster dodge attacks.)
                Just dont get hit by the first bash, I promise it's fairly easy to avoid. I'll leave this link here about BP from Freeze
https://youtu.be/dlKDl4RhHJg
You forgot the /s. And This sub is filled with mindless people. F
    To be fair, theres a lot of people with some odd misconceptions about too.
Yeah
    Orochi and shinobi are my favs
I think the original intention was to make assassins squishier since they have deflect moves, which promote turtling. Reflex guard makes turtling harder.
I don't understand how it's more difficult? How often do you leave your guard in place for it to matter? It honestly just seems like like fluff to me and can't say I've ever considered it to make any difference.
    Oh it makes a difference alright. I cannot even begin to describe how many times reflex guard has gotten me killed. 

I like to leave my guard top when fighting opponents such as shaolin since his top light is faster than his side lights. Reflex guard? Nah fam, no can do, you gotta move your mouse around like a crack addict. This is just one of the many many problems. Most issues arise in 1vX situations. 

Also, you cannot possibly deny that reflex guard does not make it more difficult to play the game, it is certainly not just "fluff". Gladiator and shinobi both have shorter duration reflex guard than other assassins. 
Guard switching will always cause a 100 ms window of free damage, so assassins are always at a disadvantage when being ganked. 
After every block with reflex guard you must refresh the guard since it goes back to neutral. 
You also can't keep holding left on controller to keep your guard left. This part is very very hard on mouse since you only have so much mousemat. 

These are just some of the problems with reflex guard, but there are many more.
        My second most played is an assasin and I've never once got hit since maybe my first 2 hours in game and it being because of reflex guard. I play on PC but on controller it sounds like it's a mouse problem. It's genuinely never once affected me on controller once I figured out how it works.
            Everything ive listed are proven bugs and problems that affect evey system. The fact that youve "never been hit" makes me thinn you're lying through your teeth or you've barely played.
                Clearly said never been hit because of reflex guard but if you're gonna act in bad faith feel free to go elsewhere.
                    My bad, I misinterpreted what you wrote, but my point still stands.

Reflex guard serves little to no purpose, and although you may not have been negatively influenced by it, it is undeniable that giving certain characters reflex guard  serves little to no purpose in this stage of the game.

Only two assassins are considered "strong" while all others are rather weak. It is not only unfair, it is completely redundant to keep reflex guard in the game. It is a remnant of the past, and back then it served a purpose, but now it does not. 

Standardizing all guards is something I feel would positively improve the game by a rather large amount. Whether making all guards into reflex or static is a whole other discussion.
                        >Reflex guard serves little to no purpose, and although you may not have been negatively influenced by it, it is undeniable that giving certain characters reflex guard  serves little to no purpose in this stage of the game.

Sure I agree it's pretty much just fluff at this point.

\> Only two assassins are considered "strong" while all others are rather  weak. It is not only unfair, it is completely redundant to keep reflex  guard in the game. It is a remnant of the past, and back then it served a  purpose, but now it does not.

Given from what good players say reflex guard being removed wouldn't affect balance whatsoever.

\> Standardizing all guards is something I feel would positively improve  the game by a rather large amount. Whether making all guards into reflex  or static is a whole other discussion.

This is a pretty compelling argument from a game dev point tbh standardisation is a very good thing for base mechanics. That said I wouldn't hate it if they kept it as a Beserker only feature.
Fuck anything that kills me in a way I don’t like for me in particular
    Fuck Shaman players who play her the way I play her
        Facts tho, I pray I never meet a shaman who plays like i do
    Might as well be the motto of our community tbh
That's why I dropped my hard earned 10k steel into Cent after switching from xbox to PC. Gotta learn how to dodge that 5m punch. I swear Shugo's grab will get me every single time until I play him til I'm bored
    I don’t know why I refuse to pick up Kensei after all these years and know I’ll continue to suck against him until I do
        I'm the same. I've only had it for <6 months, but I see no fun in kensei, and I get seriously pissed when I get outplayed by one. Maybe I'll grab a 6 pack and give it a go tonight
You know, I liked warden a lot early on. Still a solid choice, although I prefer raider in the vanguard group. I didn't realize how cancerous the shoulder bash was until like a week ago
Well, it's not pvp, right? If it was, would it be infuriating?
So this is what it feels like, when doves cry!
Damage that can't be avoided, like parry riposte, deflect, certain class counters.  The arcade bots use and abuse them to the point where you can only beat them by playing in a very specific, tedious,and boring way.  The community agrees almost unanimously that its bullshit.

I've been making the same arguement that *moderately* skilled PC players can reach that level since the parry-into-guardbreak nightmare that was late season 1.  After which point they've basically beat the game's mechanics and opponent skill becomes fairly irrelevant.   

They claim the bots are frustratingly near-unbeatable, but when I point out that some players fight the exact same way, I'm looked at like a conspiracy theorist.
    So what? Take out parries, deflects, parry counters? None of these are “free damage”, they rely on the attacking player being countered, and every single one of these things you’ve mentioned can be avoided by pressing the feint button.

I get the point about it being unfun when the AI do it, and they do indeed input read and make it literally impossible to “fool” them, but I think the point that “the community unanimously agrees on” is the frustration with input reading and bots feinting attacks that cannot be feinted, not the AI usage of basic game mechanics. Extending the claim to players is ridiculous imo, they’re humans, and they *do* make mistakes.
        You can't react to a parry, you have to guess that it's going to happen and plan the feint in advance.  Otherwise the other player gets their damage off just for winning a quicktime event.  It takes agency away from the attacking player and massively disincentivizes using most of the game's movesets.  When parry crutching was at its worst, all *hIGh lEVeL pLAy* players had a long list of movesets they would *never* under *any* circumstances use, because they were "risky" as in, easy to parry. Parry actively undermines the class system.


I'm not advocating that free damage abilities be removed, just that their follow ups simply be reactable.  Nuxia's deflect is great.  It can be blocked on reaction, but the nux can change its direction making it harder to react to.  Parry should remove the victim's ability to attack for about the duration of a top heavy, allowing the parryer the opportunity to attack, but not a guarantee of damage.  Use it as a momentum shift if someone is battering you, not as a godamned I-win button.

Imagine how much faster, intense, and *skill-based* fights would be if every ability had skill checks on both players?  If you could block the parry riposte, it would change the game.  You could use your whole moveset again. You wouldn't be terrified to attack when your health is low.
            Uh yeah, guessing what the opponent is going to do is literally one of the largest points of this game, and it will become even more prevalent with the combat changes coming in August. Feints are meant to bait, not to reverse an attack, and a feint happy opponent is easily punished. About the only thing I can agree on is that parry punishes are way too high on some characters.

I’m a little confused as to why you’d defend Nuxia’s deflect when it’s one of the worst in the game. If your changes were to come through why would anyone bother deflecting if it gives the same shitty reward as a parry? If anything your proposed changes disincentivize using movesets more than the current game. Why in gods name would you want to make more things in this game reactable when we know what that meta looks like, and have been spending 3+ years trying to get away from it? Deflects are high risk high reward moves, whereas this proposed change would turn it into a high risk move with potentially no reward- what’s the point?

Just sounds like both players would be parrying each others attacks all game and blocking their riposte. No offense but this is one of the worst ideas I’ve ever heard.
                You can't see all the new opportunities that would open up when your movesets can't be hard countered. All you can think of is "if we can't get free damage after a parry, nothing will ever die!".  You're clearly the type where, if parry just broke one day due to some glitch like the warden instakill thing that one patch, your entire playstyle would just crumble.  You wouldn't know what to do.  That's pathetic, and I clearly won't get through to you.  

Back in season 1, when I railed against parry-into-guardbreak, the most common argument was "but that's the game!".  They were so used to their easy win strat that they couldn't see past it.  You're exactly like them, and time will prove you wrong too.
                    Idk man, only one of us here is asking for the entire parry / punish system to be rebuilt to accommodate their playstyle, sounds like you’re just shit at the game honestly but go off
                        And then you litterally reword the "but that's the game!" argument.
Mostly breach and some ranked duels
That explains everything.
Yeah getting ganked is what I’m used to most the time, which is why I love revenge and I think it’s perfectly balanced as all things should be.
    You clearly aren’t the same skill as me if you think that ..
        Care to elaborate what’s so bad about it? I want to know what you think.
        Here we see the definition of the word “cringe”

    I don’t even know you dog

                Nerd
                    Yes.
Hyper armour OP? You must think Shugoki is top tier then. XD
So four. That are all easily punishable
I see where you're coming from
You mean those emoting bots that stay on kne point
    Yeah, those things is that what we call them. I just call them thrash pieces, not good enough to be trash cans
The same twelve year olds who play characters they only press R1 with.
    exactly
I feel as though Ubi's balancing rarely looks at the core issues that a certain character or moveset has, and addresses it from there, but instead uses amateurish fixes which hammer out the problems occasionally but usually just ruin the character. And either way, the core problem usually persists, and the 'fix' best case scenario is messy.

That said, I love the game and I have an immense amount of fun playing it. I don't have that many day to day complaints, either.
    I think the big issue is it's MUCH easier to simply adjust a variable than to retool a kit.
Hay. While hito could have used more work, B tier with ubi nerfs isn't all that bad.
Just look at Shinobi for example.
    I have better luck with shinobi purely because nobody knows how to fight him, and his 10 meter slappings somehow don't teach people to close the gap
    Or most assassins for that matter. 

The only ones that are even mildly successful are zerk and shaman, and shaman was nerfed really hard after S4. She used to be able to track around corners with her neck bite.
I cant say they did

Having playing the early days of the beta and the game it self

It was in a far worse state than its in now
Would actually explain why they nerfed hito and jorm when neither character really needed it
    Bruh...
    Jorm needed the nerf to balance him more but they messed up the nerf and made him bad hito didn’t need the kick speed nerf only to switch the punish to a light for the non charged and heavy for charged her superior light wasn’t really an issue but it was spam able and people complained the devs don’t understand how to balance and those characters are the result I mean look at centi he has lost his uniqueness they nerfed shinobi to the ground nerfed  shugoki for no reason really it did nothing and they are planning a combat rework august six which will be the end of forhonor on console and will hopefully get the dev team removed
        Bro, use punctuation. That was so hard to read.
            I apologize, punctuation wasn’t my biggest concern there
For glory?
    Yes. I like that.
Absolver?
    nah that game failed to be "for honor killer"
    Haven't played that one is it anything like for honor?
        If for honor was open world and more about martial arts?
            That sounds great
                It’s an indie game though
Its like a rage drug, feels good at first then its spirals down
Yeah I should've mentioned the heavy as well. She still has options even after a miss while others just have to recover from it. But if the opponent makes the right read they get the punish. It makes the whole bash system a lot more fun and fair than it is on the others like BP or Conq who are basically safe from those who don't have a dodge attack.

And yeah that GB vuln buff to her chained heavy is godlike. I don't like mentioning it much tho because I feel like it wasn't intended. Don't want it to get nerfed :P
    I feel it is true on Black Prior. I often miss the bash but still get a light off because people try to guard break.
    If you make a solid read on BPs and Conqs bash, you get a Free GB. Same with Warlords too.
        Bit how are you supposed to do that, its just guessing, you cant react! 

Entirely unrelated, this game is bad, everthing is reactable, this leads to turteling, the game needs more reads, ~~my favourite streamer said~~ thats my absolutely original opinion.

This subreddit in a nutshell.
            Alot of people on this sub either have no idea what they talking about, or circlejerk things they hear youtuber say

Still they wouldnt be wrong about turtling. On higher levels turtling is a major problem and its a reason im getting real tired of this game. I don't wanna stare at people
I feel like Tiandi is everything Orochi should’ve been, minus the deflects. This is also including the lack of reflex guard since I think it’s a pretty unnecessary part of the game.
That’s not even his strongest mixup.

One confirmed bash by Bp puts you in a 50/50 between unreactable bash and guardbreak for either light damage and stamina pause + drain or guardbreak for heavy damage and stamina damage if they try using a dodge attack (yes most dodge attacks are too slow due to BPs frame advantage after a confirmed bash.) 

This is what I’m referring to.
    But I never see that. Every BP I face in a duel EXCLUSIVELY does the light/bash/light combo.

I'd like to seen any other mixup, even if it is unreactable.
        hey at least now you can actually dodge the bash if you didn't block the light in time, too bad it took them like what, 9 months to fix that?
        Not a lot of people know how busted the bash really is.

It’s very prominent in grandmaster duels though just for how safe and strong it is.
            I mean, I am a BP main, and ppl counter the bash fairly easy if you know what to do. First, ppl can parry the light attack and then your fucked. Second, ppl can back step dodge, and GB. Not as easy to get off, but when ppl do it... your fucked.

I feel it is true on Black Prior. I often miss the bash but still get a light off because people try to guard break.
If you make a solid read on BPs and Conqs bash, you get a Free GB. Same with Warlords too.
    Bit how are you supposed to do that, its just guessing, you cant react! 

Entirely unrelated, this game is bad, everthing is reactable, this leads to turteling, the game needs more reads, ~~my favourite streamer said~~ thats my absolutely original opinion.

This subreddit in a nutshell.
        Alot of people on this sub either have no idea what they talking about, or circlejerk things they hear youtuber say

Still they wouldnt be wrong about turtling. On higher levels turtling is a major problem and its a reason im getting real tired of this game. I don't wanna stare at people
But I never see that. Every BP I face in a duel EXCLUSIVELY does the light/bash/light combo.

I'd like to seen any other mixup, even if it is unreactable.
    hey at least now you can actually dodge the bash if you didn't block the light in time, too bad it took them like what, 9 months to fix that?
    Not a lot of people know how busted the bash really is.

It’s very prominent in grandmaster duels though just for how safe and strong it is.
        I mean, I am a BP main, and ppl counter the bash fairly easy if you know what to do. First, ppl can parry the light attack and then your fucked. Second, ppl can back step dodge, and GB. Not as easy to get off, but when ppl do it... your fucked.
            This is incorrect.

What I’m referring to isn’t a neutral bash. It’s the bash mixup after a landed bash.

bps bash light grants a very generous frame advantage to the bp, it’s the followup bash that’s strong.

It’s a 50/50 between UNREACTABLE bash or guard break. 

What you are referring to is anything from neutral. 

Getting hit by bps bash and the followup mixup isn’t neutral, it’s an entirely different mixup of its own. You cannot light attack out of this mixup unless you have a 400ms light. Dodge attacks except those with a 100ms input window are too slow but are still interrupted by a slightly delayed bash rather than a buffered bash. 

Tldr: the mixup after a landed bash from Bp is a 50/50 between buffered bash and guardbreak as the bash is unreactable and only dodged on prediction (doesn’t help that Bp still has a variable timed bash either.) basically wardens “vortex” but stronger.

Edit: also any of black priors bashes can only be guardbroken on a prediction dodge, I.e a dodge before the bash is even initiated.
but you can just light him out of his forward dodge
    You cannot.

If Bp lands a bash light the following mixup is a 50/50 between unreactable bash or guard break thanks to frame advantage. 


Test it yourself, if you aren’t playing a character with a 400ms light or zone (orochi can interrupt too) the only counter is a prediction dodge attack or flip. 

Even if you dodge the bash it cannot be punished if you don’t have a dodge attack with a 100ms startup.
        if BP does another bash after landing the previous one then you can just stuff him out of it even with a buffered 500ms light
            Due to frame advantage anything slower than a buffered 400ms too light/zone or orochis top light/zone will be interrupted by a buffered Bp bash. Meaning if you don’t have one of those you have to play into the mixup as there is no way to counter it (buffered dodge attacks with a 100ms input timing into dodge works as well but only for some faster dodge attacks.)
        Just dont get hit by the first bash, I promise it's fairly easy to avoid. I'll leave this link here about BP from Freeze

My second most played is an assasin and I've never once got hit since maybe my first 2 hours in game and it being because of reflex guard. I play on PC but on controller it sounds like it's a mouse problem. It's genuinely never once affected me on controller once I figured out how it works.
    Everything ive listed are proven bugs and problems that affect evey system. The fact that youve "never been hit" makes me thinn you're lying through your teeth or you've barely played.
        Clearly said never been hit because of reflex guard but if you're gonna act in bad faith feel free to go elsewhere.
            My bad, I misinterpreted what you wrote, but my point still stands.

Reflex guard serves little to no purpose, and although you may not have been negatively influenced by it, it is undeniable that giving certain characters reflex guard  serves little to no purpose in this stage of the game.

Only two assassins are considered "strong" while all others are rather weak. It is not only unfair, it is completely redundant to keep reflex guard in the game. It is a remnant of the past, and back then it served a purpose, but now it does not. 

Standardizing all guards is something I feel would positively improve the game by a rather large amount. Whether making all guards into reflex or static is a whole other discussion.
                >Reflex guard serves little to no purpose, and although you may not have been negatively influenced by it, it is undeniable that giving certain characters reflex guard  serves little to no purpose in this stage of the game.

Sure I agree it's pretty much just fluff at this point.

\> Only two assassins are considered "strong" while all others are rather  weak. It is not only unfair, it is completely redundant to keep reflex  guard in the game. It is a remnant of the past, and back then it served a  purpose, but now it does not.

Given from what good players say reflex guard being removed wouldn't affect balance whatsoever.

\> Standardizing all guards is something I feel would positively improve  the game by a rather large amount. Whether making all guards into reflex  or static is a whole other discussion.

This is a pretty compelling argument from a game dev point tbh standardisation is a very good thing for base mechanics. That said I wouldn't hate it if they kept it as a Beserker only feature.
Facts tho, I pray I never meet a shaman who plays like i do
I'm the same. I've only had it for <6 months, but I see no fun in kensei, and I get seriously pissed when I get outplayed by one. Maybe I'll grab a 6 pack and give it a go tonight
You can't react to a parry, you have to guess that it's going to happen and plan the feint in advance.  Otherwise the other player gets their damage off just for winning a quicktime event.  It takes agency away from the attacking player and massively disincentivizes using most of the game's movesets.  When parry crutching was at its worst, all *hIGh lEVeL pLAy* players had a long list of movesets they would *never* under *any* circumstances use, because they were "risky" as in, easy to parry. Parry actively undermines the class system.


I'm not advocating that free damage abilities be removed, just that their follow ups simply be reactable.  Nuxia's deflect is great.  It can be blocked on reaction, but the nux can change its direction making it harder to react to.  Parry should remove the victim's ability to attack for about the duration of a top heavy, allowing the parryer the opportunity to attack, but not a guarantee of damage.  Use it as a momentum shift if someone is battering you, not as a godamned I-win button.

Imagine how much faster, intense, and *skill-based* fights would be if every ability had skill checks on both players?  If you could block the parry riposte, it would change the game.  You could use your whole moveset again. You wouldn't be terrified to attack when your health is low.
    Uh yeah, guessing what the opponent is going to do is literally one of the largest points of this game, and it will become even more prevalent with the combat changes coming in August. Feints are meant to bait, not to reverse an attack, and a feint happy opponent is easily punished. About the only thing I can agree on is that parry punishes are way too high on some characters.

I’m a little confused as to why you’d defend Nuxia’s deflect when it’s one of the worst in the game. If your changes were to come through why would anyone bother deflecting if it gives the same shitty reward as a parry? If anything your proposed changes disincentivize using movesets more than the current game. Why in gods name would you want to make more things in this game reactable when we know what that meta looks like, and have been spending 3+ years trying to get away from it? Deflects are high risk high reward moves, whereas this proposed change would turn it into a high risk move with potentially no reward- what’s the point?

Just sounds like both players would be parrying each others attacks all game and blocking their riposte. No offense but this is one of the worst ideas I’ve ever heard.
        You can't see all the new opportunities that would open up when your movesets can't be hard countered. All you can think of is "if we can't get free damage after a parry, nothing will ever die!".  You're clearly the type where, if parry just broke one day due to some glitch like the warden instakill thing that one patch, your entire playstyle would just crumble.  You wouldn't know what to do.  That's pathetic, and I clearly won't get through to you.  

Back in season 1, when I railed against parry-into-guardbreak, the most common argument was "but that's the game!".  They were so used to their easy win strat that they couldn't see past it.  You're exactly like them, and time will prove you wrong too.
            Idk man, only one of us here is asking for the entire parry / punish system to be rebuilt to accommodate their playstyle, sounds like you’re just shit at the game honestly but go off
                And then you litterally reword the "but that's the game!" argument.
