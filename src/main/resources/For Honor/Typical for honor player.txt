[[Typical for honor player]]





Truly a for honor moment
    Nah like fr, bro can’t parry a single hit
        It was so painful to watch
            Even more painful to play against him
        should pick up orochi and show him real spam looks like LMAO
The dude was so braindead he couldn't even process the idea of shugo top heavies

All those hits to the head probably destroyed the last 1/3rd of a braincell he had left
    This comment is so funny bruh 💀

    Lmaooo 😭
I love when players default to complaining about spam when they can't do something as simple as blocking.
    Truly amazing that they exist 😭🙏🏻
        Had a similar experience happen today. Guy got hit with glads unblockable heavies over and over. 2 rounds I didn't feint a single one. He messaged me calling me a spammer, but this little nugget made me lol. https://imgur.com/gallery/Cpqv7pX
    You can't block while hitstunned jsyk
        aside from the bash light combos he could’ve, he just tired to go for the light parry’s and missed
        Yes, you can. Landing one light does not garuntee a second one.
            That is entirely dependent on which character you are playing
                Prove it, then. I know for a fact it isn't. I've played since the beta, and I play every character. You are wrong
                    Then you definitely haven't played since beta 😂
                        That's not proof
                            Kid stfu if you had actually played that long youd know in right
                                I have clips bru
He was never winning with HL

    Bro picked the worst character of the game After getting cooked and thought "nah i'd win"
This is why I tell new players to take fights slow. It’s not spam, he’s running into everything you throw
    And he’s not new he’s rep 400
        Jeez. That video kills my soul as an ex-GM.
            [deleted]
                Bro thought he was slick with it
                    I was trying to milk attention. My b
                        Milk these balls

*Wait this isnt FHR I forgot.
                            Bet. Place date and time
    That’s what I was trying to prove when I chose shugoki 💀
    Not only slow but another tip that's helped me and probably many others get into the rhythm of the game is that,
 at first it's good to try blocking most attacks and not tense up and Parry everything.

The more comfortable you get with blocking the more capable you'll probably get parrying later.
    Nah, i play slow and people complain about me staring, this community Will find a reason to hate you one way or another.
Although i"ll admit that sometimes im way to slow but the point remains
        I’d rather be too slow and play space than not think ahead
            https://youtube.com/shorts/S6uBdTFDuoY?si=8TTpuAnn4AVTFXnI
i think he *was* trying to parry everything but that’s what was getting him hit since the timing was off on a majority of it :/
    You can literally see he’s always trying to spam on every situation
        there was an instance in round 3 of shugo v glad where he tried deflecting but it was fully charged, then tried punching you out of a fully charged. the brain is working but you were punishing all his attempts at defense and countering so in the later duels he just went monke mode with spamming every chance he got to crack ANYTHING open and keep it going to get damage. i think this explains his choice of HL, highlander can take a mile if you give him an inch.
            Fair but there were full two games that he wasn’t trying anything
                i chalk that up to decision fatigue, being on the defensive for that long and having to consider a swathe of neutral options wears you down fast. at that point he must’ve just been thinking exclusively in the present, nothing about how he could adapt his behaviour or how to mix you up or any information he could use to survive. he was just getting hit and hit and hit. [this video by core-a explains this better](https://youtu.be/g4-EyNJhcQ8?si=ktNZBuCTO_2Pfn8M)
                    Bro pulled out a whole 15 minute video 💀
                        its a good vid :) i like core-a
                            Fine I’ll watch it 😭
Man, even I sound like I can beat him, and I’m dog shit
    And he’s rep 400
        Rep 23 here. 

My game plan; HEAVY! oh shit. He blocked. What do?
            Bro I won by doing this plan 💀
                Then it sounds like I can do it too lol
                    I believe in you!🫡
I don’t actually play shugoki
    Shugo bonk is the most fun
        True🫡
    (I do)
If it were me against him I couldn't help but lecture the guy
    I just decided to bonk him
        *BONK* was very effective
            Indeed
У меня было подобное но в дуэлях и в итоге я играл с челом где-то час или полтора. Я играл за афиру и он пытался найти подход к моему стилю боя , персонажей он так же менял. Но всё же вполне хорошо провёл время с тем с кем был на равном уровне. Кстати подскажи название песни , приятель
    Я не был на равном уровне с этим бро 😭🙏🏻
        Но всё же можно позавидовать его упорству. Я бы не смог переигрывать с челом которого я засрал, после того как он тупо каждый раунд насилует меня не напрягаясь
            Пхахахахахах сука ты так смешно это написал
                Same
                    Bro speaks Russian 💀
    Jelena Rozga - Bižuterija. Рекомендую послушать и другие её песни. (:
Did you really smoke half his dudes? Jesus nice
    Thanks bro 🙏🏻 he was rep 400 too
How do you all get so lucky to fight against bots like this? Nearly everyone I fight is a sweat lord
    Idk bro it was 4 am
What is that song lol?
    Bizuterija
        Koji kurac? Hahahahahh uplašio me autoplay i Rozga
            Bro I don’t speak whatever the fuck this language is
                That's the language of the song...
                    Cool
                        I agree, Slavic languages are cool indeed
                            I know I speak russian
                                The only thing I know in Russian is "Ya ne govoryu po Russkii"
                Bro it's the language the song is in lmao
                    Cool 💀
Did it ever come to his mind to maybe.. block? That, or he really likes getting bashed over the head. im actually cringing over how painful that was to watch 😭 and he has the audacity to say “spam”
    He was also rep 400 bruh💀
Top heby
    Best strat
That repeated bonk scratched a side of my brain funny
    🤣
Bonk!
    Bonk! 🫡
The Shugo bonks killed me everytime lmao
    🤣
My guy did not even attempt a parry after getting sound advice
    Fr
For honor players and their massive egos...
    Fr..
Bro is spamming mistakes
    Funniest comment
He should watch some Havok or Faraam
    Definitely
[deleted]
    I didn’t spam him 💀
The worst part is you didn't parry either bc you didn't have to lol. I'm assuming you didn't even attempt to tbh. Poor dude.

I really wish you would've given them the Shugo special with feints to gb and hugs tho.
    I did I just didn’t put it in the vid
        Good person, giving that dude the hugs they never got when they were young.
            Lmao why are you so cruel 💀
                Only to bad players who tilt message blaming better players for their shortcomings. Keep up the good work showing em where they really belong, fellow warrior.
                    🫡respect
The sound that was being made every time you hit him while playing goki is the same sound I hear when I hit people with him
    Lmao I hear it too even without the sound 💀
Naw buddy trash
"Spam!!!!!!" *Casually spams themselves*
    Like fr why
        It's crazy how Hippocratical people can be
            Like I don’t even care about the spam fr, he’s the only one who genuinely cares
                Yeah, don't get me wrong, spam can be annoying at times. Especially for me because I can't properly time the blocks and parrys
                    Naw bro like I get mad too, but I never send messages to strangers asking them for a 1v1 to fill my ego 😭
                        Fr man, like how low on chromosomes do you have to be to ask for a 1v1 just to fill your ego
                            Probably the amount of chromosomes that guy has
Wish the servers were better tbh
    Wdym?
        Well I've practiced against certain moves in the training but due to having a latency of 70 against the opponent who has 10-20 I literally can't get a parry in
            Lmao sometimes it happens to all of us
                It's because is sooooo good at the game that it has to nerfy skill qoth garbage latency
                    I believe you
I feel the pain of your foe, parrying is hard.... a ceremonial fuck you. (i dont mean it)
    I’m crying
        T-T
lol the top heavies got me
    The best part 🤣
starting the spanking with shugo was brilliant
    Thank you 🙏🏻😭
That sure is a lot of dodge attacking from neutral from the guy complaining about spam. 

I'm not saying he's being hypocritical, but how you complain about how other people play, have the gall to demand a 1v1 to prove you're better, and then play like a fucking monkey.
    Bro is speaking facts 💀
REP 37????????????? WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
    Yeah lmao and he’s overall 400 something reps
        Hoooow,really...HOW
            I have no idea 🤷🏻‍♂️
imagine beeing good at for honor...
    Don’t need to imagine 😎
As a rep 6 cent main i respect it
    😉
he’s built different, but in the way that a dad says they don’t need the ikea instructions different
    😂
SPAM
    SPAM
Surely he won't throw another top.....SOB!!!!!
    Probably what he was thinking
BALKAN SONG RRAAAAAHHHHH 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸
    Save Europe
I think he has a concussion from all the top heavies
Imagine someone complaining about spam, I would be happy if my opponents wouldn't play Waiting Simulator 😭😭
    Same
Bro didn't even dodge 😭😭😭
    He did a lil bit
I'm genuinely about to give up as Kyoshin and revert to Shugoki because I can't mentally handle losing to a gladiator/communist monk gank anymore.
    Honestly I don’t play shugoki so I can’t relate
        He's fun
            I know
Bro tried to deflect that unblockable
    He did
    Almost succeeded
i dont get why people complain in a fighting game,they expect the opponent to play according to them
    Fr like just let people do what they want
How dare you repeatedly press the attack button. Op is obviously in the wrong
    I’m so wrong
I don’t often wish death upon people. But you are the exception
    Thank you
I would main Shugo forever if they added a "Bonk" mode that played that sound effect on every hit in game lol
    Same tbh
Yo the ps5 graphics look amazing… no wonder why I can’t keep up with a ps4. 🥲
    I’m sad for you
        I know I’m sad for me too… those graphics for ps5 is so crisp
Shugoki is a terrible character and he lost to literal heavy spam
    That’s why I picked shugoki 😅
I fucking lost it with the repeated top heavies

dude ACTUALLY couldn't parry lmaooo
    Like fr
This is why I'd never message anyone. You never know if the one guy you decide to step up to will churn your ass like butter and put you into a kill compilations with you being the only target.
    Lmaooo you make me feel bad for him kinda 😅
The shug bonks 😩😩😩
    BONK!
This guy just can't block a top heavy to save his life
    He tried deflecting once 🫡
I would pick the same hero just to make a point, but it's fun to see a Shugoki out pace a Gladiator.
    Truly a fun moment
Koja je to muzika prvi put je cujem. 😉
    I don’t speak this language sadly
        It's the language of the song.
            Cool
You know it's serious when he pulls orochi
    And losses to a rep 1 centurion
        While having 37 reps on roach 🪳
            Tbf 37 reps on orochi doesn't involve much improvement so I'd say you were about equal 👍
                I agree most braindead orochi people are for some reason the highest reps
Parrying is like running, you gotta be able to walk before you run, likewise you gotta be able to block before you can parry and homeboy couldn't even do that 💀
    Lmao 🤣
Dipshits and skilled mfs have one thing in common, letting that heavy fly
    Lmao 🤣
This happened to me with Warmonger once. Funniest shit ever when this Rep 1 Warden who couldn’t parry to save his life (literally) kept messaging me on PSN with “stop spamming” and eventually told me he was better than I am, to which I responded “k wanna 1v1” and he agreed. I promised that I would only use beast of prey and shit like that twice per round and followed that promise and still kicked this bloke’s ass somehow, and I’m absolute shit :D
    Lmaooo
How is he even getting hit his guard is there, im sorry for him but that just skill issue
    Like that’s just what I was saying
I was really hoping you'd only attack from the right on Goki.. Would've been pure gold.
    Fr
    But top heavy is better
Op: let's all attack fly. Does not faint a single strike. And do 0 mixes.
Opponent: Gets hit with every single one

XD what a tool
    😂
balkan chad vs virgin tik toker
    Literally me
Typical glad gameplay, I find alot of glad players play him not because they want to or like him but his bunga-ability means he is the only one they can pilot to any kind of half decent results.
    True but he has like 400 reps overall he’s just bad at everything
        HOLY FUCK I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE THAT LOOOOOOOL AYE IF HE IN HERE I HOPE HE SPEAK UP WITH AN EXCUSE.
😂😂😂😂
    🤣
        The play style killed me you play very similar to how I do 😂 you got to the point where you literally did spam hoping he’d parry and he still didn’t and lost 💀
            Lmao yes I just wanted to make him parry once 💀
        Mans a bot
            Lvl 1 bot
                Literally
                    😞
I miss these interactions, now people just emote spam and leave games
For Honor players when you don’t use 16 different moves in a single fight
    So true 💀
All he had to do was parry.
    Literally
Bro he really did need to just parry, you weren't spamming originally but then started and he didn't get the memo lol
    Fr lmao
I mean yeah maybe you are using the same attacks a lot but he can't parry for his life lmao
    I did it on purpose to make him angry 😅
        Nws I do the same thing with jorm, they say that I am spamming and then I start doing it for real, priceless reactions everytime😂
That man is 10x my reps and I just know I'd fuck him up
    How much reps you got?
        45
            Nice, keep up the grind, I’m 101 rn
He tried to deflect an unblockable
    Bro got confused 😅
40 reps on HL and I think he’s a solid counter for Shugo, despite  this guy getting 0-3.
    I agree, but he’s dogshit, he had 12 reps on him 😅
I started dying once you had that stare down and that GB from neutral worked. Props my guy.
Just parry
    Fr
Like I hate shugoki,  but that dude is pretty dumb, not even one parry
I like how in every other fighting game spam is basically expected. But in for honour, even locking on to your opponent breaks like 4 social taboos and DARING to combo somone is punishable by harassment
    Lmao this is so real
DUDE i was NEVER expecting THIS song...
Watafak bro
If It was me he would have parried every single top heavy
Bro throwing shugi neutral heavies had me rolling
I just find it funny dude said spam over and over again but didn't even try to get out of the way of a top heavy 🤣 first thing that came to mind was light 🤣 funny ASF dude needs to just stay in unranked lobbies 
    Also I find it funny dude said parry other dude responded "k" where was the parry 
Centurion try not to start every attack with an ublockabke or guard-break - impossible
    I didn’t?
        That was fast. From what I see bro it seems like you’d throw a heavy into an unblockable or just throw an unblockable. I’m not accusing you directly but commonly centurions do that. It was kinda spam. Not a single light, I’ll say that.
            Bro I’m 1 rep with centurion against his 37 rep orochi, what’s the problem here
                I’m not leaving much in the dark, you kinda went spammy on him. Same with Pharoah (that’s what I call the Egyptian dude from the beginning of your clip) you threw a nasty ass light spam 😂
                    Bro didn’t block my hits why wouldn’t i continue my combo
                        Yeah it’s kinda hard to block light spam bro, that’s why it’s effective 😂
                            Bro I rewatched the vid and I hit him with only 3 light what are you on
                                Listen bro I’m not gonna fight with you, but when you say “just parry it” and then load into a 1v1 and then pull the same shit, it’s not a good rep 😂
                                    Bruh I picked the easiest character to parry
                                Ive never played as Pharoah, but I’ve played against him plenty, and you can def spam with him.
                                    Okay but I don’t LIGHTSPAM
                            I used more zone and heavy attacks
        Yeah rewatching the clip now you def used like 80% unblockables and guardbreaks 😂
            Wdym I only used an unblockable ones, and two guard breaks
                I counted 9 attacks that have that orange glow, counting the faint you did
                    Bro that’s bashes 💀
                        Alr, you responded in like 3 different messages, and I’m not gonna respond to all of them separately. Stop fighting small battles dude. Idc what move you used, you’re repetitive af, and I’m being generous in saying you’re BORDERING spam.
                            Chill 💀
                                Chill? Bro what tone are you reading my messages with 😂 I’m just talking
                                    Idk like an annoying teacher type of tone 🤣

    Shugoki is a spammer? 💀
        Like I only picked him since I thought he’s the less spammer out of all heroes
        [deleted]
            Bro spamming is when you throw a lot of attacks over a short time 💀

                            I thought you’re serious for a second 😭
You parried 3-4 things. You gotta try harder if you're gonna tell other people to parry
    If I’d needed to I would
    Bro I wasn’t trying 💀
        Then don't tell others to try
            Bro I wasn’t the one who messaged a stranger and asked for a 1v1 💀
                🤓
                    Cry more
                        😩
Try doing side heavies as shugo. They catch dodges pretty well.
    I won’t, I just wanted to prove he’s brain dead that’s why I did only top heavies
        fair enough lmao
            Lmao
No shot this mf tried to deflect a shugoki variable timed heavy when he can’t even block lights or parry repeated same side raw heavy’s
I like how really all you did was top heavies and buddy couldn't figure it out at all. Lol
Spam. Spam. Spam.
    🤓☝🏻
    YES.
Accuses you of spamming, then picks Orochi. Truly a For Honor moment.
    Lmaooo 😭
I mean guy definitely can’t block or parry and yea you won, but that doesn’t mean you didn’t spam, literally picked some of the easiest characters to spam and commenced to spamming sooo… you’re both right? You’re both wrong? Idk 🤷‍♂️
    I just don’t care I wasn’t trying to prove I’m not spamming
        I mean he’s definitely in the wrong for taking the time to message you, talk shit and set up a 1v1 and lose don’t get me wrong, and you’d probably beat me in a 1v1 so I don’t have much room for talking either honestly
I mean he is right all you did with medjay was spam

You can't exactly parry when you are infinite hitstunned
    You don’t get hit stunned by lights
        How long have you played this game for???

You get hit by any attack your character staggers and if your character has fast enough swing speed like medjay whos swing speed is out of this world busted

You can just infinite light chain them and they can't move their guard to block or dodge out of it
            Like 2000 hours
                2000 hours and you still spam

No wonder every hates this games playerbase
                    Just parry
                        Can't parry while stagerlocked
                            You can parry whenever, only when you are stunned by a bash you can’t parry
                                Or guardbreaked
                                In order to parry your guard has to be in the same direction as the incoming attack

You cant change your guard direction while staggered, if you are light spammed by a fast character you get stagerlocked meaning you are unable to do anything about it
                                    Not true get gud
Why you gonna put this person on blast when ypur playing two characters that are flawed also you shouldn't put people on blast your just toxic
    Cry
        So you rather be toxic in a game to show that your a nobody in your own life btw you were spamming so maybe stop playing games and touch grass
            I do touch grass and I bench more than you 👍
                Wow such a tough guy okg I'm shivering in my boots idiot you just proved my point you probably only life that controller and those twinkies in to your mouth
                Your rep 100 and you think your gonna win an argument about being outside and working out bro you live your life on that game
                    Bro what’s your bench?
                        I don't I dint have to work out I'm naturally skinny and watch what I eat and you know go outside if you did the same yoy wouldn't have to lie about working out
                            You need proofs bro?🙏🏻💀
                                Proof your life is sad your a level 100 in a game you posted your own sadness nothing you will ever do will make you less sad or depressing go outside meet someone stop playing a game like just talking to you is making me depressed get out of that sad dark basement and go outside like level 100 get a life
                                    Bro how can you be this serious 😭🙏🏻
I’m just fucking with you, I play the game since it’s release bro I don’t play it much I just never dropped it, and I like to sometimes do funny vids about it, it’s nothing serious, and btw be a good boy and go gym it’s good for the health, being skinny or fat is not good 👍
Nah like fr, bro can’t parry a single hit
    It was so painful to watch
        Even more painful to play against him
    should pick up orochi and show him real spam looks like LMAO
This comment is so funny bruh 💀
Lmaooo 😭
Truly amazing that they exist 😭🙏🏻
    Had a similar experience happen today. Guy got hit with glads unblockable heavies over and over. 2 rounds I didn't feint a single one. He messaged me calling me a spammer, but this little nugget made me lol. https://imgur.com/gallery/Cpqv7pX
You can't block while hitstunned jsyk
    aside from the bash light combos he could’ve, he just tired to go for the light parry’s and missed
    Yes, you can. Landing one light does not garuntee a second one.
        That is entirely dependent on which character you are playing
            Prove it, then. I know for a fact it isn't. I've played since the beta, and I play every character. You are wrong
                Then you definitely haven't played since beta 😂
                    That's not proof
                        Kid stfu if you had actually played that long youd know in right

Bro picked the worst character of the game After getting cooked and thought "nah i'd win"
And he’s not new he’s rep 400
    Jeez. That video kills my soul as an ex-GM.

*Wait this isnt FHR I forgot.
                        Bet. Place date and time
That’s what I was trying to prove when I chose shugoki 💀
Not only slow but another tip that's helped me and probably many others get into the rhythm of the game is that,
 at first it's good to try blocking most attacks and not tense up and Parry everything.

The more comfortable you get with blocking the more capable you'll probably get parrying later.
Nah, i play slow and people complain about me staring, this community Will find a reason to hate you one way or another.
Although i"ll admit that sometimes im way to slow but the point remains
    I’d rather be too slow and play space than not think ahead
        https://youtube.com/shorts/S6uBdTFDuoY?si=8TTpuAnn4AVTFXnI
You can literally see he’s always trying to spam on every situation
    there was an instance in round 3 of shugo v glad where he tried deflecting but it was fully charged, then tried punching you out of a fully charged. the brain is working but you were punishing all his attempts at defense and countering so in the later duels he just went monke mode with spamming every chance he got to crack ANYTHING open and keep it going to get damage. i think this explains his choice of HL, highlander can take a mile if you give him an inch.
        Fair but there were full two games that he wasn’t trying anything
            i chalk that up to decision fatigue, being on the defensive for that long and having to consider a swathe of neutral options wears you down fast. at that point he must’ve just been thinking exclusively in the present, nothing about how he could adapt his behaviour or how to mix you up or any information he could use to survive. he was just getting hit and hit and hit. [this video by core-a explains this better](https://youtu.be/g4-EyNJhcQ8?si=ktNZBuCTO_2Pfn8M)
                Bro pulled out a whole 15 minute video 💀
                    its a good vid :) i like core-a
                        Fine I’ll watch it 😭
And he’s rep 400
    Rep 23 here. 

My game plan; HEAVY! oh shit. He blocked. What do?
        Bro I won by doing this plan 💀
            Then it sounds like I can do it too lol
                I believe in you!🫡
Shugo bonk is the most fun
    True🫡
(I do)
I just decided to bonk him
    *BONK* was very effective
        Indeed
Я не был на равном уровне с этим бро 😭🙏🏻
    Но всё же можно позавидовать его упорству. Я бы не смог переигрывать с челом которого я засрал, после того как он тупо каждый раунд насилует меня не напрягаясь
        Пхахахахахах сука ты так смешно это написал
            Same
                Bro speaks Russian 💀
Jelena Rozga - Bižuterija. Рекомендую послушать и другие её песни. (:
Thanks bro 🙏🏻 he was rep 400 too
Idk bro it was 4 am
Bizuterija
    Koji kurac? Hahahahahh uplašio me autoplay i Rozga
        Bro I don’t speak whatever the fuck this language is
            That's the language of the song...
                Cool
                    I agree, Slavic languages are cool indeed
                        I know I speak russian
                            The only thing I know in Russian is "Ya ne govoryu po Russkii"
            Bro it's the language the song is in lmao
                Cool 💀
He was also rep 400 bruh💀
Best strat
🤣
Bonk! 🫡

Fr..
Funniest comment
Definitely
I didn’t spam him 💀
I did I just didn’t put it in the vid
    Good person, giving that dude the hugs they never got when they were young.
        Lmao why are you so cruel 💀
            Only to bad players who tilt message blaming better players for their shortcomings. Keep up the good work showing em where they really belong, fellow warrior.
                🫡respect
Lmao I hear it too even without the sound 💀
Like fr why
    It's crazy how Hippocratical people can be
        Like I don’t even care about the spam fr, he’s the only one who genuinely cares
            Yeah, don't get me wrong, spam can be annoying at times. Especially for me because I can't properly time the blocks and parrys
                Naw bro like I get mad too, but I never send messages to strangers asking them for a 1v1 to fill my ego 😭
                    Fr man, like how low on chromosomes do you have to be to ask for a 1v1 just to fill your ego
                        Probably the amount of chromosomes that guy has
Wdym?
    Well I've practiced against certain moves in the training but due to having a latency of 70 against the opponent who has 10-20 I literally can't get a parry in
        Lmao sometimes it happens to all of us
            It's because is sooooo good at the game that it has to nerfy skill qoth garbage latency
                I believe you
I’m crying
    T-T
The best part 🤣
Thank you 🙏🏻😭
Bro is speaking facts 💀
Yeah lmao and he’s overall 400 something reps
    Hoooow,really...HOW
        I have no idea 🤷🏻‍♂️
Don’t need to imagine 😎
😉
😂
SPAM
Probably what he was thinking
Save Europe
Same
He did a lil bit
Honestly I don’t play shugoki so I can’t relate
    He's fun
        I know
He did
Almost succeeded
Fr like just let people do what they want
I’m so wrong
Thank you
Same tbh
I’m sad for you
    I know I’m sad for me too… those graphics for ps5 is so crisp
That’s why I picked shugoki 😅
Like fr
Lmaooo you make me feel bad for him kinda 😅
BONK!
He tried deflecting once 🫡
Truly a fun moment
I don’t speak this language sadly
    It's the language of the song.
        Cool
And losses to a rep 1 centurion
    While having 37 reps on roach 🪳
        Tbf 37 reps on orochi doesn't involve much improvement so I'd say you were about equal 👍
            I agree most braindead orochi people are for some reason the highest reps
Lmao 🤣
Lmao 🤣
Lmaooo
Like that’s just what I was saying
Fr
But top heavy is better
😂
Literally me
True but he has like 400 reps overall he’s just bad at everything
    HOLY FUCK I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE THAT LOOOOOOOL AYE IF HE IN HERE I HOPE HE SPEAK UP WITH AN EXCUSE.
🤣
    The play style killed me you play very similar to how I do 😂 you got to the point where you literally did spam hoping he’d parry and he still didn’t and lost 💀
        Lmao yes I just wanted to make him parry once 💀
    Mans a bot
        Lvl 1 bot
            Literally
                😞
So true 💀
Literally
Fr lmao
I did it on purpose to make him angry 😅
    Nws I do the same thing with jorm, they say that I am spamming and then I start doing it for real, priceless reactions everytime😂
How much reps you got?
    45
        Nice, keep up the grind, I’m 101 rn
Bro got confused 😅
I agree, but he’s dogshit, he had 12 reps on him 😅
Fr
Lmao this is so real
Also I find it funny dude said parry other dude responded "k" where was the parry 
I didn’t?
    That was fast. From what I see bro it seems like you’d throw a heavy into an unblockable or just throw an unblockable. I’m not accusing you directly but commonly centurions do that. It was kinda spam. Not a single light, I’ll say that.
        Bro I’m 1 rep with centurion against his 37 rep orochi, what’s the problem here
            I’m not leaving much in the dark, you kinda went spammy on him. Same with Pharoah (that’s what I call the Egyptian dude from the beginning of your clip) you threw a nasty ass light spam 😂
                Bro didn’t block my hits why wouldn’t i continue my combo
                    Yeah it’s kinda hard to block light spam bro, that’s why it’s effective 😂
                        Bro I rewatched the vid and I hit him with only 3 light what are you on
                            Listen bro I’m not gonna fight with you, but when you say “just parry it” and then load into a 1v1 and then pull the same shit, it’s not a good rep 😂
                                Bruh I picked the easiest character to parry
                            Ive never played as Pharoah, but I’ve played against him plenty, and you can def spam with him.
                                Okay but I don’t LIGHTSPAM
                        I used more zone and heavy attacks
    Yeah rewatching the clip now you def used like 80% unblockables and guardbreaks 😂
        Wdym I only used an unblockable ones, and two guard breaks
            I counted 9 attacks that have that orange glow, counting the faint you did
                Bro that’s bashes 💀
                    Alr, you responded in like 3 different messages, and I’m not gonna respond to all of them separately. Stop fighting small battles dude. Idc what move you used, you’re repetitive af, and I’m being generous in saying you’re BORDERING spam.
                        Chill 💀
                            Chill? Bro what tone are you reading my messages with 😂 I’m just talking
                                Idk like an annoying teacher type of tone 🤣
Shugoki is a spammer? 💀
    Like I only picked him since I thought he’s the less spammer out of all heroes

        Bro spamming is when you throw a lot of attacks over a short time 💀
            [deleted]

                    [deleted]
                        I thought you’re serious for a second 😭
If I’d needed to I would
Bro I wasn’t trying 💀
    Then don't tell others to try
        Bro I wasn’t the one who messaged a stranger and asked for a 1v1 💀
            🤓
                Cry more
                    😩
I won’t, I just wanted to prove he’s brain dead that’s why I did only top heavies
    fair enough lmao
        Lmao
🤓☝🏻
YES.
Lmaooo 😭
I just don’t care I wasn’t trying to prove I’m not spamming
    I mean he’s definitely in the wrong for taking the time to message you, talk shit and set up a 1v1 and lose don’t get me wrong, and you’d probably beat me in a 1v1 so I don’t have much room for talking either honestly
You don’t get hit stunned by lights
    How long have you played this game for???

You get hit by any attack your character staggers and if your character has fast enough swing speed like medjay whos swing speed is out of this world busted

You can just infinite light chain them and they can't move their guard to block or dodge out of it
        Like 2000 hours
            2000 hours and you still spam

No wonder every hates this games playerbase
                Just parry
                    Can't parry while stagerlocked
                        You can parry whenever, only when you are stunned by a bash you can’t parry
                            Or guardbreaked
                            In order to parry your guard has to be in the same direction as the incoming attack

You cant change your guard direction while staggered, if you are light spammed by a fast character you get stagerlocked meaning you are unable to do anything about it
                                Not true get gud
Cry
    So you rather be toxic in a game to show that your a nobody in your own life btw you were spamming so maybe stop playing games and touch grass
        I do touch grass and I bench more than you 👍
            Wow such a tough guy okg I'm shivering in my boots idiot you just proved my point you probably only life that controller and those twinkies in to your mouth
            Your rep 100 and you think your gonna win an argument about being outside and working out bro you live your life on that game
                Bro what’s your bench?
                    I don't I dint have to work out I'm naturally skinny and watch what I eat and you know go outside if you did the same yoy wouldn't have to lie about working out
                        You need proofs bro?🙏🏻💀
                            Proof your life is sad your a level 100 in a game you posted your own sadness nothing you will ever do will make you less sad or depressing go outside meet someone stop playing a game like just talking to you is making me depressed get out of that sad dark basement and go outside like level 100 get a life

                            Idk like an annoying teacher type of tone 🤣
Like I only picked him since I thought he’s the less spammer out of all heroes

    Bro spamming is when you throw a lot of attacks over a short time 💀
        [deleted]
            Bro I have 2 reps in shugoki 💀

Then don't tell others to try
    Bro I wasn’t the one who messaged a stranger and asked for a 1v1 💀
        🤓
            Cry more
                😩
fair enough lmao
    Lmao
I mean he’s definitely in the wrong for taking the time to message you, talk shit and set up a 1v1 and lose don’t get me wrong, and you’d probably beat me in a 1v1 so I don’t have much room for talking either honestly
How long have you played this game for???

You get hit by any attack your character staggers and if your character has fast enough swing speed like medjay whos swing speed is out of this world busted

You can just infinite light chain them and they can't move their guard to block or dodge out of it
    Like 2000 hours
        2000 hours and you still spam

No wonder every hates this games playerbase
            Just parry
                Can't parry while stagerlocked
                    You can parry whenever, only when you are stunned by a bash you can’t parry
                        Or guardbreaked
                        In order to parry your guard has to be in the same direction as the incoming attack

You cant change your guard direction while staggered, if you are light spammed by a fast character you get stagerlocked meaning you are unable to do anything about it
                            Not true get gud
So you rather be toxic in a game to show that your a nobody in your own life btw you were spamming so maybe stop playing games and touch grass
    I do touch grass and I bench more than you 👍
        Wow such a tough guy okg I'm shivering in my boots idiot you just proved my point you probably only life that controller and those twinkies in to your mouth
        Your rep 100 and you think your gonna win an argument about being outside and working out bro you live your life on that game
            Bro what’s your bench?
                I don't I dint have to work out I'm naturally skinny and watch what I eat and you know go outside if you did the same yoy wouldn't have to lie about working out
                    You need proofs bro?🙏🏻💀
                        Proof your life is sad your a level 100 in a game you posted your own sadness nothing you will ever do will make you less sad or depressing go outside meet someone stop playing a game like just talking to you is making me depressed get out of that sad dark basement and go outside like level 100 get a life
                            Bro how can you be this serious 😭🙏🏻
I’m just fucking with you, I play the game since it’s release bro I don’t play it much I just never dropped it, and I like to sometimes do funny vids about it, it’s nothing serious, and btw be a good boy and go gym it’s good for the health, being skinny or fat is not good 👍
Even more painful to play against him
That is entirely dependent on which character you are playing
    Prove it, then. I know for a fact it isn't. I've played since the beta, and I play every character. You are wrong
        Then you definitely haven't played since beta 😂
            That's not proof
                Kid stfu if you had actually played that long youd know in right

Fair but there were full two games that he wasn’t trying anything
    i chalk that up to decision fatigue, being on the defensive for that long and having to consider a swathe of neutral options wears you down fast. at that point he must’ve just been thinking exclusively in the present, nothing about how he could adapt his behaviour or how to mix you up or any information he could use to survive. he was just getting hit and hit and hit. [this video by core-a explains this better](https://youtu.be/g4-EyNJhcQ8?si=ktNZBuCTO_2Pfn8M)
        Bro pulled out a whole 15 minute video 💀
            its a good vid :) i like core-a
                Fine I’ll watch it 😭
Bro I won by doing this plan 💀

Bro I don’t speak whatever the fuck this language is
    That's the language of the song...
        Cool
            I agree, Slavic languages are cool indeed
                I know I speak russian
                    The only thing I know in Russian is "Ya ne govoryu po Russkii"
    Bro it's the language the song is in lmao
        Cool 💀
Lmao why are you so cruel 💀
    Only to bad players who tilt message blaming better players for their shortcomings. Keep up the good work showing em where they really belong, fellow warrior.

Like I don’t even care about the spam fr, he’s the only one who genuinely cares
    Yeah, don't get me wrong, spam can be annoying at times. Especially for me because I can't properly time the blocks and parrys
        Naw bro like I get mad too, but I never send messages to strangers asking them for a 1v1 to fill my ego 😭
            Fr man, like how low on chromosomes do you have to be to ask for a 1v1 just to fill your ego
                Probably the amount of chromosomes that guy has
Lmao sometimes it happens to all of us
    It's because is sooooo good at the game that it has to nerfy skill qoth garbage latency
        I believe you
I have no idea 🤷🏻‍♂️
I know
Cool
Tbf 37 reps on orochi doesn't involve much improvement so I'd say you were about equal 👍
    I agree most braindead orochi people are for some reason the highest reps
Lmao yes I just wanted to make him parry once 💀
Lvl 1 bot
    Literally
        😞
Nice, keep up the grind, I’m 101 rn
Bro I’m 1 rep with centurion against his 37 rep orochi, what’s the problem here
    I’m not leaving much in the dark, you kinda went spammy on him. Same with Pharoah (that’s what I call the Egyptian dude from the beginning of your clip) you threw a nasty ass light spam 😂
        Bro didn’t block my hits why wouldn’t i continue my combo
            Yeah it’s kinda hard to block light spam bro, that’s why it’s effective 😂
                Bro I rewatched the vid and I hit him with only 3 light what are you on
                    Listen bro I’m not gonna fight with you, but when you say “just parry it” and then load into a 1v1 and then pull the same shit, it’s not a good rep 😂
                        Bruh I picked the easiest character to parry
                    Ive never played as Pharoah, but I’ve played against him plenty, and you can def spam with him.
                        Okay but I don’t LIGHTSPAM
                I used more zone and heavy attacks
Wdym I only used an unblockable ones, and two guard breaks
    I counted 9 attacks that have that orange glow, counting the faint you did
        Bro that’s bashes 💀
            Alr, you responded in like 3 different messages, and I’m not gonna respond to all of them separately. Stop fighting small battles dude. Idc what move you used, you’re repetitive af, and I’m being generous in saying you’re BORDERING spam.

Listen bro I’m not gonna fight with you, but when you say “just parry it” and then load into a 1v1 and then pull the same shit, it’s not a good rep 😂
    Bruh I picked the easiest character to parry
Ive never played as Pharoah, but I’ve played against him plenty, and you can def spam with him.
    Okay but I don’t LIGHTSPAM
Chill? Bro what tone are you reading my messages with 😂 I’m just talking
    Idk like an annoying teacher type of tone 🤣
Or guardbreaked
In order to parry your guard has to be in the same direction as the incoming attack

You cant change your guard direction while staggered, if you are light spammed by a fast character you get stagerlocked meaning you are unable to do anything about it
    Not true get gud
Proof your life is sad your a level 100 in a game you posted your own sadness nothing you will ever do will make you less sad or depressing go outside meet someone stop playing a game like just talking to you is making me depressed get out of that sad dark basement and go outside like level 100 get a life
    Bro how can you be this serious 😭🙏🏻
I’m just fucking with you, I play the game since it’s release bro I don’t play it much I just never dropped it, and I like to sometimes do funny vids about it, it’s nothing serious, and btw be a good boy and go gym it’s good for the health, being skinny or fat is not good 👍
