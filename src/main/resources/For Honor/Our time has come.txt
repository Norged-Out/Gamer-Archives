[[Our time has come]]





why the hell do these fuckers seek you out from like 5m away when you’re doing literally anything? They’ll be walking along to go damage the ram or some shit and then for no reason like 3 of them will break off from the group and try to poke you for no reason.
    They exist only to be a menace. I’ll just be chillin drinking my cool aid and checking my phone then all of a sudden I hear their damn grunts
        >They exist only to be a menace. 

Precisely.

        I'll be here chilling, then i hear in the distance "KEEP THE RAM MOVIIIIIING"
            the only ones i hear from that retard is “PROTECT THE RAMMM!!!” and “CLEAR THE RAM!!!!”
        Cool aid, the off brand Kool-Aid
    for real. I was minding my own business at my summer home when I heard a knock. I answered it and 3 of those cunts stabbed me and ran
    Bro there would be like a captain and 2 friendly pikemen but they still decide to solely poke the shit outta you
    Yeah what I hate the most is that they can interrupt your block and split second stun you if they hit you on the side you're not blocking, but if they're going to hit you a split second before an actual hero's hit, and you go to block the soldiers hit, it won't chain the blocks and you'll eat whatever the hero threw at you. Makes zero sense to me. None whatsoever, so even if you're a Good at blocking, if you have half a bar of health left and you're fighting 1 hero with a random pikeman nearby, you have a good chance you're going to die.
        It's pretty nice at the very least when you're the *one* player defending the ram on your team
    Like no joke I would think that my execution is far away from they're "scheduled destination to the ram" but nah they focus on me anyway.
    You gotta admit though, those pokes hurt.
or revive!
    Even with quick revive they come at mach speed just to interrupt it.
        Yeah they slog like snails when they need to defend the ram just to get shot by archer points, but the second you try to revive or execute someone they fucking teleport on your ass
    You can still revive after being poked, just keep pressing your revive button.
        Blocking them for a moment is also just as fast and you wont lose health
            How do you block pikemans’ attack? Do you have to be in guard mode?
                Yes, and I think guard direction matters. Pretty sure it won't feed revenge and ofc you cant block the 20 poking you from behind. TL;DR, always thrust forward!
This looks high effort. I like it. Have an upvote
This is too true. It almost hurts.
I WAS CHOSEN BY HEAVEN!

I love these 'me and the boys' memes. Is there a subreddit for them?

&#x200B;

r/MeAndTheBoys perhaps?

&#x200B;

Edit: It already exists! r/meandtheboysmemes
Time to use hitokiri
    So many People still don't realise that a Hitokiri's execution can be interrupted with a gb
        Pretty sure bashes work too
            Well, bashes work too, but not all characters have them.
        I.... Am one of them.... Thank you stranger.
            Np. Bashes also work
        At least minions won’t poke u out of it now
        Shhhh I don’t want them to learn
        pretty sure minions don't gb
            Yep, minions don't gb. Officers do. Especially if you run next to them, they often gb you
                really? never happened to me outside Arcade.
                    Try running by the tall boi in Breach, he will grab you
    there needs to be a sequel meme where a hitokiri looms large over them from behind and they start sweating.
Me and the boys waiting that this post reaches hot
I need a chat quote that just says “FUCKING PIKEMEN!”
Fucking hell you're about to land the finishing blow for your execution and suddenly you get butt stabbed by a three foot man with a sharp stick.
And so have we
    We'll laugh last cause you got interrupted
        The damage done, the pain subsides
            And I can see the salt clear when I look into your eyes
Please put minion executions back in, those were so cool
    Like they were in the single player? I only just started playing, never saw these unless it’s the ones used in story mode. I found myself wishing those animations were in multiplayer a few times.
        Yeah,  those minion executions were in multiplayer up until marching fire.
            Was it ever explained why they were removed? I can understand maybe for the arcade mode, took slightly too long to execute when surrounded by 3 bleedy bois and burning to death. But seems like it should be a tactical risk in the other modes.
                Its because their too lazy to make it for the new characters most likely
                    Yeah, that’s the consencus from posts I read on the matter. Such a shame they removed a cool feature from existing characters for such a trivial reason.

Again, as somebody who just started playing, I don’t really know what I’m missing in it’s entirety. The campaign was enough to make me question why it wasn’t in the other modes. Oh well
                        They looked really good too, imo centerion had the best one
                        From my eyes its to normalize minion clearing as a whole. Some minion clear animations of other heroes are inefficient when it comes to time and still are after the removal.
    I miss them so much
Hitokiri: *laughs in execution*
Too true im about to exicute and out of nowhere one of the soldiers tickles me out of it
[deleted]
    *laughs in kick feint to gb*
This is why i hate anything bigger than a 2v2. I'll literally be capturing something, my teammates are bad then all get killed, and I get stuck in a 3v1 situation, EVERY SINGLE TIME in dominion.
Perfection
Shouldn’t there only be 3 Boys?

EDIT: ANNND I realized they’re Pikemen after I hit send.
Sadlander noises
I'll see you in hot.
This is beautiful
That's a good one. Nice work!
*laughs in fast kill time*
r/2007scape leaking?
Can this be the subreddit Wallpaper/Banner for like a week or on a Meme day? This one actually made me chuckle. Well done.
We call this: 

Pikeman, Interrupted starring Julia Roberts.
Just play Hitokiri, you'll forget they ever existed
Cant wait to do 5 dmg
High effort meme 👌🏿
cool long execution you got there...it would be a shame if we interrupt it by poking you - pikemen
This pisses me off all the time.
Yet what would this game type even be without the pikemen? I see people legitimately complain about them, but without the pikemen, Breach would be significantly boring.
Vortiger= *upgraded pikeman*
Did somebody order a cheeky 10 damage?
Can someone tell me how the devs allowing minions to interrupt executions and revives improved FH? Why was that decision made?
Love it.
I breathed out my nose too hard at this
interrupting someone’s respawn
Feel the wrath of the long dong of justice. No it isn't a lawdad.
*Laughs as Hitokiri*
Best version of this meme so far 👌 Nice one.
Ahh pikemen, I hate you so much.
For real
Fuck pikemen.
Lol revenge of the pikemen
* laughs in manslayer *
I am so glad i am a sakura main and have the uninterruptable execution
I hate to say it. But, sometimes it’s not an accident 😂
*...and so have I. I laugh last cuz you came to die. The damage done, the pain subsides, and I can see fear clear when I look in your eye.*
Not my sakura
I love this so much
Laughs in hitokiri feat 1 while executing
To whoever at Ubisoft who thought this was a good idea...

I am midly annoyed. Maybe you could tone it down a bit? Please? :(
IT'S SO TRUE
I hate you
Hitokiri : I don't think so.
Anybody noticed lbs new top unblock animation (he doesnt always uses it)
Meanwhile I laugh at the four of them as I insta execute my opponents with BP.
SAVED LOL
***laughs in hitokiri***
These motherfuckers
Or a revive
I say these guys become a new knight character so we can control the menace, who’s with me!?
They exist only to be a menace. I’ll just be chillin drinking my cool aid and checking my phone then all of a sudden I hear their damn grunts
