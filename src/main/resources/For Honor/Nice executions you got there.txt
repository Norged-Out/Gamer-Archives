[[Nice executions you got there]]





In samurai, they give their enemies chance to kill themselves. Its honorable. For them. To commit seppuku
    Yeah, I’m surprised people don’t know about the “Freeing from the pain” portion of Seppuku. I like they added that. Although I thought Seppuku didn’t just mean to just stab yourself, but to actually cut your guts out. Start at the left of the belly and slide it to the right to have your entrails spill out, then you’re decapitated to be freed from the pain. Maybe that’s specifically Harakiri, who knows.
        It still freaks me out the way they sheath the katana and carry the bare blade with the hand. 
Is it this hard to add a saya??? It’s an important part for the katana!
            Same with warden, pk and the rest of the cast who use swords
                I know what you mean but it was actually quite “common” for knights to carry a sword bare handed when engaging from a fight to another (not sure how a pk would deal with this though).
My point is that the saya plays a crucial point for the Katana in the japanese history. 

Throwing away your saya meant disrespecting the sword and the smith, which was something you wouldn’t do as a samurai (disrespect and being dishonorable was one of the worst things one could be/do)
And a good smith was/is seen highly in that time and still today. 

But hey, who am I trying to be historically correct with a game that added a hero who can teleport behind you. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
                    Yeah I'm aware of that. I would love to see saya on my Aramusha. The reason they didn't do it is probably because of the gear stats (now perks), although they could have added it to be purely cosmetic like ornaments or materials.
                        Exactly my thought! 
But I doubt it will ever happen. 

We just have to start cringing everytime we see this and deal with it like real warriors haha
                            With how the new executions turned out I can tell you right now that it won't happen. Ubi is slowly giving up on this game
                                I know, I know. 
I just hope otherwise.. there is still hope for the next gen...
                        They could've even made a Saya that changes depending on your blade or grip to match it and not be ankther cosmetic that you spend 30k on applying
                    >
But hey, who am I trying to be historically correct with a game that added a hero who can teleport behind you. ¯\(ツ)/¯

Shaolin monks can teleport behind you and to close friends in fights in real life, duh.
                        I love how they said that block damage is unrealistic and shouldnt be in the game and a few months later they ad a teleporting shaolin
                            Teleporting shaolins are realistic, watchumean
                    You're really glamorizing samurai. Lots of them were not this fictitious idea of the utmost honorable warrior
                        Yes. This one.

Honorable People were everywhere, and no social Group were somehow magical in drawing them, or making them.
                    Thanks for the info, didn't know the saya had such symbolic significance for samurai!

I assumed the reason Wardens carry their blades by hand is because they're wearing armored gauntlets and don't care if the edge gets a little scuffed by the gauntlets because blade sharpness isn't as important to them because their fighting style includes using the sword as a bludgeon or quarter staff?
                        Exactly.

That’s why there are executions (which actually happened in. Real life as well) where warden graps the blade and slams the hilt into your neck. 
Not going to happen with a katana, since they wore mostly leather gauntlets so they had superior handlich of the blade. 
So basically of a samurai would do this with his katana, he would chop of his fingers with the force of the impact + the fact that a tsuba is/was mostly round so it’s stupid to do this.
                            Right yeah! That reminds me how annoying it is that samurai wear wooden armor in this game when that's not at all what they wore historically haha
                                A lot of weired things are happening in for Honor... 
like teleporting monkeys and ninja’s and stuff. 

I just wished they would at least give an eye to those little things. 
That would make the game 200% cooler and I would even consider to walk with Orochi the Rep70 road. 

Also considering the armor thing, they were able to give the knights decent armor and so... but hey knights and vikings are easier to design that the japanese I guess? 

Even the wu-lin have decent armor...
                                    Yeah not a fan of that monkey magic idiot personally

The samurai armor is just weird because they wore metal armor so why go out of their way to invent wooden armor they never wore haha
            Yeah, it always freak me about that orochi sheath right but without any Saya: I'd someone would do that for real even with the leather armor he would cuts himself anyway
            It honestly ruins the immersion for me, in the stupidest way.
            Its actually not a katana. Kensei uses a No Dachi.
                I think he was referring to the katana they use on the new exec, as kensei doesn't actually sheath his nodashi
            Hey got your wish dude
                For Kyoshin yeah but still not for Orochi ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
        Correct me if I am wrong but I don't think you are supposed to be decapitated. Your head is still attached to your body by some skin. If your head was to get cut off and roll that would have been seen as embarrassing.
            It depends. I’m no expert myself but I believe that it’s actually considered disrespectful to not completely sever the head. However the rolling head is still not something that was desireable. The most skilled executioners developed a method where they would only slice through a very specific part of the neck and hit a part of the spine that proved instantly fatal, with the only evidence of execution being a small cut on the side of their neck. I believe this technique was called “Soul Cleansing” but I could be wrong.

Edit: If you want an example of this in game’s, Sekiro’s final execution is an example

 Go to 5:10 in the video
                I thought of sekiro before I even saw you say it
                    Hesitation is defeat
                        Isshina is kicking my ass T-T
                            I was gonna come up with some advice but "git gud" is the most succinct advice I have lol.

I've beaten him quite a few times now though so message me if you need help :)
                                >git gud

i love how this is a meme but genuinly sound advice for getting better at the game hahahaha
                            Well you can block his bullets with the umbrella, which powers it up. Now use the powered up umbrella (it gains a ranged projectile) to one shot him when he's in the air. Not the easiest way to beat him maybe but definetly the cheesiest.

The umbrella is pretty op in general tbh.
                                i use it incorrectly and it is still powerful hahahah
                                    People thinking it is a purely defensive piece of gear are sorely mistakenthe Suzaku variant also stunlocks every red eyes enemy in the game, just opening it close to them counts as fire damage iirc

Speaking of little known tactics, did you know that you can deathblow the Schimen warriors (the purple skull terrify guys) when they "jump?" And another, the fishy guys in Fountainhead are extremely weak to the poison blade, if you hit their block a few times with it their posture breaks.
                C1-C5 keep jack alive.

I've read that they would have retainers that would follow them on the battlefield. Their sole purpose would be to decapitate them if they had to seppuku
                    So breaking c1-c5 is lethal is what the rhyme is saying? Also do u have any other medical rhymes like that?
                        Yup, your c spine in general, but in particular the c1-5 vertebrae are what control essential life functions like your lungs and heart. You can lose the others and still be alive. Paralyzed depending on where, but still alive.

I don't remember any other rhymes, just that one was thrown around a lot in basic class.
                    I think it was generally a close friend or comrade of the person performing seppuku, could be wrong and might depend on the Era and region
                This game hands down has the most badass, beautiful combat of any game ever created
            So from what I know the person is supposed to cut their stomach across and then upwards from their belly button to their chest. Then another person finishes them via severing their head.
                This was actually a right given to the samurai committing sepuku. If the pain became too much to handle, they could ask to get their head cut off by a close friend.
                I think the amount of cutting was related to the act they had committed. The more dishonor, the more they would cut. If they did it upwards that meant they  had a lot of shame.
            If I’m not mistaken, there is a book called Hagakure which was a dictation by a prominent samurai, Yamamoto Tsunetomo, in his later life, written by a vassal. In it there was a passage describing how the goal of the Kaishaku, the executioner, was to cleave the neck close enough to the far edge of skin such that the remaining attached skin would hold the head to the body. It was considered lacking in grace and control to completely lob off the head.
            Right
        >Maybe that’s specifically Harakiri, who knows.

Seppuku and harakiri are synonyms. The former is derived from Chinese root words and considered more formal, while the latter is derived from native Japanese root words and typically not used in formal writing.
            Ah, I thought one was a bit more formal than the other. I knew they both meant the same thing, I just thought one may have been favoured when talking about a specific method of suicide.
                The hara is below the belly button. Kiri means cut. Harakiri basically means to cut the hara. Seppuku is the act of restoring your honor by killing yourself in the most painful way. Harakiri is the most painful way.
                To be more elaborate, harakiri simply means “belly (hara) cutting (kiri, also why it’s in Hitokiri’s name, “man cutter”)”. Seppuku is just the ritual name
        Yeah but the thing is. The executor sends the head rolling which is extremely disrespectful not only for the one dying but for the one killing. Only the most skilled swordsman were made to do this as it required you to break their spinal cord in your neck without cutting your head. Too little would result in increased pain. Too much would result in the head rolling.
        On the temple garden map the statues all have horizontal wounds on their stomachs, implying that as a depiction of their honored dead.
        Seppeku is when you told a frisbee in half and eat it so it expands in your neck
        I don’t believe harakiri was a term that was used for it until very recently. Other than that they’re synonymous.
        It is, but the spotter who cuts the head is there in case they can't finish the job themselves.
        Correct me if I'm ignorant, but what part about disemboweling yourself is "freeing from the pain"?
            I don't think it is. Samurai cut open their bellies to die painfully and "restore their honor".

The decapitation was there so you didn't spend 5 minutes bleeding out, hence "freeing from the pain".
                Think the beheading part was a backup if you were unable to properly kill yourself....ie cut deep enough to get the correct arteries so you don't spend a long time bleeding out 

I'm no expert though so take it as you will
                    It was not just a backup. Often a second was allowed to behead(well ideally cut the head without it rolling off) because no one actually wanted to disembowel themselves and no one wanted witness it either.

See: [Kaishakunin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaishakunin)
        Yeah, you are right, however, there is no difference between seppuku and harakiri, however, “seppuku” is the formal and respectful form of saying it, while “harakiri” literally means “slicing open the abdomen with a dagger”, which is way less formal
    They were also given the option to get their head cut off by a friend if the pain became unbearable. It’s crazy how accurate this is to samurai culture
    And then decapitate them.
        Yes to free them from pain
            Wasn't the point of Seppuku to allow them to honorably kill themselves and allow them just that. Killing them outright during the first stage of the act seems more dishonest.

Edit: Go through my later comments to see where I was proven wrong, let my dumbassary be a learning tool.
                Nah, im no expert but cutting head is part of that 'ritual' since cutting gut wont kill you quickly. I'll share a video with you if you want to know more tho. I dont remember all the things.

  


https://youtu.be/-oM8I7niF0Y
                    They had a man stand next to them with a sword drawn. If the one committing the ritual hesitated or started to pull out the blade he would cut off the head as to not allow them to dishonor themself.
                    If done correctly you'll sever the aorta, causing a rather rapid death through blood loss.
                        Yeah but you’ll get a more rapid death if your homie just cuts off your head.
                            Then the point of honorable suicide is diminished. The act pertains to holding onto what admiration, respect, dignity and honour you had left and doing the deed, yourself. 

You're taking that from them.
                                the decaptitation is most of the time requested by the one who commits suicide, they intentionally stretch their neck out to allow an easy cut
                                During the act of Seppuku, a second, known as a kaishakunin, stands ready nearby. This person is given explicit, personalised instructions as to at what moment they are to behead the Samurai - at the time of beheading, the kaishaku will pass their katana half way through the neck of the honoured warrior, allowing their neck to hang by a section of tissue in front of their torso, this is symbolic of the embrace of death - for some, the instruction was that if it looked like they might be overcome with pain and lose control they were to behead them. For others, the instruction was that as soon as the blade was irrevocably moving towards the belly they were to cut off the head.

 The kaishakunin does not diminish the act of honourable suicide. By standing ready to strike at the moment of greatest weakness, they preserve the honour of the act. It is ignorant to assume otherwise.
                                    It's fine to be ignorant, hence why I stopped replying. Everyone here is correcting me and I've learned more about the subject henceforth.

I won't delete my comments either so anyone who formerly thought they way I did, can see the misconceptions.

Small edit: Inclusion added.
                                They also cut their belly open, not just stab but you don't have guts falling out in the game. The head is also not supposed to roll around on the ground but again, such a thing is not in the game.

Either way, they plunge the blade, that's the moment of "death" for them, decapitation is just so they don't sit there and bleed with their guts out. And eventually it became a ritual and they wouldn't even stab themselves, just reach for something that is symbolic and get decapitated.
                its a bit complicated but the initial cut you do dring seppuku wont kill you, but it signals that you are honroable and die on your own, most people then strech out their head and show their neck as best as possible to allow a decapitation because that makes the process faster, unless you are a masochist and want to bleed out

&#x200B;

decapitation is friendly... its a mercy kill
                They're (old Japan) believed that soul/spirit is located in stomach. So cutting your stomach open before death will realise your soul into the world otherwise it will be trapped inside (until body completely decomposed I guess). 

Stomach standing is super painful cuz u hurt your liver. If u ever got hit in your liver u know how bad it is. Imagine how infinitely more painful it should be to get stabbed there. So cutting head of is act of mercy
                They did it anyways.  

It eventually got to the point where the disgraced samurai didn’t even reach for a sword, but rather something symbolic like a brush or fan, prompting the assistant to lop their head off.

Originally, you had no second to decapitate oh, and were supposed to cut deep enough to sever your aorta, since that would end it pretty quickly.  To that end, you’d just carve yourself up until you got it.
                if the pain was too much they would ask someone close to them to cut off their head to end it
    I know the whole sudoku stuff 

I just think the fact they tell you to kill yourself Is funny to me
        It was a way to allow yourself honour in death. Despite any atrocious act in life, the Japanese believes everyone deserved equal treatment in death. It allows their lineage to not be stained with the wrongdoings of their past. It’s a very interesting part of their culture.
    well its a honorable death while knights and vikings dont even want to kill em
    I think most people know about that, but the post is just a joke
Vikings - "Ready to drink mead in the great hall!?"
    Knight: *fucking drops dead*
        His name is Larry.
            Don't disrespect larry
        Viking: \*urp\* Fuckin pansy.
    VALHALLAAAAA!
wu lin be like: LÄMPP
    “I shall guide your soul to the afterlife. Be safe on your journey.”
        I love this lamp execution
            I would love it, but the royal walkup while their lifeless body just smacks into the ground makes it super awkward imo.
                Yea that is unfortunate i hate that part too but the lantern part tho its nice
                Yeah that is weird
    WOU NAI LAMP
It isn't in a mocking way, they give them a dagger so that they can commit sepuku and restore their honor
    I know the actual meaning 

And I don’t think that the scene I take the samurai bit from is mocking either 

However kill yourself is a common insult over the internet and that makes it kinda funny to me
    That's the *intent*, yes. We all know how it's gonna be used, though.
This is high quality. Don't rule 4 pls
    Tiff pls no I spent like 20 minutes cropping those photos
    Tiff hopped on as soon as he saw the executions, knowing that the community will rant.
    The mods are the worst, I hope they don’t take the post down
    If you don’t photoshop a heroes head into the image it gets removed pretty much
Wait Avdol is a samurai 😔
    People would riot if he was a knight.

.....which is exactly why I want them to add middle eastern fighters to the knights faction 😏
        he’s a crusader technically
            A stardust crusaders to be more specific
                Someone call me?
Have you seen Highlanders executions?!
    I’m talking about the new shitty universal ones that got released today
        The Samurai and Viking ones aren’t shitty at all.
            agreed
        I kinda like them. And given the circumstances I don't blame Ubisoft for the lack of unique executions.
        oi i like the viking and samurai ones
>No salt, much honor  

Fem raider: *I’m gonna piss in yer skull!*
But haven’t you seen that execution when kensei bows down!? Cmon that’s the most respect I’ve seen in the game
    Talking about new executions and how drastically different the samurai one is to the others 

I used Kensei because he was the first samurai that came to mind
        Oh shit my bag Haha nvm I haven’t been on the game in a bit
    I can't wait to see the new executions because the only Kensei execution I know that bows, is one of the most disrespectful in the game. Lmfao.
        How is a bows execution most disrespectful one and he bows in the end of that execution as well. Your idea of being disrespectful is very vague man, they are Execution like the opponent jumps like a dummy which is more "disrespectful" if that really matters or having skull crushed by foot with sword in the head (Highlander's) and all of them are respectful ? Like bruh smh
            Punch in the stomach, bows.  Slowly aims a bow at point blank range. Fires.

Giggles.


Also: one of the most disrespectful does not mean "the most disrespectful"

Hence the "one of the"
                Giggles ? Lmao he giggles after he fires the arrow ? Haha stop assuming things.
What are you on bruh ? 
Kensei has some of the most grateful executions and the least disrespectful ones.
                    ... Yes.

And he also has some of the most disrespectful.
                        Aka: loose something?
                            That one is funny
"Much respect" "no Salt here" Lmao please tell me how to find people like that on ubisoft servers.
MUHAMMED AVDOL
    YES I AM!
Haven't been able to play in a bit, are the executions for the faction or only for vanguards? Cause it's hard to imagine shugoki doing the seppuku execution and then home-running your ass from behind.
    It’s faction wide all use the same animation 

So shugoki just grabs a fucking sword then immediately shoves it back up his ass
“Oh you’re approaching me? Instead of running away to your teammates you are coming right at me?”

“I can’t shoulder bash the shit out of you without getting closer.”
Valkyrie literally has execution that used to be the enemy grabbing her boobs.
    Yeah but ubi pussied out
        Did they change the execution or what happened?
            The games rating doesn't support lewd things. It would technically have to be reevaluated to include Sexual/Suggestive Themes. The fix was that now Valk moves her shield in the way. It still kinda works, but no actual boob touch.
                Oh I never noticed they changed the execution
Yeah, I saw the knights and Vikings execution, and I was happy that Larry was having a good time before he died for the trillionth time. But then I saw the samurai execution and I felt bad for poor Larry.
Not to shit on arochi and kensi mains but anytime I go against them in 1v1s I lose to light spamming
    Orochi* kensei*
        \*orichi \*kensai
    Practice blocking. The chain stops if you block the first light unless you’re OOS or the opponent has revenge.
        See this is the only acceptable response to someone complaining about light spam
        [deleted]
            A quick google search told me that the average male reaction time is 284 milliseconds. Orochi’s opening light attack is 500ms (or 466ms, might’ve been changed and I can’t remember). Either way, 500ms is the average light attack speed for most characters and it’s perfectly reactable. Can you block a shugoki or kensei throwing a light at you, or a lawbringer or shaolin throwing side lights? Because those are all 500ms.
                [deleted]
                    I don't think he ever had light attacks that were faster than 300ms or so
    Unfortunately that's all kensei mains do nowadays, pure disgrace
        *pops unlockable feat*
Are these executions on live right now or Testing?
    Right now
        Then saving for Nuxia can wait, I got to make other players commit seppuku
            Yeah it’s the best execution out of a crappy bunch 

Nothing better than a stylised “kill yourself”
                Got it, used it, love it.
            Sorry but Nuxia is not from the faction that got the Seppuku Exec
                No, I mean I was saving for Nuxia, but I am goingto waste some silver on a execution.
I've been waiting for this execution since I started playing for honor
Literally just watched that exact episode of Jojo. I thought i had deja vu for a second
    POL-NA-RE-FFU
Unexpected JJBA?
i like the new executions a lot. and the Samurai one is also my favourite. The honor to assist in a seppoku is one of the highest they have/had.
I'm a simple man. I see a jojo reference, i upvote.
Not all that nice. Just super lazy, there's word these were done way before corona so dont blame that.
    The title is mildly sarcastic
we better get some compensation for this garbo lmao. Which is basically me saying, please, please make this new hero good. I beg of you ubi. If you can't deliver finishers, please give us a fun, in-depth balanced hero
True dat
The viking one is kinda bm
this is exactly what i thought of
With a lot of the samauri they already have a sword yet for the executions they get another and then it dissapears...
Is it a sword from the shadow realm??
Knights; And rise.....fuck, he's gonna get up in about fifteen seconds anyway, it's fine
Vikings; TOAST TOAST TOAST TOAST
Samurai; FuCkInG kIlL yOuRsElF loSer LoL
Wu lin; *Puts a soul lantern down* you fought well, worthy adversary
I completely forgot they were dropping new executions today and I was so hyped to hop on and check all of them out. Then I found out they just made a universal one for each faction. Color me fucking depressed.
LMAO, I actually made a meme of this on one of the game devs tweets. Oof
i like the chinese faction i forget the name of one. haven’t played in a while until today, but i really like it because it has cultural resemblance
Nice
I don't know why a Viking or a knight would commit seppeku.
    Bro they made a hero that can teleport and they put horns on the vikings helmets, are you really going to question Ubi logic now?
        Teleport? Wtf who?
            Shaolin,he can teleport to one of his teammates,and shinobi kind of teleports too
                Had no idea that shaolin can teleport to his friends damn Ubisoft.
Why, just why.
Anybody notice JoJo?
I think the most disrespectful execution is "Lose Something" its a Kensei execution
Is this a new Samurai execution? Not playing for a while now, can anyone link the execution if there is one.
    [Made by u/Hurans](https://v.redd.it/cm354qucfw251)
They were lazy with theses execution but I see why because of covid 19
Exactly if you brought dishonor to your clans name and your families heritage you were given a chance at redemption through a fatal blood letting typically plunged through the heart for a quick less painful and more honerable death... The fucked part us when he choos off your head decapitation was seen as an ultimate dishonor to am opponent in these times
    Even more reasons as to why it’s hilarious
Wait i dont understand this? Almost every execution kensei has, depicts his utmost respect for his opponent. Almost all the other factions just have decapitations save the wardens like, 2 honorable executions.
    The utmost respect of cutting of your opponents arm and laughing, or punching him in the stomach to shoot an arrow in his face.
        Im talking about, Yasuraka, Shizuka Ni Nemure, Kyudoka, these ones are undoubtedly the most honorable of all in the game. Bowing to your adversary?
            Look up the translation, generally whatever Kensei says is pretty mean during any execution.
With that said, the downvotes yo're getting are stupid
                I dont understand? [Like this is what google says?](https://imgur.com/Az9rdCK) Calm, quiet sleep, sorta thing. I cant speak for the other executions which you are probably referring too! But in the ones im postulating, these executions show honor and respect.
                    Can't give much examples cuz they're spanned accrocs multiple videos of execution translation, but here's one (at 1.30 / https://youtu.be/QN7cSxqQps8)

Of course there are respectful but I think in general he isn't, he's kindof like JJ in that sense
            That is respect. He’s ending his suffering. Something that was pretty common. It’s better than bleeding out
                Yes! I agree very much so, that level of respect is something not seen to frequently outside of specifically Kensei's execution sets.
                    Something I find funny is how the Viking one is somewhat respect. It’s them just saying. “Ay I know you’re going to die. How about one last drink” I love it
    This is about the 3 faction executions that were just added.
        4*
        Oh gotcha! Thanks for the clarification!
Vikings missed out a prefect opportunity for faction execution with a blood eagle 🦅 🩸
    As much as I'd love a long-ass Blood Eagle execution, I don't think For Honor's gore system would support flaying someone's back. All we have are blood splatters and severed body parts. If they made a For Honor 2 and wanted to really sell the brutality, they could model muscles and bones beneath the skin, and burned skin textures. Would allow for some extremely graphic deaths.
    Man that's such a good idea!
Why the downvotes tho
        People don’t like blood haha
            I think it’s because the engine can’t handle it. But amazing idea that’d be gruesome
Prop executions are dumb, fight me.
    Most of the time I’d agree

I think what gets me the most is how weird characters look with the weapon sheathed
I only upvoted because Jojo meme
The new executions are dogshit lets be real here.
    The samurai one is the only good one 

The rest are just plain unsatisfying
        I think the Viking one was really good
Yeah, I’m surprised people don’t know about the “Freeing from the pain” portion of Seppuku. I like they added that. Although I thought Seppuku didn’t just mean to just stab yourself, but to actually cut your guts out. Start at the left of the belly and slide it to the right to have your entrails spill out, then you’re decapitated to be freed from the pain. Maybe that’s specifically Harakiri, who knows.
    It still freaks me out the way they sheath the katana and carry the bare blade with the hand. 
Is it this hard to add a saya??? It’s an important part for the katana!
        Same with warden, pk and the rest of the cast who use swords
            I know what you mean but it was actually quite “common” for knights to carry a sword bare handed when engaging from a fight to another (not sure how a pk would deal with this though).
My point is that the saya plays a crucial point for the Katana in the japanese history. 

Throwing away your saya meant disrespecting the sword and the smith, which was something you wouldn’t do as a samurai (disrespect and being dishonorable was one of the worst things one could be/do)
And a good smith was/is seen highly in that time and still today. 

But hey, who am I trying to be historically correct with a game that added a hero who can teleport behind you. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
                Yeah I'm aware of that. I would love to see saya on my Aramusha. The reason they didn't do it is probably because of the gear stats (now perks), although they could have added it to be purely cosmetic like ornaments or materials.
                    Exactly my thought! 
But I doubt it will ever happen. 

We just have to start cringing everytime we see this and deal with it like real warriors haha
                        With how the new executions turned out I can tell you right now that it won't happen. Ubi is slowly giving up on this game
                            I know, I know. 
I just hope otherwise.. there is still hope for the next gen...
                    They could've even made a Saya that changes depending on your blade or grip to match it and not be ankther cosmetic that you spend 30k on applying
                >
But hey, who am I trying to be historically correct with a game that added a hero who can teleport behind you. ¯\(ツ)/¯

Shaolin monks can teleport behind you and to close friends in fights in real life, duh.
                    I love how they said that block damage is unrealistic and shouldnt be in the game and a few months later they ad a teleporting shaolin
                        Teleporting shaolins are realistic, watchumean
                You're really glamorizing samurai. Lots of them were not this fictitious idea of the utmost honorable warrior
                    Yes. This one.

Honorable People were everywhere, and no social Group were somehow magical in drawing them, or making them.
                Thanks for the info, didn't know the saya had such symbolic significance for samurai!

I assumed the reason Wardens carry their blades by hand is because they're wearing armored gauntlets and don't care if the edge gets a little scuffed by the gauntlets because blade sharpness isn't as important to them because their fighting style includes using the sword as a bludgeon or quarter staff?
                    Exactly.

That’s why there are executions (which actually happened in. Real life as well) where warden graps the blade and slams the hilt into your neck. 
Not going to happen with a katana, since they wore mostly leather gauntlets so they had superior handlich of the blade. 
So basically of a samurai would do this with his katana, he would chop of his fingers with the force of the impact + the fact that a tsuba is/was mostly round so it’s stupid to do this.
                        Right yeah! That reminds me how annoying it is that samurai wear wooden armor in this game when that's not at all what they wore historically haha
                            A lot of weired things are happening in for Honor... 
like teleporting monkeys and ninja’s and stuff. 

I just wished they would at least give an eye to those little things. 
That would make the game 200% cooler and I would even consider to walk with Orochi the Rep70 road. 

Also considering the armor thing, they were able to give the knights decent armor and so... but hey knights and vikings are easier to design that the japanese I guess? 

Even the wu-lin have decent armor...
                                Yeah not a fan of that monkey magic idiot personally

The samurai armor is just weird because they wore metal armor so why go out of their way to invent wooden armor they never wore haha
        Yeah, it always freak me about that orochi sheath right but without any Saya: I'd someone would do that for real even with the leather armor he would cuts himself anyway
        It honestly ruins the immersion for me, in the stupidest way.
        Its actually not a katana. Kensei uses a No Dachi.
            I think he was referring to the katana they use on the new exec, as kensei doesn't actually sheath his nodashi
        Hey got your wish dude
            For Kyoshin yeah but still not for Orochi ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
    Correct me if I am wrong but I don't think you are supposed to be decapitated. Your head is still attached to your body by some skin. If your head was to get cut off and roll that would have been seen as embarrassing.
        It depends. I’m no expert myself but I believe that it’s actually considered disrespectful to not completely sever the head. However the rolling head is still not something that was desireable. The most skilled executioners developed a method where they would only slice through a very specific part of the neck and hit a part of the spine that proved instantly fatal, with the only evidence of execution being a small cut on the side of their neck. I believe this technique was called “Soul Cleansing” but I could be wrong.

Edit: If you want an example of this in game’s, Sekiro’s final execution is an example 


https://youtu.be/ei2dx016t5g.                        
 Go to 5:10 in the video
            I thought of sekiro before I even saw you say it
                Hesitation is defeat
                    Isshina is kicking my ass T-T
                        I was gonna come up with some advice but "git gud" is the most succinct advice I have lol.

I've beaten him quite a few times now though so message me if you need help :)
                            >git gud

i love how this is a meme but genuinly sound advice for getting better at the game hahahaha
                        Well you can block his bullets with the umbrella, which powers it up. Now use the powered up umbrella (it gains a ranged projectile) to one shot him when he's in the air. Not the easiest way to beat him maybe but definetly the cheesiest.

The umbrella is pretty op in general tbh.
                            i use it incorrectly and it is still powerful hahahah
                                People thinking it is a purely defensive piece of gear are sorely mistakenthe Suzaku variant also stunlocks every red eyes enemy in the game, just opening it close to them counts as fire damage iirc

Speaking of little known tactics, did you know that you can deathblow the Schimen warriors (the purple skull terrify guys) when they "jump?" And another, the fishy guys in Fountainhead are extremely weak to the poison blade, if you hit their block a few times with it their posture breaks.
            C1-C5 keep jack alive.

I've read that they would have retainers that would follow them on the battlefield. Their sole purpose would be to decapitate them if they had to seppuku
                So breaking c1-c5 is lethal is what the rhyme is saying? Also do u have any other medical rhymes like that?
                    Yup, your c spine in general, but in particular the c1-5 vertebrae are what control essential life functions like your lungs and heart. You can lose the others and still be alive. Paralyzed depending on where, but still alive.

I don't remember any other rhymes, just that one was thrown around a lot in basic class.
                I think it was generally a close friend or comrade of the person performing seppuku, could be wrong and might depend on the Era and region
            This game hands down has the most badass, beautiful combat of any game ever created
        So from what I know the person is supposed to cut their stomach across and then upwards from their belly button to their chest. Then another person finishes them via severing their head.
            This was actually a right given to the samurai committing sepuku. If the pain became too much to handle, they could ask to get their head cut off by a close friend.
            I think the amount of cutting was related to the act they had committed. The more dishonor, the more they would cut. If they did it upwards that meant they  had a lot of shame.
        If I’m not mistaken, there is a book called Hagakure which was a dictation by a prominent samurai, Yamamoto Tsunetomo, in his later life, written by a vassal. In it there was a passage describing how the goal of the Kaishaku, the executioner, was to cleave the neck close enough to the far edge of skin such that the remaining attached skin would hold the head to the body. It was considered lacking in grace and control to completely lob off the head.
        Right
    >Maybe that’s specifically Harakiri, who knows.

Seppuku and harakiri are synonyms. The former is derived from Chinese root words and considered more formal, while the latter is derived from native Japanese root words and typically not used in formal writing.
        Ah, I thought one was a bit more formal than the other. I knew they both meant the same thing, I just thought one may have been favoured when talking about a specific method of suicide.
            The hara is below the belly button. Kiri means cut. Harakiri basically means to cut the hara. Seppuku is the act of restoring your honor by killing yourself in the most painful way. Harakiri is the most painful way.
            To be more elaborate, harakiri simply means “belly (hara) cutting (kiri, also why it’s in Hitokiri’s name, “man cutter”)”. Seppuku is just the ritual name
    Yeah but the thing is. The executor sends the head rolling which is extremely disrespectful not only for the one dying but for the one killing. Only the most skilled swordsman were made to do this as it required you to break their spinal cord in your neck without cutting your head. Too little would result in increased pain. Too much would result in the head rolling.
    On the temple garden map the statues all have horizontal wounds on their stomachs, implying that as a depiction of their honored dead.
    Seppeku is when you told a frisbee in half and eat it so it expands in your neck
    I don’t believe harakiri was a term that was used for it until very recently. Other than that they’re synonymous.
    It is, but the spotter who cuts the head is there in case they can't finish the job themselves.
    Correct me if I'm ignorant, but what part about disemboweling yourself is "freeing from the pain"?
        I don't think it is. Samurai cut open their bellies to die painfully and "restore their honor".

The decapitation was there so you didn't spend 5 minutes bleeding out, hence "freeing from the pain".
            Think the beheading part was a backup if you were unable to properly kill yourself....ie cut deep enough to get the correct arteries so you don't spend a long time bleeding out 

I'm no expert though so take it as you will
                It was not just a backup. Often a second was allowed to behead(well ideally cut the head without it rolling off) because no one actually wanted to disembowel themselves and no one wanted witness it either.

See: [Kaishakunin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaishakunin)
    Yeah, you are right, however, there is no difference between seppuku and harakiri, however, “seppuku” is the formal and respectful form of saying it, while “harakiri” literally means “slicing open the abdomen with a dagger”, which is way less formal
They were also given the option to get their head cut off by a friend if the pain became unbearable. It’s crazy how accurate this is to samurai culture
And then decapitate them.
    Yes to free them from pain
        Wasn't the point of Seppuku to allow them to honorably kill themselves and allow them just that. Killing them outright during the first stage of the act seems more dishonest.

Edit: Go through my later comments to see where I was proven wrong, let my dumbassary be a learning tool.
            Nah, im no expert but cutting head is part of that 'ritual' since cutting gut wont kill you quickly. I'll share a video with you if you want to know more tho. I dont remember all the things.

  


https://youtu.be/-oM8I7niF0Y
                They had a man stand next to them with a sword drawn. If the one committing the ritual hesitated or started to pull out the blade he would cut off the head as to not allow them to dishonor themself.
                If done correctly you'll sever the aorta, causing a rather rapid death through blood loss.
                    Yeah but you’ll get a more rapid death if your homie just cuts off your head.
                        Then the point of honorable suicide is diminished. The act pertains to holding onto what admiration, respect, dignity and honour you had left and doing the deed, yourself. 

You're taking that from them.
                            the decaptitation is most of the time requested by the one who commits suicide, they intentionally stretch their neck out to allow an easy cut
                            During the act of Seppuku, a second, known as a kaishakunin, stands ready nearby. This person is given explicit, personalised instructions as to at what moment they are to behead the Samurai - at the time of beheading, the kaishaku will pass their katana half way through the neck of the honoured warrior, allowing their neck to hang by a section of tissue in front of their torso, this is symbolic of the embrace of death - for some, the instruction was that if it looked like they might be overcome with pain and lose control they were to behead them. For others, the instruction was that as soon as the blade was irrevocably moving towards the belly they were to cut off the head.

 The kaishakunin does not diminish the act of honourable suicide. By standing ready to strike at the moment of greatest weakness, they preserve the honour of the act. It is ignorant to assume otherwise.
                                It's fine to be ignorant, hence why I stopped replying. Everyone here is correcting me and I've learned more about the subject henceforth.

I won't delete my comments either so anyone who formerly thought they way I did, can see the misconceptions.

Small edit: Inclusion added.
                            They also cut their belly open, not just stab but you don't have guts falling out in the game. The head is also not supposed to roll around on the ground but again, such a thing is not in the game.

Either way, they plunge the blade, that's the moment of "death" for them, decapitation is just so they don't sit there and bleed with their guts out. And eventually it became a ritual and they wouldn't even stab themselves, just reach for something that is symbolic and get decapitated.
            its a bit complicated but the initial cut you do dring seppuku wont kill you, but it signals that you are honroable and die on your own, most people then strech out their head and show their neck as best as possible to allow a decapitation because that makes the process faster, unless you are a masochist and want to bleed out

&#x200B;

decapitation is friendly... its a mercy kill
            They're (old Japan) believed that soul/spirit is located in stomach. So cutting your stomach open before death will realise your soul into the world otherwise it will be trapped inside (until body completely decomposed I guess). 

Stomach standing is super painful cuz u hurt your liver. If u ever got hit in your liver u know how bad it is. Imagine how infinitely more painful it should be to get stabbed there. So cutting head of is act of mercy
            They did it anyways.  

It eventually got to the point where the disgraced samurai didn’t even reach for a sword, but rather something symbolic like a brush or fan, prompting the assistant to lop their head off.

Originally, you had no second to decapitate oh, and were supposed to cut deep enough to sever your aorta, since that would end it pretty quickly.  To that end, you’d just carve yourself up until you got it.
            if the pain was too much they would ask someone close to them to cut off their head to end it
I know the whole sudoku stuff 

I just think the fact they tell you to kill yourself Is funny to me
    It was a way to allow yourself honour in death. Despite any atrocious act in life, the Japanese believes everyone deserved equal treatment in death. It allows their lineage to not be stained with the wrongdoings of their past. It’s a very interesting part of their culture.
well its a honorable death while knights and vikings dont even want to kill em
I think most people know about that, but the post is just a joke
Knight: *fucking drops dead*
    His name is Larry.
        Don't disrespect larry
    Viking: \*urp\* Fuckin pansy.
VALHALLAAAAA!
“I shall guide your soul to the afterlife. Be safe on your journey.”
    I love this lamp execution
        I would love it, but the royal walkup while their lifeless body just smacks into the ground makes it super awkward imo.
            Yea that is unfortunate i hate that part too but the lantern part tho its nice
            Yeah that is weird
WOU NAI LAMP
I know the actual meaning 

And I don’t think that the scene I take the samurai bit from is mocking either 

However kill yourself is a common insult over the internet and that makes it kinda funny to me
That's the *intent*, yes. We all know how it's gonna be used, though.
Tiff pls no I spent like 20 minutes cropping those photos
Tiff hopped on as soon as he saw the executions, knowing that the community will rant.
The mods are the worst, I hope they don’t take the post down
If you don’t photoshop a heroes head into the image it gets removed pretty much
People would riot if he was a knight.

.....which is exactly why I want them to add middle eastern fighters to the knights faction 😏
    he’s a crusader technically
        A stardust crusaders to be more specific
            Someone call me?
I’m talking about the new shitty universal ones that got released today
    The Samurai and Viking ones aren’t shitty at all.
        agreed
    I kinda like them. And given the circumstances I don't blame Ubisoft for the lack of unique executions.
    oi i like the viking and samurai ones
Talking about new executions and how drastically different the samurai one is to the others 

I used Kensei because he was the first samurai that came to mind
    Oh shit my bag Haha nvm I haven’t been on the game in a bit
I can't wait to see the new executions because the only Kensei execution I know that bows, is one of the most disrespectful in the game. Lmfao.
    How is a bows execution most disrespectful one and he bows in the end of that execution as well. Your idea of being disrespectful is very vague man, they are Execution like the opponent jumps like a dummy which is more "disrespectful" if that really matters or having skull crushed by foot with sword in the head (Highlander's) and all of them are respectful ? Like bruh smh
        Punch in the stomach, bows.  Slowly aims a bow at point blank range. Fires.

Giggles.


Also: one of the most disrespectful does not mean "the most disrespectful"

Hence the "one of the"
            Giggles ? Lmao he giggles after he fires the arrow ? Haha stop assuming things.
What are you on bruh ? 
Kensei has some of the most grateful executions and the least disrespectful ones.
                ... Yes.

And he also has some of the most disrespectful.
                    Aka: loose something?
                        That one is funny
YES I AM!
It’s faction wide all use the same animation 

So shugoki just grabs a fucking sword then immediately shoves it back up his ass
Yeah but ubi pussied out
    Did they change the execution or what happened?
        The games rating doesn't support lewd things. It would technically have to be reevaluated to include Sexual/Suggestive Themes. The fix was that now Valk moves her shield in the way. It still kinda works, but no actual boob touch.
            Oh I never noticed they changed the execution
Orochi* kensei*
    \*orichi \*kensai
Practice blocking. The chain stops if you block the first light unless you’re OOS or the opponent has revenge.
    See this is the only acceptable response to someone complaining about light spam
    [deleted]
        A quick google search told me that the average male reaction time is 284 milliseconds. Orochi’s opening light attack is 500ms (or 466ms, might’ve been changed and I can’t remember). Either way, 500ms is the average light attack speed for most characters and it’s perfectly reactable. Can you block a shugoki or kensei throwing a light at you, or a lawbringer or shaolin throwing side lights? Because those are all 500ms.
            [deleted]
                I don't think he ever had light attacks that were faster than 300ms or so
Unfortunately that's all kensei mains do nowadays, pure disgrace
    *pops unlockable feat*
Right now
    Then saving for Nuxia can wait, I got to make other players commit seppuku
        Yeah it’s the best execution out of a crappy bunch 

Nothing better than a stylised “kill yourself”
            Got it, used it, love it.
        Sorry but Nuxia is not from the faction that got the Seppuku Exec
            No, I mean I was saving for Nuxia, but I am goingto waste some silver on a execution.
POL-NA-RE-FFU
The title is mildly sarcastic
Bro they made a hero that can teleport and they put horns on the vikings helmets, are you really going to question Ubi logic now?
    Teleport? Wtf who?
        Shaolin,he can teleport to one of his teammates,and shinobi kind of teleports too
            Had no idea that shaolin can teleport to his friends damn Ubisoft.
[Made by u/Hurans](https://v.redd.it/cm354qucfw251)
Even more reasons as to why it’s hilarious
The utmost respect of cutting of your opponents arm and laughing, or punching him in the stomach to shoot an arrow in his face.
    Im talking about, Yasuraka, Shizuka Ni Nemure, Kyudoka, these ones are undoubtedly the most honorable of all in the game. Bowing to your adversary?
        Look up the translation, generally whatever Kensei says is pretty mean during any execution.
With that said, the downvotes yo're getting are stupid
            I dont understand? [Like this is what google says?](https://imgur.com/Az9rdCK) Calm, quiet sleep, sorta thing. I cant speak for the other executions which you are probably referring too! But in the ones im postulating, these executions show honor and respect.
                Can't give much examples cuz they're spanned accrocs multiple videos of execution translation, but here's one (at 1.30 / https://youtu.be/QN7cSxqQps8)

Of course there are respectful but I think in general he isn't, he's kindof like JJ in that sense
        That is respect. He’s ending his suffering. Something that was pretty common. It’s better than bleeding out
            Yes! I agree very much so, that level of respect is something not seen to frequently outside of specifically Kensei's execution sets.
                Something I find funny is how the Viking one is somewhat respect. It’s them just saying. “Ay I know you’re going to die. How about one last drink” I love it
This is about the 3 faction executions that were just added.
    4*
    Oh gotcha! Thanks for the clarification!
As much as I'd love a long-ass Blood Eagle execution, I don't think For Honor's gore system would support flaying someone's back. All we have are blood splatters and severed body parts. If they made a For Honor 2 and wanted to really sell the brutality, they could model muscles and bones beneath the skin, and burned skin textures. Would allow for some extremely graphic deaths.
Man that's such a good idea!
Why the downvotes tho
    People don’t like blood haha
        I think it’s because the engine can’t handle it. But amazing idea that’d be gruesome
Most of the time I’d agree

I think what gets me the most is how weird characters look with the weapon sheathed
The samurai one is the only good one 

The rest are just plain unsatisfying
    I think the Viking one was really good
It still freaks me out the way they sheath the katana and carry the bare blade with the hand. 
Is it this hard to add a saya??? It’s an important part for the katana!
    Same with warden, pk and the rest of the cast who use swords
        I know what you mean but it was actually quite “common” for knights to carry a sword bare handed when engaging from a fight to another (not sure how a pk would deal with this though).
My point is that the saya plays a crucial point for the Katana in the japanese history. 

Throwing away your saya meant disrespecting the sword and the smith, which was something you wouldn’t do as a samurai (disrespect and being dishonorable was one of the worst things one could be/do)
And a good smith was/is seen highly in that time and still today. 

But hey, who am I trying to be historically correct with a game that added a hero who can teleport behind you. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
            Yeah I'm aware of that. I would love to see saya on my Aramusha. The reason they didn't do it is probably because of the gear stats (now perks), although they could have added it to be purely cosmetic like ornaments or materials.
                Exactly my thought! 
But I doubt it will ever happen. 

We just have to start cringing everytime we see this and deal with it like real warriors haha
                    With how the new executions turned out I can tell you right now that it won't happen. Ubi is slowly giving up on this game
                        I know, I know. 
I just hope otherwise.. there is still hope for the next gen...
                They could've even made a Saya that changes depending on your blade or grip to match it and not be ankther cosmetic that you spend 30k on applying
            >

Shaolin monks can teleport behind you and to close friends in fights in real life, duh.
                I love how they said that block damage is unrealistic and shouldnt be in the game and a few months later they ad a teleporting shaolin
                    Teleporting shaolins are realistic, watchumean
            You're really glamorizing samurai. Lots of them were not this fictitious idea of the utmost honorable warrior
                Yes. This one.

Honorable People were everywhere, and no social Group were somehow magical in drawing them, or making them.
            Thanks for the info, didn't know the saya had such symbolic significance for samurai!

I assumed the reason Wardens carry their blades by hand is because they're wearing armored gauntlets and don't care if the edge gets a little scuffed by the gauntlets because blade sharpness isn't as important to them because their fighting style includes using the sword as a bludgeon or quarter staff?
                Exactly.

That’s why there are executions (which actually happened in. Real life as well) where warden graps the blade and slams the hilt into your neck. 
Not going to happen with a katana, since they wore mostly leather gauntlets so they had superior handlich of the blade. 
So basically of a samurai would do this with his katana, he would chop of his fingers with the force of the impact + the fact that a tsuba is/was mostly round so it’s stupid to do this.
                    Right yeah! That reminds me how annoying it is that samurai wear wooden armor in this game when that's not at all what they wore historically haha
                        A lot of weired things are happening in for Honor... 
like teleporting monkeys and ninja’s and stuff. 

I just wished they would at least give an eye to those little things. 
That would make the game 200% cooler and I would even consider to walk with Orochi the Rep70 road. 

Also considering the armor thing, they were able to give the knights decent armor and so... but hey knights and vikings are easier to design that the japanese I guess? 

Even the wu-lin have decent armor...
                            Yeah not a fan of that monkey magic idiot personally

The samurai armor is just weird because they wore metal armor so why go out of their way to invent wooden armor they never wore haha
    Yeah, it always freak me about that orochi sheath right but without any Saya: I'd someone would do that for real even with the leather armor he would cuts himself anyway
    It honestly ruins the immersion for me, in the stupidest way.
    Its actually not a katana. Kensei uses a No Dachi.
        I think he was referring to the katana they use on the new exec, as kensei doesn't actually sheath his nodashi
    Hey got your wish dude
        For Kyoshin yeah but still not for Orochi ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Correct me if I am wrong but I don't think you are supposed to be decapitated. Your head is still attached to your body by some skin. If your head was to get cut off and roll that would have been seen as embarrassing.
    It depends. I’m no expert myself but I believe that it’s actually considered disrespectful to not completely sever the head. However the rolling head is still not something that was desireable. The most skilled executioners developed a method where they would only slice through a very specific part of the neck and hit a part of the spine that proved instantly fatal, with the only evidence of execution being a small cut on the side of their neck. I believe this technique was called “Soul Cleansing” but I could be wrong.

Edit: If you want an example of this in game’s, Sekiro’s final execution is an example

 Go to 5:10 in the video
        I thought of sekiro before I even saw you say it
            Hesitation is defeat
                Isshina is kicking my ass T-T
                    I was gonna come up with some advice but "git gud" is the most succinct advice I have lol.

I've beaten him quite a few times now though so message me if you need help :)
                        >git gud

i love how this is a meme but genuinly sound advice for getting better at the game hahahaha
                    Well you can block his bullets with the umbrella, which powers it up. Now use the powered up umbrella (it gains a ranged projectile) to one shot him when he's in the air. Not the easiest way to beat him maybe but definetly the cheesiest.

The umbrella is pretty op in general tbh.
                        i use it incorrectly and it is still powerful hahahah
                            People thinking it is a purely defensive piece of gear are sorely mistakenthe Suzaku variant also stunlocks every red eyes enemy in the game, just opening it close to them counts as fire damage iirc

Speaking of little known tactics, did you know that you can deathblow the Schimen warriors (the purple skull terrify guys) when they "jump?" And another, the fishy guys in Fountainhead are extremely weak to the poison blade, if you hit their block a few times with it their posture breaks.
        C1-C5 keep jack alive.

I've read that they would have retainers that would follow them on the battlefield. Their sole purpose would be to decapitate them if they had to seppuku
            So breaking c1-c5 is lethal is what the rhyme is saying? Also do u have any other medical rhymes like that?
                Yup, your c spine in general, but in particular the c1-5 vertebrae are what control essential life functions like your lungs and heart. You can lose the others and still be alive. Paralyzed depending on where, but still alive.

I don't remember any other rhymes, just that one was thrown around a lot in basic class.
            I think it was generally a close friend or comrade of the person performing seppuku, could be wrong and might depend on the Era and region
        This game hands down has the most badass, beautiful combat of any game ever created
    So from what I know the person is supposed to cut their stomach across and then upwards from their belly button to their chest. Then another person finishes them via severing their head.
        This was actually a right given to the samurai committing sepuku. If the pain became too much to handle, they could ask to get their head cut off by a close friend.
        I think the amount of cutting was related to the act they had committed. The more dishonor, the more they would cut. If they did it upwards that meant they  had a lot of shame.
    If I’m not mistaken, there is a book called Hagakure which was a dictation by a prominent samurai, Yamamoto Tsunetomo, in his later life, written by a vassal. In it there was a passage describing how the goal of the Kaishaku, the executioner, was to cleave the neck close enough to the far edge of skin such that the remaining attached skin would hold the head to the body. It was considered lacking in grace and control to completely lob off the head.
    Right
>Maybe that’s specifically Harakiri, who knows.

Seppuku and harakiri are synonyms. The former is derived from Chinese root words and considered more formal, while the latter is derived from native Japanese root words and typically not used in formal writing.
    Ah, I thought one was a bit more formal than the other. I knew they both meant the same thing, I just thought one may have been favoured when talking about a specific method of suicide.
        The hara is below the belly button. Kiri means cut. Harakiri basically means to cut the hara. Seppuku is the act of restoring your honor by killing yourself in the most painful way. Harakiri is the most painful way.
        To be more elaborate, harakiri simply means “belly (hara) cutting (kiri, also why it’s in Hitokiri’s name, “man cutter”)”. Seppuku is just the ritual name
Yeah but the thing is. The executor sends the head rolling which is extremely disrespectful not only for the one dying but for the one killing. Only the most skilled swordsman were made to do this as it required you to break their spinal cord in your neck without cutting your head. Too little would result in increased pain. Too much would result in the head rolling.
On the temple garden map the statues all have horizontal wounds on their stomachs, implying that as a depiction of their honored dead.
Seppeku is when you told a frisbee in half and eat it so it expands in your neck
I don’t believe harakiri was a term that was used for it until very recently. Other than that they’re synonymous.
It is, but the spotter who cuts the head is there in case they can't finish the job themselves.
Correct me if I'm ignorant, but what part about disemboweling yourself is "freeing from the pain"?
    I don't think it is. Samurai cut open their bellies to die painfully and "restore their honor".

The decapitation was there so you didn't spend 5 minutes bleeding out, hence "freeing from the pain".
        Think the beheading part was a backup if you were unable to properly kill yourself....ie cut deep enough to get the correct arteries so you don't spend a long time bleeding out 

I'm no expert though so take it as you will
            It was not just a backup. Often a second was allowed to behead(well ideally cut the head without it rolling off) because no one actually wanted to disembowel themselves and no one wanted witness it either.

See: [Kaishakunin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaishakunin)
Yeah, you are right, however, there is no difference between seppuku and harakiri, however, “seppuku” is the formal and respectful form of saying it, while “harakiri” literally means “slicing open the abdomen with a dagger”, which is way less formal
Yes to free them from pain
    Wasn't the point of Seppuku to allow them to honorably kill themselves and allow them just that. Killing them outright during the first stage of the act seems more dishonest.

Edit: Go through my later comments to see where I was proven wrong, let my dumbassary be a learning tool.
        Nah, im no expert but cutting head is part of that 'ritual' since cutting gut wont kill you quickly. I'll share a video with you if you want to know more tho. I dont remember all the things.

  


https://youtu.be/-oM8I7niF0Y
            They had a man stand next to them with a sword drawn. If the one committing the ritual hesitated or started to pull out the blade he would cut off the head as to not allow them to dishonor themself.
            If done correctly you'll sever the aorta, causing a rather rapid death through blood loss.
                Yeah but you’ll get a more rapid death if your homie just cuts off your head.
                    Then the point of honorable suicide is diminished. The act pertains to holding onto what admiration, respect, dignity and honour you had left and doing the deed, yourself. 

You're taking that from them.
                        the decaptitation is most of the time requested by the one who commits suicide, they intentionally stretch their neck out to allow an easy cut
                        During the act of Seppuku, a second, known as a kaishakunin, stands ready nearby. This person is given explicit, personalised instructions as to at what moment they are to behead the Samurai - at the time of beheading, the kaishaku will pass their katana half way through the neck of the honoured warrior, allowing their neck to hang by a section of tissue in front of their torso, this is symbolic of the embrace of death - for some, the instruction was that if it looked like they might be overcome with pain and lose control they were to behead them. For others, the instruction was that as soon as the blade was irrevocably moving towards the belly they were to cut off the head.

 The kaishakunin does not diminish the act of honourable suicide. By standing ready to strike at the moment of greatest weakness, they preserve the honour of the act. It is ignorant to assume otherwise.
                            It's fine to be ignorant, hence why I stopped replying. Everyone here is correcting me and I've learned more about the subject henceforth.

I won't delete my comments either so anyone who formerly thought they way I did, can see the misconceptions.

Small edit: Inclusion added.
                        They also cut their belly open, not just stab but you don't have guts falling out in the game. The head is also not supposed to roll around on the ground but again, such a thing is not in the game.

Either way, they plunge the blade, that's the moment of "death" for them, decapitation is just so they don't sit there and bleed with their guts out. And eventually it became a ritual and they wouldn't even stab themselves, just reach for something that is symbolic and get decapitated.
        its a bit complicated but the initial cut you do dring seppuku wont kill you, but it signals that you are honroable and die on your own, most people then strech out their head and show their neck as best as possible to allow a decapitation because that makes the process faster, unless you are a masochist and want to bleed out

&#x200B;

decapitation is friendly... its a mercy kill
        They're (old Japan) believed that soul/spirit is located in stomach. So cutting your stomach open before death will realise your soul into the world otherwise it will be trapped inside (until body completely decomposed I guess). 

Stomach standing is super painful cuz u hurt your liver. If u ever got hit in your liver u know how bad it is. Imagine how infinitely more painful it should be to get stabbed there. So cutting head of is act of mercy
        They did it anyways.  

It eventually got to the point where the disgraced samurai didn’t even reach for a sword, but rather something symbolic like a brush or fan, prompting the assistant to lop their head off.

Originally, you had no second to decapitate oh, and were supposed to cut deep enough to sever your aorta, since that would end it pretty quickly.  To that end, you’d just carve yourself up until you got it.
        if the pain was too much they would ask someone close to them to cut off their head to end it
It was a way to allow yourself honour in death. Despite any atrocious act in life, the Japanese believes everyone deserved equal treatment in death. It allows their lineage to not be stained with the wrongdoings of their past. It’s a very interesting part of their culture.
His name is Larry.
    Don't disrespect larry
Viking: \*urp\* Fuckin pansy.
I love this lamp execution
    I would love it, but the royal walkup while their lifeless body just smacks into the ground makes it super awkward imo.
        Yea that is unfortunate i hate that part too but the lantern part tho its nice
        Yeah that is weird
he’s a crusader technically
    A stardust crusaders to be more specific
        Someone call me?
The Samurai and Viking ones aren’t shitty at all.
    agreed
I kinda like them. And given the circumstances I don't blame Ubisoft for the lack of unique executions.
oi i like the viking and samurai ones
Oh shit my bag Haha nvm I haven’t been on the game in a bit
How is a bows execution most disrespectful one and he bows in the end of that execution as well. Your idea of being disrespectful is very vague man, they are Execution like the opponent jumps like a dummy which is more "disrespectful" if that really matters or having skull crushed by foot with sword in the head (Highlander's) and all of them are respectful ? Like bruh smh
    Punch in the stomach, bows.  Slowly aims a bow at point blank range. Fires.

Giggles.


Also: one of the most disrespectful does not mean "the most disrespectful"

Hence the "one of the"
        Giggles ? Lmao he giggles after he fires the arrow ? Haha stop assuming things.
What are you on bruh ? 
Kensei has some of the most grateful executions and the least disrespectful ones.
            ... Yes.

And he also has some of the most disrespectful.
                Aka: loose something?
                    That one is funny
Did they change the execution or what happened?
    The games rating doesn't support lewd things. It would technically have to be reevaluated to include Sexual/Suggestive Themes. The fix was that now Valk moves her shield in the way. It still kinda works, but no actual boob touch.
        Oh I never noticed they changed the execution
\*orichi \*kensai
See this is the only acceptable response to someone complaining about light spam
[deleted]
    A quick google search told me that the average male reaction time is 284 milliseconds. Orochi’s opening light attack is 500ms (or 466ms, might’ve been changed and I can’t remember). Either way, 500ms is the average light attack speed for most characters and it’s perfectly reactable. Can you block a shugoki or kensei throwing a light at you, or a lawbringer or shaolin throwing side lights? Because those are all 500ms.
        [deleted]
            I don't think he ever had light attacks that were faster than 300ms or so
*pops unlockable feat*
Then saving for Nuxia can wait, I got to make other players commit seppuku
    Yeah it’s the best execution out of a crappy bunch 

Nothing better than a stylised “kill yourself”
        Got it, used it, love it.
    Sorry but Nuxia is not from the faction that got the Seppuku Exec
        No, I mean I was saving for Nuxia, but I am goingto waste some silver on a execution.
Teleport? Wtf who?
    Shaolin,he can teleport to one of his teammates,and shinobi kind of teleports too
        Had no idea that shaolin can teleport to his friends damn Ubisoft.
Im talking about, Yasuraka, Shizuka Ni Nemure, Kyudoka, these ones are undoubtedly the most honorable of all in the game. Bowing to your adversary?
    Look up the translation, generally whatever Kensei says is pretty mean during any execution.
With that said, the downvotes yo're getting are stupid
        I dont understand? [Like this is what google says?](https://imgur.com/Az9rdCK) Calm, quiet sleep, sorta thing. I cant speak for the other executions which you are probably referring too! But in the ones im postulating, these executions show honor and respect.
            Can't give much examples cuz they're spanned accrocs multiple videos of execution translation, but here's one (at 1.30 / https://youtu.be/QN7cSxqQps8)

Of course there are respectful but I think in general he isn't, he's kindof like JJ in that sense
    That is respect. He’s ending his suffering. Something that was pretty common. It’s better than bleeding out
        Yes! I agree very much so, that level of respect is something not seen to frequently outside of specifically Kensei's execution sets.
            Something I find funny is how the Viking one is somewhat respect. It’s them just saying. “Ay I know you’re going to die. How about one last drink” I love it
4*
Oh gotcha! Thanks for the clarification!
People don’t like blood haha
    I think it’s because the engine can’t handle it. But amazing idea that’d be gruesome
I think the Viking one was really good
Same with warden, pk and the rest of the cast who use swords
    I know what you mean but it was actually quite “common” for knights to carry a sword bare handed when engaging from a fight to another (not sure how a pk would deal with this though).

Ah, I thought one was a bit more formal than the other. I knew they both meant the same thing, I just thought one may have been favoured when talking about a specific method of suicide.
    The hara is below the belly button. Kiri means cut. Harakiri basically means to cut the hara. Seppuku is the act of restoring your honor by killing yourself in the most painful way. Harakiri is the most painful way.
    To be more elaborate, harakiri simply means “belly (hara) cutting (kiri, also why it’s in Hitokiri’s name, “man cutter”)”. Seppuku is just the ritual name
I don't think it is. Samurai cut open their bellies to die painfully and "restore their honor".

The decapitation was there so you didn't spend 5 minutes bleeding out, hence "freeing from the pain".
    Think the beheading part was a backup if you were unable to properly kill yourself....ie cut deep enough to get the correct arteries so you don't spend a long time bleeding out 

I'm no expert though so take it as you will
        It was not just a backup. Often a second was allowed to behead(well ideally cut the head without it rolling off) because no one actually wanted to disembowel themselves and no one wanted witness it either.

See: [Kaishakunin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaishakunin)
Wasn't the point of Seppuku to allow them to honorably kill themselves and allow them just that. Killing them outright during the first stage of the act seems more dishonest.

Edit: Go through my later comments to see where I was proven wrong, let my dumbassary be a learning tool.
    Nah, im no expert but cutting head is part of that 'ritual' since cutting gut wont kill you quickly. I'll share a video with you if you want to know more tho. I dont remember all the things.

        They had a man stand next to them with a sword drawn. If the one committing the ritual hesitated or started to pull out the blade he would cut off the head as to not allow them to dishonor themself.
        If done correctly you'll sever the aorta, causing a rather rapid death through blood loss.
            Yeah but you’ll get a more rapid death if your homie just cuts off your head.
                Then the point of honorable suicide is diminished. The act pertains to holding onto what admiration, respect, dignity and honour you had left and doing the deed, yourself. 

You're taking that from them.
                    the decaptitation is most of the time requested by the one who commits suicide, they intentionally stretch their neck out to allow an easy cut
                    During the act of Seppuku, a second, known as a kaishakunin, stands ready nearby. This person is given explicit, personalised instructions as to at what moment they are to behead the Samurai - at the time of beheading, the kaishaku will pass their katana half way through the neck of the honoured warrior, allowing their neck to hang by a section of tissue in front of their torso, this is symbolic of the embrace of death - for some, the instruction was that if it looked like they might be overcome with pain and lose control they were to behead them. For others, the instruction was that as soon as the blade was irrevocably moving towards the belly they were to cut off the head.

 The kaishakunin does not diminish the act of honourable suicide. By standing ready to strike at the moment of greatest weakness, they preserve the honour of the act. It is ignorant to assume otherwise.
                        It's fine to be ignorant, hence why I stopped replying. Everyone here is correcting me and I've learned more about the subject henceforth.

I won't delete my comments either so anyone who formerly thought they way I did, can see the misconceptions.

Small edit: Inclusion added.
                    They also cut their belly open, not just stab but you don't have guts falling out in the game. The head is also not supposed to roll around on the ground but again, such a thing is not in the game.

Either way, they plunge the blade, that's the moment of "death" for them, decapitation is just so they don't sit there and bleed with their guts out. And eventually it became a ritual and they wouldn't even stab themselves, just reach for something that is symbolic and get decapitated.
    its a bit complicated but the initial cut you do dring seppuku wont kill you, but it signals that you are honroable and die on your own, most people then strech out their head and show their neck as best as possible to allow a decapitation because that makes the process faster, unless you are a masochist and want to bleed out

&#x200B;

decapitation is friendly... its a mercy kill
    They're (old Japan) believed that soul/spirit is located in stomach. So cutting your stomach open before death will realise your soul into the world otherwise it will be trapped inside (until body completely decomposed I guess). 

Stomach standing is super painful cuz u hurt your liver. If u ever got hit in your liver u know how bad it is. Imagine how infinitely more painful it should be to get stabbed there. So cutting head of is act of mercy
    They did it anyways.  

It eventually got to the point where the disgraced samurai didn’t even reach for a sword, but rather something symbolic like a brush or fan, prompting the assistant to lop their head off.

Originally, you had no second to decapitate oh, and were supposed to cut deep enough to sever your aorta, since that would end it pretty quickly.  To that end, you’d just carve yourself up until you got it.
    if the pain was too much they would ask someone close to them to cut off their head to end it
Don't disrespect larry
I would love it, but the royal walkup while their lifeless body just smacks into the ground makes it super awkward imo.
    Yea that is unfortunate i hate that part too but the lantern part tho its nice
    Yeah that is weird
A stardust crusaders to be more specific
    Someone call me?
agreed
Punch in the stomach, bows.  Slowly aims a bow at point blank range. Fires.

Giggles.


Also: one of the most disrespectful does not mean "the most disrespectful"

Hence the "one of the"
    Giggles ? Lmao he giggles after he fires the arrow ? Haha stop assuming things.
What are you on bruh ? 
Kensei has some of the most grateful executions and the least disrespectful ones.
        ... Yes.

And he also has some of the most disrespectful.
            Aka: loose something?
                That one is funny
The games rating doesn't support lewd things. It would technically have to be reevaluated to include Sexual/Suggestive Themes. The fix was that now Valk moves her shield in the way. It still kinda works, but no actual boob touch.
    Oh I never noticed they changed the execution
A quick google search told me that the average male reaction time is 284 milliseconds. Orochi’s opening light attack is 500ms (or 466ms, might’ve been changed and I can’t remember). Either way, 500ms is the average light attack speed for most characters and it’s perfectly reactable. Can you block a shugoki or kensei throwing a light at you, or a lawbringer or shaolin throwing side lights? Because those are all 500ms.
    [deleted]
        I don't think he ever had light attacks that were faster than 300ms or so
Yeah it’s the best execution out of a crappy bunch 

Nothing better than a stylised “kill yourself”
    Got it, used it, love it.
Sorry but Nuxia is not from the faction that got the Seppuku Exec
    No, I mean I was saving for Nuxia, but I am goingto waste some silver on a execution.
Shaolin,he can teleport to one of his teammates,and shinobi kind of teleports too
    Had no idea that shaolin can teleport to his friends damn Ubisoft.
Look up the translation, generally whatever Kensei says is pretty mean during any execution.
With that said, the downvotes yo're getting are stupid
    I dont understand? [Like this is what google says?](https://imgur.com/Az9rdCK) Calm, quiet sleep, sorta thing. I cant speak for the other executions which you are probably referring too! But in the ones im postulating, these executions show honor and respect.
        Can't give much examples cuz they're spanned accrocs multiple videos of execution translation, but here's one (at 1.30 / https://youtu.be/QN7cSxqQps8)

Of course there are respectful but I think in general he isn't, he's kindof like JJ in that sense
That is respect. He’s ending his suffering. Something that was pretty common. It’s better than bleeding out
    Yes! I agree very much so, that level of respect is something not seen to frequently outside of specifically Kensei's execution sets.
        Something I find funny is how the Viking one is somewhat respect. It’s them just saying. “Ay I know you’re going to die. How about one last drink” I love it
I think it’s because the engine can’t handle it. But amazing idea that’d be gruesome
I know what you mean but it was actually quite “common” for knights to carry a sword bare handed when engaging from a fight to another (not sure how a pk would deal with this though).
My point is that the saya plays a crucial point for the Katana in the japanese history. 

Throwing away your saya meant disrespecting the sword and the smith, which was something you wouldn’t do as a samurai (disrespect and being dishonorable was one of the worst things one could be/do)
And a good smith was/is seen highly in that time and still today. 

But hey, who am I trying to be historically correct with a game that added a hero who can teleport behind you. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
    Yeah I'm aware of that. I would love to see saya on my Aramusha. The reason they didn't do it is probably because of the gear stats (now perks), although they could have added it to be purely cosmetic like ornaments or materials.
        Exactly my thought! 
But I doubt it will ever happen. 

We just have to start cringing everytime we see this and deal with it like real warriors haha
            With how the new executions turned out I can tell you right now that it won't happen. Ubi is slowly giving up on this game
                I know, I know. 
I just hope otherwise.. there is still hope for the next gen...
        They could've even made a Saya that changes depending on your blade or grip to match it and not be ankther cosmetic that you spend 30k on applying
    >
But hey, who am I trying to be historically correct with a game that added a hero who can teleport behind you. ¯\(ツ)/¯

Shaolin monks can teleport behind you and to close friends in fights in real life, duh.
        I love how they said that block damage is unrealistic and shouldnt be in the game and a few months later they ad a teleporting shaolin
            Teleporting shaolins are realistic, watchumean
    You're really glamorizing samurai. Lots of them were not this fictitious idea of the utmost honorable warrior
        Yes. This one.

Honorable People were everywhere, and no social Group were somehow magical in drawing them, or making them.
    Thanks for the info, didn't know the saya had such symbolic significance for samurai!

I assumed the reason Wardens carry their blades by hand is because they're wearing armored gauntlets and don't care if the edge gets a little scuffed by the gauntlets because blade sharpness isn't as important to them because their fighting style includes using the sword as a bludgeon or quarter staff?
        Exactly.

That’s why there are executions (which actually happened in. Real life as well) where warden graps the blade and slams the hilt into your neck. 
Not going to happen with a katana, since they wore mostly leather gauntlets so they had superior handlich of the blade. 
So basically of a samurai would do this with his katana, he would chop of his fingers with the force of the impact + the fact that a tsuba is/was mostly round so it’s stupid to do this.
            Right yeah! That reminds me how annoying it is that samurai wear wooden armor in this game when that's not at all what they wore historically haha
                A lot of weired things are happening in for Honor... 
like teleporting monkeys and ninja’s and stuff. 

I just wished they would at least give an eye to those little things. 
That would make the game 200% cooler and I would even consider to walk with Orochi the Rep70 road. 

Also considering the armor thing, they were able to give the knights decent armor and so... but hey knights and vikings are easier to design that the japanese I guess? 

Even the wu-lin have decent armor...
                    Yeah not a fan of that monkey magic idiot personally

The samurai armor is just weird because they wore metal armor so why go out of their way to invent wooden armor they never wore haha
I think he was referring to the katana they use on the new exec, as kensei doesn't actually sheath his nodashi
For Kyoshin yeah but still not for Orochi ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
I thought of sekiro before I even saw you say it
    Hesitation is defeat
        Isshina is kicking my ass T-T
            I was gonna come up with some advice but "git gud" is the most succinct advice I have lol.

I've beaten him quite a few times now though so message me if you need help :)
                >git gud

i love how this is a meme but genuinly sound advice for getting better at the game hahahaha
            Well you can block his bullets with the umbrella, which powers it up. Now use the powered up umbrella (it gains a ranged projectile) to one shot him when he's in the air. Not the easiest way to beat him maybe but definetly the cheesiest.

The umbrella is pretty op in general tbh.
                i use it incorrectly and it is still powerful hahahah
                    People thinking it is a purely defensive piece of gear are sorely mistakenthe Suzaku variant also stunlocks every red eyes enemy in the game, just opening it close to them counts as fire damage iirc

Speaking of little known tactics, did you know that you can deathblow the Schimen warriors (the purple skull terrify guys) when they "jump?" And another, the fishy guys in Fountainhead are extremely weak to the poison blade, if you hit their block a few times with it their posture breaks.
C1-C5 keep jack alive.

I've read that they would have retainers that would follow them on the battlefield. Their sole purpose would be to decapitate them if they had to seppuku
    So breaking c1-c5 is lethal is what the rhyme is saying? Also do u have any other medical rhymes like that?
        Yup, your c spine in general, but in particular the c1-5 vertebrae are what control essential life functions like your lungs and heart. You can lose the others and still be alive. Paralyzed depending on where, but still alive.

I don't remember any other rhymes, just that one was thrown around a lot in basic class.
    I think it was generally a close friend or comrade of the person performing seppuku, could be wrong and might depend on the Era and region
This game hands down has the most badass, beautiful combat of any game ever created
This was actually a right given to the samurai committing sepuku. If the pain became too much to handle, they could ask to get their head cut off by a close friend.
I think the amount of cutting was related to the act they had committed. The more dishonor, the more they would cut. If they did it upwards that meant they  had a lot of shame.
The hara is below the belly button. Kiri means cut. Harakiri basically means to cut the hara. Seppuku is the act of restoring your honor by killing yourself in the most painful way. Harakiri is the most painful way.
To be more elaborate, harakiri simply means “belly (hara) cutting (kiri, also why it’s in Hitokiri’s name, “man cutter”)”. Seppuku is just the ritual name

Not going to happen with a katana, since they wore mostly leather gauntlets so they had superior handlich of the blade. 
So basically of a samurai would do this with his katana, he would chop of his fingers with the force of the impact + the fact that a tsuba is/was mostly round so it’s stupid to do this.
    Right yeah! That reminds me how annoying it is that samurai wear wooden armor in this game when that's not at all what they wore historically haha
        A lot of weired things are happening in for Honor... 
like teleporting monkeys and ninja’s and stuff. 

I just wished they would at least give an eye to those little things. 
That would make the game 200% cooler and I would even consider to walk with Orochi the Rep70 road. 

Also considering the armor thing, they were able to give the knights decent armor and so... but hey knights and vikings are easier to design that the japanese I guess? 

Even the wu-lin have decent armor...
            Yeah not a fan of that monkey magic idiot personally

The samurai armor is just weird because they wore metal armor so why go out of their way to invent wooden armor they never wore haha
Isshina is kicking my ass T-T
    I was gonna come up with some advice but "git gud" is the most succinct advice I have lol.

I've beaten him quite a few times now though so message me if you need help :)
        >git gud

i love how this is a meme but genuinly sound advice for getting better at the game hahahaha
    Well you can block his bullets with the umbrella, which powers it up. Now use the powered up umbrella (it gains a ranged projectile) to one shot him when he's in the air. Not the easiest way to beat him maybe but definetly the cheesiest.

The umbrella is pretty op in general tbh.
        i use it incorrectly and it is still powerful hahahah
            People thinking it is a purely defensive piece of gear are sorely mistakenthe Suzaku variant also stunlocks every red eyes enemy in the game, just opening it close to them counts as fire damage iirc

Speaking of little known tactics, did you know that you can deathblow the Schimen warriors (the purple skull terrify guys) when they "jump?" And another, the fishy guys in Fountainhead are extremely weak to the poison blade, if you hit their block a few times with it their posture breaks.
Yup, your c spine in general, but in particular the c1-5 vertebrae are what control essential life functions like your lungs and heart. You can lose the others and still be alive. Paralyzed depending on where, but still alive.

I don't remember any other rhymes, just that one was thrown around a lot in basic class.
Yeah but you’ll get a more rapid death if your homie just cuts off your head.
    Then the point of honorable suicide is diminished. The act pertains to holding onto what admiration, respect, dignity and honour you had left and doing the deed, yourself. 

You're taking that from them.
        the decaptitation is most of the time requested by the one who commits suicide, they intentionally stretch their neck out to allow an easy cut
        During the act of Seppuku, a second, known as a kaishakunin, stands ready nearby. This person is given explicit, personalised instructions as to at what moment they are to behead the Samurai - at the time of beheading, the kaishaku will pass their katana half way through the neck of the honoured warrior, allowing their neck to hang by a section of tissue in front of their torso, this is symbolic of the embrace of death - for some, the instruction was that if it looked like they might be overcome with pain and lose control they were to behead them. For others, the instruction was that as soon as the blade was irrevocably moving towards the belly they were to cut off the head.

 The kaishakunin does not diminish the act of honourable suicide. By standing ready to strike at the moment of greatest weakness, they preserve the honour of the act. It is ignorant to assume otherwise.
            It's fine to be ignorant, hence why I stopped replying. Everyone here is correcting me and I've learned more about the subject henceforth.

I won't delete my comments either so anyone who formerly thought they way I did, can see the misconceptions.

Small edit: Inclusion added.
        They also cut their belly open, not just stab but you don't have guts falling out in the game. The head is also not supposed to roll around on the ground but again, such a thing is not in the game.

Either way, they plunge the blade, that's the moment of "death" for them, decapitation is just so they don't sit there and bleed with their guts out. And eventually it became a ritual and they wouldn't even stab themselves, just reach for something that is symbolic and get decapitated.
Aka: loose something?
    That one is funny
With how the new executions turned out I can tell you right now that it won't happen. Ubi is slowly giving up on this game
    I know, I know. 
I just hope otherwise.. there is still hope for the next gen...
Teleporting shaolins are realistic, watchumean
