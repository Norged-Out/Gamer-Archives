[[How it feels using the tier 1 feat]]





Using that feat to save a teammate who's fighting on the verge of death and seeing them clutch the win is the best feeling
    Literally every time I use this on someone, they immidietly get heavy staggered to the death
        I feel bad like the sudden shield caused a small surge of excitement that led to a lapse in concentration and ultimately death
            "Over-confidence is a slow and insidious killer"
                "Be wary! Triumphant pride precipitates a dizzying fall."
                    "Death waits for the slightest lapse in concentration."
                        "Prodigious size alone does not disuade the sharpened blade"
                            "Mortality clarified in a single strike"
                    More like "Soothed, sedated".
                The *Dahkesht* Dungeon
                Over-confidence is a flimsy shield.
                Be mindful of your thoughts young padawan.
            Teammate the shielded...

Teammate the fool!
            no.  you mean ultimately ***TRUE DAHKNESH!!!!***
        Or they die before it even registers, but you still lose your hp and now you have 25 hp less for no reason
    Yep.  
That or the moments where both teams are breaking, one teammate left fighting the last opponent, barely holding on. You run up and hit Phalanx, "[Let's do this buddy](https://i.imgur.com/0QRIm1K.gifv)".
This is one of the best memes I have ever seen on this subbreddit

        Good bot
I'm always too late for that. Hence why I run speed revive instead
    Speed revive is great too
        With the Rising Dawn perk - even better.
            with smoke bomb even better. Nobu feat/perk combo which is at least viable (as supportive ofc)
            Remember when Protected Revived used to be good too?  
it was imo
        Yeah, I run a full support build on my JJ with his feats, and prefer Speed Revive to get my boys back into the action.
    I have a buddy that won't switch off of sprint while oos. It's really annoying.
I had a black prior homie last night toss that shield on me after I saved him in a breach gank, despite the fact his health was already really low. I guess it was a way of saying "thanks"
    Funnily enough, black prior mains are usually the exact opposite of their main‚Äôs personality
        And what would that be XD?
            A lotta Black Prior mains take after the 'Protector' tag on the BP.

Chasing your 1-bar-1-rep Berserker across the map and ending up 1v3ing while he runs off to do fuck-knows what.  
Worth.
                I see yeah that's true. Feel like the only one who actually tries to play like a medic with bp.
When he firsts came out I was always helping people in ganks now I'm seeking people to gank me because AD PROFUNDIS is just so much fun xd
                    Me too , but i didnt get Rising Dawn yet , but i loved playing black prior for 2 weeks , then i came back to my Cent and i was like "how do i deal with gank?"
                        The question of questions 
Most of the time by having a shit ton of luck Haha
            Edgy, brooding, aggressive asshole
                Hahah yes ^EDGE^
I‚Äôve never played black fryer, what does it do, just give a shield?
    ye, at the cost of a bar of health
        Damn that‚Äôs actually pretty cool
            A small shield though.
                Even a small shield can tip a fight back in an allies favor.
                    That's why I use speed revive instead since I already have umbral shelter.
                        My point was that with that small extra shield I dont even have to revive the guy
                            Yes, but my point is that instead, that same guy gets his ass bashed in trying to win the gank after getting a small shield. I dunno about you, but I've been in more situations where I needed to revive quickly than to give an already dying friendly a small and very limited shield. I have Umbral Shelter for those moments.
                        It's better to save someone than try to revive someone in a team fight.
    sacrifices bps health to give a shield
    Yeah, 10HP for, I think, 1/3 of shield for few seconds. It aint much, but can save someone
        25 HP for a 30 HP shield
            Yep, it got nerfed :(((
You're powered up,get in there
    Sinister Shield, combined with Inspire or Morale booster is pretty much nanoboost.
    *genji ult audio plays*

Me: *shakes in fear and hides in the corner*
Great artwork!

Also Idk how common knowledge this is but... If you use this on a guy who thrn gets a kill, you get the assist and some renown.
    I noticed this too! Also if you give it to someone who has revenge active, they get to keep their remaining shield for a while, after they exit revenge.  
I also noticed that feats that give damage boost to teammates seem to give kill assists and renown too.
        I always wondered about using t1 on a revenge teammate, thanks!

Yep another good one is JJ when he uses benefaction, really useful against jorms.
            Also the snowball emote. It gives kill assists too! :D
This reminds me of a breach match I had a while back. Everyone was a pretty high total rep, with plenty of time put into the game, apart from a Lawbringer on my team. Total rep 30-something. 

As Black Prior, I spent the final two stages of the game just protecting him. I'd pop shields on him, use oathbreaker when we ganked someone, use my fourth tier, all of it. Escorting him to the healing point when he was at no health. 

We cut down everyone in our path. Nobody could touch the Lawboy without answering to me. Through the sheer force of ass-busting I did to keep him alive, we killed the commander without him dying a single time after the start of the second stage. 

I hope he's still playing the game. I really do.
    :D  
This is why I enjoy playing BP. I get to play as a protector and as support to my team.
I always throw it on that one goofy ass who keeps running into groups of enemies by himself.
    Well of course I know him. He‚Äôs me
I love BP‚Äôs support feats and I wish there were more like them
I think the nerf on it is too harsh. They should have either decreased the shield or increased the HP cost, not both.
wtf an actually good meme on this subreddit 

***H O W***
question, does BP have any shields WITHOUT spikes on the sides?
    Yeah
    Only one shield that isn't massively edgy that also doesn't have spikes.
        There are also some from events
            They don't have spikes, but they ARE fucking edgy.
                Prince of Persia shield is really not edgy
                Eagle shield isn‚Äôt really edgy (don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs called, but it has a birb on it)
                    Tombstell (silver) or Aeslon i think (golden)  
And FFS, the one shield, Ni Os Peril, i think. It's the edgiest piece of wargear ever made.
                        The one with a golden eagle in the corner? How so? I thought edgy was black with spikes. If that‚Äôs edgy, then by god, what isn‚Äôt?
    Well I rock a nice silver curved surface shield that isn't edgy besides an eagle head in the center.
I feel like most players don't realise when they're gifted with the dahhkness and just carry on.
    There are plenty who say Thanks!
Perfectly balanced - as all things in For Honor should be.
I love this
Same
That is a really high effort meme
Is this a reference to something? I kinda dont get it
    It's a reference to [Hulk taco meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hulk-gives-ant-man-a-taco).
    Avengers
Thanks bp very cool
"Quieres?"
did you made it yourself?
    Yep
        nice!
I wonder if that shield on an assassin in a 1v1 makes it a 2v1 for purposes of the assassin getting renown from the kill.
    If you give it to someone and they win a fight you get an assist credit so.. maybe?
    Other people are saying that they get kill assist credit for this, so I think it does get bumped to a 2v1.
I love how it‚Äôs at the bottom of zone A on that one map where everyone jumps off and sometimes only nearly survive
r/wholesomememes
Ain‚Äôt no shaman taking my shield. Horrible little monsters, all of ‚Äòem.
I really like your art style. This looks like Happy Souls material but For Honor instead. üòçü§©
This makes me feel warm inside
Happy Necc noises
The For Honor version of "Have an upvote"
how badly will people hate me if i start playing black prior? its the closest i can get to darth vader i swear im not toxic
    Well, the newest hero or centurion is probably closer, given the one handed sword thing
        probably, but centurion doesnt come as close fashion wise and black prior moves in a very darth vader manner
            Yeah, the newest hero, warmonger tI think, it probably the best bet then, edgelord color scheme,( so black is undoubtedly in there) and a one sword brutalist battle style
                at this point im just being pointlessly pedantic bc its interesting to me, but i think warmonger fights more like kylo ren tbh
    Every character is toxic, there, I said it

Pick who ever
        not even wrong, but even in a room full of smellies,,,some characters still have an Odor
            I guess, idk, I quit multiplayer since CCU but might return on the 27th or wait until it's playable, in console
That‚Äôs the heal on block one, right? It‚Äôs been a while but I remember it being a pick up feat in the viking campaign
    It's Sinister Shield. BP gives a 30 HP shield to a teammate at the cost of losing 25 HP.
Is this from something?
    It's a reference to [Hulk taco meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hulk-gives-ant-man-a-taco).
        Wh- I‚Äôve never even seen that before, what is that from
            Check out the URL I linked. It has info about and the origin of the meme.
Darkness friend, no bite
I'm a BP main and I use this feat almost every game but I can't remember one time it actually saved someone. I usually just end up having to watch from afar as they get executed because I couldn't get there in time
I love my boy
That BP's face is quite disturbing...
    Haha, it's professor Hulk's face from his taco meme.

                        Ahh its a bot that detects haikus? Yeah I know what haiku means, I just didn't realize that that's what that bot does, why is there a bot that detects haikus anyway? XD

        TF does "haikus" means?
            Haiku is a type of japanese poetry. I can link you the wikipedia page if you want.
                Ahh its a bot that detects haikus? Yeah I know what haiku means, I just didn't realize that that's what that bot does, why is there a bot that detects haikus anyway? XD
                    I guess sometimes it arranges it into a funny way but I havent seen it do any funny ones so far.

            He has returned!
with smoke bomb even better. Nobu feat/perk combo which is at least viable (as supportive ofc)
Remember when Protected Revived used to be good too?  
it was imo
A lotta Black Prior mains take after the 'Protector' tag on the BP.

Chasing your 1-bar-1-rep Berserker across the map and ending up 1v3ing while he runs off to do fuck-knows what.  
Worth.
    I see yeah that's true. Feel like the only one who actually tries to play like a medic with bp.
When he firsts came out I was always helping people in ganks now I'm seeking people to gank me because AD PROFUNDIS is just so much fun xd
        Me too , but i didnt get Rising Dawn yet , but i loved playing black prior for 2 weeks , then i came back to my Cent and i was like "how do i deal with gank?"
            The question of questions 
Most of the time by having a shit ton of luck Haha
Edgy, brooding, aggressive asshole
    Hahah yes ^EDGE^
A small shield though.
    Even a small shield can tip a fight back in an allies favor.
        That's why I use speed revive instead since I already have umbral shelter.
            My point was that with that small extra shield I dont even have to revive the guy
                Yes, but my point is that instead, that same guy gets his ass bashed in trying to win the gank after getting a small shield. I dunno about you, but I've been in more situations where I needed to revive quickly than to give an already dying friendly a small and very limited shield. I have Umbral Shelter for those moments.
            It's better to save someone than try to revive someone in a team fight.
Yep, it got nerfed :(((
Also the snowball emote. It gives kill assists too! :D
They don't have spikes, but they ARE fucking edgy.
    Prince of Persia shield is really not edgy
    Eagle shield isn‚Äôt really edgy (don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs called, but it has a birb on it)
        Tombstell (silver) or Aeslon i think (golden)  
And FFS, the one shield, Ni Os Peril, i think. It's the edgiest piece of wargear ever made.
            The one with a golden eagle in the corner? How so? I thought edgy was black with spikes. If that‚Äôs edgy, then by god, what isn‚Äôt?
Yeah, the newest hero, warmonger tI think, it probably the best bet then, edgelord color scheme,( so black is undoubtedly in there) and a one sword brutalist battle style
    at this point im just being pointlessly pedantic bc its interesting to me, but i think warmonger fights more like kylo ren tbh
