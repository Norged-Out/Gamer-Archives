It is even scarier when the monster appears as an 0 rank Warden then precedes to 3-0 you and parry all your mix ups.
    Smurfs
        No we‚Äôre talking about good players who are bad players in disguise not smurfs idiot. /s
        Call me an idiot but what do you mean? Please ignore my name.
            A Smurf is a high level experience player who re-rolls a new character so they can beat up on new inexperienced players.
                Oooooh, I just call them assholes.
                    Oh they are that too :)
                        They are not much different.

Account assholes
                        Look I know I‚Äôm only rep 3 but it‚Äôs not my fault everyone plays orochi and everyone sucks as him alright?

(Throws side dodge attacks without reason against a lawbringer so what is a man to do?)
    Or a lowly rep 0 conqueror who really has 70 reps on his main.
        Trust me, a rep 0 conqueror for real is scarier than a rep 70. You can't know what he's doing if he doesn't
            Yea i find it harder to fight players who have no idea what their doing because they're so random lol
                I eat so many heavies that I expect to be feinted because I‚Äôm actually bad at this game
                    Sometimes i do this though
I'll just be like "itsa let the heavy fly kinda day" 


Catch hella people with the heavys its unreal
                        No one ever expects straight Highland heavy's. 

"Nah, no way this rep 15 Highlander is just going to toss those out"
                            Exactly! Same with me, they always think im going to soft feint into a stunning tap but no raw heavysüòé
                                I‚Äôd honestly rather have that than get tap spammed so good on you :)
                                    Try it! You know how good it feels to 3 hit a zerk? ;)

*wallsplat top heavys*
                            Fr though! They rarely expect a regular heavy after a light *from the same side*
                                My favourite is to purposefully whiff the first light and then hammer 'em with two heavy's from the chain.
                                    Oouuuu! I‚Äôll have to use that one later today lol
                        I‚Äôm bad so this is all I do even against high level players. Heavy spam with Shugoki cuz there‚Äôs no way I would just throw that out. Next swing ‚Äúokay well there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs just gonna do it again.‚Äù

                        Yeah so many people never expect the raw heavies coming from an orochi. No one ever expects heavies on orochi for some reason
                        Fuck all of y'all. Every single time I let heavies fly they get parried. Every. Single. Time.
                            At higher level play this is more often the case. The  reaction time and adaptability of some players is mind boggling.
                For real, the only character i got better with after I learned them was glad. I just got worse with the rest.
                I've got a friend who only played lawbringer and was terrible at the game. He would never stop throwing heavies, even OOS. But he would rack up kills because people always thought he would feint.
                Getting better at this game is actually kind of funny because you can be rep 20 and land light chains from the same side every time because the other guy doesn't think you'll do such a noob move and then he's dead
            Ah the deadpool style.

Nobody can predict your moves if you can't even predict them yourself.

        Dont forget the booster cards at 5 bucks a pop that make you a god for 5 seconds
            they ship you a credit card swiper that you plug into your pc/console, whenever you want revenge, swipe your card, and get revenge for 15 seconds, at the low, low price of 7.99$!
                Parrying? 2.99 a day or 75.99 for the whole month unlimited!

wowzers what a deal
            You can get a discount on the revenge activation DLC too!
    Most likely Ubisoft will do what they're doing with rainbow six and keep updating and making content for the main game. No reason to make a second when they can update the first and charge for that. Les development costs to.
        Last time they were questioned about For Honor 2 they did say they had no plans or even concepts for a 2nd game now or for the near future. So that's either good news or bad news.
    Until epic starts snacking up console games to port them exclusively to the epic games store...
        I personally think it's a great move! PC gets Console Exclusives, and Epic gets to bite the costs because Fuck Epic, I'm gonna pirate it instead.
        i wouldnt have a problem with that to be honest, steam isnt much better at all.
            personally, I use steam big picture with my controller. So steam is still a bit more conveniant fore me. I know, few people use it, but I like big picture mode.
                Yea i mainly use steam as well, but to say steam is morally superior is just wrong
                    Agreed. I actually think the better cut for people who make the game is morally better.
I just wonder if this is just a temporary thing to get people abord, kind of like big companies undercut small shops until they go bankrupt, then raise prices when the competition is gone.

Basically matchmaking since launch 


they‚Äôve been trying to fix that for years....
    It's really unfortunate, I've gotten so many friends into FH but they all quit after a week or so because the matchmaking keeps putting them into unwinnable games over and over and over. I get matchmaking in skill based games is hard, but FH has no lie got to be the worst example of it being done poorly I've ever seen.

Once you hit rep 1 it's like the matchmaker goes "OK so you are good at the game now enjoy"
        ###ON PAR WITH YOUR ENEMIES

me: P2 nobushi
my team: level 7 kensei, level 14 conq, p1 Raider

their team:
P100 Warden, P60 Lawbringer, P50 Orochi and a P60 Shugoki
            Seeing "P" instead of "R" for Reputations hurts my soul
                What, you don‚Äôt like the Preputation system?
                Prestige most likely
                    I know, but it still hurts my soul
                        Sorry I also play Dead by Daylight and that game has prestige stuff too so terms get mixed up.
                            I figured something like that :P
                            I see a lot of guys that play similar games to me in the games I do play. 

That sounds weird, but I‚Äôve met a lot of people in dbd that play fh and ark. Met people in fh that play dbd and such.
            You think that's fear? The only true fear is when you see the satanic symbol of AI on the other team. I fear no man, but that thing, scares me.
                The enemy team gets a level 3 bot. We always get a level 2 bot.
        They don't seem to make any accomodation for Time Played or anything, just "% of games/fights won". So if you've been doing okay against other newbies and L1 bots, they see that 70% winrate and think "Oh okay he'll do fine against this guy who's been playing since Y1S1 and has the same winrate accumulated over thousands of matches".
        Get them to play on console, at first at least. It's much more forgiving on console since they'll be less likely to be grouped with people that have thousands of hours on the game and have  already mastered M&K from the get-go.
            But then you gotta play on a console
                Fair point lol. 
30fps VS rep 61473 Shugoki tho. 
Which is really worse?
                    Well on 30fps every shugoki feel a like a rep 6000.

#MAYBE IF THEIR ANIMATIONS WERENT SHIT
                        Looks like you could use a **BEAR HUG**

                                **CRACK!**
            I'm not so sure about that, when it became free to play for ps plus members my friends and I started playing and absolutely loved it for the first week. It was a bit challenging at times but we won maybe 2/3 of our matches. The instant we hit rep 1 it was a different, and entirely unplayable game altogether. The second and final week we played was so painful we would stop playing for the night once we got our first win for the day (would typically take 5-8 matches) Never experienced anything quite like that in a game
                [deleted]
                    If you are bad at the game, it should be matching you with players that are also bad, sometimes slightly better, to force you to increase your skill. For newer players, matchmaking feels like ranked matchmaking does to us.
                    I, personally am not good at this game and have no shame admitting it. Two of the three guys I played with are avid gamers though so maybe you were a medieval champion in your past life
        Underated comment
        Happy cake day!
        But that's also why I'm honest with anyone I introduce to the game. "The matchmaking's not great and you're probably gonna get your ass beat a lot but it is SO FUN when you get the hang of it."  


Plus, most games I play you still end up being matched against people who you can't even graze sometimes, that's just part of PVP.
            Yeah I tried that too, turns out getting mudstompped for days and days with the promise of it being fun eventually does not really work for most people.
                I also heartily reccommend they do the Warrior Trials and PvAI with friends or just alone to get the hang of their combos and mixups (especially now that bots can be fooled by feints) and how to defend themselves.

But hey your answer is also why I don't play games like League - getting roflstomped by the people who play it daily isn't fun.
                    Yea but even League have better matchmaking. After 5-10 matches it will stop pairing you with smurfs and you will only play with people on your skill level. It isn't ideal but for sure it's better than For Honor matchmaking.
        My friend closed and uninstalled the game right after getting 2 hit killed by Highlander, twice. I'm not sure if he even made it to rep 1
    truth, but over time you changed from beeing prey to becoming the monster yourself.
        There's always...always a bigger monster.
            Hello there

*General Kenobi WOW WOW WOW*
        You either die a warden main...Or you live long enough to become ‚ÄúLegendary‚Äù *Air hump intensifies*
    Are you sure they‚Äôve been trying? I can‚Äôt imagine a team being so bad they can‚Äôt make matchmaking better than it is when they are actually for real trying.
        This is the 4-5th time they‚Äôve reset matchmaking for their ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù
            matchmaking has made a tiny bit of an improvement bc now when i join a lobby it‚Äôll be a team of 30 reps each with a single rep 100 instead of a full team of rep 100s. the pain is still there but it doesn‚Äôt hurt as much
                Give it some time
            Holy shit
                You underestimate ubis triple A devs incompetence. 

Oh sorry I mean it‚Äôs a 
small indie dev team they‚Äôll get it right eventually....
                    Hey man, it could be worse. We could have R6S's dev team *shudders*
My friend made me do ranked when I was barely rep 1 conq and I immediately get a 139 rep overall 60 rep kensei. Safe to say haven‚Äôt gone back since
    We're you still in placement matches?
    Plenty of high reps aren‚Äôt that good. Part of the point of placement matches is gauging your skill level, so it puts you against many different players to see where you stand.
I totally agree! Ark and For Honor for the win!
    I love both those game, but ooff. Ark is brutal I played it for months Never met a game that hates its players so much lo. don't get me wrong, it is a lot of fun, but the grind is so real, and at any point you could lose everything.
        Yep, my friends and I play on a private server with the resource gathering buffed up to high hell. Don‚Äôt have to worry about enemy tribes and hours of grinding.
        Yes it is quite brutal. I played with a decent size tribe though, so it was not as bad as it could be. We were usually the alpha tribe on any server we joined.
Literally the only two games that are played on my xbox
That's why I just play against AI.
    *Level 3 bots while your team is level 1 and 2 bots.*
        Sound fair to me
    **Breach PvAI 4life**

Maybe im just retarded or something, but do you know how hard it is for me to parry?!? Im a rep 60 Highlander for crying out loud and ive found that the only things i should even consider parrying is dodge attacks because most characters cant cancel them. But for the new guys, they all just get in your face and light, light. Light Bash. Light Heavy. And if i ever try to parry them, i start the process of digging a 6 foot hole.
    Lights are pretty prediction based. You see that damn raider throw a stunning tap from his heavies get ready to parry that shit and get your free heavy. 

Same with any moves players default to like LB top light, orochi top light, warden zone. They get predictable with moves they crutch on.
        Bro i kid you not, all ive seen in ranked is Black Prior, Hitokiri, Jormungandr, And the rest are raiders. Fuck raiders. I have no idea how to fight them. Is it just me being on console or what? The parry flashes and then they fucking cancel the attack into a stun. Once again. 
Fuck raiders.
If you play raider, i have no respect for you. Im not kidding when i say Orochi's are easier to fight than raiders. By a million. I could win against an orochi 4/5 times. Raiders 0/5.
            Console is definitely harder. Add in the fact the the enemy could be lagging.
            Just try hard characters, except jorm. Jorms just seem to spam and hope you fail their mixup. Parry jorms lights over and over and I can feel them crying on the other end. 

Raider isn‚Äôt too bad, the way I fight him is keep your guard to the top. Then react to the side. Know that at any point in a heavy they can soft feint to tap. Once they do tap you I either try and immediately light to provide some space or react to what they do. Usually they will do a zone mixup and you‚Äôll be at the disadvantage there. The only issue I have with raider is his animations are janky as hell. The damage is a bit brutal as well. When they let that zone fly in a chain and you get smacked with a raw 50 dmg it hurts.
                I hate that every other character is getting damage that is more than my sword now. 

\*Sad Highlander Noises\*

And usually i would try to do a light like you said, but it doesn't work against most characters now, because they will throw out their light before mine. Highlanders light aren't the fastest.

Thanks for the tips though bro. I have respect for the Lawbringers.
I like how most people seemed to think of Shugoki first, I instantly thought of Shaman
    You and me both brother
I once killed and ate a player in ark because he got my character infected with that swamp disease. 

I then looted his entire base and left a note saying he tasted delicious

Edit: I‚Äôm equal parts proud and ashamed of this
    In ark the difference is that you the player is the higher level monster
Can‚Äôt deny that
I find for honor to be kinda dull without my buddy because while I love the game I just don't enjoy my salty ass being out salted but with my friend at least we can be salty together because we're both potatos, as in potato players and we're scottish and Irish so we're living potatoes
ARK really is a great game
    Ark allows me to finally play out my childhood fantasy of raising an army of genetically perfect raptors.
        Hey, only in that game do you feel like you can be Chris pratt
    I got it and the season pass for $36 a few days ago and I can't put it down.
        It‚Äôs an amazing game for what it is. Had bugs since launch but haven‚Äôt been game breaking at all for me. 

Any time is a great time to play ark. They just announced two new maps (new season pass sorry friend.) But if you have the current pass, SE, Abberation, and Extinction will keep you more than enough busy till they come out. 

That‚Äôs not even touching Rag, Center or Val.
            Rag is freaking majestic
I like ark.
I too fuck with both these games on a very hard level.

Accurate, actually. I'm not taking the chance!
For honor after rep 1 is very much a ‚Äúget gud noob‚Äù type of environment.
I once had a rep 0 orochi in duels, but he was actually that low. All he did was dodge lights from neutral. Man got parried a lot.
I wish I could still play ark but a lot of the community I‚Äôve ran into are toxic or only keep a server open for at most a month
So very true

        they ship you a credit card swiper that you plug into your pc/console, whenever you want revenge, swipe your card, and get revenge for 15 seconds, at the low, low price of 7.99$!
            Parrying? 2.99 a day or 75.99 for the whole month unlimited!

wowzers what a deal
        You can get a discount on the revenge activation DLC too!
Most likely Ubisoft will do what they're doing with rainbow six and keep updating and making content for the main game. No reason to make a second when they can update the first and charge for that. Les development costs to.
    Last time they were questioned about For Honor 2 they did say they had no plans or even concepts for a 2nd game now or for the near future. So that's either good news or bad news.
Until epic starts snacking up console games to port them exclusively to the epic games store...
    I personally think it's a great move! PC gets Console Exclusives, and Epic gets to bite the costs because Fuck Epic, I'm gonna pirate it instead.
    i wouldnt have a problem with that to be honest, steam isnt much better at all.
        personally, I use steam big picture with my controller. So steam is still a bit more conveniant fore me. I know, few people use it, but I like big picture mode.
            Yea i mainly use steam as well, but to say steam is morally superior is just wrong
                Agreed. I actually think the better cut for people who make the game is morally better.
I just wonder if this is just a temporary thing to get people abord, kind of like big companies undercut small shops until they go bankrupt, then raise prices when the competition is gone.

        Honestly, some people...
        What did they say?
            "Where did you get that information?"
                WOWWWWWW okay ty
    r/woooosh
Don‚Äôt give me ptsd
    I will never forget the day I had a Shugoki just sit on me for an execution.
It's really unfortunate, I've gotten so many friends into FH but they all quit after a week or so because the matchmaking keeps putting them into unwinnable games over and over and over. I get matchmaking in skill based games is hard, but FH has no lie got to be the worst example of it being done poorly I've ever seen.

Once you hit rep 1 it's like the matchmaker goes "OK so you are good at the game now enjoy"
    ###ON PAR WITH YOUR ENEMIES

me: P2 nobushi
my team: level 7 kensei, level 14 conq, p1 Raider

their team:
P100 Warden, P60 Lawbringer, P50 Orochi and a P60 Shugoki
        Seeing "P" instead of "R" for Reputations hurts my soul
            What, you don‚Äôt like the Preputation system?
            Prestige most likely
                I know, but it still hurts my soul
                    Sorry I also play Dead by Daylight and that game has prestige stuff too so terms get mixed up.
                        I figured something like that :P
                        I see a lot of guys that play similar games to me in the games I do play. 

That sounds weird, but I‚Äôve met a lot of people in dbd that play fh and ark. Met people in fh that play dbd and such.
        You think that's fear? The only true fear is when you see the satanic symbol of AI on the other team. I fear no man, but that thing, scares me.
            The enemy team gets a level 3 bot. We always get a level 2 bot.
    They don't seem to make any accomodation for Time Played or anything, just "% of games/fights won". So if you've been doing okay against other newbies and L1 bots, they see that 70% winrate and think "Oh okay he'll do fine against this guy who's been playing since Y1S1 and has the same winrate accumulated over thousands of matches".
    Get them to play on console, at first at least. It's much more forgiving on console since they'll be less likely to be grouped with people that have thousands of hours on the game and have  already mastered M&K from the get-go.
        But then you gotta play on a console
            Fair point lol. 
30fps VS rep 61473 Shugoki tho. 
Which is really worse?
                Well on 30fps every shugoki feel a like a rep 6000.

#MAYBE IF THEIR ANIMATIONS WERENT SHIT
                    Looks like you could use a **BEAR HUG**
                        OH GOD PLEASE NO
                            **CRACK!**
        I'm not so sure about that, when it became free to play for ps plus members my friends and I started playing and absolutely loved it for the first week. It was a bit challenging at times but we won maybe 2/3 of our matches. The instant we hit rep 1 it was a different, and entirely unplayable game altogether. The second and final week we played was so painful we would stop playing for the night once we got our first win for the day (would typically take 5-8 matches) Never experienced anything quite like that in a game
            [deleted]
                If you are bad at the game, it should be matching you with players that are also bad, sometimes slightly better, to force you to increase your skill. For newer players, matchmaking feels like ranked matchmaking does to us.
                I, personally am not good at this game and have no shame admitting it. Two of the three guys I played with are avid gamers though so maybe you were a medieval champion in your past life
    Underated comment
    Happy cake day!
    But that's also why I'm honest with anyone I introduce to the game. "The matchmaking's not great and you're probably gonna get your ass beat a lot but it is SO FUN when you get the hang of it."  


Plus, most games I play you still end up being matched against people who you can't even graze sometimes, that's just part of PVP.
        Yeah I tried that too, turns out getting mudstompped for days and days with the promise of it being fun eventually does not really work for most people.
            I also heartily reccommend they do the Warrior Trials and PvAI with friends or just alone to get the hang of their combos and mixups (especially now that bots can be fooled by feints) and how to defend themselves.

But hey your answer is also why I don't play games like League - getting roflstomped by the people who play it daily isn't fun.
                Yea but even League have better matchmaking. After 5-10 matches it will stop pairing you with smurfs and you will only play with people on your skill level. It isn't ideal but for sure it's better than For Honor matchmaking.
    My friend closed and uninstalled the game right after getting 2 hit killed by Highlander, twice. I'm not sure if he even made it to rep 1
truth, but over time you changed from beeing prey to becoming the monster yourself.
    There's always...always a bigger monster.
        Hello there

*General Kenobi WOW WOW WOW*
    You either die a warden main...Or you live long enough to become ‚ÄúLegendary‚Äù *Air hump intensifies*
Are you sure they‚Äôve been trying? I can‚Äôt imagine a team being so bad they can‚Äôt make matchmaking better than it is when they are actually for real trying.
    This is the 4-5th time they‚Äôve reset matchmaking for their ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù
        matchmaking has made a tiny bit of an improvement bc now when i join a lobby it‚Äôll be a team of 30 reps each with a single rep 100 instead of a full team of rep 100s. the pain is still there but it doesn‚Äôt hurt as much
            Give it some time
        Holy shit
            You underestimate ubis triple A devs incompetence. 

Oh sorry I mean it‚Äôs a 
small indie dev team they‚Äôll get it right eventually....
                Hey man, it could be worse. We could have R6S's dev team *shudders*
We're you still in placement matches?
Plenty of high reps aren‚Äôt that good. Part of the point of placement matches is gauging your skill level, so it puts you against many different players to see where you stand.
I love both those game, but ooff. Ark is brutal I played it for months Never met a game that hates its players so much lo. don't get me wrong, it is a lot of fun, but the grind is so real, and at any point you could lose everything.
    Yep, my friends and I play on a private server with the resource gathering buffed up to high hell. Don‚Äôt have to worry about enemy tribes and hours of grinding.
    Yes it is quite brutal. I played with a decent size tribe though, so it was not as bad as it could be. We were usually the alpha tribe on any server we joined.
*Level 3 bots while your team is level 1 and 2 bots.*
    Sound fair to me
**Breach PvAI 4life**
Preach
Lights are pretty prediction based. You see that damn raider throw a stunning tap from his heavies get ready to parry that shit and get your free heavy. 

Same with any moves players default to like LB top light, orochi top light, warden zone. They get predictable with moves they crutch on.
    Bro i kid you not, all ive seen in ranked is Black Prior, Hitokiri, Jormungandr, And the rest are raiders. Fuck raiders. I have no idea how to fight them. Is it just me being on console or what? The parry flashes and then they fucking cancel the attack into a stun. Once again. 
Fuck raiders.
If you play raider, i have no respect for you. Im not kidding when i say Orochi's are easier to fight than raiders. By a million. I could win against an orochi 4/5 times. Raiders 0/5.
        Console is definitely harder. Add in the fact the the enemy could be lagging.
        Just try hard characters, except jorm. Jorms just seem to spam and hope you fail their mixup. Parry jorms lights over and over and I can feel them crying on the other end. 

Raider isn‚Äôt too bad, the way I fight him is keep your guard to the top. Then react to the side. Know that at any point in a heavy they can soft feint to tap. Once they do tap you I either try and immediately light to provide some space or react to what they do. Usually they will do a zone mixup and you‚Äôll be at the disadvantage there. The only issue I have with raider is his animations are janky as hell. The damage is a bit brutal as well. When they let that zone fly in a chain and you get smacked with a raw 50 dmg it hurts.
            I hate that every other character is getting damage that is more than my sword now. 

\*Sad Highlander Noises\*

And usually i would try to do a light like you said, but it doesn't work against most characters now, because they will throw out their light before mine. Highlanders light aren't the fastest.

Thanks for the tips though bro. I have respect for the Lawbringers.
You and me both brother
In ark the difference is that you the player is the higher level monster
Ark allows me to finally play out my childhood fantasy of raising an army of genetically perfect raptors.
    Hey, only in that game do you feel like you can be Chris pratt
I got it and the season pass for $36 a few days ago and I can't put it down.
    It‚Äôs an amazing game for what it is. Had bugs since launch but haven‚Äôt been game breaking at all for me. 

Any time is a great time to play ark. They just announced two new maps (new season pass sorry friend.) But if you have the current pass, SE, Abberation, and Extinction will keep you more than enough busy till they come out. 

That‚Äôs not even touching Rag, Center or Val.
        Rag is freaking majestic
I am a shrekgoki
‚ÄúNot to brag or anything‚Äù
Skill>rep. I have a rep 40 friend that can antigank teams of rep 100-300s as cent. After a certain point rep doesn't determine your skill.
Shut the fuck up
    Wow, you gamer boyz sure are spicy
You know b, that's kinda mean
No we‚Äôre talking about good players who are bad players in disguise not smurfs idiot. /s
Call me an idiot but what do you mean? Please ignore my name.
    A Smurf is a high level experience player who re-rolls a new character so they can beat up on new inexperienced players.
        Oooooh, I just call them assholes.
            Oh they are that too :)
                They are not much different.

Account assholes
                Look I know I‚Äôm only rep 3 but it‚Äôs not my fault everyone plays orochi and everyone sucks as him alright?

(Throws side dodge attacks without reason against a lawbringer so what is a man to do?)
Trust me, a rep 0 conqueror for real is scarier than a rep 70. You can't know what he's doing if he doesn't
    Yea i find it harder to fight players who have no idea what their doing because they're so random lol
        I eat so many heavies that I expect to be feinted because I‚Äôm actually bad at this game
            Sometimes i do this though
I'll just be like "itsa let the heavy fly kinda day" 


Catch hella people with the heavys its unreal
                No one ever expects straight Highland heavy's. 

"Nah, no way this rep 15 Highlander is just going to toss those out"
                    Exactly! Same with me, they always think im going to soft feint into a stunning tap but no raw heavysüòé
                        I‚Äôd honestly rather have that than get tap spammed so good on you :)
                            Try it! You know how good it feels to 3 hit a zerk? ;)
                        r/emojipolice

Hands up. You are being arrested for crimes against humanity. You have the right to remain silent.
                            Fuck you!

*wallsplat top heavys*
                    Fr though! They rarely expect a regular heavy after a light *from the same side*
                        My favourite is to purposefully whiff the first light and then hammer 'em with two heavy's from the chain.
                            Oouuuu! I‚Äôll have to use that one later today lol
                I‚Äôm bad so this is all I do even against high level players. Heavy spam with Shugoki cuz there‚Äôs no way I would just throw that out. Next swing ‚Äúokay well there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs just gonna do it again.‚Äù
                    #SUPRISE MOTHAFUCKAAA#
                Seriously, I love when I catch myself saying ‚Äúwow I didn‚Äôt expect them to let that go‚Äù
                Yeah so many people never expect the raw heavies coming from an orochi. No one ever expects heavies on orochi for some reason
                Fuck all of y'all. Every single time I let heavies fly they get parried. Every. Single. Time.
                    At higher level play this is more often the case. The  reaction time and adaptability of some players is mind boggling.
        For real, the only character i got better with after I learned them was glad. I just got worse with the rest.
        I've got a friend who only played lawbringer and was terrible at the game. He would never stop throwing heavies, even OOS. But he would rack up kills because people always thought he would feint.
        Getting better at this game is actually kind of funny because you can be rep 20 and land light chains from the same side every time because the other guy doesn't think you'll do such a noob move and then he's dead
    Ah the deadpool style.

Nobody can predict your moves if you can't even predict them yourself.
    *infinite chain intensifies*
    That‚Äôs how I was able to beat my better friends when I first started
Free weekend in a nutshell.
Bunch of parry god and pure newbs.

            Seriously, I love when I catch myself saying ‚Äúwow I didn‚Äôt expect them to let that go‚Äù
            Yeah so many people never expect the raw heavies coming from an orochi. No one ever expects heavies on orochi for some reason
            Fuck all of y'all. Every single time I let heavies fly they get parried. Every. Single. Time.
                At higher level play this is more often the case. The  reaction time and adaptability of some players is mind boggling.
    For real, the only character i got better with after I learned them was glad. I just got worse with the rest.
    I've got a friend who only played lawbringer and was terrible at the game. He would never stop throwing heavies, even OOS. But he would rack up kills because people always thought he would feint.
    Getting better at this game is actually kind of funny because you can be rep 20 and land light chains from the same side every time because the other guy doesn't think you'll do such a noob move and then he's dead
Ah the deadpool style.

Nobody can predict your moves if you can't even predict them yourself.
*infinite chain intensifies*
That‚Äôs how I was able to beat my better friends when I first started
they ship you a credit card swiper that you plug into your pc/console, whenever you want revenge, swipe your card, and get revenge for 15 seconds, at the low, low price of 7.99$!
    Parrying? 2.99 a day or 75.99 for the whole month unlimited!

wowzers what a deal
You can get a discount on the revenge activation DLC too!
personally, I use steam big picture with my controller. So steam is still a bit more conveniant fore me. I know, few people use it, but I like big picture mode.
    Yea i mainly use steam as well, but to say steam is morally superior is just wrong
        Agreed. I actually think the better cut for people who make the game is morally better.
I just wonder if this is just a temporary thing to get people abord, kind of like big companies undercut small shops until they go bankrupt, then raise prices when the competition is gone.
Honestly, some people...
What did they say?
    "Where did you get that information?"
        WOWWWWWW okay ty
Seeing "P" instead of "R" for Reputations hurts my soul
    What, you don‚Äôt like the Preputation system?
    Prestige most likely
        I know, but it still hurts my soul
            Sorry I also play Dead by Daylight and that game has prestige stuff too so terms get mixed up.
                I figured something like that :P
                I see a lot of guys that play similar games to me in the games I do play. 

That sounds weird, but I‚Äôve met a lot of people in dbd that play fh and ark. Met people in fh that play dbd and such.
You think that's fear? The only true fear is when you see the satanic symbol of AI on the other team. I fear no man, but that thing, scares me.
    The enemy team gets a level 3 bot. We always get a level 2 bot.
But then you gotta play on a console
    Fair point lol. 
30fps VS rep 61473 Shugoki tho. 
Which is really worse?
        Well on 30fps every shugoki feel a like a rep 6000.

#MAYBE IF THEIR ANIMATIONS WERENT SHIT
            Looks like you could use a **BEAR HUG**
                OH GOD PLEASE NO
                    **CRACK!**
I'm not so sure about that, when it became free to play for ps plus members my friends and I started playing and absolutely loved it for the first week. It was a bit challenging at times but we won maybe 2/3 of our matches. The instant we hit rep 1 it was a different, and entirely unplayable game altogether. The second and final week we played was so painful we would stop playing for the night once we got our first win for the day (would typically take 5-8 matches) Never experienced anything quite like that in a game
    [deleted]
        If you are bad at the game, it should be matching you with players that are also bad, sometimes slightly better, to force you to increase your skill. For newer players, matchmaking feels like ranked matchmaking does to us.
        I, personally am not good at this game and have no shame admitting it. Two of the three guys I played with are avid gamers though so maybe you were a medieval champion in your past life
Yeah I tried that too, turns out getting mudstompped for days and days with the promise of it being fun eventually does not really work for most people.
    I also heartily reccommend they do the Warrior Trials and PvAI with friends or just alone to get the hang of their combos and mixups (especially now that bots can be fooled by feints) and how to defend themselves.

But hey your answer is also why I don't play games like League - getting roflstomped by the people who play it daily isn't fun.
        Yea but even League have better matchmaking. After 5-10 matches it will stop pairing you with smurfs and you will only play with people on your skill level. It isn't ideal but for sure it's better than For Honor matchmaking.
Hello there

*General Kenobi WOW WOW WOW*
matchmaking has made a tiny bit of an improvement bc now when i join a lobby it‚Äôll be a team of 30 reps each with a single rep 100 instead of a full team of rep 100s. the pain is still there but it doesn‚Äôt hurt as much
    Give it some time
Holy shit
    You underestimate ubis triple A devs incompetence. 

Oh sorry I mean it‚Äôs a 
small indie dev team they‚Äôll get it right eventually....
        Hey man, it could be worse. We could have R6S's dev team *shudders*
Console is definitely harder. Add in the fact the the enemy could be lagging.
Just try hard characters, except jorm. Jorms just seem to spam and hope you fail their mixup. Parry jorms lights over and over and I can feel them crying on the other end. 

Raider isn‚Äôt too bad, the way I fight him is keep your guard to the top. Then react to the side. Know that at any point in a heavy they can soft feint to tap. Once they do tap you I either try and immediately light to provide some space or react to what they do. Usually they will do a zone mixup and you‚Äôll be at the disadvantage there. The only issue I have with raider is his animations are janky as hell. The damage is a bit brutal as well. When they let that zone fly in a chain and you get smacked with a raw 50 dmg it hurts.
    I hate that every other character is getting damage that is more than my sword now. 

\*Sad Highlander Noises\*

And usually i would try to do a light like you said, but it doesn't work against most characters now, because they will throw out their light before mine. Highlanders light aren't the fastest.

Thanks for the tips though bro. I have respect for the Lawbringers.
Rag is freaking majestic
Oooooh, I just call them assholes.
    Oh they are that too :)
        They are not much different.

Account assholes
        Look I know I‚Äôm only rep 3 but it‚Äôs not my fault everyone plays orochi and everyone sucks as him alright?

(Throws side dodge attacks without reason against a lawbringer so what is a man to do?)
I eat so many heavies that I expect to be feinted because I‚Äôm actually bad at this game
    Sometimes i do this though
I'll just be like "itsa let the heavy fly kinda day" 


Catch hella people with the heavys its unreal
        No one ever expects straight Highland heavy's. 

"Nah, no way this rep 15 Highlander is just going to toss those out"
            Exactly! Same with me, they always think im going to soft feint into a stunning tap but no raw heavysüòé
                I‚Äôd honestly rather have that than get tap spammed so good on you :)
                    Try it! You know how good it feels to 3 hit a zerk? ;)
                r/emojipolice

Hands up. You are being arrested for crimes against humanity. You have the right to remain silent.
                    Fuck you!

*wallsplat top heavys*
            Fr though! They rarely expect a regular heavy after a light *from the same side*
                My favourite is to purposefully whiff the first light and then hammer 'em with two heavy's from the chain.
                    Oouuuu! I‚Äôll have to use that one later today lol
