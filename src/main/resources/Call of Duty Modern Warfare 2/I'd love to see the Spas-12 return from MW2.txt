[[I'd love to see the Spas-12 return from MW2]]





A SPAS-12 that could switch between pump action and semiauto on the fly would be both amazing and quite unique ngl, most games (COD included) usually have the SPAS-12 being either one or the other.

Now, if that's hard to balance, maybe your choice of ammo could dictate the mode the SPAS-12 would work it? For example, stuff like buckshot and slugs could easily be semiauto while stuff like Dragon's Breath (which are weak enough to not cycle well in semiauto shotguns) could be pump action only instead.

Either way, I want to see an SPAS-12 in MW2.

        Why would the rate of fire dictate range?
            It wouldn't, but you gotta make pump-action worth something over semi-auto.
                How about ..ehmmm accuracy
        Not to be that guy, but the pump action/ semi auto is actually more related to whatever ammo you’re putting in the gun. Rounds that generate lower pressure have to be used with pump action to get the gun to cycle correctly. You could use it to balance things like dragons breath though so it could still be like your idea.
    I would like more pump action shotguns in mw2, mw2019 had so little, like only 2 were pump action shotguns
    God damn that sounds like it could be broken as fuck.

I can’t imagine the toxic MP.

No one would use any other weapons lol.

Because if you can’t beat um, join um!
        You realize the CW Spas-12 was semi auto, right?
            Yes but shotguns are never balanced on IW CoDs
                Mw19 shotguns were really well balanced (pre nerf 725 not included obviously) idk what you're talking about
The question is, pump or semi? Honestly I kinda like the tradition that 3arc = semi and IW = pump, just like the FAMAS is burst in IW and auto in 3arc
    Hopefully with the gunsmith both
Lot of fun playing with this beauty on OG MW2. I am the MASTER OF SPAS12
even better - the SPAS-15!
I got it. You want every weapons out there.
Even if it does return it wont have its real name..
    Who cares
    I mean, plenty of guns in MW had their real names, even dlc ones.
Give me akimbo model 18s and UMP

        How about akimbo ac-130 gunships?
            You gonna make me act up papi
Bro I loved the SPAS on MW2 so much I literally made an account with SPAS in the name and only ever used the SPAS.

SPAS
Spas-12 is alright but we'd be blessed to see the TAC-12 make a comeback as well.
They should put every weapon with even a hint of nostalgia in the game!
I know they already confirmed working folding stocks, so I don’t see why they wouldn’t.

Will probably come in a later season for a nostalgia grab and post release hype.
