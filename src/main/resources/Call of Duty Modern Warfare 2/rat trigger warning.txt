I like putting an rpg round right next to them
    Works every time
        Weird cause the never works for me
            Well fifty percent of the time it works every time then
    I just shoot their stupid feet.
        symtex sticks to the shield too its funny.
            Drill charge is much more fun, they think they are free, then they hear the drilling start
                As someone who just leveled my knife with the riot shield, this is it. I always think I'm clear then the whirring sound of death gets me.
                    And you can’t escape the incoming death lmao. I’d like to try getting stuck on HC then running into the enemy team
                        Back when MW2 originally released my buddies and i had some dirty dirty tactics with this and tubes. Need a few kills quick at the end of the match? Wait till the other team is grouped up, get your riot shield class ready with flack jacket and last stand. Run at the opposing team and have your buddy stick a simtex to your back, grenades and tubes no longer 1 shot you and all of a sudden you just detonate in the middle. But wait theres more! If you have last stand you drop a grenade at your feet and anyone left that runs up gets the second kaboom.
                            Lol
                            That is the most evil non Hitler thing I've heard in awhile.
                            Sadist.
                            This is so well thought out, I love it. If you killed me like this I'd honestly laugh.
                            Martyrdom dropped the nade. Last stand downs you with a pistol. Man never touched a cod in his life.
                                Wow he mixed up the name of a perk from 13 years ago, you sure did show him lmfao
                                    Back in the day you could throw a grenade in last stand if you were holding it whan you went down.[this wiki is a good source to back me up](https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Last_Stand#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20if%20a%20player,double%2Dtapping%20the%20action%20button.)
                It's like a slow middle finger to riot shielders. Rubbing it in their faces in a way lmao
                Drill charges never work for me. If they are smart enough to sprint while it's deploying, you won't even get a hit marker on them.
            I just had a round where I stuck the one enemy riot shielder at least a dozen times. There are illegal drugs that don’t feel as good as that.
            A lot of the time people who stick me with a Semtex don't realize when I run at them we both die.
            i recently got platinum for the riot shield.  i now have symtex PTSD. i swear EVERYONE has them equipped when im using the riot shield 😂
        Gotta get them DAWGS
        Not my feet.
        Thank you
        All day, everyday
    yup, I always carry a RPG for such occasions.
        Right? Specifically for shield users. It also has a cool secondary use of blowing up enemy UAV, but that's uses Ammo so yeah.
    Honestly there are a lot of ways to deal with them easily. People just don’t want to switch their class to do it.
        if you have to switch your entire loadout to deal with 1 "wEaPoN" in the entire game then that's a problem. riot shield should not be in the game...at all.
            Wait… do you only use one load out slot? Think you are just butt hurt then. Riot shields are easy to counter. You can literally switch out whatever tactical you have for a stun and kill them easily.
    I use mollys.
        This isn't an NA meeting.
            Molitov cocktail beats shield, Have you not played rock paper scissors molitov shield?
    Facts. I love when they think they’re safe sitting in a corner. And I just shoot the RPG at the wall right behind them. Then I look at the scoreboard and see then watching the killcam the whole way lol
    Or jumping around with a knife until you’ve confused them and stab them in the face. Lol. Or both one after the other to make them quit.
Gonna be honest, I LOVE finding a shield maiden in a game. Nothing more satisfying than them confidently crouch walking towards me, then sticking a thermite in their stupid face.
Then spending the rest of the match hunting them down to do it again, and again.

Edit: I really don't care about k/d or wins, or whatever. I just play to have fun. I was sincere about loving to find them🤷‍♂️ It's like a mini game within the match haha
    Unless you run into a fully dedicated shield warrior who throwing knifes you the second you pause shooting, pull a grenade, reload, turn away, or even hesitate
        Not just throwing knives.

            Sweet Jesus, that drill charge got him good
                I’ve gotten so toxic with the drill charge, almost every time I throw it I stick someone in the head and their death comms are always so satisfying
                    The drill charge is basically a troll device at this point. Teammate hogging the tank at spawn? Drill charge.
                        You’re not wrong, I was playing DMZ and went against a couple of kids camping my teammates body so what did I use to flush them out? You guessed it, drill charges
                    Drill charges are one taps if it hits a person directly as the drill will be what kills not the charge that gets implanted in them but that charge would most definitely ensure they're not getting back up.
                        Realistically the charge won't even touch them, it'll blow up everything behind them once the drill finishes boring a perfect hole through their mangled body
                    The coms when I get back into tank after a teammate try’s to kick me out with a drill charge is even more satisfying lol
                But it left him open to death by pistol.


EDIT: but that was kinda cool to see a fountain of blood.
                    I agree it's beautiful. I have never seen that before and i use drill charges for that as well
                        It's likely cuz I drop my shield to pull out a pistol.  So instead of the drill charge burrowing into my shield, it's burrowing into my chest instead.  Lol.
                            True. But i am also already looking for a next target so i can't really enjoy the death animation.
                Brings back the Turok 2 memories.
                    I’m not the only one that remembers the cerebral bore gun?

I miss the dead body rag dolls too.  Spent so much time just blowing up dead bodies
                        It’s honestly one of the greatest fps guns of all time. 10 year old me was blown away by all of that pixilated monster gore.
                    I miss the cerebral bore!
            Had one of these for the final kill and everyone geeked
            Just gotta make sure you hit the operator and not the shield. 

Last night I was running drill charges and had a match with 3 people on the other team using riot shields. Normally, a thermite stuck to a shield would kill that operator. But for some reason last night, every drill charge I stuck to the shield expelled the explosion behind the operator leaving them alive and able to beat me down.

Drill charges should absolutely chunk the user behind a shield but for some reason don't unless you stick it to the user themself.
                I ran into a shield guy last night and stuck his shield with a drill charge. He switched to his secondary and killed me. He didn't die. When he switched weapons and the shield went to his back the drill charge fell off so I had to switch to thermite for the remainder of the game.
                The patch raised the amount of successful sticks for drill charges I think.  And I'm the shield guy in that video.  But as you can see, I was still able to get the kill even if the drill charge takes me out.


I'd be in a severely weakened state.  So followup shots are a must.  And keeping a large spread between teammates as wolves usually do when hunting helps expose vulnerable angles on the shield.
        Is it just me or does thermite need a faster throw speed? Drill Charges are thrown faster, and they have to be heavier then a stick with a case of thermite on one end.
            Drill Charges are thrown in this game as if every operator was Aroldis Chapman slinging 105mph heaters, I swear. 

Half the reason I love using the drill charge is that it's so easy to aim because it is SCHMOOVIN' once you release it and the animation to throw is quick too.
                You think so? I find the throwing animation slow enough to get me killed fairly often. Once it's out of your hands though that baby is flying XD
                    I've been COD timing'd by the drill charge more than anything else. I swear the moment I crack it the enemies get a big "peek now!!!" notification
                        Same honestly
                That's one thing I noticed, you can absolutely chuck a drill charge like crazy.
                    *y e e t*
                        Quite literally
                You can even stick it to VTOL from ground level...
                Agreed. I feel like the drill charge replaced the termite with the SCHMOOVIN' velocity. I just die trying to throw thermite most times now as the windup takes ages.
            you have a perk for throwing faster
        Then they got skill
            I jump away as soon as the throwing animation starts. I can usually dodge even fast hands this way. Love fighting against shield hunters.
        I can still respawn and try again until I kill them. It's almost more satisfying.
            You mean actually playing the game is FUN and that the shields give you a challenge to overcome in a rock paper scissors way?!
                No, this game is only fun if everyone only uses MP5s
                Exactly. Played a match where like 4/6 opponents were using shields and I thought it was funny (and fun) as shit.
                I actually love the shield guys in DMZ, it at least requires some coordination with your team mates. Like someone grabs his attention and the other guys flank him.
                    Dmz are worse than humans bc they reach around shield with sniper accuracy machine pistols
                        Yea but they are the only challenging NPC enemy. Even helicopters are a joke. You either kill them all before it lands or drop one grenade just before it lands and you are golden.
                            Nobody is complaining about NPC's🤦‍♂️
                The high I get seeing 3 people scramble to kill me and then run after I kill 2 with throwing knives is priceless.
        That’s also me, get more throwing knife kills than shield kills.
            When I was doing gold shield I throwing knifed anyone who wasn’t cooperating
                is there tricks to aiming? i always seem to just throw em at the wall behind em.
                Hehehehe! Ikr! I got it poly, imagine how people hates me.
        Lmao yea I was about to say maybe in a bot lobby. With sbmm, all the riot shielders I get are ultra sweats.
        Hey look, it’s me
            Bro fist for the "dedicated shield warriors" lol 

You run tear gas or flash bang as your tac?
        Shield, quick hands, flash bang, throwing knife, scavenger perk for extra knives. Rinse and repeat. 

Had almost identical setup in the original MW2, could get an AC130 no sweat.

Only downside is MW2 22 is scavenger dosnt replen flash/stun unlike in OG MW2.
        I'll be honest, I love TheseKnivesOnly and the content he makes. His entire channel idea is getting max level and playing CoD by getting only melee kills. So he runs riot shield, melee weapon, and throwing knife. It's enjoyable, and obviously it takes some skill to do what he does, BUT

whenever someone talks shit to him ingame about using the riot shield, he's like, "Haha, they're so mad, bro. Come on, I'm just using a riot shield and a knife."

I'm just like, how tone deaf can you be? You should know that by running a shield and being able to throw a knife in .5 seconds while still holding the shield, that you're the one with the advantage now. And he's all like, "Man, he got me with a termite. I hate that." And you're just like, BRUH, that's the only way he can get you effectively and consistently. You get close enough to melee him, and he's dead.
        I sprint and attempt to jump over them while shooting down with a shotgun. Works every time
            you shouldnt be downvoted, jumping a bit to the side past them and shooting them from up above works really well, also with other guns than shotguns. for me at least, and i am not a very good player
                I got the idea from this sub so I figured it was common knowledge. I’m also not very good at the game. 

Dammit. I was saving my karma to buy a bundle too.
    He’s not talking about people who actually use the riot shield
        Yea wtf are people upvoting this and downvoting you for? All these comments are talking about people who use primary riot shield which isn’t the purpose of the post
            I swear 90% of the people on the internet are functional illiterate
                It's hilarious seeing basically the entire comment section being like "Ummmm, excuuuuse me, you can counter them by throwing semtex at them". Like yeah, that wasn't the complaint you idiot, it's about the people roleplaying as turtles to make themselves invulnerable from behind unless you aim at their legs where the damage multiplier is shit for most guns and makes them take more shots to kill. Honestly I blame the shit tier balancing for the perks.  Battle hardened does basically nothing against flash grenades, double time is a meme unless you're trying to knife people with how tactical sprint makes you sound like a rhino running, strong arm is too niche, scavenger is useless if you're running meta like everyone else is, tracker is also a joke given how loud your footsteps are, and extra tactical is just used so that you can farm weapon xp with decoy grenades. The only perks worth a damn are bomb squad and overkill.
    I’ve found in close quarters that you can often run a tight circle around them and get a takedown off, I’ve done this like 3 times and it’s always awesome
    Yah honestly riot shields are really easy to counter in this game.  Thermite, Semtex, drill charge, Molotov, hell even a cooked frag will do the trick.
        How do you always have a lethal when you run into them?  Half the time I run into them I have to switch to rpg quick because I'm out of drill charges.  Does scavenger resupply lethals?
            Once I know there is a riot shield in play I save my drill charges for him.
                If they have bomb squad they can tank the drill charges

Edit: not anymore I’m told
                    Not anymore. Patchnotes says they are 100% to die if they got stuck by a drill no matter what.
                        [deleted]
                            My highest kills in this game are with the shield you are right it’s not fully patched, sometimes drill charges kill me sometimes they don’t
                        I hit a shielder like 3 times in a game with a drill charge yesterday and they didn't die.
                    They just patched this
                        Last night I swear I stuck a shield guy with a drill charge and he survived.  I was questioning whether Bomb Squad would save them or not.  Not sure they patched this completely
                    Threw a drill charge today at one, drilled through the shield, exploded, and did zero damage. However it did lower their teammates health who charged in with riot shield #2 to get melee’d. Should have been a double kill but neither dies off the explosion unfortunately
                        Yeah I’m just gonna keep rocking semtex, it’s a guaranteed kill if you stick it on the shield. The reason drill doesn’t kill is because it spits the nade behind them and if they’re coming forward they’re far enough away from it. When you stick a person with it the drilling is what kills them lmao.
                            Yea i immediately switched back to semtex after it myself lol
            Using resupply and/or by making sure I have at least one left incase of the riot shield. I'll regularly throw all my lethals though if I have teammates, especially the friends I'm playing with nearby.
                And when you run into 2 or 3 or 4 or...
                    Easy, you can leave the game at any time
                        "but my win/loss ratio :("
            Resupply perk is a god send.
            Scavenger does not recharge lethals but Resupply does recharge them every 25 seconds and lets you carry 2, once Resupply activates. Resupply is in the 3rd perk slot, if you are making a custom perk set.
        Ya, if you die just as much as they do so you always have a lethal available for when you both respawn lol.

What a strategy.
    THIS. 

I’m always like “Thank you for giving me the opportunity to hit you with a Molotov Cocktail and watching you burn.”
    You called them shield maiden. 😂
    drill charge ftw
    I see that we share the same  brain
    We're just trying to get camos man calm down.
    Same I wish it was the same for drill charge it's just slow
    Literally me when i died 25 times in a shoothouse game, me being the shield maiden lol
    I like running frags, and don’t care about my k/d, so whenever I see one of these people I pull out a frag, hold it and walk towards them. Works most of the time and I’ve even gotten some friendly tbag dances out of it.
    I love it both ways.
Especially fun is being a shield user coming across another sheild user and seeing who cracks first.
    You were annoying when I was grinding that thing to platinum lol
    I love using the shield myself because by simply existing you tilt people off the face of the earth. Its pretty fucking funny. Then we got folks like you who shrug it off, swap in a thermite, and never have an issue again. Which makes the former group even fucking funnier.
    I love watching them freak out and run around on fire until they die
    I came here to say exactly this…
All they have to do is make Overkill and Riot shield incompatible. I don't blame shielders trying to level pistols or launchers.
    No, all they have to do is make a more compelling to use other perks. In older CODs there were better options in the same perk category than using overkill.

This perk systems just sucks. There are 8 base perks, so statistically 1/4 players are probably using overkill. Probably 1/3 since I don't see a reason why you'd use Strong Arm and Extra Tactical.
        Double time, tracker and bomb squad are very good perks
            Strong arm is awesome.

(I have bad aim)
                I love strong arm for lobbing C4’s haha
            Those are the 3 perks I mostly use. I only use Overkill on my Ground War sniper class, and Battle Hardened on my objective game mode class.
        I like strong arm because I'm not great and haven't played enough to properly predict where a throwable will go based on where my reticle is. So the throwing arc is very useful to me. But yeah as I become accustomed to the aiming angle required I imagine this opinion will wane
            [deleted]
                Hey that's solid advice. Don't wanna calibrate my muscle memory to a setting that I will change. If only I could separate the arc from the throwing distance, but I guess I'll learn to do without either.

Didn't know that about Semtex, I guess relying on the arc has meant I haven't noticed that I have to increase the throwing angle? Cheers either way m8
        Woah now, don't bring my boy extra tac into this.  
  
Smg class, two flash nades.  
  
Bliss.  
  
*also nostalgic to the fact that you had two tacticals by default in the OG MW2*
    The only reason anyone should be using the shield is for camos imo
        Yeah. Only reason I use it. Otherwise it’s just frustrating to go up against. But when grinding camos especially 3 kills without dieing the shield has been a massive help
        I enjoyed using it just to piss off try hards; I’d always try and find the best player on the enemy team and annoy the fuck out of them
I think a way they could fix this is either make riot shields have a severe speed penalty even when unequipped, or have the riot shield be collapsible so when it's on a player's back, it's a lot smaller.
    Make it so riot shields cant be used with Overkill. I have no problem with pistol or knife users who have a turtle shell
        The worst part is people that run a riot shield secondary while grinding weapon camos or just playing. You shouldn't be able to have perfect protection from behind (and blocking multi kills) with only the penalty of just one perk
            The problem for me is the perk system, overkill has to be one of the first perk because of how they work but most of those perk are not really good compared to some of the second / third perk so having overkill doesn’t really make you trade off something else that is actually good. Like… even without shield I run overkill on most of my class because it’s probably the best perk in this category.

And I guess the shield on your back should at least let people shoot you in the head
                They should just exclude the riot shield from being used with Overkill. Or make Overkill block the ultimate perk or something to add a downside
                    OK wouldn't work as ultimate as then what would your loadout be until you unlock it seeing as its not a base perk?

That's the issue 1) with OK being moved in *any* other slot and 2) an issue with the perk package in general
                        No I’m saying that if you use Overkill, you are sacrificing your Ultimate perk. So for example, you’d have Scavenger, Overkill, and Fast Hands, but you’d never be able to select an ultimate perk.

It could also take up both base perk slots, but honestly it’s so OP that it should block the ultimate slot.

COD 4 did this sort of. If you had a noob tube on your gun, you couldn’t get your first perk. 

I’m also of the opinion that Riot Shields don’t belong in call of duty, so maybe my opinion isn’t the best on this topic.
                    In objective game mode the shield can be actually useful especially with communication while running overkill to have another gun when not on the objective, I use it sometime in HQ/HP with another gun, I switch to the shield in situation where I need it and I actually don’t even use it for the back protection.

It would be dumb to remove this option from the game imo.

In old cod the shield protected your back and nobody was complaining tbh, it was fine and it’s still fine imo. My only problem is that you don’t have any tradeoff on overkill, it’s OP as fuck even if you play something like 2 smgs.
                        I’ve been complaining ever since they allowed you to run a riot shield with Overkill. Riot shields should just be removed from the game.
                            I think they just shouldn't be added to the game in the first place.
        Thank you. As a player who loves pistols this is like only way we can make them viable.
            I disagree, I got gold on X12s and Basilisk without a shield on my back and didn’t have a bad time at all. When we’re talking about getting shot in the back it doesn’t really matter what gun you’re using
                Fair
                    Reasonable, respecting, level-headed discussion? In MY CoD subreddit? Unacceptable! I demand a witless slinging of insults at once!
                        Alright, fine.

Fuck you, cheese-monger.
                Same for me. I’m currently working on my deagle to get gold. Then I’ll go back to the G18/X13 Auto’s
                While I agree, when grinding my secondaries I don’t touch my primary so equipping the riot shield seems to be the most logical since I get protection/I’m not using that slot anyway. They should just give shields health so their effectiveness drops as they’re shot.
            Pistols are viable but only in certain situations. There are times where I’ve beaten an SMG and an assault rifle with my X12. It’s a challenge for sure and I got lucky, but they are usable

Most of my kills are with them not facing me though lol
            The P890, X12 with stock, and the Basilisk are all fantastic. If you need a shield on your back thats on you.
                X13 is fantastic
            Ive golded three pistols without touching the shield before tier 1 even dropped. Pistols are insanely viable and if you're running the the Deagle or the Revolver you're basically running a primary with how effective they can at one taps.
            Nah dont use a riot shield
        This would be fine if akimbo pistols were not completely busted.
            Akimbo pistols actually suck.... The damage is nerfed on both of the pistols when akimbo
                That may be the case but they are most certainly not bad
                The basilisk with snakeshot and the P890 aren't bad. Akimbo deagles seem like they're intentionally made useless
            Akimbo pistols are pretty bad, and certainly not busted. Like the X13's hipfire cone is so enormous you cant kill anyone at unless youre at point blank distance. X12 akimbo was the only one i had any real success with. Deagle is awful akimbo
                Akimbo deagle is only practical if you land both shots, it's the worst pistol to run akimbo aside from the basilisk without snakeshot. All the other pistols are at least minimally viable for close to close-medium engagements. Some of my best games have been running pistols both with and without akimbo
            They could have akimbo disabled if using a shield.
    yeah like the deployable cover or something thats actually a good fucking idea
        Or it could be a field upgrade with a slow recharge rate and everything. I really think it should have some durability stat so it can be destroyed too.
            I believe in mw3 survival the shield could be broken
    Agree with the speed penalty, I have found various mf's that use riot shield in the back and the knife as main, those fckrs run faster than Usain Bolt
        The tradeoff is range, they literally don't have a primary gun
        As one of these people, just shoot me.
    Or make it unable to be equipped with overkill at least
    Brilliant
    I’m fine with the riot shield block shots from the front, there is a thermite, sticky nade, and breach charge to count it. However, blocking shots to the back is absolutely ridiculous and needs to be scrapped.

Your collapsible idea is a legit solution to this now 3-4 year problem.
    A collapsing riot shield would fit this game’s aesthetic too
Are people just reading this and deciding it says something else? This has nothing to do with sticking riot shielders with a semtex it has nothing to do with riot shielders, it's aimed at the people who use an MP5 and have full back protection never using the shield once.

Everyone talking about riot shielders aren't that bad and what you do to deal with then, you're just completely missing the point
    Not really, the post is just wrong. It doesn't provide full back and head coverage and it can be easily countered from any angle. Complaining about it is pointless, learn how to exploit it's weaknesses
        So you basically just said skill issue without saying skill issue. It’s a crutch 100%. if they have their back to you, all u can see is the bottom of their legs. Which shooting does significantly less damage than torso/head. It’s a legitimate criticism
    It's because everyone replying here are cheesing the shit out of shields and immediately got triggered from the post, rather than taking the time to read it
just run a drill charge
    It seems to be buggy with the drill charge. There have been times I've stuck someone with a shield with the drill charge, and hear the detonation only to turn and see them still alive somehow.
        Before the patch, I think you had to stick it on the upper part for it to actually kill the guy.

However, with the new patch, it is supposed to 100% kill as long as you stick it on the actual shield
            I think I had at least 1 not kill after the patch, because it was in Tier 1. I aimed it directly at the shield and threw it, and he didn't side step or anything, and I turned to sprint around a corner, so it is possible it may not have stuck, since I've 'missed' shots with enemies centered in my crosshairs, but it *should* have stuck the dude and killed them, but they did not die.
                It's still buggy, it's happening many times where I've thrown the drill chargers directly on riot shield people in Tier1 with no kill.
                    Yeah I’ve thrown them, gotten the “STUCK” pop up, and no kill 🤷🏻‍♂️
                Had this exact experience and I was trying out the shield for the for the first time, when I got stuck with the drill charge I switched to my pistol and barely survived the blast. But I did survive and it was tier 1

Also it was on the hydroelectric map, just in case it was actually me and you that had the interaction
                    Nah, mine was Farm 18 in this specific instance, but weird that you can survive it in Tier 1
            Definitely not working still.
            I’ve definitely stuck a shield and didn’t get the kill since said update. Not saying every single time, but I think there’s still some bugs.
            I can assure you it doesn’t 

Stuck 3 separate riot shields last night with drill charge and it never killed the user
        Because the drill charge shoots out a grenade on the other side rather than just detonating from the surface it appeared on, you can kind of outrun the grenade it shoots out if you sprint straight ahead
            This is the right reason. If they run, the grenade is behind them. If they stand still or crouch walk it will kill them. The reason people get hit markers is the shield maiden is smart enough to run forward.
        Sometimes the drill charge will bug out and shoot itself out under the ground texture, that's why it doesnt kill
    Thermite grenade works better since it sticks
        Drill charge sticks too.

But I agree that thermite is better. For whatever reason I'm able to actually land the sticks more consistently.  I think the thermite may move a bit quicker.
            It does, I always think you can throw it further than the drill charge as well.
    and then what do you do once you use it
    Semtex is more reliable
    Yea, I should have to toss a lethal and stick someone to kill them from behind. lmao.
    Drill charge literally works 1 in 10 tries. Somehow the explosive goes completely thru them and only hit marks them.
    Or a thermite, or a Semtex, or Molotov. They’re really not that hard to deal with.
    I have stuck drill charges to about 10 shield with zero effect, same for AI riot shields.
Maybe make them damage-able so if all else fails you can just pump rounds into them until they're defenseless. I honestly am not as bothered by riot shields as a lot of people but i also could definitely live without them
    Armor piercing rounds should beat them, maybe with a few nerfs to the round to not make it OP
        Ap rounds should do 40-70% ish damage when fired at the shields.
            Couldn't get a kill last time I tried but I'll give it another go.
                It was a suggestion rather than a fact I think.
            If you do that you might as well remove shields from the game. Everyone in the lobby would switch to AP the second they see your shield.
        I had assumed AP rounds worked. Im stunned that they dont
            Apparently I'm wrong but I haven't had success yet.
    I just want an end to the turtle meta. Just make people slow as fuck with the riot shield on their back.
        Yeah there’s two real solutions here. Make it cover less of the back or make people slower. Either one would significantly bump down the usage.
    That’s it more realism. I think armor piercing rounds should eat through them personally since you know that is how it would work.
I'm sure he means "scrapped", everyone.
    Oh ok, and here I was thinking the “sc” was the typo
I don’t mind Riot shields. I find it a fun change of pace when they show up. They force me to get creative with my stun grenades and Semtex. I’ve gotten a ton of kills even with cooked grenades against riot shields
    The point of this post is saying they shouldn’t provide protection when on your back (not equipped).
        It's insane how most of the comments are just ignoring the post
            Classic Reddit. Seems to be even worse in CoD subs, where in comments you can usually find in-topic replies with approximate ratio of 1:50 😊
                Because most posters are literally children and teenagers
                    Yeah, it never ceases to baffle me how young the 18 year old people sound nowadays

                They're bragging about how amazing they are for throwing a grenade at it. Prime MLG players here
        Oof That's like the sole reason I use them lol cause I like to run pistols and the protection on the back helps with the super slow pistol ttk
            With overkill tho it's like having insane protection at no cost. Especially if you run a high capacity mag.
    [deleted]
        If you see a shield on their back, aim at ankles. Shield on back only ruins it if you spray or have an aim bot forcing you to shoot higher up.
            Just because they are still killable doesnt mean they should have a protection like that for basically free. Most primary perks in this game arent really that good so running Overkill instead of something else is not a penalty at all. So there is basically no reason to not use a shield on your back, no matter what kind of playstyle you want to have or what gun you want to use.
            If they’re running their legs are going in and out behind the shield man.
                If you can't hit moving target let em go.
            Alright, I’ll use my sniper and try to hit an ankle twice (because it would likely be a hit marker first)…. Or they could just stop adding this crutch mechanic in the game
                Oh no you might have to put effort beyond point and click.
                    Lol we’re talking about a weapon that literally requires zero effort to benefit from. What a dumb point to try to make. There’s no legitimate argument for why riot shields should work on your back the way they do but all of the losers who can’t handle getting shot in the back keep defending it. If you’re getting shot in the back enough that you *need* a riot shield to protect you, you’re not moving around the map in a smart way
                        And if you can't kill someone from behind with a two shot gun then you also have issues. Worst case you get an assist and still block their play.


Shields come at a cost. They're real easy to shot around and there's more lethal than ever that deal with them. People are just complaining because it isn't THEIR play style and want it easier.
                            >	Shields come at a cost.

None of your points are “costs” unique to riot shields. You know who’s easier to shoot than someone with a shield? Someone without one. You know who else deals with lethals? Everyone. Riot shields are a crutch for bad players, nothing else to it.
                                They are useful for low skill, ie the majority of players. They're also harder to use effectively other than passively.


There's an argument for all weapons being low skill if you don't use them. OHK especially without slow ADS feels OP, holding the trigger to spray rather than aim feels OP. Shooting explosives at the floor near people for kills feels OP. Until you use it and try to utilise it, it all feels OP.
        It’s easy as shit killing a player from behind with a riot shield, not only does the shield move but there legs are always open to get blasted. Just aim down
            [removed]
    I’ve played that way for the last 20 hours and I’ve got to say it’s broken as hell but if the speed is nerfed the play style is no longer viable. 

I’m an average player and I top out around 18-22 kills with a knife and riot shield. I can totally dominate objective game modes but it’s useless in TDM and SND and those game modes
        > if the speed is nerfed the play style is no longer viable.


Yeah, let's take all variety out of the game. Don't use a semtex, termite, stun, flash, claymore, prox mine, rpg or movement to counter it.
        [deleted]
            Aye do you man, I hope I never come across you in the game
    Shields are so easy to counter idk why people are so whiny about it. Only thing I would agree with is making Arms and/or Head more exposed while the shield is on the back.

Overall the Shield is pretty easy to counter for the most part, idk why people keep complaining.
        [removed]
            I can't just slide cancel and bunny hop my way to victory?! Man this game sucks. They need to bring back exploits and get rid of the critical thinking of how to address an enemy that's only protected from the front while crouching. /s
                Considering this game is just get on and shoot a gun casually I don't see why anyone would want to sit and change a class just to counter one specific player in that game... Also this is about back protection not using the actual riot shield...
                    Semtex, molotov, drill charge, c4, claymore, prox mine, rpg, shoot the legs, run away and use moment tactics, stun or flash grenade and shoot their sides. Any of that is viable and I'm sure if you're creative you can come up with more ways to kill a shield guy. Also from behind you can shoot them in the legs/ass. The shield sits at an angle, not straight up and down. I think people are just salty because there's something they can't just pew pew with an SMG and slide cancel/stim their way to victory. It's not hard to counter, at all. People just like to complain, I guess.
ill take it off my back when they fix spawns
Like 90% of the comments didn't even read the text properly. This is talking about people who run overkill just to have a riot shield (and complete protection) on their back, while running a normal gun. It basically makes overkill a perk that says "completely protect your backside from all gunfire, no drawbacks". This has nothing to do with people who use the riot shield as their main weapon.
Larger calibers should be able to punch thro riot shields.
    Also Snipers should be super heavy and should be impossible to be used up close
        But my point blank camo challenges :(
        Yes, this. Having half the field run and gunning with snipers is annoying as hell.
Shields should collapse/expand. When on the back of a player the top/bottom should slide in to the center, leaving the head and lower torso exposed.
It sucks especially since there’s very little reason to not run Overkill now.
Believe me trying to level pistol with the shield on your back makes life just a bit easier, I also have sympathy for those leveling it for completion challenges
    The pistols are honestly amazing in this game though
    The Problem is with people using overkill and putting a shield on their back. There's nothing wrong with players using shield and secondaries.
It crazy how the "counters" to the shield are really only viable when someone is actually using as a primary
    Yeah because when they're not, you shoot their feet and they die. No equipment necessary.
Personally I feel shaped charges like the RPG should go through riot shields, 50 BMG & if you using armor piercing ammo it should go through it as well just to add more usability to the ammo type.
 Folded up on your back until equipped would fix this. Kinda like deployable cover
Here we go…. Feel free to halo jump one shot with a sniper rifle but nah let’s get rid of the riot shield which you can counter with most tactical equipment. I get killed tons while using the riot shield. Not that hard to play against dude stahhhp
    i’m just confused about the fact that it’s been full protection in every COD… right? am i imagining things? why is it an issue now?
        I think the big issue is the amount of people that are running them on their back now after the Vanguard glitch that made it really hard to kill them from behind
        Because you don’t have to make a sacrifice to run overkill in this game unlike in past games you can run overkill and scav thanks to the perk system where as before you’d have to choose scav or overkill, and who’s going to take overkill over a more beneficial perk
            Overkill is usually in the same perk slot as Ghost too.
            This, you basically don’t trade anything good to be able to play with overkill, people should complain more about the current perk system breaking the balance of the game instead.
        It’s always been an issue
        it's only been part of the game for like thirteen years, you gotta excuse people for wanting these new-fangled mechanics out of the game.
        People have hated it since the original MW2. Where on Earth have you been?
        They get mad because of the kamikaze reverse boosting/knife camo challenge players.
        I’m pretty sure in MW3 the glass was breakable with enough rounds, so you could only get headshot

Also this discussion has been going on since the start of 2019 at least lol, I’d be shocked if they changed it now
        This is exactly right
    Whole comment section under this post „fear the walking shield“ xD
    This isn’t about riot shields people are equipping.. it’s about riot shields as a secondary on your back.
    Well the counter to jumpshotting is good aim, which you can't exactly use up.

Equipment on the other hand, might not be around for every gunfight if you've already used it.
        If they one tap you with a cracked out marksmen build, good luck practicing good aim lmao.
    name one other build in the game that can only be countered by a one-use-per-life piece of equipment
        Damn munitions box and restock are crazy you should run them. Imagine having to think when you turn on the game 🤯

H-how can I run those when all my classes need fast hands and dead silence no matter what's happening in the lobby 😡
            Yeah lemme be forced to run that garbage just to hopefully kill a shield user. Thats called centralizing.
            Oh no! I had to use my equipment on an enemy! You know, the thing it was literally made for!
Y’all gotta learn to start shooting them feet’s lol.
    I’ve noticed that while playing riot/knife. Last CoD game I reverently played was WWII, you basically had to crouch with the shield the whole time or you’d get shredded. But I’ve found myself just walking at people with impunity in this game because they just don’t shoot my feet.
a drill charge usually solves this
It’s a crutch on the back, plain and simple.  People don’t have map awareness, so they slap a shield on their back.  They aren’t the same as shield mains and camo grinders, they have a place in the game.
Not only that, but their movement speed should be nerfed into oblivion. Love getting blasted by a riot shield user running akimbo snakeshit while bunny hopping like a fucking madman the entire match
they could rest the riot shields horizontally instead of vertically (while the player is using their primary weapon), that way only the butt and lower back is protected
If I get killed a couple times against them, I usually switch over to stuns and thermite or drill charge with my own shield. Makes for some funny gameplay. 

Shields don’t bother me as much as they did in Vanguard where everyone ran one all the time.
I personally love the riot shield and have it plat. But I never use it with overkill to protect my back. Just need my trusty RPG and throwing knife
    Least based riot shield enjoyer
    Best snd build
    Exactly, the only time I'm running it on my back is if I'm using my knife or maybe running pistols but in those cases I'm not using a primary
    Honestly most of the time I run RS on my back I just get killed from the front anyhow.
Just get some Semtex or Thermite grenades
Breaching charges work wonders against riot shields.
ap rounds should go through riot shields. if not the whole shield, then the glass.
Here we go

It's the lean, green, ninja team

On the scene, cool teens doin' ninja things

So extreme, out the sewer, like laser beams

Get rocked with the Shell-shocked Pizza Kings
I would be totally ok removing from the game completely. It's just a gimmick and doesn't add anything to make gameplay interesting
throwback to when people who ran riot shields would just use them to set up cover in bo2 and throw the most obscene shit on the front with an emblem

&#x200B;

i want those riot shields back man, didn't seem as frustrating to play against
    The deployable shield was flimsy but I enjoyed using it for cover, I liked how ghosts had attachments for the shields I always wanted the option to use a Pistol/SMG with it off to the side like AI & not mounted in the shield like BO4.
Scrapped*
Y’all complain too much

L
Only way to combat skilled quickscopers. Functioning as intended.
Once they scrap the diving & bunny hopping sure
I mean, it’s literally the one of the points and benefits of the shield so <shrug>

Seems a bit like complaining about scopes on sniper rifles
Skill issue
Bigger problem is the perk system and overkill being a powerful perk in a weak perk slot.
    But how else would it work? You suddenly get overkill half way through the game and your whole class magically changes?
        Totally agree it can't be anywhere else with the current progressive perk system. I mainly mean, it's just another reason why this new perk system is trash.
When its on their back it should make them run slow as fuck and not be able to sprint.
Y’all are cringe, they’re not that annoying.
    Only annoying when they block all explosives that aren't tactical. It's a bulletshield, not a concrete wall.
    Right, just gotta use tactical equipment. And people don’t like changing their playstyle for one game, they just wanna run around and not think 1 bit
        Honestly, I fucking hate them. My brain sometimes go full regard when I see them. *However*, I do like that they change the pace of play. It makes the game interesting, because now I have to get out of my comfort zone to take them on. So I guess it'd be better to say I hate getting *outplayed* by them.
    imagine bitching because you can't beat the in-game equivalent of red-light/green-light.
    This sub complains about everything and anything so I'm not surprised

Plus this shit has been in cod for ages hasn't it?
Back coverage? Yes, that's ridiculous...get rid of it.  If my giant-ass PILA doesn't block some bullets, that shield shouldn't either

Front coverage?  No...that defeats the whole point of a riot shield, you're just salty because you got killed.
    Hes talking about the back coverage...
    I use the shield quite often and in multiple loadouts, and I love it's versatility. 

But saying that I've always thought the shield should be carried laterally across his waist. Still provides since cover from a random spray but not to upper chest and head, the two highest damage places. I think using it with overkill just for protection is a trash strategy and needs to die.
Y'all find anything to complain about. The riot shield, ESPECIALLY in warzone is the most underpowered thing in the game. It literally does nothing but block bullets on 1 of 4 sides. It can't be planted on the ground, it doesn't have a flash effect, it's slow, and the swap speed is ass.
    I remember when you could plant them in BO2. You would have to pull out your knife when you did it.
[deleted]
    Man I felt so outplayed when I can't shoot someone in the back simply bc they pressed 2 buttons in a menu
        Reading these comments is unreal. People are actually this dumb and think it is a good feature. No wonder gaming is fucked when the average IQ is below 50.
            Granted its a cod subreddit, but honestly this site used to have more intelligent users. Doubt itll ever get fixed because people that use crutches always get defensive when people call it broken. Because if it’s broken then their epic killstreaks weren’t as skillful as they thought
        What if... There was a way to shoot them from the front while the shield was on their back?
            They're running away after killing my squadmate, I can shoot at their feet but the damage debuff from doing so would just get hitmarkers.  They escape yet again.
    Near-Invincibility is getting outplayed now? So I if goku blows up earth it’s a skill issue?
    Everyone’s out here acting like a riot shield makes you a juggernaut
    It's not "outplaying" if it's just something you choose in the create-a-class menu.

"Outplaying" is something you do mid game with limited time.
        yeah and if you can't outplay the shielder before they kill you you've been outplayed yourself.
            Used my thermite on a flank point and a shield appears.  Oh no, it appears I've been outplayed because the one tool used to kill them was used for more important things.  I don't use lethals and tacticals on shields exclusively you know.  

I also don't like devolving an FPS into a game of rock paper scissors.
The right shield just needs a health value. Just knowing their shield is dwindling as it takes damage, will cause riot shielders to play a bit more aggressive.
    This is not Overwatch...
Semtex, Flash, Stun, or my favorite, thermite. Riot shielders help you git gud at throwing stuff, because they are easy target practice. Thank you for coming to my CODTalk.
    How did this guy get upvoted? The post is about riot shields on people's back, not when they're actually used.
    I hope you like trading kills.

        I-mean push come to shove this isn’t too bad. After all the riot shield user does die too so its a little cathartic even if its just a trade.
I remember there was a cod that had riot shields that once they were shot enough they broke. Why did they scrap that feature
Yes, but also no
No it’s shouldn’t be completely scrapped but it should be adjusted to have a limit. For example, maybe have the root shield slightly collapse while stowed so it only overs the back 

To be fair tho, players have to sacrifice a perk and weapon to have a riot shield on their back so it’s not without drawbacks
Molotov all the way
I just switch to Thermite and stick them right with it and dance on their corpse
Sure it provides protection but I look at it this way; they sacrifice a perk and a secondary ranged weapon for the trade off of back protection. Seems pretty fair to me.
Armor piercing rounds should do damage to them, maybe half but still.
I’m just glad I got it plat before they do change it because that things either way too garbage or way too busted and it only works when it feels like it while the rest of the times it tells you to get back to it in 3-5 business day as it’s gone fishing
AP rounds should pierce it.
This is stupid.... if people want to sacrifice their situational/backup weapon for riot a shield thenlet them. That is the drawback. They arent impervious, as you can shoot their feet or use a lethal, ie grenade, sticky, termite, etc. 

Both parties just need to get good.
I've never felt shields were OP. They are an advantage, and a disadvantage. Learn how to play instead of bitching about something so trivial.
Dunno about American servers, but in Japan it’s not a “proper” game unless there are 5 enemy shield bois. And they usually have a gold or platinum shottie to boot. Bastards don’t even bother to capture objectives. Just lay in the corners like the cockroaches they are.
Yeah it's "ability" not at all actual proparities of the shields. I would say proper guns should do proper damage to the shield(based on real ballistic shields)  and guy who's wearing it.
Being able to put the shield away, throw a knife and put the shield back on in the short amount of time that you can is what I have an issue with. It’s like half of a second.
Molotovs, thermite, Semtex, hell any lethal being used by someone who’s not stupid can take a riot shield. When I go against riot shields, I do what the founding fathers (OG MW games) intended and I bully that little bastard by making his KD roughly equal to my dick length in inches (somewhere between 0.5 and 0.1)
Completely agree. This shit is beyond fucking stupid
You can still kill riot shield users by shooting their feet. Someone seriously got mad at me for this over voicechat….
Running with riot shield on back should be disabled or nerfed.
I feel bad for people who have to play this way. I mean, the item is in the game specifically for people who are so bad at playing, with such poor situational awareness that they have to use it because they cant learn to keep their head on a swivel. I can just imagine the frustration they endure game after game until they finally accept the inevitable fact they are so bad that they must use this item, and mark themselves so everyone can see how bad they actually are. But its so frustrating to play against. The best counter is just a thermite, or semtex, or rpg. I really like when they sit in a corner, and theres no way to get them. Until you throw a sticky, or a mine in front of them and watch them absolutely PANIC. Its the little things that bring me joy.
    It’s my experience that most people use it to goblin run at me and melee me or tuck into a corner and wait for an opportunity to throw a knife at my head lmao
Overkill should disable the riot shield. 

That's coming from a riot shield knifer
Riot shields should be pocketed when not in use
Scraped?
    Scrapped.
Armor piercing ammo should go through shields, the shields should break after a certain amount of damage, and it shouldn't provide protection when on your back. Change my mind.

            It's high tier. Pineapple, bit of chicken, jalapeños. That's a regular for me if I'm having trouble deciding.
        pineapl3pizza ?
You're playing a different game OP, I get consistently beamed in the legs from behind and riot shield helps fuck all
    Same, I’ve been running riot shields on my back and it only makes a difference like 1 out of every 10 kills at best.  People seem to have no problem killing me from behind the vast majority of the time.
    They dont help that much, people are just whiney
Facing a shield user while it’s in front of them I really don’t have a problem with. It’s just when it’s on their back like this post says that can be very frustrating. Needs some kinda buff for that specifically
This is such bullshit

So many dumb things that can get you killed, but me cosplaying a turtle is suddenly an issue?
Make riot shields breakable
The jump button should be completely taken out. Period.
As much as I hate them, I disagree. 

Git gud
    It’s not even about getting good. Just makes sense to give the shield more cons since the glass doesn’t break when it should.
Have you ever heard of the tale of Achilles? Just aim for the heels.
What about this, try to imagine a call of duty you had fun in that didn’t have riot shields. (Wondering op’s age considering I hear most riot shield complaints from the younger player base and it’s not historically an activision/partnered company move )
Have you tried being better?
    Why the hell would I do that?
Are people really asking to nerf the fucking riot shield? Bro, how bad at the game are you?
[deleted]
    Nobody is talking about some poor kid crouch-walking at you, just trying to level his shield. Equipment, for one, is situational. Two, there is no counter to a guy who keeps getting to areas of the map that shouldn’t be possible because he can freely hit cuts, right in front of your teammates, without needing to worry about bullets in a FPS thanks to his unequipped shield. What next? Marksman rifles are fine?
    Can’t wait for everyone to complain snipers are one shot kills
    *once per life
It never ceases to amaze me how dumbfounded people get when you put the tiniest obstacle in the way. 

You have endless options to kill people but you put a slight amount of cover on someone and everyone loses their minds because they can't 1 tap everyone they see 

Then go to reddit and post the 400th quick scope montage saying how broken it is
    Cod players when they encounter a mechanic which isn't "gun shoot."
I personally just think, if the caliber of the gun is high enough (aka almost all snipers) they should penetrate the shield. You can't tell me that if I shoot you with my .50 cal sniper that the shield tanks it. Just no
    [deleted]
        I agree completely. I personally think snipers shouldn't be able to quickscope. They are meant to be hard hitting area denial. Not fast af weapons meant to be used like an ar
Scrapped*
They need to make it so overkill and shields isn’t together
“The ability for trophy systems to block missiles should be scrapped”
They should either make you slow as molasses regardless if it’s equipped or on back, or make it not work with overkill. As of now there is zero downside to being a turtle
This is how you know this subs whining has gotten out of control.

Riot shields have remained basically unchanged in literal decades of CoD. It’s not some huge advantage to have one on your back, you’re behind the guy, you have the drop on him, shoot him in the legs. The TTK is so low it won’t even be hard. 

Plus, is anyone running lethals other than drill charge or thermite? Both will drop a shielder almost instantly.
Of course a large, ballistics shield is going to cover most of your vitals whilst on your back. It’s just more realistic other than anything besides a couple shitties unable to shoot someone’s feet because they lack critical thinking skills.
    If you wanna talk about realism then why don't armor piercing rounds break through? Or even enough regular rounds? Riot shield don't hold forever in real life
What if shields didn't provide full back and head cover because they were just removed from the game?  :O
How about you learn to chuck nearly any tactical equipment (you know,  the hard counters to the shield; of which there are many) and leave my shield alone
    I used my thermite on the last riot shield user what do you suggest I do now
        They are going to suggest you have resupply and munitions box next.  They are basically suggesting you build your entire class around possibly meeting a shield user.
            yeah it’s beyond stupid
1. Most, if not 90% of riot shield users you'll ever find are trying to go for Orion or other camos, they don't use the shield cause oh yeah it's super fun to be slow and not able to hit anyone outside a 1m radius.

2. It's really not that difficult to outplay a riot shield. You can either jump behind them and shoot their exposed back or stick any explosive lethal and they're done.

With that said, they don't need any nerf at all. They're not overpowered at all and if you find yourself dying to a riot shield more times than killing them, it's definitely a skill issue
    Read the post again. It's about people putting the shield on their back, not the players who actually use it as intended.
Easily countered with a Semtex, been that was since riot shields were introduced years ago. I’m not a fan, so I don’t use it, but it’s not a big deal to me.
Need to get rid of them. Worse item in the game.
The one thing I dislike about the shield maidens I've run into is that every one of them seems to get butthurt when people switch to loadouts meant to counter it and start screaming
Why is everyone misreading the post and not realizing they are saying that having it on your back should not protect your head and body from damage.
those turtles are so annoying
Thermite, semtex, drill charge, shoot their feet, jump over them. Just be better and stop crying about it.
Good players can adapt around it
    To be fair though the only time I pick it up aside from my troll class is to get my melee weapons done got knife platinum before work today just need the platinum challenge for shield
Riot shield is not hard to counter. Either a thermite or drill charge. If those fail pull out the old RPG. Either learn to adapt or stop bitching
Just don’t suck.
majority of lobbies aren't running this though
Shoot the feet
    Guys guys stop arguing, u/Jordanthb has cracked the code!  Why is everyone worrying about riot shields when you can just shoot at their feet!! 

Ah I remember my first call of duty game too
What the fuck has happened to this community. Shields were a part of COD basically since the OG MW2 and we always LAUGHED at them. They were never more than just a meme to fuck around with. BO2 had the strongest shield out of all games, with superfast melee and ability to plant them on the ground to use as portable cover, and NOBODY complained about them being OP lol.

If you think shields are broken in MW2 2022 and they need to get scrapped, you're an absolute clown 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
    A lot of people are taking gaming way too serious.
        Just crouch and shoot their exposed ass. Lol.
I bet you they’re the first to complain about snipers/ marksman rifles too
So basically every player in tier 1.
Keep on crying 🤡
Riot shields should never been added to call of duty *change my mind*
    I use the riot shield in every loadout.  I would give it up in a second if every match i was in wasnt full of camping snipers.  Its the best counter to that bullshit.
Riot shields should not be in the game, they are stupid. “Just run a drill charge” How about you don’t tank 600 bullets and a fucking cruise missile with your plastic shield? Not to mention the most toxic players are always the ones with a shield
Why do we even need riot shields in the game? I don’t really understand why they’re considered a staple. In a game where 99% of the gameplay is shooting at each other, a shield feels out of place and sort of breaks the gameplay loop unlike any other weapon. Also they’re always made ridiculously overpowered, I understand stopping bullets and even some equipment, but it should never stop killstreak explosions
I mean some of the biggest Chad's I've seen run riot Shield and knife and pass every one off its great, but the rats using it don't understand how to use it. The shield is allot worse than it was in 2019 and very easy to counter
enough of the stupid riot shield posts… PLEASE!
No, you're just soft. Stop complaining and use your brain. Very easy to counter them.
    Based
mfs want realism then cry when a riot shield works as intended
    Show me a real life riot shield that stops a full mag of high caliber bullets
        Show me a clip where someone is quick scoping everybody with a sniper
            Hence why COD is an arcade shooter. Instead of complaining on reddit go play and get better.
    What Riot Shield blocks 50 Cals while on your back without any weight or downside whatsoever? Or even. 308. Hell, even a mag of 7.62?whilst being made of transparent material?
    Lmao this really. But truth be told, they should have some sort of speed penalty or at least slower sprint if unequipped just my two cents tho
NOOOOOOO!!!!!1!1!1!!1 RIOT SHIELDS SHOULDN’T COVER YOU!1!1!1!1!1!1!1 STOP HAVING FUN!!!! STOP IT!1!1!1!1!1!1!1!.
Just make them to reduce your movement speed like 50% if you ain't carrying a pistol or a knife.
 I can comprehend you using a shield while playing with a pistol or knife, I even so it myself, but being able to do it without cons while using a freaking LMG or AR it's just ridiculous.
"I don't like someone's strategy, therefore it should be removed"

Shit. Take.

There's so many counters, it's silly.

Get. Gud.
    its not about counters, its about sweats running riot shields on their back so they cant get shot from behind ever while they jump shotgun everyone...
Get good ig
There is literally nothing wrong with riot shields
Completely in agreement it's ridiculous
They should be forced into the primary slot and not allowed to use overkill, you should be forced to use a pistol.

Would solve a lot of issues with it straight away.

Also make it so you can't put it on your back and have the character draw the pistol to the side of the shield for hip fire, exposing the player.
Shields have been about the same since 2009. They’re not changing any time soon.
Bro ppl in this thread talking about using shields and countering them when people round around with them as primary weapons are totally missing the point.

How fkn stupid are you bots that this simple thread title confuses you.
Riot shield is op for invasion and ground war because you can cross streets without getting blown up by a sniper across the map
TTK is too fast in this game for old guys like me. I need that back protection
I think nerfing the shield when using it with overkill would be the right move, if someone is playing it active or with pistols its a fair trade. But recently most of the CDL skins are just having it on their back for additional protection which is to much imho
Lmao this sub hates anything that counters running and gunning
This was the meta in vanguard and it sucked balls
    Das Haus and shipment were all just people with shields on their backs. Shields actually didn't block bullets on the back at launch but apparently it was a bug and they patched it. Once it was patched that was all you would see and it was so frustrating. There were times where your shots would even be blocked from the front when it was on their back. I think if you see everyone using one specific piece of equipment then there are some balance issues whether people want to admit it or not. There should be reasons to use different equipment and not just have one overpowered thing that everyone uses. 

I also made this argument with Vanguard, should my gun shoot from my back since they can block shots when the shield isn't even equipped?
If you have thermite you win
a well placed drill charge or thermite kills them
yes, they should be collapsible, only extending when held, kinda like deployable cover.
This right here.
Or atleast make weapon bullet calibers matter against them. Small thinhs like 9mm shouldn't pierce them but 7.62 or fuckin LITERALLY. 50BMG should pass through them like butter
It's funny how mad y'all get at people with shields when it's the easiest thing to counter

Fuck people that only keep them on their backs tho
Just use thermites or drills?
Make Overkill impossible while using Riot shields problem solved
Drill Charge that B
Original MW2 riot shield was the most fun thing in that game, no cap and I lived for the very same salt I see still overflows.
Shoot the legs
If they didn’t then why fucking use them or have them In the game at all, they become useless and never get used.
Just saying I told y'all shields/Overkill were gonna be a problem before launch and I got downvoted to shit
I personally want the riot shield completely removed. It's a trash gear for trash players. Nurfing isn't enough.
I always carry a drill charge or two for those players
How about harden the fuck up.
If there's one thing vangaurd did decent, it was the fact you could shoot the riot shield out someone's hand. Don't know why they didn't keep it.
Crazy that people think this post is about people using a shield like it’s supposed to be used instead of stowed on the back running a sub or ar as a primary
Thermite, every time. I always have a class made up. It's awesome watching them burn.
No we need to make bunny jumping coner and shooting impossible
Thermite works
Nah man I just take their toes.
Unpopular opinion: Riot shielders adds another variable challenge in matches and I enjoy killing them.
I just prone and shoot those toes
Drill, semtex, or even thermite defeats shields all day. I love hunting these guys when I find them. Screw the match, screw the objective, troll the riot shield guys all game. Muahahahahahahaaaa!
Riot Shields are fun
do i think the riot shield is annoying?  
no cause its easy as hell to counter  
do i think it need to be nerfed?  
no cause once again...easy as hell to counter and if you think like this you either are too bad to counter them OR...you got a rat infestation with super rats
Squeaks angrily
Although not always conditional, shooting them in the feet with crippling rounds and then throwing a semtex, makes me smile.
It's dumb because a shield that big that would deflect bullets would be too heavy to wield effectively.. realism lol
[deleted]
I still don’t understand why a riot shield used to deflect rocks/bottles by *police* are in a military game.
    It’s a video game. There are also shock sticks and other unrealistic devices. I don’t think they’re going for realism.
        Hmm. I’ve heard many people make pro realism arguments when discussing things like sun glare, fast TTK, bullet drop, red dots on minimap, etc. It would be nice if IW picked whether or not they want to go for more of a realism approach rather than mixing and matching. I think the game would benefit from not having riot shields in the game.
Works every time
    Weird cause the never works for me
        Well fifty percent of the time it works every time then
I just shoot their stupid feet.
    symtex sticks to the shield too its funny.
        Drill charge is much more fun, they think they are free, then they hear the drilling start
            As someone who just leveled my knife with the riot shield, this is it. I always think I'm clear then the whirring sound of death gets me.
                And you can’t escape the incoming death lmao. I’d like to try getting stuck on HC then running into the enemy team
                    Back when MW2 originally released my buddies and i had some dirty dirty tactics with this and tubes. Need a few kills quick at the end of the match? Wait till the other team is grouped up, get your riot shield class ready with flack jacket and last stand. Run at the opposing team and have your buddy stick a simtex to your back, grenades and tubes no longer 1 shot you and all of a sudden you just detonate in the middle. But wait theres more! If you have last stand you drop a grenade at your feet and anyone left that runs up gets the second kaboom.
                        Lol
                        That is the most evil non Hitler thing I've heard in awhile.
                        Sadist.
                        This is so well thought out, I love it. If you killed me like this I'd honestly laugh.
                        Martyrdom dropped the nade. Last stand downs you with a pistol. Man never touched a cod in his life.
                            Wow he mixed up the name of a perk from 13 years ago, you sure did show him lmfao
                                Back in the day you could throw a grenade in last stand if you were holding it whan you went down.[this wiki is a good source to back me up](https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Last_Stand#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20if%20a%20player,double%2Dtapping%20the%20action%20button.)
            It's like a slow middle finger to riot shielders. Rubbing it in their faces in a way lmao
            Drill charges never work for me. If they are smart enough to sprint while it's deploying, you won't even get a hit marker on them.
        I just had a round where I stuck the one enemy riot shielder at least a dozen times. There are illegal drugs that don’t feel as good as that.
        A lot of the time people who stick me with a Semtex don't realize when I run at them we both die.
        i recently got platinum for the riot shield.  i now have symtex PTSD. i swear EVERYONE has them equipped when im using the riot shield 😂
    Gotta get them DAWGS
    Not my feet.
    Thank you
    All day, everyday
yup, I always carry a RPG for such occasions.
    Right? Specifically for shield users. It also has a cool secondary use of blowing up enemy UAV, but that's uses Ammo so yeah.
Honestly there are a lot of ways to deal with them easily. People just don’t want to switch their class to do it.
    if you have to switch your entire loadout to deal with 1 "wEaPoN" in the entire game then that's a problem. riot shield should not be in the game...at all.
        Wait… do you only use one load out slot? Think you are just butt hurt then. Riot shields are easy to counter. You can literally switch out whatever tactical you have for a stun and kill them easily.
I use mollys.
    This isn't an NA meeting.
        Molitov cocktail beats shield, Have you not played rock paper scissors molitov shield?
Facts. I love when they think they’re safe sitting in a corner. And I just shoot the RPG at the wall right behind them. Then I look at the scoreboard and see then watching the killcam the whole way lol
Or jumping around with a knife until you’ve confused them and stab them in the face. Lol. Or both one after the other to make them quit.
Unless you run into a fully dedicated shield warrior who throwing knifes you the second you pause shooting, pull a grenade, reload, turn away, or even hesitate
    Not just throwing knives.

        Sweet Jesus, that drill charge got him good
            I’ve gotten so toxic with the drill charge, almost every time I throw it I stick someone in the head and their death comms are always so satisfying
                The drill charge is basically a troll device at this point. Teammate hogging the tank at spawn? Drill charge.
                    You’re not wrong, I was playing DMZ and went against a couple of kids camping my teammates body so what did I use to flush them out? You guessed it, drill charges
                Drill charges are one taps if it hits a person directly as the drill will be what kills not the charge that gets implanted in them but that charge would most definitely ensure they're not getting back up.
                    Realistically the charge won't even touch them, it'll blow up everything behind them once the drill finishes boring a perfect hole through their mangled body
                The coms when I get back into tank after a teammate try’s to kick me out with a drill charge is even more satisfying lol
            But it left him open to death by pistol.


EDIT: but that was kinda cool to see a fountain of blood.
                I agree it's beautiful. I have never seen that before and i use drill charges for that as well
                    It's likely cuz I drop my shield to pull out a pistol.  So instead of the drill charge burrowing into my shield, it's burrowing into my chest instead.  Lol.
                        True. But i am also already looking for a next target so i can't really enjoy the death animation.
            Brings back the Turok 2 memories.
                I’m not the only one that remembers the cerebral bore gun?

I miss the dead body rag dolls too.  Spent so much time just blowing up dead bodies
                    It’s honestly one of the greatest fps guns of all time. 10 year old me was blown away by all of that pixilated monster gore.
                I miss the cerebral bore!
        Had one of these for the final kill and everyone geeked
        Just gotta make sure you hit the operator and not the shield. 

Last night I was running drill charges and had a match with 3 people on the other team using riot shields. Normally, a thermite stuck to a shield would kill that operator. But for some reason last night, every drill charge I stuck to the shield expelled the explosion behind the operator leaving them alive and able to beat me down.

Drill charges should absolutely chunk the user behind a shield but for some reason don't unless you stick it to the user themself.
            I ran into a shield guy last night and stuck his shield with a drill charge. He switched to his secondary and killed me. He didn't die. When he switched weapons and the shield went to his back the drill charge fell off so I had to switch to thermite for the remainder of the game.
            The patch raised the amount of successful sticks for drill charges I think.  And I'm the shield guy in that video.  But as you can see, I was still able to get the kill even if the drill charge takes me out.


I'd be in a severely weakened state.  So followup shots are a must.  And keeping a large spread between teammates as wolves usually do when hunting helps expose vulnerable angles on the shield.
    Is it just me or does thermite need a faster throw speed? Drill Charges are thrown faster, and they have to be heavier then a stick with a case of thermite on one end.
        Drill Charges are thrown in this game as if every operator was Aroldis Chapman slinging 105mph heaters, I swear. 

Half the reason I love using the drill charge is that it's so easy to aim because it is SCHMOOVIN' once you release it and the animation to throw is quick too.
            You think so? I find the throwing animation slow enough to get me killed fairly often. Once it's out of your hands though that baby is flying XD
                I've been COD timing'd by the drill charge more than anything else. I swear the moment I crack it the enemies get a big "peek now!!!" notification
                    Same honestly
            That's one thing I noticed, you can absolutely chuck a drill charge like crazy.
                *y e e t*
                    Quite literally
            You can even stick it to VTOL from ground level...
            Agreed. I feel like the drill charge replaced the termite with the SCHMOOVIN' velocity. I just die trying to throw thermite most times now as the windup takes ages.
        you have a perk for throwing faster
    Then they got skill
        I jump away as soon as the throwing animation starts. I can usually dodge even fast hands this way. Love fighting against shield hunters.
    I can still respawn and try again until I kill them. It's almost more satisfying.
        You mean actually playing the game is FUN and that the shields give you a challenge to overcome in a rock paper scissors way?!
            No, this game is only fun if everyone only uses MP5s
            Exactly. Played a match where like 4/6 opponents were using shields and I thought it was funny (and fun) as shit.
            I actually love the shield guys in DMZ, it at least requires some coordination with your team mates. Like someone grabs his attention and the other guys flank him.
                Dmz are worse than humans bc they reach around shield with sniper accuracy machine pistols
                    Yea but they are the only challenging NPC enemy. Even helicopters are a joke. You either kill them all before it lands or drop one grenade just before it lands and you are golden.
                        Nobody is complaining about NPC's🤦‍♂️
            The high I get seeing 3 people scramble to kill me and then run after I kill 2 with throwing knives is priceless.
    That’s also me, get more throwing knife kills than shield kills.
        When I was doing gold shield I throwing knifed anyone who wasn’t cooperating
            is there tricks to aiming? i always seem to just throw em at the wall behind em.
            Hehehehe! Ikr! I got it poly, imagine how people hates me.
    Lmao yea I was about to say maybe in a bot lobby. With sbmm, all the riot shielders I get are ultra sweats.
    Hey look, it’s me
        Bro fist for the "dedicated shield warriors" lol 

You run tear gas or flash bang as your tac?
    Shield, quick hands, flash bang, throwing knife, scavenger perk for extra knives. Rinse and repeat. 

Had almost identical setup in the original MW2, could get an AC130 no sweat.

Only downside is MW2 22 is scavenger dosnt replen flash/stun unlike in OG MW2.
    I'll be honest, I love TheseKnivesOnly and the content he makes. His entire channel idea is getting max level and playing CoD by getting only melee kills. So he runs riot shield, melee weapon, and throwing knife. It's enjoyable, and obviously it takes some skill to do what he does, BUT

whenever someone talks shit to him ingame about using the riot shield, he's like, "Haha, they're so mad, bro. Come on, I'm just using a riot shield and a knife."

I'm just like, how tone deaf can you be? You should know that by running a shield and being able to throw a knife in .5 seconds while still holding the shield, that you're the one with the advantage now. And he's all like, "Man, he got me with a termite. I hate that." And you're just like, BRUH, that's the only way he can get you effectively and consistently. You get close enough to melee him, and he's dead.
    I sprint and attempt to jump over them while shooting down with a shotgun. Works every time
        you shouldnt be downvoted, jumping a bit to the side past them and shooting them from up above works really well, also with other guns than shotguns. for me at least, and i am not a very good player
            I got the idea from this sub so I figured it was common knowledge. I’m also not very good at the game. 

Dammit. I was saving my karma to buy a bundle too.
He’s not talking about people who actually use the riot shield
    Yea wtf are people upvoting this and downvoting you for? All these comments are talking about people who use primary riot shield which isn’t the purpose of the post
        I swear 90% of the people on the internet are functional illiterate
            It's hilarious seeing basically the entire comment section being like "Ummmm, excuuuuse me, you can counter them by throwing semtex at them". Like yeah, that wasn't the complaint you idiot, it's about the people roleplaying as turtles to make themselves invulnerable from behind unless you aim at their legs where the damage multiplier is shit for most guns and makes them take more shots to kill. Honestly I blame the shit tier balancing for the perks.  Battle hardened does basically nothing against flash grenades, double time is a meme unless you're trying to knife people with how tactical sprint makes you sound like a rhino running, strong arm is too niche, scavenger is useless if you're running meta like everyone else is, tracker is also a joke given how loud your footsteps are, and extra tactical is just used so that you can farm weapon xp with decoy grenades. The only perks worth a damn are bomb squad and overkill.
I’ve found in close quarters that you can often run a tight circle around them and get a takedown off, I’ve done this like 3 times and it’s always awesome
Yah honestly riot shields are really easy to counter in this game.  Thermite, Semtex, drill charge, Molotov, hell even a cooked frag will do the trick.
    How do you always have a lethal when you run into them?  Half the time I run into them I have to switch to rpg quick because I'm out of drill charges.  Does scavenger resupply lethals?
        Once I know there is a riot shield in play I save my drill charges for him.
            If they have bomb squad they can tank the drill charges

Edit: not anymore I’m told
                Not anymore. Patchnotes says they are 100% to die if they got stuck by a drill no matter what.
                    [deleted]
                        My highest kills in this game are with the shield you are right it’s not fully patched, sometimes drill charges kill me sometimes they don’t
                    I hit a shielder like 3 times in a game with a drill charge yesterday and they didn't die.
                They just patched this
                    Last night I swear I stuck a shield guy with a drill charge and he survived.  I was questioning whether Bomb Squad would save them or not.  Not sure they patched this completely
                Threw a drill charge today at one, drilled through the shield, exploded, and did zero damage. However it did lower their teammates health who charged in with riot shield #2 to get melee’d. Should have been a double kill but neither dies off the explosion unfortunately
                    Yeah I’m just gonna keep rocking semtex, it’s a guaranteed kill if you stick it on the shield. The reason drill doesn’t kill is because it spits the nade behind them and if they’re coming forward they’re far enough away from it. When you stick a person with it the drilling is what kills them lmao.
                        Yea i immediately switched back to semtex after it myself lol
        Using resupply and/or by making sure I have at least one left incase of the riot shield. I'll regularly throw all my lethals though if I have teammates, especially the friends I'm playing with nearby.
            And when you run into 2 or 3 or 4 or...
                Easy, you can leave the game at any time
                    "but my win/loss ratio :("
        Resupply perk is a god send.
        Scavenger does not recharge lethals but Resupply does recharge them every 25 seconds and lets you carry 2, once Resupply activates. Resupply is in the 3rd perk slot, if you are making a custom perk set.
    Ya, if you die just as much as they do so you always have a lethal available for when you both respawn lol.

What a strategy.
THIS. 

I’m always like “Thank you for giving me the opportunity to hit you with a Molotov Cocktail and watching you burn.”
You called them shield maiden. 😂
drill charge ftw
I see that we share the same  brain
We're just trying to get camos man calm down.
Same I wish it was the same for drill charge it's just slow
Literally me when i died 25 times in a shoothouse game, me being the shield maiden lol
I like running frags, and don’t care about my k/d, so whenever I see one of these people I pull out a frag, hold it and walk towards them. Works most of the time and I’ve even gotten some friendly tbag dances out of it.
I love it both ways.
Especially fun is being a shield user coming across another sheild user and seeing who cracks first.
You were annoying when I was grinding that thing to platinum lol
I love using the shield myself because by simply existing you tilt people off the face of the earth. Its pretty fucking funny. Then we got folks like you who shrug it off, swap in a thermite, and never have an issue again. Which makes the former group even fucking funnier.
I love watching them freak out and run around on fire until they die
I came here to say exactly this…
No, all they have to do is make a more compelling to use other perks. In older CODs there were better options in the same perk category than using overkill.

This perk systems just sucks. There are 8 base perks, so statistically 1/4 players are probably using overkill. Probably 1/3 since I don't see a reason why you'd use Strong Arm and Extra Tactical.
    Double time, tracker and bomb squad are very good perks
        Strong arm is awesome.

(I have bad aim)
            I love strong arm for lobbing C4’s haha
        Those are the 3 perks I mostly use. I only use Overkill on my Ground War sniper class, and Battle Hardened on my objective game mode class.
    I like strong arm because I'm not great and haven't played enough to properly predict where a throwable will go based on where my reticle is. So the throwing arc is very useful to me. But yeah as I become accustomed to the aiming angle required I imagine this opinion will wane
        [deleted]
            Hey that's solid advice. Don't wanna calibrate my muscle memory to a setting that I will change. If only I could separate the arc from the throwing distance, but I guess I'll learn to do without either.

Didn't know that about Semtex, I guess relying on the arc has meant I haven't noticed that I have to increase the throwing angle? Cheers either way m8
    Woah now, don't bring my boy extra tac into this.  
  
Smg class, two flash nades.  
  
Bliss.  
  
*also nostalgic to the fact that you had two tacticals by default in the OG MW2*
The only reason anyone should be using the shield is for camos imo
    Yeah. Only reason I use it. Otherwise it’s just frustrating to go up against. But when grinding camos especially 3 kills without dieing the shield has been a massive help
    I enjoyed using it just to piss off try hards; I’d always try and find the best player on the enemy team and annoy the fuck out of them
Make it so riot shields cant be used with Overkill. I have no problem with pistol or knife users who have a turtle shell
    The worst part is people that run a riot shield secondary while grinding weapon camos or just playing. You shouldn't be able to have perfect protection from behind (and blocking multi kills) with only the penalty of just one perk
        The problem for me is the perk system, overkill has to be one of the first perk because of how they work but most of those perk are not really good compared to some of the second / third perk so having overkill doesn’t really make you trade off something else that is actually good. Like… even without shield I run overkill on most of my class because it’s probably the best perk in this category.

And I guess the shield on your back should at least let people shoot you in the head
            They should just exclude the riot shield from being used with Overkill. Or make Overkill block the ultimate perk or something to add a downside
                OK wouldn't work as ultimate as then what would your loadout be until you unlock it seeing as its not a base perk?

That's the issue 1) with OK being moved in *any* other slot and 2) an issue with the perk package in general
                    No I’m saying that if you use Overkill, you are sacrificing your Ultimate perk. So for example, you’d have Scavenger, Overkill, and Fast Hands, but you’d never be able to select an ultimate perk.

It could also take up both base perk slots, but honestly it’s so OP that it should block the ultimate slot.

COD 4 did this sort of. If you had a noob tube on your gun, you couldn’t get your first perk. 

I’m also of the opinion that Riot Shields don’t belong in call of duty, so maybe my opinion isn’t the best on this topic.
                In objective game mode the shield can be actually useful especially with communication while running overkill to have another gun when not on the objective, I use it sometime in HQ/HP with another gun, I switch to the shield in situation where I need it and I actually don’t even use it for the back protection.

It would be dumb to remove this option from the game imo.

In old cod the shield protected your back and nobody was complaining tbh, it was fine and it’s still fine imo. My only problem is that you don’t have any tradeoff on overkill, it’s OP as fuck even if you play something like 2 smgs.
                    I’ve been complaining ever since they allowed you to run a riot shield with Overkill. Riot shields should just be removed from the game.
                        I think they just shouldn't be added to the game in the first place.
    Thank you. As a player who loves pistols this is like only way we can make them viable.
        I disagree, I got gold on X12s and Basilisk without a shield on my back and didn’t have a bad time at all. When we’re talking about getting shot in the back it doesn’t really matter what gun you’re using
            Fair
                Reasonable, respecting, level-headed discussion? In MY CoD subreddit? Unacceptable! I demand a witless slinging of insults at once!
                    Alright, fine.

Fuck you, cheese-monger.
            Same for me. I’m currently working on my deagle to get gold. Then I’ll go back to the G18/X13 Auto’s
            While I agree, when grinding my secondaries I don’t touch my primary so equipping the riot shield seems to be the most logical since I get protection/I’m not using that slot anyway. They should just give shields health so their effectiveness drops as they’re shot.
        Pistols are viable but only in certain situations. There are times where I’ve beaten an SMG and an assault rifle with my X12. It’s a challenge for sure and I got lucky, but they are usable

Most of my kills are with them not facing me though lol
        The P890, X12 with stock, and the Basilisk are all fantastic. If you need a shield on your back thats on you.
            X13 is fantastic
        Ive golded three pistols without touching the shield before tier 1 even dropped. Pistols are insanely viable and if you're running the the Deagle or the Revolver you're basically running a primary with how effective they can at one taps.
        Nah dont use a riot shield
    This would be fine if akimbo pistols were not completely busted.
        Akimbo pistols actually suck.... The damage is nerfed on both of the pistols when akimbo
            That may be the case but they are most certainly not bad
            The basilisk with snakeshot and the P890 aren't bad. Akimbo deagles seem like they're intentionally made useless
        Akimbo pistols are pretty bad, and certainly not busted. Like the X13's hipfire cone is so enormous you cant kill anyone at unless youre at point blank distance. X12 akimbo was the only one i had any real success with. Deagle is awful akimbo
            Akimbo deagle is only practical if you land both shots, it's the worst pistol to run akimbo aside from the basilisk without snakeshot. All the other pistols are at least minimally viable for close to close-medium engagements. Some of my best games have been running pistols both with and without akimbo
        They could have akimbo disabled if using a shield.
yeah like the deployable cover or something thats actually a good fucking idea
    Or it could be a field upgrade with a slow recharge rate and everything. I really think it should have some durability stat so it can be destroyed too.
        I believe in mw3 survival the shield could be broken
Agree with the speed penalty, I have found various mf's that use riot shield in the back and the knife as main, those fckrs run faster than Usain Bolt
    The tradeoff is range, they literally don't have a primary gun
    As one of these people, just shoot me.
Or make it unable to be equipped with overkill at least
Brilliant
I’m fine with the riot shield block shots from the front, there is a thermite, sticky nade, and breach charge to count it. However, blocking shots to the back is absolutely ridiculous and needs to be scrapped.

Your collapsible idea is a legit solution to this now 3-4 year problem.
A collapsing riot shield would fit this game’s aesthetic too
Not really, the post is just wrong. It doesn't provide full back and head coverage and it can be easily countered from any angle. Complaining about it is pointless, learn how to exploit it's weaknesses
    So you basically just said skill issue without saying skill issue. It’s a crutch 100%. if they have their back to you, all u can see is the bottom of their legs. Which shooting does significantly less damage than torso/head. It’s a legitimate criticism
It's because everyone replying here are cheesing the shit out of shields and immediately got triggered from the post, rather than taking the time to read it
It seems to be buggy with the drill charge. There have been times I've stuck someone with a shield with the drill charge, and hear the detonation only to turn and see them still alive somehow.
    Before the patch, I think you had to stick it on the upper part for it to actually kill the guy.

However, with the new patch, it is supposed to 100% kill as long as you stick it on the actual shield
        I think I had at least 1 not kill after the patch, because it was in Tier 1. I aimed it directly at the shield and threw it, and he didn't side step or anything, and I turned to sprint around a corner, so it is possible it may not have stuck, since I've 'missed' shots with enemies centered in my crosshairs, but it *should* have stuck the dude and killed them, but they did not die.
            It's still buggy, it's happening many times where I've thrown the drill chargers directly on riot shield people in Tier1 with no kill.
                Yeah I’ve thrown them, gotten the “STUCK” pop up, and no kill 🤷🏻‍♂️
            Had this exact experience and I was trying out the shield for the for the first time, when I got stuck with the drill charge I switched to my pistol and barely survived the blast. But I did survive and it was tier 1

Also it was on the hydroelectric map, just in case it was actually me and you that had the interaction
                Nah, mine was Farm 18 in this specific instance, but weird that you can survive it in Tier 1
        Definitely not working still.
        I’ve definitely stuck a shield and didn’t get the kill since said update. Not saying every single time, but I think there’s still some bugs.
        I can assure you it doesn’t 

Stuck 3 separate riot shields last night with drill charge and it never killed the user
    Because the drill charge shoots out a grenade on the other side rather than just detonating from the surface it appeared on, you can kind of outrun the grenade it shoots out if you sprint straight ahead
        This is the right reason. If they run, the grenade is behind them. If they stand still or crouch walk it will kill them. The reason people get hit markers is the shield maiden is smart enough to run forward.
    Sometimes the drill charge will bug out and shoot itself out under the ground texture, that's why it doesnt kill
Thermite grenade works better since it sticks
    Drill charge sticks too.

But I agree that thermite is better. For whatever reason I'm able to actually land the sticks more consistently.  I think the thermite may move a bit quicker.
        It does, I always think you can throw it further than the drill charge as well.
and then what do you do once you use it
Semtex is more reliable
Yea, I should have to toss a lethal and stick someone to kill them from behind. lmao.
Drill charge literally works 1 in 10 tries. Somehow the explosive goes completely thru them and only hit marks them.
Or a thermite, or a Semtex, or Molotov. They’re really not that hard to deal with.
I have stuck drill charges to about 10 shield with zero effect, same for AI riot shields.
Armor piercing rounds should beat them, maybe with a few nerfs to the round to not make it OP
    Ap rounds should do 40-70% ish damage when fired at the shields.
        Couldn't get a kill last time I tried but I'll give it another go.
            It was a suggestion rather than a fact I think.
        If you do that you might as well remove shields from the game. Everyone in the lobby would switch to AP the second they see your shield.
    I had assumed AP rounds worked. Im stunned that they dont
        Apparently I'm wrong but I haven't had success yet.
I just want an end to the turtle meta. Just make people slow as fuck with the riot shield on their back.
    Yeah there’s two real solutions here. Make it cover less of the back or make people slower. Either one would significantly bump down the usage.
That’s it more realism. I think armor piercing rounds should eat through them personally since you know that is how it would work.
Oh ok, and here I was thinking the “sc” was the typo
The point of this post is saying they shouldn’t provide protection when on your back (not equipped).
    It's insane how most of the comments are just ignoring the post
        Classic Reddit. Seems to be even worse in CoD subs, where in comments you can usually find in-topic replies with approximate ratio of 1:50 😊
            Because most posters are literally children and teenagers
                Yeah, it never ceases to baffle me how young the 18 year old people sound nowadays
        busy reply squeal many puzzled books lavish truck quack person -- mass edited with https://redact.dev/
            They're bragging about how amazing they are for throwing a grenade at it. Prime MLG players here
    Oof That's like the sole reason I use them lol cause I like to run pistols and the protection on the back helps with the super slow pistol ttk
        With overkill tho it's like having insane protection at no cost. Especially if you run a high capacity mag.
[deleted]
    If you see a shield on their back, aim at ankles. Shield on back only ruins it if you spray or have an aim bot forcing you to shoot higher up.
        Just because they are still killable doesnt mean they should have a protection like that for basically free. Most primary perks in this game arent really that good so running Overkill instead of something else is not a penalty at all. So there is basically no reason to not use a shield on your back, no matter what kind of playstyle you want to have or what gun you want to use.
        If they’re running their legs are going in and out behind the shield man.
            If you can't hit moving target let em go.
        Alright, I’ll use my sniper and try to hit an ankle twice (because it would likely be a hit marker first)…. Or they could just stop adding this crutch mechanic in the game
            Oh no you might have to put effort beyond point and click.
                Lol we’re talking about a weapon that literally requires zero effort to benefit from. What a dumb point to try to make. There’s no legitimate argument for why riot shields should work on your back the way they do but all of the losers who can’t handle getting shot in the back keep defending it. If you’re getting shot in the back enough that you *need* a riot shield to protect you, you’re not moving around the map in a smart way
                    And if you can't kill someone from behind with a two shot gun then you also have issues. Worst case you get an assist and still block their play.


Shields come at a cost. They're real easy to shot around and there's more lethal than ever that deal with them. People are just complaining because it isn't THEIR play style and want it easier.
                        >	Shields come at a cost.

None of your points are “costs” unique to riot shields. You know who’s easier to shoot than someone with a shield? Someone without one. You know who else deals with lethals? Everyone. Riot shields are a crutch for bad players, nothing else to it.
                            They are useful for low skill, ie the majority of players. They're also harder to use effectively other than passively.


There's an argument for all weapons being low skill if you don't use them. OHK especially without slow ADS feels OP, holding the trigger to spray rather than aim feels OP. Shooting explosives at the floor near people for kills feels OP. Until you use it and try to utilise it, it all feels OP.
    It’s easy as shit killing a player from behind with a riot shield, not only does the shield move but there legs are always open to get blasted. Just aim down
        [removed]
I’ve played that way for the last 20 hours and I’ve got to say it’s broken as hell but if the speed is nerfed the play style is no longer viable. 

I’m an average player and I top out around 18-22 kills with a knife and riot shield. I can totally dominate objective game modes but it’s useless in TDM and SND and those game modes
    > if the speed is nerfed the play style is no longer viable.


Yeah, let's take all variety out of the game. Don't use a semtex, termite, stun, flash, claymore, prox mine, rpg or movement to counter it.
    [deleted]
        Aye do you man, I hope I never come across you in the game
Shields are so easy to counter idk why people are so whiny about it. Only thing I would agree with is making Arms and/or Head more exposed while the shield is on the back.

Overall the Shield is pretty easy to counter for the most part, idk why people keep complaining.
    [removed]
        I can't just slide cancel and bunny hop my way to victory?! Man this game sucks. They need to bring back exploits and get rid of the critical thinking of how to address an enemy that's only protected from the front while crouching. /s
            Considering this game is just get on and shoot a gun casually I don't see why anyone would want to sit and change a class just to counter one specific player in that game... Also this is about back protection not using the actual riot shield...
                Semtex, molotov, drill charge, c4, claymore, prox mine, rpg, shoot the legs, run away and use moment tactics, stun or flash grenade and shoot their sides. Any of that is viable and I'm sure if you're creative you can come up with more ways to kill a shield guy. Also from behind you can shoot them in the legs/ass. The shield sits at an angle, not straight up and down. I think people are just salty because there's something they can't just pew pew with an SMG and slide cancel/stim their way to victory. It's not hard to counter, at all. People just like to complain, I guess.
Also Snipers should be super heavy and should be impossible to be used up close
    But my point blank camo challenges :(
    Yes, this. Having half the field run and gunning with snipers is annoying as hell.
The pistols are honestly amazing in this game though
The Problem is with people using overkill and putting a shield on their back. There's nothing wrong with players using shield and secondaries.
Yeah because when they're not, you shoot their feet and they die. No equipment necessary.
i’m just confused about the fact that it’s been full protection in every COD… right? am i imagining things? why is it an issue now?
    I think the big issue is the amount of people that are running them on their back now after the Vanguard glitch that made it really hard to kill them from behind
    Because you don’t have to make a sacrifice to run overkill in this game unlike in past games you can run overkill and scav thanks to the perk system where as before you’d have to choose scav or overkill, and who’s going to take overkill over a more beneficial perk
        Overkill is usually in the same perk slot as Ghost too.
        This, you basically don’t trade anything good to be able to play with overkill, people should complain more about the current perk system breaking the balance of the game instead.
    It’s always been an issue
    it's only been part of the game for like thirteen years, you gotta excuse people for wanting these new-fangled mechanics out of the game.
    People have hated it since the original MW2. Where on Earth have you been?
    They get mad because of the kamikaze reverse boosting/knife camo challenge players.
    I’m pretty sure in MW3 the glass was breakable with enough rounds, so you could only get headshot

Also this discussion has been going on since the start of 2019 at least lol, I’d be shocked if they changed it now
    This is exactly right
Whole comment section under this post „fear the walking shield“ xD
This isn’t about riot shields people are equipping.. it’s about riot shields as a secondary on your back.
Well the counter to jumpshotting is good aim, which you can't exactly use up.

Equipment on the other hand, might not be around for every gunfight if you've already used it.
    If they one tap you with a cracked out marksmen build, good luck practicing good aim lmao.
name one other build in the game that can only be countered by a one-use-per-life piece of equipment
    Damn munitions box and restock are crazy you should run them. Imagine having to think when you turn on the game 🤯

H-how can I run those when all my classes need fast hands and dead silence no matter what's happening in the lobby 😡
        Yeah lemme be forced to run that garbage just to hopefully kill a shield user. Thats called centralizing.
        Oh no! I had to use my equipment on an enemy! You know, the thing it was literally made for!
I’ve noticed that while playing riot/knife. Last CoD game I reverently played was WWII, you basically had to crouch with the shield the whole time or you’d get shredded. But I’ve found myself just walking at people with impunity in this game because they just don’t shoot my feet.
Least based riot shield enjoyer
Best snd build
Exactly, the only time I'm running it on my back is if I'm using my knife or maybe running pistols but in those cases I'm not using a primary
Honestly most of the time I run RS on my back I just get killed from the front anyhow.
The deployable shield was flimsy but I enjoyed using it for cover, I liked how ghosts had attachments for the shields I always wanted the option to use a Pistol/SMG with it off to the side like AI & not mounted in the shield like BO4.
But how else would it work? You suddenly get overkill half way through the game and your whole class magically changes?
    Totally agree it can't be anywhere else with the current progressive perk system. I mainly mean, it's just another reason why this new perk system is trash.
Only annoying when they block all explosives that aren't tactical. It's a bulletshield, not a concrete wall.
Right, just gotta use tactical equipment. And people don’t like changing their playstyle for one game, they just wanna run around and not think 1 bit
    Honestly, I fucking hate them. My brain sometimes go full regard when I see them. *However*, I do like that they change the pace of play. It makes the game interesting, because now I have to get out of my comfort zone to take them on. So I guess it'd be better to say I hate getting *outplayed* by them.
imagine bitching because you can't beat the in-game equivalent of red-light/green-light.
This sub complains about everything and anything so I'm not surprised

Plus this shit has been in cod for ages hasn't it?
Hes talking about the back coverage...
I use the shield quite often and in multiple loadouts, and I love it's versatility. 

But saying that I've always thought the shield should be carried laterally across his waist. Still provides since cover from a random spray but not to upper chest and head, the two highest damage places. I think using it with overkill just for protection is a trash strategy and needs to die.
I remember when you could plant them in BO2. You would have to pull out your knife when you did it.
Man I felt so outplayed when I can't shoot someone in the back simply bc they pressed 2 buttons in a menu
    Reading these comments is unreal. People are actually this dumb and think it is a good feature. No wonder gaming is fucked when the average IQ is below 50.
        Granted its a cod subreddit, but honestly this site used to have more intelligent users. Doubt itll ever get fixed because people that use crutches always get defensive when people call it broken. Because if it’s broken then their epic killstreaks weren’t as skillful as they thought
    What if... There was a way to shoot them from the front while the shield was on their back?
        They're running away after killing my squadmate, I can shoot at their feet but the damage debuff from doing so would just get hitmarkers.  They escape yet again.
Near-Invincibility is getting outplayed now? So I if goku blows up earth it’s a skill issue?
Everyone’s out here acting like a riot shield makes you a juggernaut
It's not "outplaying" if it's just something you choose in the create-a-class menu.

"Outplaying" is something you do mid game with limited time.
    yeah and if you can't outplay the shielder before they kill you you've been outplayed yourself.
        Used my thermite on a flank point and a shield appears.  Oh no, it appears I've been outplayed because the one tool used to kill them was used for more important things.  I don't use lethals and tacticals on shields exclusively you know.  

I also don't like devolving an FPS into a game of rock paper scissors.
This is not Overwatch...
How did this guy get upvoted? The post is about riot shields on people's back, not when they're actually used.
I hope you like trading kills.

    I-mean push come to shove this isn’t too bad. After all the riot shield user does die too so its a little cathartic even if its just a trade.
It’s my experience that most people use it to goblin run at me and melee me or tuck into a corner and wait for an opportunity to throw a knife at my head lmao
Scrapped.

    Pineapple pizza is good. Fight me
        It's high tier. Pineapple, bit of chicken, jalapeños. That's a regular for me if I'm having trouble deciding.
    pineapl3pizza ?
Same, I’ve been running riot shields on my back and it only makes a difference like 1 out of every 10 kills at best.  People seem to have no problem killing me from behind the vast majority of the time.
They dont help that much, people are just whiney
It’s not even about getting good. Just makes sense to give the shield more cons since the glass doesn’t break when it should.
Why the hell would I do that?
Nobody is talking about some poor kid crouch-walking at you, just trying to level his shield. Equipment, for one, is situational. Two, there is no counter to a guy who keeps getting to areas of the map that shouldn’t be possible because he can freely hit cuts, right in front of your teammates, without needing to worry about bullets in a FPS thanks to his unequipped shield. What next? Marksman rifles are fine?
Can’t wait for everyone to complain snipers are one shot kills
*once per life
Cod players when they encounter a mechanic which isn't "gun shoot."
[deleted]
    I agree completely. I personally think snipers shouldn't be able to quickscope. They are meant to be hard hitting area denial. Not fast af weapons meant to be used like an ar
If you wanna talk about realism then why don't armor piercing rounds break through? Or even enough regular rounds? Riot shield don't hold forever in real life
I used my thermite on the last riot shield user what do you suggest I do now
    They are going to suggest you have resupply and munitions box next.  They are basically suggesting you build your entire class around possibly meeting a shield user.
        yeah it’s beyond stupid
Read the post again. It's about people putting the shield on their back, not the players who actually use it as intended.
To be fair though the only time I pick it up aside from my troll class is to get my melee weapons done got knife platinum before work today just need the platinum challenge for shield
Guys guys stop arguing, u/Jordanthb has cracked the code!  Why is everyone worrying about riot shields when you can just shoot at their feet!! 

Ah I remember my first call of duty game too
A lot of people are taking gaming way too serious.
    Just crouch and shoot their exposed ass. Lol.
I use the riot shield in every loadout.  I would give it up in a second if every match i was in wasnt full of camping snipers.  Its the best counter to that bullshit.
Based
Show me a real life riot shield that stops a full mag of high caliber bullets
    Show me a clip where someone is quick scoping everybody with a sniper
        Hence why COD is an arcade shooter. Instead of complaining on reddit go play and get better.
What Riot Shield blocks 50 Cals while on your back without any weight or downside whatsoever? Or even. 308. Hell, even a mag of 7.62?whilst being made of transparent material?
Lmao this really. But truth be told, they should have some sort of speed penalty or at least slower sprint if unequipped just my two cents tho
its not about counters, its about sweats running riot shields on their back so they cant get shot from behind ever while they jump shotgun everyone...
Das Haus and shipment were all just people with shields on their backs. Shields actually didn't block bullets on the back at launch but apparently it was a bug and they patched it. Once it was patched that was all you would see and it was so frustrating. There were times where your shots would even be blocked from the front when it was on their back. I think if you see everyone using one specific piece of equipment then there are some balance issues whether people want to admit it or not. There should be reasons to use different equipment and not just have one overpowered thing that everyone uses. 

I also made this argument with Vanguard, should my gun shoot from my back since they can block shots when the shield isn't even equipped?
It’s a video game. There are also shock sticks and other unrealistic devices. I don’t think they’re going for realism.
    Hmm. I’ve heard many people make pro realism arguments when discussing things like sun glare, fast TTK, bullet drop, red dots on minimap, etc. It would be nice if IW picked whether or not they want to go for more of a realism approach rather than mixing and matching. I think the game would benefit from not having riot shields in the game.
Weird cause the never works for me
    Well fifty percent of the time it works every time then
symtex sticks to the shield too its funny.
    Drill charge is much more fun, they think they are free, then they hear the drilling start
        As someone who just leveled my knife with the riot shield, this is it. I always think I'm clear then the whirring sound of death gets me.
            And you can’t escape the incoming death lmao. I’d like to try getting stuck on HC then running into the enemy team
                Back when MW2 originally released my buddies and i had some dirty dirty tactics with this and tubes. Need a few kills quick at the end of the match? Wait till the other team is grouped up, get your riot shield class ready with flack jacket and last stand. Run at the opposing team and have your buddy stick a simtex to your back, grenades and tubes no longer 1 shot you and all of a sudden you just detonate in the middle. But wait theres more! If you have last stand you drop a grenade at your feet and anyone left that runs up gets the second kaboom.
                    Lol
                    That is the most evil non Hitler thing I've heard in awhile.
                    Sadist.
                    This is so well thought out, I love it. If you killed me like this I'd honestly laugh.
                    Martyrdom dropped the nade. Last stand downs you with a pistol. Man never touched a cod in his life.
                        Wow he mixed up the name of a perk from 13 years ago, you sure did show him lmfao
                            Back in the day you could throw a grenade in last stand if you were holding it whan you went down.[this wiki is a good source to back me up](https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Last_Stand#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20if%20a%20player,double%2Dtapping%20the%20action%20button.)
        It's like a slow middle finger to riot shielders. Rubbing it in their faces in a way lmao
        Drill charges never work for me. If they are smart enough to sprint while it's deploying, you won't even get a hit marker on them.
    I just had a round where I stuck the one enemy riot shielder at least a dozen times. There are illegal drugs that don’t feel as good as that.
    A lot of the time people who stick me with a Semtex don't realize when I run at them we both die.
    i recently got platinum for the riot shield.  i now have symtex PTSD. i swear EVERYONE has them equipped when im using the riot shield 😂
Gotta get them DAWGS
Not my feet.
Thank you
All day, everyday
Right? Specifically for shield users. It also has a cool secondary use of blowing up enemy UAV, but that's uses Ammo so yeah.
if you have to switch your entire loadout to deal with 1 "wEaPoN" in the entire game then that's a problem. riot shield should not be in the game...at all.
    Wait… do you only use one load out slot? Think you are just butt hurt then. Riot shields are easy to counter. You can literally switch out whatever tactical you have for a stun and kill them easily.
This isn't an NA meeting.
    Molitov cocktail beats shield, Have you not played rock paper scissors molitov shield?
Not just throwing knives.

    Sweet Jesus, that drill charge got him good
        I’ve gotten so toxic with the drill charge, almost every time I throw it I stick someone in the head and their death comms are always so satisfying
            The drill charge is basically a troll device at this point. Teammate hogging the tank at spawn? Drill charge.
                You’re not wrong, I was playing DMZ and went against a couple of kids camping my teammates body so what did I use to flush them out? You guessed it, drill charges
            Drill charges are one taps if it hits a person directly as the drill will be what kills not the charge that gets implanted in them but that charge would most definitely ensure they're not getting back up.
                Realistically the charge won't even touch them, it'll blow up everything behind them once the drill finishes boring a perfect hole through their mangled body
            The coms when I get back into tank after a teammate try’s to kick me out with a drill charge is even more satisfying lol
        But it left him open to death by pistol.


EDIT: but that was kinda cool to see a fountain of blood.
            I agree it's beautiful. I have never seen that before and i use drill charges for that as well
                It's likely cuz I drop my shield to pull out a pistol.  So instead of the drill charge burrowing into my shield, it's burrowing into my chest instead.  Lol.
                    True. But i am also already looking for a next target so i can't really enjoy the death animation.
        Brings back the Turok 2 memories.
            I’m not the only one that remembers the cerebral bore gun?

I miss the dead body rag dolls too.  Spent so much time just blowing up dead bodies
                It’s honestly one of the greatest fps guns of all time. 10 year old me was blown away by all of that pixilated monster gore.
            I miss the cerebral bore!
    Had one of these for the final kill and everyone geeked
    Just gotta make sure you hit the operator and not the shield. 

Last night I was running drill charges and had a match with 3 people on the other team using riot shields. Normally, a thermite stuck to a shield would kill that operator. But for some reason last night, every drill charge I stuck to the shield expelled the explosion behind the operator leaving them alive and able to beat me down.

Drill charges should absolutely chunk the user behind a shield but for some reason don't unless you stick it to the user themself.
        I ran into a shield guy last night and stuck his shield with a drill charge. He switched to his secondary and killed me. He didn't die. When he switched weapons and the shield went to his back the drill charge fell off so I had to switch to thermite for the remainder of the game.
        The patch raised the amount of successful sticks for drill charges I think.  And I'm the shield guy in that video.  But as you can see, I was still able to get the kill even if the drill charge takes me out.


I'd be in a severely weakened state.  So followup shots are a must.  And keeping a large spread between teammates as wolves usually do when hunting helps expose vulnerable angles on the shield.
Is it just me or does thermite need a faster throw speed? Drill Charges are thrown faster, and they have to be heavier then a stick with a case of thermite on one end.
    Drill Charges are thrown in this game as if every operator was Aroldis Chapman slinging 105mph heaters, I swear. 

Half the reason I love using the drill charge is that it's so easy to aim because it is SCHMOOVIN' once you release it and the animation to throw is quick too.
        You think so? I find the throwing animation slow enough to get me killed fairly often. Once it's out of your hands though that baby is flying XD
            I've been COD timing'd by the drill charge more than anything else. I swear the moment I crack it the enemies get a big "peek now!!!" notification
                Same honestly
        That's one thing I noticed, you can absolutely chuck a drill charge like crazy.
            *y e e t*
                Quite literally
        You can even stick it to VTOL from ground level...
        Agreed. I feel like the drill charge replaced the termite with the SCHMOOVIN' velocity. I just die trying to throw thermite most times now as the windup takes ages.
    you have a perk for throwing faster
Then they got skill
    I jump away as soon as the throwing animation starts. I can usually dodge even fast hands this way. Love fighting against shield hunters.
I can still respawn and try again until I kill them. It's almost more satisfying.
    You mean actually playing the game is FUN and that the shields give you a challenge to overcome in a rock paper scissors way?!
        No, this game is only fun if everyone only uses MP5s
        Exactly. Played a match where like 4/6 opponents were using shields and I thought it was funny (and fun) as shit.
        I actually love the shield guys in DMZ, it at least requires some coordination with your team mates. Like someone grabs his attention and the other guys flank him.
            Dmz are worse than humans bc they reach around shield with sniper accuracy machine pistols
                Yea but they are the only challenging NPC enemy. Even helicopters are a joke. You either kill them all before it lands or drop one grenade just before it lands and you are golden.
                    Nobody is complaining about NPC's🤦‍♂️
        The high I get seeing 3 people scramble to kill me and then run after I kill 2 with throwing knives is priceless.
That’s also me, get more throwing knife kills than shield kills.
    When I was doing gold shield I throwing knifed anyone who wasn’t cooperating
        is there tricks to aiming? i always seem to just throw em at the wall behind em.
        Hehehehe! Ikr! I got it poly, imagine how people hates me.
Lmao yea I was about to say maybe in a bot lobby. With sbmm, all the riot shielders I get are ultra sweats.
Hey look, it’s me
    Bro fist for the "dedicated shield warriors" lol 

You run tear gas or flash bang as your tac?
Shield, quick hands, flash bang, throwing knife, scavenger perk for extra knives. Rinse and repeat. 

Had almost identical setup in the original MW2, could get an AC130 no sweat.

Only downside is MW2 22 is scavenger dosnt replen flash/stun unlike in OG MW2.
I'll be honest, I love TheseKnivesOnly and the content he makes. His entire channel idea is getting max level and playing CoD by getting only melee kills. So he runs riot shield, melee weapon, and throwing knife. It's enjoyable, and obviously it takes some skill to do what he does, BUT

whenever someone talks shit to him ingame about using the riot shield, he's like, "Haha, they're so mad, bro. Come on, I'm just using a riot shield and a knife."

I'm just like, how tone deaf can you be? You should know that by running a shield and being able to throw a knife in .5 seconds while still holding the shield, that you're the one with the advantage now. And he's all like, "Man, he got me with a termite. I hate that." And you're just like, BRUH, that's the only way he can get you effectively and consistently. You get close enough to melee him, and he's dead.
I sprint and attempt to jump over them while shooting down with a shotgun. Works every time
    you shouldnt be downvoted, jumping a bit to the side past them and shooting them from up above works really well, also with other guns than shotguns. for me at least, and i am not a very good player
        I got the idea from this sub so I figured it was common knowledge. I’m also not very good at the game. 

Dammit. I was saving my karma to buy a bundle too.
Yea wtf are people upvoting this and downvoting you for? All these comments are talking about people who use primary riot shield which isn’t the purpose of the post
    I swear 90% of the people on the internet are functional illiterate
        It's hilarious seeing basically the entire comment section being like "Ummmm, excuuuuse me, you can counter them by throwing semtex at them". Like yeah, that wasn't the complaint you idiot, it's about the people roleplaying as turtles to make themselves invulnerable from behind unless you aim at their legs where the damage multiplier is shit for most guns and makes them take more shots to kill. Honestly I blame the shit tier balancing for the perks.  Battle hardened does basically nothing against flash grenades, double time is a meme unless you're trying to knife people with how tactical sprint makes you sound like a rhino running, strong arm is too niche, scavenger is useless if you're running meta like everyone else is, tracker is also a joke given how loud your footsteps are, and extra tactical is just used so that you can farm weapon xp with decoy grenades. The only perks worth a damn are bomb squad and overkill.
How do you always have a lethal when you run into them?  Half the time I run into them I have to switch to rpg quick because I'm out of drill charges.  Does scavenger resupply lethals?
    Once I know there is a riot shield in play I save my drill charges for him.
        If they have bomb squad they can tank the drill charges

Edit: not anymore I’m told
            Not anymore. Patchnotes says they are 100% to die if they got stuck by a drill no matter what.
                [deleted]
                    My highest kills in this game are with the shield you are right it’s not fully patched, sometimes drill charges kill me sometimes they don’t
                I hit a shielder like 3 times in a game with a drill charge yesterday and they didn't die.
            They just patched this
                Last night I swear I stuck a shield guy with a drill charge and he survived.  I was questioning whether Bomb Squad would save them or not.  Not sure they patched this completely
            Threw a drill charge today at one, drilled through the shield, exploded, and did zero damage. However it did lower their teammates health who charged in with riot shield #2 to get melee’d. Should have been a double kill but neither dies off the explosion unfortunately
                Yeah I’m just gonna keep rocking semtex, it’s a guaranteed kill if you stick it on the shield. The reason drill doesn’t kill is because it spits the nade behind them and if they’re coming forward they’re far enough away from it. When you stick a person with it the drilling is what kills them lmao.
                    Yea i immediately switched back to semtex after it myself lol
    Using resupply and/or by making sure I have at least one left incase of the riot shield. I'll regularly throw all my lethals though if I have teammates, especially the friends I'm playing with nearby.
        And when you run into 2 or 3 or 4 or...
            Easy, you can leave the game at any time
                "but my win/loss ratio :("
    Resupply perk is a god send.
    Scavenger does not recharge lethals but Resupply does recharge them every 25 seconds and lets you carry 2, once Resupply activates. Resupply is in the 3rd perk slot, if you are making a custom perk set.
Ya, if you die just as much as they do so you always have a lethal available for when you both respawn lol.

What a strategy.
Double time, tracker and bomb squad are very good perks
    Strong arm is awesome.

(I have bad aim)
        I love strong arm for lobbing C4’s haha
    Those are the 3 perks I mostly use. I only use Overkill on my Ground War sniper class, and Battle Hardened on my objective game mode class.
I like strong arm because I'm not great and haven't played enough to properly predict where a throwable will go based on where my reticle is. So the throwing arc is very useful to me. But yeah as I become accustomed to the aiming angle required I imagine this opinion will wane
    [deleted]
        Hey that's solid advice. Don't wanna calibrate my muscle memory to a setting that I will change. If only I could separate the arc from the throwing distance, but I guess I'll learn to do without either.

Didn't know that about Semtex, I guess relying on the arc has meant I haven't noticed that I have to increase the throwing angle? Cheers either way m8
Woah now, don't bring my boy extra tac into this.  
  
Smg class, two flash nades.  
  
Bliss.  
  
*also nostalgic to the fact that you had two tacticals by default in the OG MW2*
Yeah. Only reason I use it. Otherwise it’s just frustrating to go up against. But when grinding camos especially 3 kills without dieing the shield has been a massive help
I enjoyed using it just to piss off try hards; I’d always try and find the best player on the enemy team and annoy the fuck out of them
The worst part is people that run a riot shield secondary while grinding weapon camos or just playing. You shouldn't be able to have perfect protection from behind (and blocking multi kills) with only the penalty of just one perk
    The problem for me is the perk system, overkill has to be one of the first perk because of how they work but most of those perk are not really good compared to some of the second / third perk so having overkill doesn’t really make you trade off something else that is actually good. Like… even without shield I run overkill on most of my class because it’s probably the best perk in this category.

And I guess the shield on your back should at least let people shoot you in the head
        They should just exclude the riot shield from being used with Overkill. Or make Overkill block the ultimate perk or something to add a downside
            OK wouldn't work as ultimate as then what would your loadout be until you unlock it seeing as its not a base perk?

That's the issue 1) with OK being moved in *any* other slot and 2) an issue with the perk package in general
                No I’m saying that if you use Overkill, you are sacrificing your Ultimate perk. So for example, you’d have Scavenger, Overkill, and Fast Hands, but you’d never be able to select an ultimate perk.

It could also take up both base perk slots, but honestly it’s so OP that it should block the ultimate slot.

COD 4 did this sort of. If you had a noob tube on your gun, you couldn’t get your first perk. 

I’m also of the opinion that Riot Shields don’t belong in call of duty, so maybe my opinion isn’t the best on this topic.
            In objective game mode the shield can be actually useful especially with communication while running overkill to have another gun when not on the objective, I use it sometime in HQ/HP with another gun, I switch to the shield in situation where I need it and I actually don’t even use it for the back protection.

It would be dumb to remove this option from the game imo.

In old cod the shield protected your back and nobody was complaining tbh, it was fine and it’s still fine imo. My only problem is that you don’t have any tradeoff on overkill, it’s OP as fuck even if you play something like 2 smgs.
                I’ve been complaining ever since they allowed you to run a riot shield with Overkill. Riot shields should just be removed from the game.
                    I think they just shouldn't be added to the game in the first place.
Thank you. As a player who loves pistols this is like only way we can make them viable.
    I disagree, I got gold on X12s and Basilisk without a shield on my back and didn’t have a bad time at all. When we’re talking about getting shot in the back it doesn’t really matter what gun you’re using
        Fair
            Reasonable, respecting, level-headed discussion? In MY CoD subreddit? Unacceptable! I demand a witless slinging of insults at once!
                Alright, fine.

Fuck you, cheese-monger.
        Same for me. I’m currently working on my deagle to get gold. Then I’ll go back to the G18/X13 Auto’s
        While I agree, when grinding my secondaries I don’t touch my primary so equipping the riot shield seems to be the most logical since I get protection/I’m not using that slot anyway. They should just give shields health so their effectiveness drops as they’re shot.
    Pistols are viable but only in certain situations. There are times where I’ve beaten an SMG and an assault rifle with my X12. It’s a challenge for sure and I got lucky, but they are usable

Most of my kills are with them not facing me though lol
    The P890, X12 with stock, and the Basilisk are all fantastic. If you need a shield on your back thats on you.
        X13 is fantastic
    Ive golded three pistols without touching the shield before tier 1 even dropped. Pistols are insanely viable and if you're running the the Deagle or the Revolver you're basically running a primary with how effective they can at one taps.
    Nah dont use a riot shield
This would be fine if akimbo pistols were not completely busted.
    Akimbo pistols actually suck.... The damage is nerfed on both of the pistols when akimbo
        That may be the case but they are most certainly not bad
        The basilisk with snakeshot and the P890 aren't bad. Akimbo deagles seem like they're intentionally made useless
    Akimbo pistols are pretty bad, and certainly not busted. Like the X13's hipfire cone is so enormous you cant kill anyone at unless youre at point blank distance. X12 akimbo was the only one i had any real success with. Deagle is awful akimbo
        Akimbo deagle is only practical if you land both shots, it's the worst pistol to run akimbo aside from the basilisk without snakeshot. All the other pistols are at least minimally viable for close to close-medium engagements. Some of my best games have been running pistols both with and without akimbo
    They could have akimbo disabled if using a shield.
Or it could be a field upgrade with a slow recharge rate and everything. I really think it should have some durability stat so it can be destroyed too.
    I believe in mw3 survival the shield could be broken
The tradeoff is range, they literally don't have a primary gun
As one of these people, just shoot me.
So you basically just said skill issue without saying skill issue. It’s a crutch 100%. if they have their back to you, all u can see is the bottom of their legs. Which shooting does significantly less damage than torso/head. It’s a legitimate criticism
Before the patch, I think you had to stick it on the upper part for it to actually kill the guy.

However, with the new patch, it is supposed to 100% kill as long as you stick it on the actual shield
    I think I had at least 1 not kill after the patch, because it was in Tier 1. I aimed it directly at the shield and threw it, and he didn't side step or anything, and I turned to sprint around a corner, so it is possible it may not have stuck, since I've 'missed' shots with enemies centered in my crosshairs, but it *should* have stuck the dude and killed them, but they did not die.
        It's still buggy, it's happening many times where I've thrown the drill chargers directly on riot shield people in Tier1 with no kill.
            Yeah I’ve thrown them, gotten the “STUCK” pop up, and no kill 🤷🏻‍♂️
        Had this exact experience and I was trying out the shield for the for the first time, when I got stuck with the drill charge I switched to my pistol and barely survived the blast. But I did survive and it was tier 1

Also it was on the hydroelectric map, just in case it was actually me and you that had the interaction
            Nah, mine was Farm 18 in this specific instance, but weird that you can survive it in Tier 1
    Definitely not working still.
    I’ve definitely stuck a shield and didn’t get the kill since said update. Not saying every single time, but I think there’s still some bugs.
    I can assure you it doesn’t 

Stuck 3 separate riot shields last night with drill charge and it never killed the user
Because the drill charge shoots out a grenade on the other side rather than just detonating from the surface it appeared on, you can kind of outrun the grenade it shoots out if you sprint straight ahead
    This is the right reason. If they run, the grenade is behind them. If they stand still or crouch walk it will kill them. The reason people get hit markers is the shield maiden is smart enough to run forward.
Sometimes the drill charge will bug out and shoot itself out under the ground texture, that's why it doesnt kill
Drill charge sticks too.

But I agree that thermite is better. For whatever reason I'm able to actually land the sticks more consistently.  I think the thermite may move a bit quicker.
    It does, I always think you can throw it further than the drill charge as well.
Ap rounds should do 40-70% ish damage when fired at the shields.
    Couldn't get a kill last time I tried but I'll give it another go.
        It was a suggestion rather than a fact I think.
    If you do that you might as well remove shields from the game. Everyone in the lobby would switch to AP the second they see your shield.
I had assumed AP rounds worked. Im stunned that they dont
    Apparently I'm wrong but I haven't had success yet.
Yeah there’s two real solutions here. Make it cover less of the back or make people slower. Either one would significantly bump down the usage.
It's insane how most of the comments are just ignoring the post
    Classic Reddit. Seems to be even worse in CoD subs, where in comments you can usually find in-topic replies with approximate ratio of 1:50 😊
        Because most posters are literally children and teenagers
            Yeah, it never ceases to baffle me how young the 18 year old people sound nowadays
    busy reply squeal many puzzled books lavish truck quack person -- mass edited with https://redact.dev/
        They're bragging about how amazing they are for throwing a grenade at it. Prime MLG players here
Oof That's like the sole reason I use them lol cause I like to run pistols and the protection on the back helps with the super slow pistol ttk
    With overkill tho it's like having insane protection at no cost. Especially if you run a high capacity mag.
If you see a shield on their back, aim at ankles. Shield on back only ruins it if you spray or have an aim bot forcing you to shoot higher up.
    Just because they are still killable doesnt mean they should have a protection like that for basically free. Most primary perks in this game arent really that good so running Overkill instead of something else is not a penalty at all. So there is basically no reason to not use a shield on your back, no matter what kind of playstyle you want to have or what gun you want to use.
    If they’re running their legs are going in and out behind the shield man.
        If you can't hit moving target let em go.
    Alright, I’ll use my sniper and try to hit an ankle twice (because it would likely be a hit marker first)…. Or they could just stop adding this crutch mechanic in the game
        Oh no you might have to put effort beyond point and click.
            Lol we’re talking about a weapon that literally requires zero effort to benefit from. What a dumb point to try to make. There’s no legitimate argument for why riot shields should work on your back the way they do but all of the losers who can’t handle getting shot in the back keep defending it. If you’re getting shot in the back enough that you *need* a riot shield to protect you, you’re not moving around the map in a smart way
                And if you can't kill someone from behind with a two shot gun then you also have issues. Worst case you get an assist and still block their play.


Shields come at a cost. They're real easy to shot around and there's more lethal than ever that deal with them. People are just complaining because it isn't THEIR play style and want it easier.
                    >	Shields come at a cost.

None of your points are “costs” unique to riot shields. You know who’s easier to shoot than someone with a shield? Someone without one. You know who else deals with lethals? Everyone. Riot shields are a crutch for bad players, nothing else to it.
                        They are useful for low skill, ie the majority of players. They're also harder to use effectively other than passively.


There's an argument for all weapons being low skill if you don't use them. OHK especially without slow ADS feels OP, holding the trigger to spray rather than aim feels OP. Shooting explosives at the floor near people for kills feels OP. Until you use it and try to utilise it, it all feels OP.
It’s easy as shit killing a player from behind with a riot shield, not only does the shield move but there legs are always open to get blasted. Just aim down
    [removed]
> if the speed is nerfed the play style is no longer viable.


Yeah, let's take all variety out of the game. Don't use a semtex, termite, stun, flash, claymore, prox mine, rpg or movement to counter it.
[deleted]
    Aye do you man, I hope I never come across you in the game
[removed]
    I can't just slide cancel and bunny hop my way to victory?! Man this game sucks. They need to bring back exploits and get rid of the critical thinking of how to address an enemy that's only protected from the front while crouching. /s
        Considering this game is just get on and shoot a gun casually I don't see why anyone would want to sit and change a class just to counter one specific player in that game... Also this is about back protection not using the actual riot shield...
            Semtex, molotov, drill charge, c4, claymore, prox mine, rpg, shoot the legs, run away and use moment tactics, stun or flash grenade and shoot their sides. Any of that is viable and I'm sure if you're creative you can come up with more ways to kill a shield guy. Also from behind you can shoot them in the legs/ass. The shield sits at an angle, not straight up and down. I think people are just salty because there's something they can't just pew pew with an SMG and slide cancel/stim their way to victory. It's not hard to counter, at all. People just like to complain, I guess.
But my point blank camo challenges :(
Yes, this. Having half the field run and gunning with snipers is annoying as hell.
I think the big issue is the amount of people that are running them on their back now after the Vanguard glitch that made it really hard to kill them from behind
Because you don’t have to make a sacrifice to run overkill in this game unlike in past games you can run overkill and scav thanks to the perk system where as before you’d have to choose scav or overkill, and who’s going to take overkill over a more beneficial perk
    Overkill is usually in the same perk slot as Ghost too.
    This, you basically don’t trade anything good to be able to play with overkill, people should complain more about the current perk system breaking the balance of the game instead.
It’s always been an issue
it's only been part of the game for like thirteen years, you gotta excuse people for wanting these new-fangled mechanics out of the game.
People have hated it since the original MW2. Where on Earth have you been?
They get mad because of the kamikaze reverse boosting/knife camo challenge players.
I’m pretty sure in MW3 the glass was breakable with enough rounds, so you could only get headshot

Also this discussion has been going on since the start of 2019 at least lol, I’d be shocked if they changed it now
This is exactly right
If they one tap you with a cracked out marksmen build, good luck practicing good aim lmao.
Damn munitions box and restock are crazy you should run them. Imagine having to think when you turn on the game 🤯

H-how can I run those when all my classes need fast hands and dead silence no matter what's happening in the lobby 😡
    Yeah lemme be forced to run that garbage just to hopefully kill a shield user. Thats called centralizing.
    Oh no! I had to use my equipment on an enemy! You know, the thing it was literally made for!
Totally agree it can't be anywhere else with the current progressive perk system. I mainly mean, it's just another reason why this new perk system is trash.
Honestly, I fucking hate them. My brain sometimes go full regard when I see them. *However*, I do like that they change the pace of play. It makes the game interesting, because now I have to get out of my comfort zone to take them on. So I guess it'd be better to say I hate getting *outplayed* by them.
Reading these comments is unreal. People are actually this dumb and think it is a good feature. No wonder gaming is fucked when the average IQ is below 50.
    Granted its a cod subreddit, but honestly this site used to have more intelligent users. Doubt itll ever get fixed because people that use crutches always get defensive when people call it broken. Because if it’s broken then their epic killstreaks weren’t as skillful as they thought
What if... There was a way to shoot them from the front while the shield was on their back?
    They're running away after killing my squadmate, I can shoot at their feet but the damage debuff from doing so would just get hitmarkers.  They escape yet again.
yeah and if you can't outplay the shielder before they kill you you've been outplayed yourself.
    Used my thermite on a flank point and a shield appears.  Oh no, it appears I've been outplayed because the one tool used to kill them was used for more important things.  I don't use lethals and tacticals on shields exclusively you know.  

I also don't like devolving an FPS into a game of rock paper scissors.
I-mean push come to shove this isn’t too bad. After all the riot shield user does die too so its a little cathartic even if its just a trade.
Pineapple pizza is good. Fight me
    It's high tier. Pineapple, bit of chicken, jalapeños. That's a regular for me if I'm having trouble deciding.
pineapl3pizza ?
I agree completely. I personally think snipers shouldn't be able to quickscope. They are meant to be hard hitting area denial. Not fast af weapons meant to be used like an ar
They are going to suggest you have resupply and munitions box next.  They are basically suggesting you build your entire class around possibly meeting a shield user.
    yeah it’s beyond stupid
Just crouch and shoot their exposed ass. Lol.
Show me a clip where someone is quick scoping everybody with a sniper
    Hence why COD is an arcade shooter. Instead of complaining on reddit go play and get better.
Hmm. I’ve heard many people make pro realism arguments when discussing things like sun glare, fast TTK, bullet drop, red dots on minimap, etc. It would be nice if IW picked whether or not they want to go for more of a realism approach rather than mixing and matching. I think the game would benefit from not having riot shields in the game.
Well fifty percent of the time it works every time then
Drill charge is much more fun, they think they are free, then they hear the drilling start
    As someone who just leveled my knife with the riot shield, this is it. I always think I'm clear then the whirring sound of death gets me.
        And you can’t escape the incoming death lmao. I’d like to try getting stuck on HC then running into the enemy team
            Back when MW2 originally released my buddies and i had some dirty dirty tactics with this and tubes. Need a few kills quick at the end of the match? Wait till the other team is grouped up, get your riot shield class ready with flack jacket and last stand. Run at the opposing team and have your buddy stick a simtex to your back, grenades and tubes no longer 1 shot you and all of a sudden you just detonate in the middle. But wait theres more! If you have last stand you drop a grenade at your feet and anyone left that runs up gets the second kaboom.
                Lol
                That is the most evil non Hitler thing I've heard in awhile.
                Sadist.
                This is so well thought out, I love it. If you killed me like this I'd honestly laugh.
                Martyrdom dropped the nade. Last stand downs you with a pistol. Man never touched a cod in his life.
                    Wow he mixed up the name of a perk from 13 years ago, you sure did show him lmfao
                        Back in the day you could throw a grenade in last stand if you were holding it whan you went down.[this wiki is a good source to back me up](https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Last_Stand#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20if%20a%20player,double%2Dtapping%20the%20action%20button.)
    It's like a slow middle finger to riot shielders. Rubbing it in their faces in a way lmao
    Drill charges never work for me. If they are smart enough to sprint while it's deploying, you won't even get a hit marker on them.
I just had a round where I stuck the one enemy riot shielder at least a dozen times. There are illegal drugs that don’t feel as good as that.
A lot of the time people who stick me with a Semtex don't realize when I run at them we both die.
i recently got platinum for the riot shield.  i now have symtex PTSD. i swear EVERYONE has them equipped when im using the riot shield 😂
Wait… do you only use one load out slot? Think you are just butt hurt then. Riot shields are easy to counter. You can literally switch out whatever tactical you have for a stun and kill them easily.
Molitov cocktail beats shield, Have you not played rock paper scissors molitov shield?
Sweet Jesus, that drill charge got him good
    I’ve gotten so toxic with the drill charge, almost every time I throw it I stick someone in the head and their death comms are always so satisfying
        The drill charge is basically a troll device at this point. Teammate hogging the tank at spawn? Drill charge.
            You’re not wrong, I was playing DMZ and went against a couple of kids camping my teammates body so what did I use to flush them out? You guessed it, drill charges
        Drill charges are one taps if it hits a person directly as the drill will be what kills not the charge that gets implanted in them but that charge would most definitely ensure they're not getting back up.
            Realistically the charge won't even touch them, it'll blow up everything behind them once the drill finishes boring a perfect hole through their mangled body
        The coms when I get back into tank after a teammate try’s to kick me out with a drill charge is even more satisfying lol
    But it left him open to death by pistol.


EDIT: but that was kinda cool to see a fountain of blood.
        I agree it's beautiful. I have never seen that before and i use drill charges for that as well
            It's likely cuz I drop my shield to pull out a pistol.  So instead of the drill charge burrowing into my shield, it's burrowing into my chest instead.  Lol.
                True. But i am also already looking for a next target so i can't really enjoy the death animation.
    Brings back the Turok 2 memories.
        I’m not the only one that remembers the cerebral bore gun?

I miss the dead body rag dolls too.  Spent so much time just blowing up dead bodies
            It’s honestly one of the greatest fps guns of all time. 10 year old me was blown away by all of that pixilated monster gore.
        I miss the cerebral bore!
Had one of these for the final kill and everyone geeked
Just gotta make sure you hit the operator and not the shield. 

Last night I was running drill charges and had a match with 3 people on the other team using riot shields. Normally, a thermite stuck to a shield would kill that operator. But for some reason last night, every drill charge I stuck to the shield expelled the explosion behind the operator leaving them alive and able to beat me down.

Drill charges should absolutely chunk the user behind a shield but for some reason don't unless you stick it to the user themself.
    I ran into a shield guy last night and stuck his shield with a drill charge. He switched to his secondary and killed me. He didn't die. When he switched weapons and the shield went to his back the drill charge fell off so I had to switch to thermite for the remainder of the game.
    The patch raised the amount of successful sticks for drill charges I think.  And I'm the shield guy in that video.  But as you can see, I was still able to get the kill even if the drill charge takes me out.


I'd be in a severely weakened state.  So followup shots are a must.  And keeping a large spread between teammates as wolves usually do when hunting helps expose vulnerable angles on the shield.
Drill Charges are thrown in this game as if every operator was Aroldis Chapman slinging 105mph heaters, I swear. 

Half the reason I love using the drill charge is that it's so easy to aim because it is SCHMOOVIN' once you release it and the animation to throw is quick too.
    You think so? I find the throwing animation slow enough to get me killed fairly often. Once it's out of your hands though that baby is flying XD
        I've been COD timing'd by the drill charge more than anything else. I swear the moment I crack it the enemies get a big "peek now!!!" notification
            Same honestly
    That's one thing I noticed, you can absolutely chuck a drill charge like crazy.
        *y e e t*
            Quite literally
    You can even stick it to VTOL from ground level...
    Agreed. I feel like the drill charge replaced the termite with the SCHMOOVIN' velocity. I just die trying to throw thermite most times now as the windup takes ages.
you have a perk for throwing faster
I jump away as soon as the throwing animation starts. I can usually dodge even fast hands this way. Love fighting against shield hunters.
You mean actually playing the game is FUN and that the shields give you a challenge to overcome in a rock paper scissors way?!
    No, this game is only fun if everyone only uses MP5s
    Exactly. Played a match where like 4/6 opponents were using shields and I thought it was funny (and fun) as shit.
    I actually love the shield guys in DMZ, it at least requires some coordination with your team mates. Like someone grabs his attention and the other guys flank him.
        Dmz are worse than humans bc they reach around shield with sniper accuracy machine pistols
            Yea but they are the only challenging NPC enemy. Even helicopters are a joke. You either kill them all before it lands or drop one grenade just before it lands and you are golden.
                Nobody is complaining about NPC's🤦‍♂️
    The high I get seeing 3 people scramble to kill me and then run after I kill 2 with throwing knives is priceless.
When I was doing gold shield I throwing knifed anyone who wasn’t cooperating
    is there tricks to aiming? i always seem to just throw em at the wall behind em.
    Hehehehe! Ikr! I got it poly, imagine how people hates me.
Bro fist for the "dedicated shield warriors" lol 

You run tear gas or flash bang as your tac?
you shouldnt be downvoted, jumping a bit to the side past them and shooting them from up above works really well, also with other guns than shotguns. for me at least, and i am not a very good player
    I got the idea from this sub so I figured it was common knowledge. I’m also not very good at the game. 

Dammit. I was saving my karma to buy a bundle too.
I swear 90% of the people on the internet are functional illiterate
    It's hilarious seeing basically the entire comment section being like "Ummmm, excuuuuse me, you can counter them by throwing semtex at them". Like yeah, that wasn't the complaint you idiot, it's about the people roleplaying as turtles to make themselves invulnerable from behind unless you aim at their legs where the damage multiplier is shit for most guns and makes them take more shots to kill. Honestly I blame the shit tier balancing for the perks.  Battle hardened does basically nothing against flash grenades, double time is a meme unless you're trying to knife people with how tactical sprint makes you sound like a rhino running, strong arm is too niche, scavenger is useless if you're running meta like everyone else is, tracker is also a joke given how loud your footsteps are, and extra tactical is just used so that you can farm weapon xp with decoy grenades. The only perks worth a damn are bomb squad and overkill.
Once I know there is a riot shield in play I save my drill charges for him.
    If they have bomb squad they can tank the drill charges

Edit: not anymore I’m told
        Not anymore. Patchnotes says they are 100% to die if they got stuck by a drill no matter what.
            [deleted]
                My highest kills in this game are with the shield you are right it’s not fully patched, sometimes drill charges kill me sometimes they don’t
            I hit a shielder like 3 times in a game with a drill charge yesterday and they didn't die.
        They just patched this
            Last night I swear I stuck a shield guy with a drill charge and he survived.  I was questioning whether Bomb Squad would save them or not.  Not sure they patched this completely
        Threw a drill charge today at one, drilled through the shield, exploded, and did zero damage. However it did lower their teammates health who charged in with riot shield #2 to get melee’d. Should have been a double kill but neither dies off the explosion unfortunately
            Yeah I’m just gonna keep rocking semtex, it’s a guaranteed kill if you stick it on the shield. The reason drill doesn’t kill is because it spits the nade behind them and if they’re coming forward they’re far enough away from it. When you stick a person with it the drilling is what kills them lmao.
                Yea i immediately switched back to semtex after it myself lol
Using resupply and/or by making sure I have at least one left incase of the riot shield. I'll regularly throw all my lethals though if I have teammates, especially the friends I'm playing with nearby.
    And when you run into 2 or 3 or 4 or...
        Easy, you can leave the game at any time
            "but my win/loss ratio :("
Resupply perk is a god send.
Scavenger does not recharge lethals but Resupply does recharge them every 25 seconds and lets you carry 2, once Resupply activates. Resupply is in the 3rd perk slot, if you are making a custom perk set.
Strong arm is awesome.

(I have bad aim)
    I love strong arm for lobbing C4’s haha
Those are the 3 perks I mostly use. I only use Overkill on my Ground War sniper class, and Battle Hardened on my objective game mode class.
[deleted]
    Hey that's solid advice. Don't wanna calibrate my muscle memory to a setting that I will change. If only I could separate the arc from the throwing distance, but I guess I'll learn to do without either.

Didn't know that about Semtex, I guess relying on the arc has meant I haven't noticed that I have to increase the throwing angle? Cheers either way m8
The problem for me is the perk system, overkill has to be one of the first perk because of how they work but most of those perk are not really good compared to some of the second / third perk so having overkill doesn’t really make you trade off something else that is actually good. Like… even without shield I run overkill on most of my class because it’s probably the best perk in this category.

And I guess the shield on your back should at least let people shoot you in the head
    They should just exclude the riot shield from being used with Overkill. Or make Overkill block the ultimate perk or something to add a downside
        OK wouldn't work as ultimate as then what would your loadout be until you unlock it seeing as its not a base perk?

That's the issue 1) with OK being moved in *any* other slot and 2) an issue with the perk package in general
            No I’m saying that if you use Overkill, you are sacrificing your Ultimate perk. So for example, you’d have Scavenger, Overkill, and Fast Hands, but you’d never be able to select an ultimate perk.

It could also take up both base perk slots, but honestly it’s so OP that it should block the ultimate slot.

COD 4 did this sort of. If you had a noob tube on your gun, you couldn’t get your first perk. 

I’m also of the opinion that Riot Shields don’t belong in call of duty, so maybe my opinion isn’t the best on this topic.
        In objective game mode the shield can be actually useful especially with communication while running overkill to have another gun when not on the objective, I use it sometime in HQ/HP with another gun, I switch to the shield in situation where I need it and I actually don’t even use it for the back protection.

It would be dumb to remove this option from the game imo.

In old cod the shield protected your back and nobody was complaining tbh, it was fine and it’s still fine imo. My only problem is that you don’t have any tradeoff on overkill, it’s OP as fuck even if you play something like 2 smgs.
            I’ve been complaining ever since they allowed you to run a riot shield with Overkill. Riot shields should just be removed from the game.
                I think they just shouldn't be added to the game in the first place.
I disagree, I got gold on X12s and Basilisk without a shield on my back and didn’t have a bad time at all. When we’re talking about getting shot in the back it doesn’t really matter what gun you’re using
    Fair
        Reasonable, respecting, level-headed discussion? In MY CoD subreddit? Unacceptable! I demand a witless slinging of insults at once!
            Alright, fine.

Fuck you, cheese-monger.
    Same for me. I’m currently working on my deagle to get gold. Then I’ll go back to the G18/X13 Auto’s
    While I agree, when grinding my secondaries I don’t touch my primary so equipping the riot shield seems to be the most logical since I get protection/I’m not using that slot anyway. They should just give shields health so their effectiveness drops as they’re shot.
Pistols are viable but only in certain situations. There are times where I’ve beaten an SMG and an assault rifle with my X12. It’s a challenge for sure and I got lucky, but they are usable

Most of my kills are with them not facing me though lol
The P890, X12 with stock, and the Basilisk are all fantastic. If you need a shield on your back thats on you.
    X13 is fantastic
Ive golded three pistols without touching the shield before tier 1 even dropped. Pistols are insanely viable and if you're running the the Deagle or the Revolver you're basically running a primary with how effective they can at one taps.
Nah dont use a riot shield
Akimbo pistols actually suck.... The damage is nerfed on both of the pistols when akimbo
    That may be the case but they are most certainly not bad
    The basilisk with snakeshot and the P890 aren't bad. Akimbo deagles seem like they're intentionally made useless
Akimbo pistols are pretty bad, and certainly not busted. Like the X13's hipfire cone is so enormous you cant kill anyone at unless youre at point blank distance. X12 akimbo was the only one i had any real success with. Deagle is awful akimbo
    Akimbo deagle is only practical if you land both shots, it's the worst pistol to run akimbo aside from the basilisk without snakeshot. All the other pistols are at least minimally viable for close to close-medium engagements. Some of my best games have been running pistols both with and without akimbo
They could have akimbo disabled if using a shield.
I believe in mw3 survival the shield could be broken
I think I had at least 1 not kill after the patch, because it was in Tier 1. I aimed it directly at the shield and threw it, and he didn't side step or anything, and I turned to sprint around a corner, so it is possible it may not have stuck, since I've 'missed' shots with enemies centered in my crosshairs, but it *should* have stuck the dude and killed them, but they did not die.
    It's still buggy, it's happening many times where I've thrown the drill chargers directly on riot shield people in Tier1 with no kill.
        Yeah I’ve thrown them, gotten the “STUCK” pop up, and no kill 🤷🏻‍♂️
    Had this exact experience and I was trying out the shield for the for the first time, when I got stuck with the drill charge I switched to my pistol and barely survived the blast. But I did survive and it was tier 1

Also it was on the hydroelectric map, just in case it was actually me and you that had the interaction
        Nah, mine was Farm 18 in this specific instance, but weird that you can survive it in Tier 1
Definitely not working still.
I’ve definitely stuck a shield and didn’t get the kill since said update. Not saying every single time, but I think there’s still some bugs.
I can assure you it doesn’t 

Stuck 3 separate riot shields last night with drill charge and it never killed the user
This is the right reason. If they run, the grenade is behind them. If they stand still or crouch walk it will kill them. The reason people get hit markers is the shield maiden is smart enough to run forward.
It does, I always think you can throw it further than the drill charge as well.
Couldn't get a kill last time I tried but I'll give it another go.
    It was a suggestion rather than a fact I think.
If you do that you might as well remove shields from the game. Everyone in the lobby would switch to AP the second they see your shield.

Classic Reddit. Seems to be even worse in CoD subs, where in comments you can usually find in-topic replies with approximate ratio of 1:50 😊
    Because most posters are literally children and teenagers
        Yeah, it never ceases to baffle me how young the 18 year old people sound nowadays

    They're bragging about how amazing they are for throwing a grenade at it. Prime MLG players here
With overkill tho it's like having insane protection at no cost. Especially if you run a high capacity mag.
Just because they are still killable doesnt mean they should have a protection like that for basically free. Most primary perks in this game arent really that good so running Overkill instead of something else is not a penalty at all. So there is basically no reason to not use a shield on your back, no matter what kind of playstyle you want to have or what gun you want to use.
If they’re running their legs are going in and out behind the shield man.
    If you can't hit moving target let em go.
Alright, I’ll use my sniper and try to hit an ankle twice (because it would likely be a hit marker first)…. Or they could just stop adding this crutch mechanic in the game
    Oh no you might have to put effort beyond point and click.
        Lol we’re talking about a weapon that literally requires zero effort to benefit from. What a dumb point to try to make. There’s no legitimate argument for why riot shields should work on your back the way they do but all of the losers who can’t handle getting shot in the back keep defending it. If you’re getting shot in the back enough that you *need* a riot shield to protect you, you’re not moving around the map in a smart way
            And if you can't kill someone from behind with a two shot gun then you also have issues. Worst case you get an assist and still block their play.


Shields come at a cost. They're real easy to shot around and there's more lethal than ever that deal with them. People are just complaining because it isn't THEIR play style and want it easier.
                >	Shields come at a cost.

None of your points are “costs” unique to riot shields. You know who’s easier to shoot than someone with a shield? Someone without one. You know who else deals with lethals? Everyone. Riot shields are a crutch for bad players, nothing else to it.
                    They are useful for low skill, ie the majority of players. They're also harder to use effectively other than passively.


There's an argument for all weapons being low skill if you don't use them. OHK especially without slow ADS feels OP, holding the trigger to spray rather than aim feels OP. Shooting explosives at the floor near people for kills feels OP. Until you use it and try to utilise it, it all feels OP.

Aye do you man, I hope I never come across you in the game
I can't just slide cancel and bunny hop my way to victory?! Man this game sucks. They need to bring back exploits and get rid of the critical thinking of how to address an enemy that's only protected from the front while crouching. /s
    Considering this game is just get on and shoot a gun casually I don't see why anyone would want to sit and change a class just to counter one specific player in that game... Also this is about back protection not using the actual riot shield...
        Semtex, molotov, drill charge, c4, claymore, prox mine, rpg, shoot the legs, run away and use moment tactics, stun or flash grenade and shoot their sides. Any of that is viable and I'm sure if you're creative you can come up with more ways to kill a shield guy. Also from behind you can shoot them in the legs/ass. The shield sits at an angle, not straight up and down. I think people are just salty because there's something they can't just pew pew with an SMG and slide cancel/stim their way to victory. It's not hard to counter, at all. People just like to complain, I guess.
Overkill is usually in the same perk slot as Ghost too.
This, you basically don’t trade anything good to be able to play with overkill, people should complain more about the current perk system breaking the balance of the game instead.
Yeah lemme be forced to run that garbage just to hopefully kill a shield user. Thats called centralizing.
Oh no! I had to use my equipment on an enemy! You know, the thing it was literally made for!
Granted its a cod subreddit, but honestly this site used to have more intelligent users. Doubt itll ever get fixed because people that use crutches always get defensive when people call it broken. Because if it’s broken then their epic killstreaks weren’t as skillful as they thought
They're running away after killing my squadmate, I can shoot at their feet but the damage debuff from doing so would just get hitmarkers.  They escape yet again.
Used my thermite on a flank point and a shield appears.  Oh no, it appears I've been outplayed because the one tool used to kill them was used for more important things.  I don't use lethals and tacticals on shields exclusively you know.  

I also don't like devolving an FPS into a game of rock paper scissors.
It's high tier. Pineapple, bit of chicken, jalapeños. That's a regular for me if I'm having trouble deciding.
yeah it’s beyond stupid
Hence why COD is an arcade shooter. Instead of complaining on reddit go play and get better.
As someone who just leveled my knife with the riot shield, this is it. I always think I'm clear then the whirring sound of death gets me.
    And you can’t escape the incoming death lmao. I’d like to try getting stuck on HC then running into the enemy team
        Back when MW2 originally released my buddies and i had some dirty dirty tactics with this and tubes. Need a few kills quick at the end of the match? Wait till the other team is grouped up, get your riot shield class ready with flack jacket and last stand. Run at the opposing team and have your buddy stick a simtex to your back, grenades and tubes no longer 1 shot you and all of a sudden you just detonate in the middle. But wait theres more! If you have last stand you drop a grenade at your feet and anyone left that runs up gets the second kaboom.
            Lol
            That is the most evil non Hitler thing I've heard in awhile.
            Sadist.
            This is so well thought out, I love it. If you killed me like this I'd honestly laugh.
            Martyrdom dropped the nade. Last stand downs you with a pistol. Man never touched a cod in his life.
                Wow he mixed up the name of a perk from 13 years ago, you sure did show him lmfao
                    Back in the day you could throw a grenade in last stand if you were holding it whan you went down.[this wiki is a good source to back me up](https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Last_Stand#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20if%20a%20player,double%2Dtapping%20the%20action%20button.)
It's like a slow middle finger to riot shielders. Rubbing it in their faces in a way lmao
Drill charges never work for me. If they are smart enough to sprint while it's deploying, you won't even get a hit marker on them.
I’ve gotten so toxic with the drill charge, almost every time I throw it I stick someone in the head and their death comms are always so satisfying
    The drill charge is basically a troll device at this point. Teammate hogging the tank at spawn? Drill charge.
        You’re not wrong, I was playing DMZ and went against a couple of kids camping my teammates body so what did I use to flush them out? You guessed it, drill charges
    Drill charges are one taps if it hits a person directly as the drill will be what kills not the charge that gets implanted in them but that charge would most definitely ensure they're not getting back up.
        Realistically the charge won't even touch them, it'll blow up everything behind them once the drill finishes boring a perfect hole through their mangled body
    The coms when I get back into tank after a teammate try’s to kick me out with a drill charge is even more satisfying lol
But it left him open to death by pistol.


EDIT: but that was kinda cool to see a fountain of blood.
    I agree it's beautiful. I have never seen that before and i use drill charges for that as well
        It's likely cuz I drop my shield to pull out a pistol.  So instead of the drill charge burrowing into my shield, it's burrowing into my chest instead.  Lol.
            True. But i am also already looking for a next target so i can't really enjoy the death animation.
Brings back the Turok 2 memories.
    I’m not the only one that remembers the cerebral bore gun?

I miss the dead body rag dolls too.  Spent so much time just blowing up dead bodies
        It’s honestly one of the greatest fps guns of all time. 10 year old me was blown away by all of that pixilated monster gore.
    I miss the cerebral bore!
I ran into a shield guy last night and stuck his shield with a drill charge. He switched to his secondary and killed me. He didn't die. When he switched weapons and the shield went to his back the drill charge fell off so I had to switch to thermite for the remainder of the game.
The patch raised the amount of successful sticks for drill charges I think.  And I'm the shield guy in that video.  But as you can see, I was still able to get the kill even if the drill charge takes me out.


I'd be in a severely weakened state.  So followup shots are a must.  And keeping a large spread between teammates as wolves usually do when hunting helps expose vulnerable angles on the shield.
You think so? I find the throwing animation slow enough to get me killed fairly often. Once it's out of your hands though that baby is flying XD
    I've been COD timing'd by the drill charge more than anything else. I swear the moment I crack it the enemies get a big "peek now!!!" notification
        Same honestly
That's one thing I noticed, you can absolutely chuck a drill charge like crazy.
    *y e e t*
        Quite literally
You can even stick it to VTOL from ground level...
Agreed. I feel like the drill charge replaced the termite with the SCHMOOVIN' velocity. I just die trying to throw thermite most times now as the windup takes ages.
No, this game is only fun if everyone only uses MP5s
Exactly. Played a match where like 4/6 opponents were using shields and I thought it was funny (and fun) as shit.
I actually love the shield guys in DMZ, it at least requires some coordination with your team mates. Like someone grabs his attention and the other guys flank him.
    Dmz are worse than humans bc they reach around shield with sniper accuracy machine pistols
        Yea but they are the only challenging NPC enemy. Even helicopters are a joke. You either kill them all before it lands or drop one grenade just before it lands and you are golden.
            Nobody is complaining about NPC's🤦‍♂️
The high I get seeing 3 people scramble to kill me and then run after I kill 2 with throwing knives is priceless.
is there tricks to aiming? i always seem to just throw em at the wall behind em.
Hehehehe! Ikr! I got it poly, imagine how people hates me.
I got the idea from this sub so I figured it was common knowledge. I’m also not very good at the game. 

Dammit. I was saving my karma to buy a bundle too.
It's hilarious seeing basically the entire comment section being like "Ummmm, excuuuuse me, you can counter them by throwing semtex at them". Like yeah, that wasn't the complaint you idiot, it's about the people roleplaying as turtles to make themselves invulnerable from behind unless you aim at their legs where the damage multiplier is shit for most guns and makes them take more shots to kill. Honestly I blame the shit tier balancing for the perks.  Battle hardened does basically nothing against flash grenades, double time is a meme unless you're trying to knife people with how tactical sprint makes you sound like a rhino running, strong arm is too niche, scavenger is useless if you're running meta like everyone else is, tracker is also a joke given how loud your footsteps are, and extra tactical is just used so that you can farm weapon xp with decoy grenades. The only perks worth a damn are bomb squad and overkill.
If they have bomb squad they can tank the drill charges

Edit: not anymore I’m told
    Not anymore. Patchnotes says they are 100% to die if they got stuck by a drill no matter what.
        [deleted]
            My highest kills in this game are with the shield you are right it’s not fully patched, sometimes drill charges kill me sometimes they don’t
        I hit a shielder like 3 times in a game with a drill charge yesterday and they didn't die.
    They just patched this
        Last night I swear I stuck a shield guy with a drill charge and he survived.  I was questioning whether Bomb Squad would save them or not.  Not sure they patched this completely
    Threw a drill charge today at one, drilled through the shield, exploded, and did zero damage. However it did lower their teammates health who charged in with riot shield #2 to get melee’d. Should have been a double kill but neither dies off the explosion unfortunately
        Yeah I’m just gonna keep rocking semtex, it’s a guaranteed kill if you stick it on the shield. The reason drill doesn’t kill is because it spits the nade behind them and if they’re coming forward they’re far enough away from it. When you stick a person with it the drilling is what kills them lmao.
            Yea i immediately switched back to semtex after it myself lol
And when you run into 2 or 3 or 4 or...
    Easy, you can leave the game at any time
        "but my win/loss ratio :("
I love strong arm for lobbing C4’s haha
Hey that's solid advice. Don't wanna calibrate my muscle memory to a setting that I will change. If only I could separate the arc from the throwing distance, but I guess I'll learn to do without either.

Didn't know that about Semtex, I guess relying on the arc has meant I haven't noticed that I have to increase the throwing angle? Cheers either way m8
They should just exclude the riot shield from being used with Overkill. Or make Overkill block the ultimate perk or something to add a downside
    OK wouldn't work as ultimate as then what would your loadout be until you unlock it seeing as its not a base perk?

That's the issue 1) with OK being moved in *any* other slot and 2) an issue with the perk package in general
        No I’m saying that if you use Overkill, you are sacrificing your Ultimate perk. So for example, you’d have Scavenger, Overkill, and Fast Hands, but you’d never be able to select an ultimate perk.

It could also take up both base perk slots, but honestly it’s so OP that it should block the ultimate slot.

COD 4 did this sort of. If you had a noob tube on your gun, you couldn’t get your first perk. 

I’m also of the opinion that Riot Shields don’t belong in call of duty, so maybe my opinion isn’t the best on this topic.
    In objective game mode the shield can be actually useful especially with communication while running overkill to have another gun when not on the objective, I use it sometime in HQ/HP with another gun, I switch to the shield in situation where I need it and I actually don’t even use it for the back protection.

It would be dumb to remove this option from the game imo.

In old cod the shield protected your back and nobody was complaining tbh, it was fine and it’s still fine imo. My only problem is that you don’t have any tradeoff on overkill, it’s OP as fuck even if you play something like 2 smgs.
        I’ve been complaining ever since they allowed you to run a riot shield with Overkill. Riot shields should just be removed from the game.
            I think they just shouldn't be added to the game in the first place.
Fair
    Reasonable, respecting, level-headed discussion? In MY CoD subreddit? Unacceptable! I demand a witless slinging of insults at once!
        Alright, fine.

Fuck you, cheese-monger.
Same for me. I’m currently working on my deagle to get gold. Then I’ll go back to the G18/X13 Auto’s
While I agree, when grinding my secondaries I don’t touch my primary so equipping the riot shield seems to be the most logical since I get protection/I’m not using that slot anyway. They should just give shields health so their effectiveness drops as they’re shot.
X13 is fantastic
That may be the case but they are most certainly not bad
The basilisk with snakeshot and the P890 aren't bad. Akimbo deagles seem like they're intentionally made useless
Akimbo deagle is only practical if you land both shots, it's the worst pistol to run akimbo aside from the basilisk without snakeshot. All the other pistols are at least minimally viable for close to close-medium engagements. Some of my best games have been running pistols both with and without akimbo
It's still buggy, it's happening many times where I've thrown the drill chargers directly on riot shield people in Tier1 with no kill.
    Yeah I’ve thrown them, gotten the “STUCK” pop up, and no kill 🤷🏻‍♂️
Had this exact experience and I was trying out the shield for the for the first time, when I got stuck with the drill charge I switched to my pistol and barely survived the blast. But I did survive and it was tier 1

Also it was on the hydroelectric map, just in case it was actually me and you that had the interaction
    Nah, mine was Farm 18 in this specific instance, but weird that you can survive it in Tier 1
It was a suggestion rather than a fact I think.
Because most posters are literally children and teenagers
    Yeah, it never ceases to baffle me how young the 18 year old people sound nowadays
They're bragging about how amazing they are for throwing a grenade at it. Prime MLG players here
If you can't hit moving target let em go.
Oh no you might have to put effort beyond point and click.

You’re not wrong, I was playing DMZ and went against a couple of kids camping my teammates body so what did I use to flush them out? You guessed it, drill charges
Realistically the charge won't even touch them, it'll blow up everything behind them once the drill finishes boring a perfect hole through their mangled body
It's likely cuz I drop my shield to pull out a pistol.  So instead of the drill charge burrowing into my shield, it's burrowing into my chest instead.  Lol.
    True. But i am also already looking for a next target so i can't really enjoy the death animation.
It’s honestly one of the greatest fps guns of all time. 10 year old me was blown away by all of that pixilated monster gore.
Same honestly
Quite literally
Yea but they are the only challenging NPC enemy. Even helicopters are a joke. You either kill them all before it lands or drop one grenade just before it lands and you are golden.
    Nobody is complaining about NPC's🤦‍♂️

    My highest kills in this game are with the shield you are right it’s not fully patched, sometimes drill charges kill me sometimes they don’t
I hit a shielder like 3 times in a game with a drill charge yesterday and they didn't die.
Last night I swear I stuck a shield guy with a drill charge and he survived.  I was questioning whether Bomb Squad would save them or not.  Not sure they patched this completely
Yeah I’m just gonna keep rocking semtex, it’s a guaranteed kill if you stick it on the shield. The reason drill doesn’t kill is because it spits the nade behind them and if they’re coming forward they’re far enough away from it. When you stick a person with it the drilling is what kills them lmao.
    Yea i immediately switched back to semtex after it myself lol
"but my win/loss ratio :("
No I’m saying that if you use Overkill, you are sacrificing your Ultimate perk. So for example, you’d have Scavenger, Overkill, and Fast Hands, but you’d never be able to select an ultimate perk.

It could also take up both base perk slots, but honestly it’s so OP that it should block the ultimate slot.

COD 4 did this sort of. If you had a noob tube on your gun, you couldn’t get your first perk. 

I’m also of the opinion that Riot Shields don’t belong in call of duty, so maybe my opinion isn’t the best on this topic.
I’ve been complaining ever since they allowed you to run a riot shield with Overkill. Riot shields should just be removed from the game.
    I think they just shouldn't be added to the game in the first place.
Alright, fine.

Fuck you, cheese-monger.
And if you can't kill someone from behind with a two shot gun then you also have issues. Worst case you get an assist and still block their play.


Shields come at a cost. They're real easy to shot around and there's more lethal than ever that deal with them. People are just complaining because it isn't THEIR play style and want it easier.
    >	Shields come at a cost.

None of your points are “costs” unique to riot shields. You know who’s easier to shoot than someone with a shield? Someone without one. You know who else deals with lethals? Everyone. Riot shields are a crutch for bad players, nothing else to it.
        They are useful for low skill, ie the majority of players. They're also harder to use effectively other than passively.


There's an argument for all weapons being low skill if you don't use them. OHK especially without slow ADS feels OP, holding the trigger to spray rather than aim feels OP. Shooting explosives at the floor near people for kills feels OP. Until you use it and try to utilise it, it all feels OP.
Lol
That is the most evil non Hitler thing I've heard in awhile.
Sadist.
This is so well thought out, I love it. If you killed me like this I'd honestly laugh.
Martyrdom dropped the nade. Last stand downs you with a pistol. Man never touched a cod in his life.
