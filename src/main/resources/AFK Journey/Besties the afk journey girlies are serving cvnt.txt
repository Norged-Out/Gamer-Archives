[[Besties the afk journey girlies are serving cvnt]]





Are they? Are they really bestie?
    The only one serving cunt is temoo in drag here
        Girl..... no, they are serving "go girl give us nothing"
Some of them are definitely not getting any tips because it's boring ![img](emote|t5_23w084|32658)
    The only bad on is 5. The rest are okay, but certainly not *okay*
        Idk they are all with the same shape and the same tits, serving ozempic brunch girlies with no spice no color nothing.

Even okay seems very lazy especially for newer mobile gacha.

If anything the only cunt they are serving is like cuntraceptive
            It’s funny you say that because Reddit commenters keep saying how they’re tired of asymmetric outfits  with flashy colors for characters in Honkai Star Rail and Genshin Impact. I totally disagree with them though. This post is case in point.
        Is the 5th one the new rate up girlie? Cause if so she can transform from victorian housewife to female comic superhero designed by a straight American man and that's kinda cvnting
I mean most of these girlies have been around for years since AFK Arena ![img](emote|t5_23w084|30702)
    They look better in afk arena imo, that artstyle lends more to them
        mirael and silvina look so weird in this artstyle
            Silvina looks basic, and Mirael does look off, like Jessica rabbit almost
                I like Silvina tho she's not as edgy but still kinda serving ballet assassin

Either her or thorny Vexana are my fave
Me when my basic ass immediately started simping for Valen 😔
    I need dating to be a feature in the game
        I want him and my Merlin to kiss tenderly and protect each other from monsters 🤭
    Flynn Rydingthatdick doop 😍😍
They're giving! Giving nothing tbh.
you guys will call anything with a pair of legs and a pair of tits cunt or camp

Excuse me you forgot THE biggest Queen in this game
This feels like an ad.
The only ones giving are slide 8 & 5, I'm sorry everyone else looks like a Super Rare from a gatcha pull

Number 6 isn't but the rest slay!@
