[[What was the first Zelda you played Mine was Ocarina of Time]]





The very first Legend of Zelda.
    Gold cartridge.
        Core memory unlocked - gold cartridge Zelda + Nintendo Power fold-out maps.
    OG gold cartridge.  Neighbor‚Äôs mom took us to Toys R Us the day of release.  We were waiting when they opened the store.
        TLoZ here too.  I‚Äôd read every drop of it I could from Nintendo Power, saved up my allowance, and begged my grandma to drive me to Target to get it.  

Then I read the instruction book all weekend until I went home cuz I didn‚Äôt have a NES at my grandma‚Äôs!
    Gold cartridge made it feel special. Prized.
        I still have my gold cartridge. My shiny. My precious
            Lucky you. My mom had it and I remember when she took all her NES games and system and brought them to EB Games to trade in cuz we needed the money. Broke my heart to pieces seeing that gold cartridge in the bucket. üò¢
                Oof, that is rough. Sorry that happened to you  :(
    Same, I didn't play to the end, because I was young and told go outside! My mother did complete the game though.
        Same! I would just play her save and cry when I got caught out in the dark with the bone creatures that spank you üò≠ I‚Äôve since finished it but it‚Äôs my favorite
    Yep. I can still hear that 8-bit music. Spoiler alert: don't play "money making game."
        Just gotta play smart. Once you win once, use the 2nd controller "save" cheat. Makes getting the Blue Ring and a Magic Shield (and Blue Candle) early a breeze.
    I spent a fair percentage of my childhood burning almost every single bush and bombing every single segment of wall in that game. I can still beat it from memory; I used to be able to add "without dying" to that claim, but I'm getting old now and the lynels or darknuts will get me from time to time these days... For good or ill, it changed my life.
        I too am old, but it‚Äôs the wizzrobes for me ü•≤
    I rebought a legit copy of it, made a frame, with plexiglass cover, and have it hanging on my office wall.

My favorite look, and the first one I played.
I just got into the series at the end of 2022, so I started out with botw. I'm playing totk and alttp rn
    I hope you enjoy the older ones as well :)
        Thanks! I'm thinking of starting MM, TP, or OOT next. Any recommendations?
            MM is my all time favorite game in general not just Zelda I highly recommend it. TP and OOT are amazing too you can't go wrong with any of them.
                They should probably start with oot since it kinda comes before mm. It's not necessary since it doesn't even mention anything from oot but I think all the reused assets kinda add something to the game. I think it kinda adds to the fever dream nature of the game. MM is also my favorite game of all time so it's a great thing to play after oot
                I agree. Those are brilliant!
            Honestly you should probably just play all three of those in release order since they kinda tell one really big story. Ocarina, then Majora, then Twilight.
            I would definitely say Majora's Mask as I absolutely loved the vibe and lore of that one- but if you want a definitive experience I would play OoT first as MM ties directly into it afterwards. 

OoT is a lot longer of a game though, so it might take some time vs going straight to MM... I'd still recommend it as OoT is considered a classic and MM kinda works upon the system OoT introduces and then sorta flips it on its head in sorts.
            Twilight princess is my all time favorite Zelda game, and easily top ten maybe top five videogame. The story is so heart wrenching, and beautiful all at the same time. If you can find an hd copy of it for the Wii U (or sail the high seas if you prefer to play on pc) it‚Äôs a really great time
            I would say OoT first then MM since OoT is a more standard 3D Zelda and MM is a little weirder and adds some weird mechanics like the timer. I think I like MM more though
            MM!!! It‚Äôs better than ocarina imo. There *is* time limit mechanism which I normally HATE, but it‚Äôs not implemented in a way that makes the game stressful, so don‚Äôt let that deter you at all. But they‚Äôre all great games.

The only Zelda games I didn‚Äôt enjoy were Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks. The puzzles were way too easy, and there are certain aspects that are extremely repetitive and just a chore to do over and over again. There‚Äôs not even a good story to save either of them.
            Oot, mm, tp in that order, could also do wind waker after the two n64 games
            MM is my favorite Zelda ever, but I don't think you can truly appreciate how wild and cool MM is without playing OoT first, so I recommend that. The first playthrough of OoT is magic.
    How are you playing ALttP? On the switch emulator?

There's a PC port called Zelda 3 by snesrev that I've been playing as of the other day and really digging. You can hot swap your items out of your inventory with L/R which is *game changing* imo, as well as hotkey a specific item. Makes it flow so much more smoothly.

They also had a fan made port which removed the screen transitions and let you zoom out the map more, but of course Nintendo sent them a Ceast & Desist letter within a week or so of release. Wish I had downloaded it beforehand.
    Same!! Also this is like one of chillest fandoms I‚Äôve been in by far. I love the games but the art and stuff that comes out of it is cool too
    I was so ready to chime in with ALttP before I finished reading. I'm glad you found it. Imo that's where the series really found its identity and truly established itself as a major player.

Top 10 game of all time for me.
    botw was my cause of a Zelda hyperfixationüò≠
The first one I played was Twilight Princess, but the first one I watched was Ocarina of Time. I couldn't play because I was too young, so my older sister was playing, and I was watching her while sitting on her lap. That's some very precious childhood memories to me.
    Amazing \^\^  
Treasure these memories, my friend.
        This memory is part of the very first memories I can remember about video games, and I hope to keep them in my mind as long as possible, because they are so precious to me.
    Same exact story with me and my big brother! He was playing Ocarina of Time on either the N64 or the GameCube while I sat nearby and watched, then I grew up a bit and played Twilight Princess myself ü•∞
    Yeah, I remember watch my dad play Ocarina when I was really little, then watching my sister when TP came out, then playing it myself a couple years later
Wind Waker
    Wind Waker gang unite!
        *begins playing Dragon Roost Island theme*
            Hearing that when I played botw‚Ä¶ feeling occurred
A Link to the Past on Super Nintendo. It came out in 1991/92.

It was groundbreaking at the time to have such a deep plot. It changed my perception of games and I‚Äôve been a gamer ever since.
    A Link to the Past was my first game too!! It was my first of many Zelda games and one of the first video games I had ever learned how to play. It's so well done. I did a 100% play through a year or so ago, and it was so satisfying.
    Never heard of it.
        Hilarious, sir. 

Yes, I see your username. Lol.
    It was so goddamn good.  It more than made up for Zelda 2.
    Have you ever played any of the top 3 rom hacks for it? Parallel Worlds, Goddess of Wisdom, and Conker's High Rule Tail are all phenomenal. Especially the msu-1 versions. However Secrets of the Past, Hylian Legacy, Oracle of Secrets, Meadow of Shadows, Lyre Islands, and 18 Hrs past are all great too. There are some others I have yet to play.
    I think this is the first non-Mario game I played and it is still the best Zelda game, and one of the best games ever, for me. I've replayed it so many times.
    I remember when Link to Past came out and many of my cousins were raving about it...and I thought, "What's the big deal.  I like Mario games."  Then years later, I actually played it as my first Zelda game and thought the game was amazing and my cousins were right!
    Mine as well!!
Wind Waker
I remember fiddling with original LoZ as a young kid but the first zelda I ever played all of was ALttP. It's what made me a life long fan.
Link to the past¬†
Zelda II The Adventure of Link
    You're a hardcore gamer to the bone, mate
    Same. Will always hold a special place. The Great Palace theme song is still one of my favs.
Skyward sword
Same actually. Then botw
Botw
The original for the NES
Mine was phantom hour glass but the first I beat was botw
The original (non-DX) Link's Awakening on the GameBoy!
I remember being a little kid and renting the first one at the video store‚Ä¶that gold cartridge! üòç
    Saved up my allowance and waited for a sale at Caldor, had it down to the tax. First game I paid for directly
Zelda II links adventure. I loved!
    That‚Äôs a great game indeed!! Loved it too, back in the days‚Ä¶
    See I love it too. There‚Äôs a fan remaster that‚Äôs pretty sweet and fixes a lot of random stuff. I still find it funny the amount of hate it gets since it‚Äôs not like other games of the series. Yet in its time was praised.
    I went back recently and enjoyed it.  But when it came out I was legit disgusted.
    I've always been a big fan of the weird esoteric sequels to old games like Zelda 2, Castlevania 2, Super Mario 2, etc. They were trying new things and while some of it didn't stick at first I think it was a good call to experiment.
My friend let me play oot on his 3ds. Then, he let me play majoras mask. Then, i got my own 3ds and oot copy.
    Totally worth it!
        Definitely
The Original Legend of Zelda. I‚Äôm a lil‚Äô old though. üòÖ
    Legends don't get old, they become classics.
The Four Swords, but I never got to complete it.
If you count it, Links cross bow training for the Wii that came for free with a copy of CoD world at war for the Wii, if you don‚Äôt count it then it would be twilight princess
Either wind waker or nes zelda
Link's Awakening with the dream island and Wind Fish, such a good game. And so sad.
a link between worlds
Oracle of ages
    Oracle of time for me! But my brother had oracle of ages so we would swap
    The best one to start with. I really hope they do a remake
Links Awakening
Technically either Majora‚Äôs Mask or LOZ 2 but the first one I played through is Twilight Princess (and is my favorite game not just from the franchise but game period)
BOTW
Mine was breath of the wild but after that I played the rest as well, my favorite was majora‚Äôs mask
Ocarina of time. It came in a bundle with a different game that I wanted. If not for that fateful sales promo, I might not have discovered this absolute gem
    Hylia herself brought the franchise to you.
Breath of the wild
The Legend of Zelda.¬† I remember watching the original commercials with the tap dancing dude.
The best one: Ocarina.
OOT. I was probably 7, my brother was 4. We were at a dinner party with my Mom and us kids needed to entertain ourselves so we were shown into the Den and put in front of the Husbands N64. We had never played before. This was before 2000. I think I had heard about Zelda so I asked him to set us up with it. My little brother and I were scared out of our minds because he had made it to adult link and we started out in the decrepit Castle Town with the re-deads. One jumped on my head and started eating and my brother and I were just holding each other terrified üòÇ. And then the husband was watching me play and notes that I moved the character like I was drunk. 
I think that Xmas my parents got us a N64 and I picked up OOT. I played the hell out of it but was too young to actually advance through the game. But yeah, I feel like I know that game front and back!
Mine was a link to the past on SNES was my first game in general I that was in 94 and hoping for a remake in the manner they did with Link's awakening.
    I'd love a remake, too
I don‚Äôt remember if Ocarina of Time or Link‚Äôs Awakening was my first but Wind Waker was the first one I finished.
A Link to the Past. What a phenomenal introduction to the series
I got into Zelda during late ‚Äò21? Maybe ‚Äò22‚Ä¶

I started w BoTW, I‚Äôve also played ToTK, AOC, Link‚Äôs Awakening, and the first two Zelda games.
Zelda: A Link to the Past on NES. It came out in America when I was six and I thought it was the coolest thing ever created.
Ocarina but wind waker was the first one I beat by myself üòé
Mine was ‚ÄòThe Legend of Zelda‚Äô‚Ä¶
First was tp, had to get my bf to do/help with some parts and i couldnt do the gohma boss battle at all cuz i hate spiders. Currently working on majoras mask and botw
I started with the original gold (that's what OG stands for, right? 'Original Gold') cartridge in the late 80s early 90s.. then didn't have a Nintendo console again until the Cube.. I've played them all since.

I did play the one for the super Nintendo for a little, but not enough to finish it.
A link to the past on the SNES...I know, I'm old as dirt XD
The Legend of Zelda on NES when I was a child. Before then, we played on the ATARI 2600, so LOZ was mind-blowing and was a real adventure.
The og golden cartridge, legend of zelda
For me it was also ocarina of time
OoT also, OP.

I was 4 when it came out. Even though my older brothers were the ones playing it they also gave me a chance, too.
The original on the NES back in the 80‚Äôs. I‚Äôm old.
Minnish Cap and it still holds a special place in my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
Majora's Mask... Sorta. When my brother and I were little our parents got us a GameCube for Christmas and it had the special edition Zelda game. We were stupid young children and only ever pressed left on the menu once which would move to MM. Being small and stupid, we couldn't figure out much of the game, let alone getting through the first cycle. Then I remember coming home one day and my sister's boyfriend was playing Ocarina of Time, and I was like daaaaang how did you figure out how to turn back to human?? 

Yeah after that I grew up a bit and actually played OoT.
Oh jeez. What was the DS one. SUPER weird graphics
Mine was "A Link to the Past" on the SNES. It's been a lifelong love affair ever since.
OoT for me, too! But I would mostly backseat game while my older brother (I was 4, he was 6 when we started) tackled the games. I didn't actually play through the first four 3d Zelda games until last year, and I started with OoT. It was really hard because I wasn't used to doing it without my brother there, and it made the game scarier than it had any right to be.
He actually bought me Link Between Worlds when it came out back in 2013, even though we hadn't played a Zelda game together since Twilight Princess (was/still is my favorite). But he knew how much I loved my 3ds. I tried getting him to help me beat Ganon, but he wouldn't, saying I needed to do it myself, and I'm glad he did because that became the first Zelda game I ever beat entirely on my own.
Majora‚Äôs mask for the 3Ds
OoT, or the GOAT
Twilight Princess! First and favorite
links awakening (no not the remastered, the og on the colorless gameboy)
My stepdad had a SNES when he married my mum so I grew up on Link to the Past
Majora's mask
First Zelda game was Oracina of Time for N64. A lot of summers spent roaming in the game and playing ball hockey at that time. üíö
OoT 3D and MM 3D
Link to the past as a kid. In my head I beat. Replayed it as an adult and realized I had never made it to the dark world.
1/10. There was only the one at the time‚Ä¶
ALttP. Must've been around '00-'01 I first played it? Deathless 100% it last March.
A link to the past on switch, and then again, and later a third time
‚ÄúLink‚Äù for NES
Twilight princess
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. But I didnt play much. OoT was the first one I played a lot of.
The first 1 with nientendo switch online then totk
I think Majoras Mask
Link‚Äôs awakening for the Game Boy color. Amazing game IMO
Botw!! Fell in love with the franchise
For me it was Link's Awakening
I first played an emulator of LTTP
Samesies bestie
Phantom hourglass
Mine was Link to the Past.
Alttp
Breath of the wild and it inspired me to play like 5 other games from my old Nintendo systems
The legend of Zelda (nes)
Mine first was "A Link into the Last," for the GBC buuuut..

The first one I ever completed was Skyward Sword.

I have a strong love for both games.
My first one was Skyward Sword, fell in love with the series ever since
The original 8-bit Legend Of Zelda.
Link to the past!
I started with Breath in late May of 2023. Since, I have played TotK, OoT, MM, LoZ, TAoL, LttP, and OoS.
Would be the OG for me.  The legend of Zelda on the good ol NES with the gold cartridge.
I played around with Phantom Hourglass on my aunts old DS when I was younger. First played Zelda game that I actually could comprehend though was BOTW when I got a switch, but I loved the series since I was a teen because of MM and the Ben Drowned creepypasta
Same but for me it was the 3ds version
The OG original.
I had started playing botw a few years ago and now i am playing totk. (Being a yiga is cool)
Technically the first I ever played was the original on my dad‚Äôs nes but I was too young to understand how to actually play. Years later I got the opportunity to play Twilight Princess and four swords anniversary on my GameCube and my 3DS
Legend of Zelda. I remembering renting the gold cartridge from the local video store. Cheap John‚Äôs Video. I can still picture it in my hand‚Ä¶.
LoZ on the NES
Same. To be honest I was watching my brother play it on the 64. Got it for the 3DS when I was older.
Ocarina of Time as well, I was 4
Links awakening uncolored version on gameboy brick.
I remember playing the originals, but when I was old enough to truly be into the game, it was Link to the Past. Still one of my favorite games ever.
A link to the past
the onebwith the gold cartridge you had to blow on to get to work..
The first one I ever tried was either Zelda 1 or Ocarina of Time. The first one I every beat was breath of the wild, followed by Ocarina and TOTK and ALBW
I started with Ocarina of time, and got decently far on windwaket but was too young and couldn‚Äôt finish either. Tried Ocarina again in college, but couldn‚Äôt find the time to finish with 6 roommates and one tv. 

I just finished BOTK. It‚Äôs the first Zelda game I‚Äôve beaten and I was so pumped to finally fight a version of Ganon.
an ex drug addict use to let me play ocarina of time 3d on his 3ds, and helped me when i needed it üò≠üò≠
That one with the four links, years go by then botw, then i attempted majoras mask on the 3ds and couldnt understand the controls, so i tried a link to the past and i like it i just dont really look at my ds, then i played totk and nothing since :)
The first Zelda game I played was Zelda.

There was an NES on display in Sears, and you could play Zelda, Mario/Duckhunt, Metroid, and Kid Icarus. I would wait in line and play it while my mom shopped. Probably 1988.

I asked for Zelda (and an NES) for Christmas and of course it's insanely difficult for a 6-y.o. kid, so I would play it with my Dad. I would try all afternoon to make progress and then he would come home from work and get us past an underworld level. Great memories.
Links awakening dx
TLOZ on NES
The very first Legend Of Zelda.
The OG The Legend of Zelda for the NES. LOVED IT.
My first was skyward sword on the wii but my favorite game is twilight princess
Wind waker
Been playing since the first on NES.
A Link to the Past
The Legend of Zelda
Link to the past was my first, and still my favorite
Original one, and then twilight Princess.
Between Skyward sword and Twilight Princess. Stuck on one part in Skyward though.
it was The Legend of Zelda on NES or the Zelda game watch I had that lasted a week.
Zelda II, but I never got far in it. LttP was the first I beat
I watched my friend play Twilight Princess on Wii but my first one was Skyward Sword on Wii
My first Zelda game was Ocarina of Time as well, it was also the game that introduced me to video games.
The Minish Cap
Majora‚Äôs Mask in 2011/2012. To this day it is my favorite game (tied with Twilight Princess).
The OG. When it came out. And needed help from Nintendo power to beat it.
I began with Wind Waker on the Wii when I was 7, then shortly after I played the 3DS OoT. Really made me realize that I was missing out on the series.
Wind Waker
Tears of the Kingdom. I got addicted QUICK
Mightve been WWHD (WiiU)
Link to the past was my first
Phantom Hourglass, Linebeck my beloved
A Link to the Past
A link to the past for me .
Christmas 1986 or 87 (edit: had to be 87) I got the NES with Super Mario Brothers, Zelda, and Metroid. I‚Äôve been chasing the dragon ever since.
My first was on the gba, I don‚Äôt remember what it was called though, never finished it
Link's Awakening
Twilight princess
A Link Between Worlds, I was really excited for the game and I got it when I was 5 and returned it to game stop immediately because I didn‚Äôt like it. I came back to it this year and I‚Äôm having fun now.
Majoras Mask 3d
OOT was how I learned to read
My mom and I both had save files on ALttP when I was a kid. It was always really exciting when one of us would find a new item because we couldn‚Äôt wait to tell each other lol.
Link's Awakening. Very much enjoyed it.
The first one on the OG Nintendo
I forgot the name of it but it was on the SNES
Majora's mask, played it when I was like 7
The OG! It was probably around the year 1989-1990.
The original Legend of Zelda for the NES.
The OG. I‚Äôm 40 though. A Link to the Past is still my favorite game if all time
twilight princess
Link‚Äôs Awakening on Gameboy. No clue who this Zelda person was everyone else was talking about lol
Wind Waker on the GameCube <3 still play it all the way through almost once a year
Links Awakening. Old school gameboy.
Link‚Äôs Awakening. I was super excited when they remastered it for the Switch.
Majora's Mask.
BOTW both on the Wii U then the Switch and now TOTK. Over 140 hours on each
OG

It‚Äôs dangerous to go alone.
I first played Twilight Princess for the Wii, but I was pretty young at the time and the first dungeon scared me lmao. so I would just play the intro over and over again and run around on Epona while listening to the music. the Ordon Village theme still gives me so much nostalgia (and all the music in TP is just beautiful tbh)
I started Zelda when it came  out, on a Gameboy.  Had to ask the younger ones to get me thru tough places.   So many years ago
Links awakening, for sure top 5 games for me
I think it was minishcap. Or WW
I played the original on NES but was to young to really grasp it.  Link to the Past was the first one i played through and completed.
Minish cap on the gameboy. Such a good game as a kid!
OG Legend of Zelda
link between worlds and oot 3d
wind waker :)
Bazinga. The original.
The very first one, on NES. You could save!!! (This was a BIG DEAL back then.
Zelda.... when it was new
My first game was also OOT. First ‚Äòplayed‚Äô it when I was 0 years old. My dad was a big fan of the series and would play it to entertain me. As I got older I‚Äôd get more involved until I demanded to play it myself, though whenever I‚Äôd enter a dungeon or it turned night in Hyrule field I‚Äôd immediately shove the controller back at him. 

I remember when the 3ds port came out he got it for me and we both played it together, him on the game cube and me on my ds, and we stayed up pointing out the differences and seeing who could get somewhere faster. All of these experiences with the game are probably why it‚Äôs my favorite in the series.
Technically ALTTP for Wii U virtual console was the first. Then I played BOTW because it was the newest at the time and my first open world experience. Then I played Skyward Sword and that was my true hook to the series and made me want to play all of them. Before that it was just mild interest.
I played the original as a child.  Beat it at like six or seven years old, lol.
Technically my first Zelda game was *Link‚Äôs Crossbow Training*. We initially it as a gift for friends back in elementary school; my sister and I enjoyed it so much that we ended up getting our own copy.

But when it comes mainline Zelda games, my first was *Spirit Tracks*‚Äîit also happened to be the latest Zelda game at the time (I was 10 years old back then). I got it as a surprise present from my mother. She figured that I‚Äôd enjoy it since I loved both puzzles and adventure games‚Äîand she figured correctly.
Minish Cap
either botw or wwhd
The Legend of Zelda on NES.  Drawing my map for the overworld was a fun project.
Majora's mask on the wii

Now I don't have the wii but I got it on the 3ds and I love it (yes I know it's not as good as the N64 version but dayum the n64 is expensive)
For me t was the Remake of Major's makes on 3D's XL when I was 11. I was a little late to the party
I dabbled in the original LoZ as I was 3 or 4 at the time and deleted my older sisters saves over and over because NES cart problems... Sorry sis... Thankfully, she doesn't hate me.
BoTW. Just started Ocarina of Time, before that had finished Majora's Mask (I know I'm playing them out of order)
OOT
The Legend of Zelda nes
Looks like Jerma
We just called it Zelda at the time.
The one on the 8bit NES.  So long ago I don‚Äôt remember the name.
twilight princess
OOT 64
Gold cartridge for NES
Link's crossbow training on the wii
A hand held Zelda game. This was pre gameboy.
Zelda
Breath of the Wild!
Legend of Zelda on the NES
It is hard for me to remember because I started playing Zelda games with my family from a really young age but I think it may have been Twilight Princess. If I am remembering correctly, I was like 6 or something when I first played it with my parents. I think we may have dropped it for a while, and I at some point later did a play through on my own.
BOTW
My grandparents got me LttP for my 5th birthday back in '92. I had no idea what it was supposed to be about, but they were SO excited, as they'd played the original often. We all got into it, and I'd call my grandpa often for help with puzzles he'd already beaten. Good times...
For me it was a link between worlds been hooked ever since
OoT 3D!! Very difficult.
The original game.
Link's Awakening.
Adventure of Link. I was a toddler back then though and I never played any other Zelda game until Ocarina of time came out and that's what got me hooked on the series.
Majora‚Äôs mask it‚Äôs what got me addicted to the whole series
I'm a true OG!! Waited as patiently as possible for the original NES Zelda as a present from my parents.
Breath of the Wild
The Legend of Zelda, original NES. Fuck that game was hard as shit when I was a kid. The Legend of Zelda 2 waffle stomped me even harder. But when that SNES came out with it's own Zelda game, I truly fell in love.
The original Legend of Zelda when I was 3 or 4
The Legend of Zelda: NES.
Totk
Triforce hereos and hot take the single player campaign is actually really good
Majora's mask. That set me back a bit. Picked up 4 swords next but didn't have any friends that had it so i played the link to the past bonus built into it
Twilight princess for the Wii. Loved it. Got the WiiU version and almost 100% the game hero difficulty and with the ganondorf amiibo. Hero difficulty makes enemies do double damage and hearts don't spawn from pots or dig spots. Ganondorf amiibo gave enemies double damage. So enemies did 4 times the damage and no heart drops. I missed one heart piece that became unobtainable after a certain point in the game. Also I couldn't beat the 30th floor in the end game desert area. 30 floors and the 3 darknaughts in such a small area just destroyed me. Did everything else.
Same. Second was Link to the Past.
I am old, the first one was my first one. I didn't finish it, my mom did.
Twilight princess
same. mine was Oot to and it changed the way i view games
Twilight princess
I would say alttp technically but the first I truly played and experienced was botw
Ballad of the Wind Fish
Lttp.
Same oot on GameCube but wind waker was the first one I beat cause the forest temple had me scared shitless from the wall masters
Link‚Äôs awakening DX
I grew up with WW however as i grew up i learned to enjoy playing ALTTP on snes with my friends we always tried to speedrun it lol
it was either Oracle of Ages, or Minish Cap
The first one. Even had a golden cartridge.
First one I played was Wind Waker when I was a teen and I got right up to the final showdown and I just‚Ä¶ stopped playing?


The first LOZ game I ever finished was BOTW and I ended up 100%-ing the game I loved it so much. After that I restarted Wind Waker and finally finished it!
Windwaker, i was a kid and didnt understand anything and used a walkthroughüíÄ still loved it tho
Botw then Twillight
The Legend of Zelda, the original from the NES. Been playing the series since the late 80‚Äôs
minish Cap
Zelda 1, for the NES
First one was the original SNES version. The second was Breath of the Wild. HUGE stretch, I know, I am missing a lot. But I love BOTW and I even played a little of its sequel.
Phantom Hourglass!
I got a switch last March in 2023, and I played BOTW the first time and I‚Äôve been obsessed with anything Zelda related ever since üòç
Technically four swords when it was free on the DSi, but my first real Zelda experience was twilight princess
The OG
Mine was Skyward Sword, and it's my favorite to this day. But I haven't played many Zelda games so that might change
Skyward Sword
OOT was my first
Played Majoras mask on my older brothers N64, didn‚Äôt figure too much out but it did freak me out
Oracle of Seasons.
The first one I played was Link Between Worlds on my 3DS. I was like 10 or 11, and was so not into it cause I was more of a Kirby and Mario girl üòÇ 5 years later I got my Switch and a friend convinced me to play BOTW. It‚Äôs been an obsession since then! It was honestly really difficult for me to play BOTW at first, given that before I usually only played platformers or more childish games. Since then, I went back and I played a good amount of the catalog and absolutely adore the series!! I credit BOTW for starting my love of games as a hobby as I became an adult, and not letting video games be just a childhood activity.
Dx on gameboy. It changed me lol, love that game
Minish Cap! Love that game. It was bright and colorful, and the soundtrack is fire.
Botw
The first one. Dad and I used to stay up late playing it. Mom was mad. I loved it.

When the snes came out, I rented a game for the weekend, beat it in an hour and was disappointed. Mom called dad. He rented a link to the past for me. It was amazing.

N64 came out. Dad and I went to play ocarina of time. He‚Ä¶. He couldn‚Äôt wrap his head around the 3D controls. Just got frustrated.

Lost him a couple of years ago. I miss him so much but I love having Zelda memories with him.
twilight princess when i was like 11ü•π i was god awful
Mine was Minish Cap
My first system was the NES so probably the first Zelda game. I was less than 10 years old then. I was born in '88
Minish cap
Breath of the Wild was my first though I don‚Äôt remember much of my first playthrough. Then I played OOT, Links Awakening, Zelda 1, and a few others. But Breath of the Wild is my favorite in the series.
The very first one and I didnt know there was a save function so poor little 7 years old me was always starting all over again lol!
Wind waker is my all time favorite, even though I no longer own the GameCube or the game. Even so, it was a blast from start to finish.

I love the OST and the atmosphere of the different islands.
It was dangerous to go alone, so an old man in a cave gave me a wooden sword.
Wind Waker HD was my first and it was fucking amazing.

Yeah I was one of the mfs who had a Wii U but those WW and TP remakes were so amazing.
I don‚Äôt remember the name, but my first Zelda game was on the Nintendo, along with a bunch of other games (including but not limited to, a very pixilated Mario kart that you can barely see because it‚Äôs so pixilated)
Minish Cap
First exposure to franchise: cartoon series and Captain N 

First time playing for about 5 minutes at a relative's house that one time: LTTP

First personally owned game: LA
Twilight Princess
Botw, last summer
Same
wind waker i think :)
The first Zelda game on NES. I didn‚Äôt get far either, but at the same time, I was like 6 years old lol. 

Ocarina of Time was the first Zelda game I completed.
I think it was called four swords?
Twilight Princess
OG Zelda for me. Gold cartridge.
Technically it‚Äôs ocarina of time. I have a vague memory of playing the gerudo desert part of the game on my uncles n64 as a kid. The first Zelda I actually played all the way through was also ocarina of time. Guess much didn‚Äôt change from being a kid to a teenagerüòÇ
The OG. Link to the Past was the fist I owned, though
This Link is 32 years old, so he‚Äôs still in his early 30s, but he does worry about his late 30s. People will consider him practically 40. Will he have enough saved for retirement? He has the giant wallet, but that only holds 500 rupees.
Majoras mask
Legend of Zelda.
Used to play Zelda on Super Nintendo at daycare.  Then my brother and I got Oracle of Ages/Seasons for gameboy color.  Loved that game :)
skyward sword!! AND IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL EVEN IF ITS ON THE WII
That NES one...

I was a kiddo
Depends on your definition of "played"

I messed around in the original Legend of Zelda since my aunt had it for her NES but I didn't know what to do and never made any real progress, so I just shut it off after dying two or three times and went to play Mario instead, funny enough, these days it's in my top 3.

I did the same for my cousin's finished file of ALTTP but same story there. At least I got to meet Ganon.

And again, with my step brother's copy of Ocarina of Time.  Except I found the world a lot more interesting.  But not interesting enough to start my own file and figure out how to play the game, I just liked to walk around, kill things, attack the cuccoos, talk to NPCs, and fight Ganondorf without realizing that the light arrows hurt him.

So the first Zelda game I played seriously was most likely Link's Awakening.  I don't remember how I got it,  I think because my local game store had it for very cheap, used?  Remember when used games could be bought for super cheap?  Good times.  I actually made it to Turtle Rock.  It was too confusing to me though. I never finished the dungeon and eventually lost my cartridge.  I must have been 8 or 9.  I think the thing that made me stick with this one was the Mario character guest appearances, I was obsessed with Mario and only Mario, didn't want to play anything else ( with pokemon being the exception ) but with Goombas, a Yoshi Doll, Peach, and Wart showing up, I just wanted to keep playing  ( and of course the game won me over on it's own merits as well, I had a weird little crush on Marin )

I did get to finally beat the game when it hit 3DS Virtual Console, and the remake probably elevated it pretty high on my list as my 2nd favorite 2D Zelda behind the NES game.

First Zelda I ever beat was Ocarina of Time though.  After Smash Bros 64 came out and I became more open minded toward things outside of Mario and Pokemon, I wanted to check out the other characters in that game, and a friend let me borrow his copy of OOT. Had a blast.
The Zelda. Legend of zelda
Oot is just better
Twilight Princess on Wii.
I started out with both oracle of ages and oracle of seasons! I started with ages, however.
A Link to the Past. Rented it for SNES on Friday after school at Blockbuster when I was a little kid. I still remember all my game rental days fondly. Those were good fucking times indeed.
A link to the past, but Ocarina makes me the most nostalgic and I still to this day joke around about Majoras Mask
Ocarina of Time on the N64 is the first I remember experiecinig as a little kid, but I was too young to know how to play. It wasn't till the remake on the 3DS where I completed the game and had a great experience.
Oracle of Ages/ Seasons - My dad could only afford a gameboy for us to share but my brother and I each got our own version of the games. We were so happy!
phantom hourglass on my sparkly red ds lite
Botw, then I went back to play oot
Original for NES.  Back around 1987 or so.
A link to the past. Still go back and play it as a comfort game
First one I played was Ocarina of Time but I was so young at the time I didn't really know what I was doing and it wasn't my game it was for my older cousin. But the first one that I actually owned and completed myself with Skyward Sword which I really really enjoyed and in retrospect I'm really glad I played that one first.
Twilight princess
Link's Awakening on the GameBoy
A Link To The Past! Fell in love!!!
Wind Waker
Ocarina of Time üêê
A link between worlds on the 3ds
The original Legend of Zelda. It's the first video game I remember playing.
The first I think was Ocarina of time but only for a few minutes at a friend's house. The first one I owned was actually Windwaker. I loved it even though it's kind of the odd ball out in terms of the Zelda series.
My very first game was The Minish Cap. :)
Mine was Zelda II and I hated it. I have grown since then. Still isn't my favorite, but it wasn't as bad as I remembered it to be.
Started with BoTW. Immediately hooked, thought it couldn't get any better.. and then I completed ToTK. I stood corrected.

Also when I was a kid, I used to watch my cousin play Ocarina of Time on his N64. Overall it feels very nostalgic as a series. 

I did gave Link's Awakening and Ocarina of Time a go on my own for a bit. Nothing got me like open world Hyrule did though.
Ocarina !!
OOT3D! Cemented my love for Zelda and adventure games. Link between worlds was my second, best 2d Zelda imo
I‚Äôm pretty sure it was Majoras mask 3d
Mine was wind waker on GameCube
OG TLoZ with my dad wayyyyyy back in the early 90s.
A link to the past and Minish cap
The first one on NES but OOT was the first one i played and beat!
Oot n64 passed down from my brother who‚Äôs 17 years older than me! I‚Äôm 21 btw
The first one. Yes im an old Millenial
The first one I played I believe was breath of the wild because my parents got it on my brother‚Äôs
Wii U then after we a got switch we got it on the switch and my addiction grew
Nintendo Land Zelda, then botw. But I got into Zelda because of majoras mask
Link to the Past!
Beat the original on my NES mini. It's fun
Oh man. I remember when I was 7 years old. My dad and I drove into town to the Toys r Us and bought a NES. We also bought Tetris and Legend of Zelda. Driving home I read every single word on the boxes and the manual. Watching and hearing that first Zelda screen and one of the greatest intros to any game ever. I have been hooked ever since. I've got a wonderful wife and 2 great daughters but......getting the NES might have been the greatest day of my life.
Original on nes
A Link to the Past. My grandma had a Super Nintendo and I would watch her play often. Eventually I picked it up myself but I wasn‚Äôt very good at anything besides Kirby sadly. I still have fond memories though.
Same
The original gold cart, I was 7 and instantly hooked- the world felt massive and endless back then and talking to friends on the playground about different secrets we found was awesome. I've played and enjoyed every game in the series since, Zelda 2 is my least favorite and I don't count spin off games like Triforce Heroes. I'm still messing around on TOTK and am eagerly awaiting the next mainline installment of my favorite series
Twilight Princess. My dad is a big Zelda fan and he introduced me to it when I was around 7. It‚Äôs still my favorite game in the series :)
links awaking on og game boy
Technically the first one I played on my own was Four Swords Adventures for the DSi/3DS, but I've been a fan since Ocarina of Time era
Same
Wind Waker
Breath of the Wild. I actually couldn‚Äôt afford Zelda games growing up and the 1 expensive game I got to pick was always Pok√©mon. lol ! I don‚Äôt think young me would have like Zelda- too hard lol
A link to the past on the Wii
Majoras Mask
A Link to the Past. I was barely walking and I was fighting with my mom over the SNES. She eventually started buying two consoles so that we could both play üòÇ. I had the coolest mom and I‚Äôd give anything to fight over the Nintendo again.
Same, played the 3DS remake and loved it, it was the special OoT themed 2DS as well
Tbh Triforce Heroes ü´£. But that was was before I even knew what Zelda was. Then I got BotW, and back tracked to play mostly everything except Oracle
A link to the past. Was obsessed.
OG NES
I wanna say OoT but it could‚Äôve been ALttP
botw
Legend of Zelda (1986)
Oracle of seasons.
Breath of the wild, but I COULD have played SS, but the Wii U I had was gone by the time I would have been old enough to play it, and BOTW released lol
Wind Waker HD
OoT
Twilight princess
My first game was actually unofficial. There was this game my mother had on her computer called The Legend of Zelda: Mystery of Solarus. I loved it and played it whenever I got the chance.¬†


One day I was looking through a bag we used to store our Gamecube games and suddenly I saw it. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. It was awesome to find that because I had always wanted to try more Zelda games, and there was one in the same bag I used to play Mario Kart the whole time. I instantly begged to play it and started it. The game was pre-owned by my cousin who never deleted his old save file so I actually started the game in the middle of the ocean, nothing in sight but a lone tall figure in the distance. I tried to swim there stupidly and failed. I decided I didn't want to play anymore and let my mom use the save file, and she found out to use the sail and ended up at Dragon Roost. I was jealous and started a new save file, and oh boy my shock to find out that the whole time I wasn't even playing from the start of the game. The moment I saw that ancient text I realized this wasn't the same Zelda I thought it was... this was something far greater. With that experience walking around Outset I remember it feeling different from other games, almost as if this game was specifically made for me, and It still kinda feels that way. To this day Wind Waker is my favorite Zelda game and my second favorite game of all time because (shockingly) another game somehow managed to create an experience greater to me (it's the bug game just saying, you probably know the one). I may have endlessly enjoyed Mystery of Solarus, but Wind Waker taught me that video games aren't always just fun, they are real adventures.
OG Zelda on the NES
I honestly think I played Zelda 2 before the first Zelda. Zelda 2 gets a lot of hate, but it‚Äôs one of my absolute favorite Zelda games and my favorite (overall) NES game.
Mine was a link to the past. It had an added piece of content on the same GBA cartridge and that added piece of content was four swords.
Technically *Zelda II*. Never really got far, spent a lot of time dying in the early areas.

First played all the way through would be *Link to the Past*.
I guess Ocarina of Time when I was 4, but it was my cousin's game and all I could figure out was how to run around Kokiri Forest. First one I owned and played a decent amount of was Wind Waker.
I played Ocarina of Time 3D after I got my 3DS XL. We had an N64, but never had a zelda game, also the only time I tried OoT at a cousins house, I was horrified of the redeads after pulling the Master Sword out. Was a lot younger then.
8bit Zelda on the NES when it was released. First game I ever played in my life
Most likely the original through Smash Bros masterpieces
Breath of the Wild, but I've played some older Zelda games since then
OoA
I'm pretty sure it was Zelda 2, I distinctly remember getting to horse head as a little kid, but I couldn't have been more than four or five.
windwaker
‚Ä¶Minish Cap. It was the only one I could get my hands on at the time as I didn‚Äôt own much in the way of consoles besides emulators and yeah‚Ä¶ I still love it and want to find a physical version of it in the future.
The original Legend of Zelda. My brother and I took turns with my dad for what seemed like months until we beat it. 

Good times.
Windwaker, but like in 2015 on when me and my brother both wanted old consoles so my dad got me a GameCube and my brother an ns4.
First ever Zelda game I got was Breath of The Wild, and that was for my 10th birthday. Recommended to me by a friend and 5 years after, it‚Äôs still one of my favorite games to play.
Pretty sure mine was also oot but I never actually completed it until a couple years ago. It‚Äôs the only one I‚Äôve actually played all the way through, though I definitely wanna play more.
Same
OG Zelda
Windwakerrrrrrüíúüíú
Botw sent me down a rabbit hole
Samesies
Link‚Äôs Awakening as a kid and somehow missed the sword location, wandered around and cut (shoveled?) a lot of grass in the village before finally giving up. Didn‚Äôt come back until Minish Cap as an adult and absolutely loved it.
Wind Waker!! Except I was still young and never got very far. 

I remember I got to Dragon Roost Island (if I recall the name correctly) and thought I had to go to the top of the island but couldn't make it bc of the heat/ ash or something so I just ran around the island for hours trying to figure out what I needed to do. 

I never left the island (which I now assume is what you have to do, and come back later) and just got tired of trying to figure it out, so I stopped playing. Soon after my dad sold my GameCube bc they were gone stop being produced and he thought that meant we had to get rid of it bc there wouldn't be any more games for it. 

Miss that lil GameCube, lots of great memories on it and my first real intro to gaming.
Majora's mask best game babyyyy
Breath of the wild
Phantom hourglass was my first Zelda game, then spirit tracks and then Twilight Princess. LOZ will always have a special place in my heart
‚ÄúOcarina of Time 3D‚Äù for me.
The og legend of Zelda
Original gold cartridge on the NES. I was like, four. 

First game I played and beat was OoT
For me, it was Oracle of the Ages. I loved the time travel mechanic, the fun story, and the fact you cpuld port over stuff to a new game with Seasons. Plus, that dark tower cutscene!
It depends what you count. I grew up with Four Swords on my DS, watching my siblings/cousins replay OoT and TP, and being shit at SS. The first one I properly played was probably Four Swords, and the first and only one I finished was BotW just last year (I‚Äôm shit at finishing games). Right now, I‚Äôm playing OoT and Minish Cap and reliving SS all at once. Really enjoying them. Hopefully someday I have them all finished.

Four Swords, basically. But Skyward Sword was THE ONE for me and the Zelda game I feel most nostalgic for
Ocarina of time as a kid, then majoras mask. Followed by nightmares if the game. Never beat that one. 29 now and beat it like 3 yrs ago on the 3ds lol . Still creeps me out
My first Zelda game was also Ocarina of Time. I loved Majora's Mask and Wind Waker after that. Twilight Princess is my favorite.
Twilight Princess
Same but I was super young and Deleted my uncles save file. I never saw the console again.
Botw
The Legend of Zelda
There's only one 1st Zelda!  The Legend
Same!
Phantom Hourglass.

Got Twilight Princess just a week later, though, and that's BY FAR my favorite one.
I wasn‚Äôt able to play games as a kid. I didn‚Äôt get to go to friend‚Äôs houses and I didn‚Äôt have any consoles. So my first game was actually breath of the wild now that I‚Äôm an adult and can but my own stuff
Borrowed OoT from my neighbor when I was like 6. And was stuck with the cucco for so long. Once I figured it out I became a fan for life.
My first was breath of the wild, but I then decided to hop on my step moms N64 and played OoT and MM
First one I played was A link to the past. First one I beat was Links Awakening. First one that truly hooked me was ocarina of time.
My first was also ocarina then majoras mask cause I had the GameCube Zelda collectors disc which has the first and second Zelda‚Äôs along with ocarina and majoras mask. I feel like majoras mask is my clear favorite with twilight a close second. Tbh with Zelda tears of the kingdom I was so excited when the devs said it was gonna be a little darker than majora but to my surprise this was very literal. It‚Äôs still pretty happy
link to the past
Phantom Hourglass!
Same
BOTW
I tried a Zelda game on the original Gameboy but since then it‚Äôs been BOTW and TOTK.
N64 4 years old I was terrible I don‚Äôt think I sat down and payed attention to what I was doing till I was about 8-10 and didn‚Äôt grasp winning with ease till I was 13 been replaying every remake ever since fav version is the game cube one cause I had the collectors edition with the game cube it had the demo of wind waker had ocarina of time Majoras mask two gba version ones and the trailer for the animated movie
Four swords. Not the original the 25th anniversary on the dsi ware store
A Link To The Past! Man I had to have been maybe 5 or 6 years old.
A Link To The Past - Snes
Spirit Tracks. And it is still my favorite 14 years later. Majoras Mask and Ocarina of time are tied for second and TOTK is in 3rd
Minish cap. Got it on an emulator, the first i BEAT was TOTK. Suck my balls, bought totk before botw.
Oracle of Ages

I thought the animal companions were awesome
The original, but I didn't beat it until many years later. First one I beat was links awakening.
Mine was technically OoT, but I was really young then, and I don't actually remember anything but jumping around some stone building. The first Zelda game I played that I _remember_ playing was Minish Cap, which I also beat, on a school chromebook, on a browser emulator, while standing up.
Mine was ocarina of time too, I loved it so much still my favorite Zelda game <3
Mine was the OG on the NES
technically I played Zelda 1 both on NES and a fair bit of the GBA port, but Wind Waker is where I fell in love with the franchise
Ocarina of Time, and this is exactly how I pictured adult link!
A Link Between Worlds for me.
Ocarina of Time(original N64 version with red blood), followed shortly thereafter by the original GameBoy version of Link's Awakening.
Phantom Hourglass
I played A Link to The Past when I was little and didn‚Äôt understand it lol then I played Ocarina of Time in middle school and all of them ever since..except for the new one.
Minish Cap on gba
Link to the Past
Twilight Princess! It was also the very firsr video game I completed! I had a crazy headcanon about the player character before I figured out it was the Link dude in Smash
The Legend of Zelda on the NES

Fave is Wind Waker
A Link To the Past. It was bundled with my SNES
The original way back when.  I was never able to find the red ring after endless attempts, finally almost 15 years later in the early 00s thanks to the internet I found it lol.
Twilight Princess
Oracle of Ages for the GBA
My first Zelda game was Oracle of Ages (I wish Nayru was in more games!), then I played BOTW and TOTK. I tried a couple others but never really got into them.
Majora Mask. Creeped me out as a kid and haven‚Äôt really played it since. I‚Äôve seen footage of it though and it looks awesome.
Link between worlds was my first. Yuga was genuinely excellent
Twilight Princess on the Wii.

I still remember the incredibly loud channel music lmao
Ocarina of time! But honestly I was so obsessed I played all that I had access to. My Dad got me started when I was like 4 or 5 and he would sit and play with me and my bros. We'd all take turns playing thr different parts and such.
BOTW, but my favorite has to be Twilight Princess
Wind Waker babyyyyyyy
Oot
The very first Legend of Zelda on the NES.
Twilight princess, in 2008. I had just started dating my spouse and they introduced me to it.
Played? First one on my dads old Nintendo I was like 6 and played for about 5 minutes, actually played, immersed myself, and finished? Botw, game is surreal
Oracle of Seasons on my gameboy advance üòÇ. I remember it being the first game I ever played as a kid that had a legitimate storyline and I was hooked on Zelda ever since
Skyward Sword. Don‚Äôt know why but I decided to start w it and it‚Äôs been a couple years I‚Äôm at the final boss battle but dreading it bc the controls suck but I‚Äôm excited for my borrowed copy of BOTW next and then TOTK but I did play a little bit of OOT when I used my brother‚Äôs switch and I didn‚Äôt get to much after getting my sword but it was fun <3

Hoping the controls are easier. They‚Äôre the reason I take so many breaks (other than college lol)
Back when it came out the first one i played was phantom hourglass
Same, Mine Was Also Ocarina Of Time
Breath of the wild
It was the original but on the Wii, I had no idea what it was called until I‚Äôve played botw and gotten into Zelda. It‚Äôs good to know I was a fan since the start
OoT on gamecube for me, I had a collection that came with Mario Kart: Double Dash, I didn't know it was rare at that time.
I think mine was Twilight Princess with my sister. The first Zelda game I attempted to play on my own was BOTW. I was chased by a guardian the moment I left the tutorial island, ran to a village, and have never picked it up since lol.
I started with Minish cap
The original on the NES.
My first zelda was the first zelda. Mind you, I'm not old, i just got nintendo online and was able to play it for "free", so i played the old ones before botw and totk. I just gotta complete/restart  OOT and majora's mask.. and then play the gameboy ones.. and complete link to the past... And totk.. and and and
Majoras mask at like 8 lmao zackscottgames carried me through it.... replayed it last year.... so goodüî•üî•üî•
Phantom hourglass
Gold cartridge.
    Core memory unlocked - gold cartridge Zelda + Nintendo Power fold-out maps.
OG gold cartridge.  Neighbor‚Äôs mom took us to Toys R Us the day of release.  We were waiting when they opened the store.
    TLoZ here too.  I‚Äôd read every drop of it I could from Nintendo Power, saved up my allowance, and begged my grandma to drive me to Target to get it.  

Then I read the instruction book all weekend until I went home cuz I didn‚Äôt have a NES at my grandma‚Äôs!
Gold cartridge made it feel special. Prized.
    I still have my gold cartridge. My shiny. My precious
        Lucky you. My mom had it and I remember when she took all her NES games and system and brought them to EB Games to trade in cuz we needed the money. Broke my heart to pieces seeing that gold cartridge in the bucket. üò¢
            Oof, that is rough. Sorry that happened to you  :(
Same, I didn't play to the end, because I was young and told go outside! My mother did complete the game though.
    Same! I would just play her save and cry when I got caught out in the dark with the bone creatures that spank you üò≠ I‚Äôve since finished it but it‚Äôs my favorite
Yep. I can still hear that 8-bit music. Spoiler alert: don't play "money making game."
    Just gotta play smart. Once you win once, use the 2nd controller "save" cheat. Makes getting the Blue Ring and a Magic Shield (and Blue Candle) early a breeze.
I spent a fair percentage of my childhood burning almost every single bush and bombing every single segment of wall in that game. I can still beat it from memory; I used to be able to add "without dying" to that claim, but I'm getting old now and the lynels or darknuts will get me from time to time these days... For good or ill, it changed my life.
    I too am old, but it‚Äôs the wizzrobes for me ü•≤
I rebought a legit copy of it, made a frame, with plexiglass cover, and have it hanging on my office wall.

My favorite look, and the first one I played.
I hope you enjoy the older ones as well :)
    Thanks! I'm thinking of starting MM, TP, or OOT next. Any recommendations?
        MM is my all time favorite game in general not just Zelda I highly recommend it. TP and OOT are amazing too you can't go wrong with any of them.
            They should probably start with oot since it kinda comes before mm. It's not necessary since it doesn't even mention anything from oot but I think all the reused assets kinda add something to the game. I think it kinda adds to the fever dream nature of the game. MM is also my favorite game of all time so it's a great thing to play after oot
            I agree. Those are brilliant!
        Honestly you should probably just play all three of those in release order since they kinda tell one really big story. Ocarina, then Majora, then Twilight.
        I would definitely say Majora's Mask as I absolutely loved the vibe and lore of that one- but if you want a definitive experience I would play OoT first as MM ties directly into it afterwards. 

OoT is a lot longer of a game though, so it might take some time vs going straight to MM... I'd still recommend it as OoT is considered a classic and MM kinda works upon the system OoT introduces and then sorta flips it on its head in sorts.
        Twilight princess is my all time favorite Zelda game, and easily top ten maybe top five videogame. The story is so heart wrenching, and beautiful all at the same time. If you can find an hd copy of it for the Wii U (or sail the high seas if you prefer to play on pc) it‚Äôs a really great time
        I would say OoT first then MM since OoT is a more standard 3D Zelda and MM is a little weirder and adds some weird mechanics like the timer. I think I like MM more though
        MM!!! It‚Äôs better than ocarina imo. There *is* time limit mechanism which I normally HATE, but it‚Äôs not implemented in a way that makes the game stressful, so don‚Äôt let that deter you at all. But they‚Äôre all great games.

The only Zelda games I didn‚Äôt enjoy were Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks. The puzzles were way too easy, and there are certain aspects that are extremely repetitive and just a chore to do over and over again. There‚Äôs not even a good story to save either of them.
        Oot, mm, tp in that order, could also do wind waker after the two n64 games
        MM is my favorite Zelda ever, but I don't think you can truly appreciate how wild and cool MM is without playing OoT first, so I recommend that. The first playthrough of OoT is magic.
How are you playing ALttP? On the switch emulator?

There's a PC port called Zelda 3 by snesrev that I've been playing as of the other day and really digging. You can hot swap your items out of your inventory with L/R which is *game changing* imo, as well as hotkey a specific item. Makes it flow so much more smoothly.

They also had a fan made port which removed the screen transitions and let you zoom out the map more, but of course Nintendo sent them a Ceast & Desist letter within a week or so of release. Wish I had downloaded it beforehand.
Same!! Also this is like one of chillest fandoms I‚Äôve been in by far. I love the games but the art and stuff that comes out of it is cool too
I was so ready to chime in with ALttP before I finished reading. I'm glad you found it. Imo that's where the series really found its identity and truly established itself as a major player.

Top 10 game of all time for me.
botw was my cause of a Zelda hyperfixationüò≠
Amazing \^\^  
Treasure these memories, my friend.
    This memory is part of the very first memories I can remember about video games, and I hope to keep them in my mind as long as possible, because they are so precious to me.
Same exact story with me and my big brother! He was playing Ocarina of Time on either the N64 or the GameCube while I sat nearby and watched, then I grew up a bit and played Twilight Princess myself ü•∞
Yeah, I remember watch my dad play Ocarina when I was really little, then watching my sister when TP came out, then playing it myself a couple years later
Wind Waker gang unite!
    *begins playing Dragon Roost Island theme*
        Hearing that when I played botw‚Ä¶ feeling occurred
A Link to the Past was my first game too!! It was my first of many Zelda games and one of the first video games I had ever learned how to play. It's so well done. I did a 100% play through a year or so ago, and it was so satisfying.
Never heard of it.
    Hilarious, sir. 

Yes, I see your username. Lol.
It was so goddamn good.  It more than made up for Zelda 2.
Have you ever played any of the top 3 rom hacks for it? Parallel Worlds, Goddess of Wisdom, and Conker's High Rule Tail are all phenomenal. Especially the msu-1 versions. However Secrets of the Past, Hylian Legacy, Oracle of Secrets, Meadow of Shadows, Lyre Islands, and 18 Hrs past are all great too. There are some others I have yet to play.
I think this is the first non-Mario game I played and it is still the best Zelda game, and one of the best games ever, for me. I've replayed it so many times.
I remember when Link to Past came out and many of my cousins were raving about it...and I thought, "What's the big deal.  I like Mario games."  Then years later, I actually played it as my first Zelda game and thought the game was amazing and my cousins were right!
Mine as well!!
You're a hardcore gamer to the bone, mate
Same. Will always hold a special place. The Great Palace theme song is still one of my favs.
Saved up my allowance and waited for a sale at Caldor, had it down to the tax. First game I paid for directly
That‚Äôs a great game indeed!! Loved it too, back in the days‚Ä¶
See I love it too. There‚Äôs a fan remaster that‚Äôs pretty sweet and fixes a lot of random stuff. I still find it funny the amount of hate it gets since it‚Äôs not like other games of the series. Yet in its time was praised.
I went back recently and enjoyed it.  But when it came out I was legit disgusted.
I've always been a big fan of the weird esoteric sequels to old games like Zelda 2, Castlevania 2, Super Mario 2, etc. They were trying new things and while some of it didn't stick at first I think it was a good call to experiment.
Totally worth it!
    Definitely
Legends don't get old, they become classics.
Oracle of time for me! But my brother had oracle of ages so we would swap
The best one to start with. I really hope they do a remake
Hylia herself brought the franchise to you.
I'd love a remake, too
Core memory unlocked - gold cartridge Zelda + Nintendo Power fold-out maps.
TLoZ here too.  I‚Äôd read every drop of it I could from Nintendo Power, saved up my allowance, and begged my grandma to drive me to Target to get it.  

Then I read the instruction book all weekend until I went home cuz I didn‚Äôt have a NES at my grandma‚Äôs!
I still have my gold cartridge. My shiny. My precious
    Lucky you. My mom had it and I remember when she took all her NES games and system and brought them to EB Games to trade in cuz we needed the money. Broke my heart to pieces seeing that gold cartridge in the bucket. üò¢
        Oof, that is rough. Sorry that happened to you  :(
Same! I would just play her save and cry when I got caught out in the dark with the bone creatures that spank you üò≠ I‚Äôve since finished it but it‚Äôs my favorite
Just gotta play smart. Once you win once, use the 2nd controller "save" cheat. Makes getting the Blue Ring and a Magic Shield (and Blue Candle) early a breeze.
I too am old, but it‚Äôs the wizzrobes for me ü•≤
Thanks! I'm thinking of starting MM, TP, or OOT next. Any recommendations?
    MM is my all time favorite game in general not just Zelda I highly recommend it. TP and OOT are amazing too you can't go wrong with any of them.
        They should probably start with oot since it kinda comes before mm. It's not necessary since it doesn't even mention anything from oot but I think all the reused assets kinda add something to the game. I think it kinda adds to the fever dream nature of the game. MM is also my favorite game of all time so it's a great thing to play after oot
        I agree. Those are brilliant!
    Honestly you should probably just play all three of those in release order since they kinda tell one really big story. Ocarina, then Majora, then Twilight.
    I would definitely say Majora's Mask as I absolutely loved the vibe and lore of that one- but if you want a definitive experience I would play OoT first as MM ties directly into it afterwards. 

OoT is a lot longer of a game though, so it might take some time vs going straight to MM... I'd still recommend it as OoT is considered a classic and MM kinda works upon the system OoT introduces and then sorta flips it on its head in sorts.
    Twilight princess is my all time favorite Zelda game, and easily top ten maybe top five videogame. The story is so heart wrenching, and beautiful all at the same time. If you can find an hd copy of it for the Wii U (or sail the high seas if you prefer to play on pc) it‚Äôs a really great time
    I would say OoT first then MM since OoT is a more standard 3D Zelda and MM is a little weirder and adds some weird mechanics like the timer. I think I like MM more though
    MM!!! It‚Äôs better than ocarina imo. There *is* time limit mechanism which I normally HATE, but it‚Äôs not implemented in a way that makes the game stressful, so don‚Äôt let that deter you at all. But they‚Äôre all great games.

The only Zelda games I didn‚Äôt enjoy were Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks. The puzzles were way too easy, and there are certain aspects that are extremely repetitive and just a chore to do over and over again. There‚Äôs not even a good story to save either of them.
    Oot, mm, tp in that order, could also do wind waker after the two n64 games
    MM is my favorite Zelda ever, but I don't think you can truly appreciate how wild and cool MM is without playing OoT first, so I recommend that. The first playthrough of OoT is magic.
