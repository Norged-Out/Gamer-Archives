Same.  So my dad had to restart because he built up so many damn bounties everywhere he couldn't do anything without getting hunted.  
Why'd ya kill em dad?  
-They said mean things.
You know you can pay off bounties right?
-they deserved to die.
Where were you, how far did you get before you had to restart?
-just got to horseshoe overlook.

Lmao and tears man, tears.
    Your dad's gotta adopt an enhanced MO - Kill the witnesses before they report to authorities! Lol
        I know right!?
        I ended up with a 500$ bounty quite early on because I was seen killing a witness and then killed the guy who saw me kill the first one and was witnessed again, and so on... until a guy sees me kill like the 6th witness and runs off lol
            I've never understood how you suddenly get a bounty if you waste everyone. If no pigs make it back to squalor how can I have bounty
        But then there‚Äôs a new witness then you kill those and someone witnesses it and it goes on and on
        I once did this in emerald ranch. Kill one person, a witness. Kill the witness, another npc sees and becomes witness. Kill witness and on and on.
    *I nearly trample a person in Saint Denis due to my own fault and they insult me*

‚Äúthey deserved to die‚Äù
        Bro I have been charged for murder 12 times for running someone over with my horse when going around the corner after knocking them off there horse
    üòÇüòÇ
        In his defense red dead npc‚Äôs be talking mad shit. At least he can get the bounty achievement before he starts a new game.
    Yo same! I bought it on PC and got a huge bounty in the main area, had to spend tons of time getting enough cash to pay it off. It‚Äôs super fun!
        Bounty hunters drop great loot. Sometimes I like to just camp out and wait for them all to show up, murder them and their horses, rinse and repeat and then fence all their loot.
            That is how I played second time too.  Step 1 LOE satchel, max out dead eye as quick as possible and then rack up a huge bounty robbing trains then get after bounty hunters.  They did drop good loot and their horses drop gold nuggets about 1 in 5.
                Woah! Kill horses???

&#x200B;

I've played through twice, and got 100%, and ZERO horses have been killed knowingly.
                    You can loot their saddlebags and not worry about getting kicked in the head. Plus you lose a lot of honor from killing horses, and the lower your honor is the better loot you get when you loot bounty hunters or law enforcers.
                        Huh... TIL

Thanks!
                        Interesting, didn‚Äôt know that! Seems to me as well, the lower your honour, the more likely your horse is shot by bounty hunters/ lawmen
                            I‚Äôve never lost a horse doing it but I do use a spare horse and just stable the one I don‚Äôt want to lose.
                    They carry the goods in their saddle bags. If they are calm you can take items from the saddle bags. If you do not calm them first you are likely to get kicked. Horses don‚Äôt need to be harmed.
                        If they ain't calm my shotgun goes from buckshot to slugs
                            Ill show that fuckin horse how much kick the semi auto shotgun has
                        Sometimes they kick you anyway, though?
                            Sometimes they are ok on one saddle bag and kick you when you go for the one on the other side.

                            That's exactly the kind of attitude Micah has.
                                I might actually start using this phrase in my real life now and hope nobody understands wtf I‚Äôm talking about to add to my joy
                    When getting chased I usually shoot the horses first.  The acrobatics of law enforcement flying off the instantly dead horse is hilarious.  Sometimes they hit hard enough where you dont even have to shoot the rider!

There a couple of places by cliffs where they start chasing you and a solid shot to the head or explosive ammo to the leg of the horse will send the guy flying all the way off the cliff (plus it actually blows off part of the horses leg!).  2 piles of bodies.  1 pile of dead horses with mad loot on the cliff top.  1 pile of dead bounty hunters with respectable loot at the bottom.

I figure the game is meant to play low honor in the beginning so I maximize my looting ability early on.  Later on I only kill in missions or hunting.

Plus Arthur isn't a modern day rainbows and sparkles kinda guy who loves horses more than people.  He grew up in an era where a horse was a tool, and shooting it was better than killing a human.

Edit:  it's a game, these are not real horses.
                        Arthur is a mirror of yourself!

Bastard.. ;)
                            Bruh it‚Äôs a game the horses are not real even if they were they‚Äôre just animals they were made to assist us only they have no souls
            Why murder the horses :(
                I hate chasing them to loot the saddlebags and often times they kick you in the head and you die. If you‚Äôre gonna go outlaw go full outlaw.
        Lol, I think everyone spends like half their money on bounties
            I stock up on expensive valuables and only ever sell them when I need to buy something so I'm always broke and can just turn myself in to get rid of my bounties
                A genius amongst men
    Wait in story mode you can‚Äôt pay off bounties?
    I kill everything in red dead that threatens me
    I just started playing for the first time and my only bounties are due to the sheriff's deputy being an asshole.
    This is my housemate at the moment he‚Äôs restarted 3 times I walked in today he killed a whole town and discovered a Molotov will destroy a building, I got him this game and created a monster:‚Äô) but it‚Äôs funny

    Probably a group chat with lots of single sended emojis. Let us believe that until told otherwise.
        Don‚Äôt start... my friends are some horny teens spamming ‚Äòstickers‚Äô and I got to delete those.

Why haven‚Äôt Whatsapp created an option to turn of stickers yet
    I have several hundred two-step verifications unopened
    I came here to say that.
    Text flex
    I get scam texts now so I just tend to leave messages unopen Bc I can‚Äôt be bothered when 99% of them are that and the 1% is of actual importance - which I have pinned to the top so I don‚Äôt have to scroll through mindless bs lol. Got about 90 unopened rn üòÖ
    Crazy ex-girlfriend. Maybe two.
    Probably texts about the Georgia election
"Got mauled by a bear."

LOL yeah I know that feeling.
    It is definitely a memorable part of the first few hours of that game.
        I've somehow avoided it and I'm like 40 hours in. I typically shit myself and run when encountering bears.
    That's like getting sent to the clouds in skyrim because you tried to take on a giant camp on day one, you've missed out on the game if it didn't happen to you.
        Or better yet, the yeti bastard when you're trying to climb the Mountain to high hrothgar
        Yep lol.
    Love how that‚Äôs inserted.
aRe Ya WiNnInG, DaD??
This is awesome! I tried to get my dad to play newer games a few years back. He said he was super impressed with how far along graphics have come, but it hurt his head. (Dads legally blind with out his glasses, and is used to old school MK arcade style games.)
I love how raw and relatable this dad's experience is lol. It makes me so happy that so many people from different generations can enjoy this masterpiece
Liked by Arthur himself too. Nice
My dad passed in 2016 because of pancreatic cancer, he loved the Midwest/out west (Wyoming, Montana and what not) he took my brothers and I out there almost every summer until I was a teenager. 

This game came out 2 years later and I love it so much but damn do I wish he could have watched me play it or I watch him play it.  I learned video games because of him. Would have been something amazing to witness.

However, every time I play it now I think of him and it‚Äôs very nice.

Enjoy these moments with your dad ‚ù§Ô∏è
    My Dad died a few years ago now from Liver Cancer. Coming across the post made me really sad all of a sudden. It's those little things I can't do anymore with my Dad that hurt the most I think. I get a split second urge to call or something like that, then deflate because "Oh yeah...he's gone." Ugh. Most of the time I'm fine. When I'm not, it sucks. Cherish every dang moment you can. No matter how small.
    My dad passed in 2017 due to MS but he's the one that got me into tech and gaming - more so the Fallout series with Fallout 3 being the first one 

I even made a memorial of sorts in Fallout 76 (when I finally had something I could use - it's also in a shelter, budget is a pain) to kind of commemorate him and to have his memory in-game

He may have been my step dad but far as I'm concerned he's my real dad
Good boah
How's your dad's heart? He might not love that one bear lurking in a cabin in Big Valley.
    Jesus, even as a 22 year old my heart fuckin leaped when I saw that motherfucker lol I was so relaxed decided to look at this cabin and that hairy turd was there 

My initial reaction was to run but I automatically pulled my shotgun and started blasting lol thank you automatic reaction lol
Lol his lack of punctuation makes me think he's trying to play and respond to yiu
I‚Äôm 49 and just got it. Also still getting used to the controls. I just got to the point where I can save. Only died once so far.
Hes just ticking off Red Dead 2 memes
"Are ya winning, Dad?"
I should call my dad.
Took forever to download would have been my first statement
Man has 327 notifications, I‚Äôve got -2
Dad is like "Ok Google, look up Red Dead Redemption 2 gameplay on YouTube."
I'm gonna tell him.
got mauled by bear
You're blessed to have him as your dad and he's bless to have you as his son.
That should literally be on the back of the box
cool son/dad
Tell him to make sure he has high honor. He'll be thankful for that tip at the end of Chapter 6
Do you really have 327 unread messages?! That would drive me crazy lol On a related note it always warms my heart for some reason when my dad calls me son on texts idk why hahah
Roger Clark, Arthur's voice actor,  liked your tweet!
Yo Kirk open some damn texts my guy
Some of my best memories were sitting in the living room playing the first Red Dead Redemption while my dad watched (Tried to talk him into playing himself but he just refused) anyway he loves westerns so he just got a kick out of me playing it. Especially when I was hunting he thought that was really cool. Wish I could get him into playing games but I doubt it.
"took forever to download" -  welcome to modern gaming, dad. when you stare at it, it knows..
Spot on
I wish my old man liked gaming
He gets it.
Would‚Äôve been the perfect encapsulation of RDR2 if he‚Äôd said ‚ÄúThank you boah‚Äù instead of son.
That‚Äôs so awesome. I‚Äôm on my second play through, and I‚Äôm finding so many details that I forgot from the first time. It‚Äôs a masterpiece. Hope dad enjoys! So cool!
Yup, pretty much summed up the whole rdr experience
Same story here ^^ 3 generations now playing together  and can relate much more with my old man since we are playing red dead 2 together. It‚Äôs fun to see son, grandson, grandpa online together, what beauty of a game love it
How popular is this guys dad... Jesus, 327 messages
Getting mauled is like a rite of passage as a new player. I shrieked when it happened for the first time
Got mauled by a bear lol
I got it from my daughter 2 Xmas ago still playing, 4th playthrough underway
Are ya winning dad?
READ YOUR MSG FFS
Yep sounds about right
You lucky bastard you actually got a like from Roger Clark himself.
Yeah that pretty much sums up red dead 2üòÇ
Son it was amazing i got mauled by a bear it was an amazing experience for me and mr arthur
He summarized red dead perfectly
"Got mauled by a bear looks very realistic." Been there done that.
I wish my dad would play red dead 2. He likes to watch when I have the game hooked up in the living room, especially when I‚Äôm hunting. 

I‚Äôm gonna show this to him, hopefully the good ol‚Äô peer pressure will get him to play lol
I must say your dad used a whole lot of commas and dots lol
You know after I experienced the game for the first time and beat it it was the only game ever that had characters in it I actually cared about and when they started dying off or leaving it actually got me in the feels then when Arthur died (I got the honorable get John to safety ending) it was and still is the only game that made me tear up I tried to replay it twice after that but each time I lost Intrest and left but all the sudden today I got the urge to play it again except this time the feeling is different I think I‚Äôll be playing all the way to the end again
I had to go visit my extended family for Christmas for it to download üíÄüôè
Awwwe he loves it and its not total sarcasm lol
A dad who said Lol?
    I‚Äòm a dad and I write lol too.
Dad rly using lol? I sayüß¢
Imagine getting mauled by bears lol. I get mauled by cougars like a real chad
Are you sure he played it? I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the description from the back of the box ;)
My 25 year old son bought it for me as a birthday present back in June 2020, but I was the one who told him that I wanted it the day it came out. I was talking about it for 7 months straight before the release.

On my second playthrough.
I wish my dad had a PS4 so he could play this
(He doesn't play Xbox)
Such a great present! Amazing Idea.
I can sign under every word there.
Wish my dad had been a gamer.

I mean he played Myst‚Ä¶
    So do I. 
My dad only plays Korean and Chinese P2W games...üòë
I don't call it a game tho
You should probably book him in to see a therapist when he reaches the ending

                I‚Äôve never lost a horse doing it but I do use a spare horse and just stable the one I don‚Äôt want to lose.
        They carry the goods in their saddle bags. If they are calm you can take items from the saddle bags. If you do not calm them first you are likely to get kicked. Horses don‚Äôt need to be harmed.
            If they ain't calm my shotgun goes from buckshot to slugs
                Ill show that fuckin horse how much kick the semi auto shotgun has
            Sometimes they kick you anyway, though?
                Sometimes they are ok on one saddle bag and kick you when you go for the one on the other side.

        When getting chased I usually shoot the horses first.  The acrobatics of law enforcement flying off the instantly dead horse is hilarious.  Sometimes they hit hard enough where you dont even have to shoot the rider!

There a couple of places by cliffs where they start chasing you and a solid shot to the head or explosive ammo to the leg of the horse will send the guy flying all the way off the cliff (plus it actually blows off part of the horses leg!).  2 piles of bodies.  1 pile of dead horses with mad loot on the cliff top.  1 pile of dead bounty hunters with respectable loot at the bottom.

I figure the game is meant to play low honor in the beginning so I maximize my looting ability early on.  Later on I only kill in missions or hunting.

Plus Arthur isn't a modern day rainbows and sparkles kinda guy who loves horses more than people.  He grew up in an era where a horse was a tool, and shooting it was better than killing a human.

Edit:  it's a game, these are not real horses.

Bastard.. ;)
                Bruh it‚Äôs a game the horses are not real even if they were they‚Äôre just animals they were made to assist us only they have no souls
Why murder the horses :(
    I hate chasing them to loot the saddlebags and often times they kick you in the head and you die. If you‚Äôre gonna go outlaw go full outlaw.
I stock up on expensive valuables and only ever sell them when I need to buy something so I'm always broke and can just turn myself in to get rid of my bounties
    A genius amongst men
Woah! Kill horses???

I've played through twice, and got 100%, and ZERO horses have been killed knowingly.
    You can loot their saddlebags and not worry about getting kicked in the head. Plus you lose a lot of honor from killing horses, and the lower your honor is the better loot you get when you loot bounty hunters or law enforcers.
        Huh... TIL
