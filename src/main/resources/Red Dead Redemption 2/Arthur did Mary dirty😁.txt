[[Arthur did Mary dirty😁]]





This is amazing. She looks like a ghoul from Fallout 🤣
    Happy cakeday smoothskin
        Ahh, a fellow wanderer. Thanks dude! Take care!
            It be a sure shame if those rockets blew up with all those ghouls going on the “great” journey
        What do you mean smoothskin? You aren't a ghoul either
        Not bad for a smoothskin
        The Cake is a Lie.

I know different game but it fits.  ;)
    Exactly!

That flop out of the window, I can't breathe haha.

"Jaime!" BOING. That timing.
It’s 4 in the damn morning and I am dying of laughter here OMG. 😭😭
    If only her luggage arm blew off
        I wish she'd lost a leg
After all, she was Arthur's old flame...
    Buh dum tiss!
She’s hot
    She was. Now she's burnt
    Smokin'
        Crispy
If any of Rockstar employees or something is reading this

Please

Keep this one in GTA6
That’s a good look on her.
Jamie be like "This never would have happened with the Chelonians..."
Anakin Skywalker at the end
I’m guessing you needed to time that perfectly to get the cutscene to initiate.
that's disgusting, now where is my dynamite...?
I tried doing this but the mission instantly fails since I “spooked Mary”
Would.
    Ahaha ffs
    Wood is correct.
These are the greatest cutscenes tbh
The cut to the wideshot where's she's on fire is amazing.
Not gonna lie , Arthur was a savage. 
Even If you try to play “good” Arthur, that dude is a straight gangster on so many levels
Ha, that’s hilarious. Reminds me of something I did years and years ago with Max Payne. I forget the mission, but at some point go through a door and there’s a mini-cut scene with guys behind a desk going “It’s Payne, kill him!” but I threw a Molotov right as I was going through the door and the cut scene turns into the dude screaming on fire and the camera panned around him. Blew my 12 yo mind.
Jesus Christ she is lookin rough at the end there lmao
    Fallout ghoul looking mf

Arthur may never change but she did
"It's good to see you Mary". Woah boy that had me going at the end.
Holy fuck this is incredible, she lost her arm and received what I would assume is 3rd degree burns but just kept pushing through her dialogue. What a performer
Lmao the split second of screaming in agony before cutscene cuts in and she goes into regular dialogue
Oh, Arthur!
The one where the dude lit a trail of oil leaking out of the oil wagon and shot it and then entered the fence. Pure gold.
This is awesome
The end of that scene is even more hilarious she comes out of the station smoking.
Blew her out the window
The way it sends her through the window 😅
She’s missing an arm lol wonder if the suitcase would just be floating if it was the other arm
She was supposed to bring balance to the force
This is peak gaming
“Oh, Arthur…”
I love these
Jesus Christ man. Jesus Mary and Joseph’s Corn in the Cob Nibbling Christ.
Now I'm curious what happens when she goes to hand over the suitcase if her left arm blows off
She went straight to Ghost Rider.
Kkkkkkkkk
    Are you Brazilian?
        Yes! Why?
            I think someone downvoted you for laughing (there's a racist group called the KKK. He probably thought you were being racist)
                I know the racist group KKK, that's why I used more than three "k" and for information, here in Brazil it is normal to use 3 "k" for laughs and without any racist connotation
😂 this game never fails to amuse me
I just love how she flew out of the window :D
I love this 😆
Does this actually work
    Yeah. Have to time it perfect. I think you fail the mission though.

&#x200B;

At least, that's what happens when you do this to Hosea and Seamus.
Lmmfao 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lmaooooo 🤣🤣🤣
Hahahaha absolutely awesome
Damn that made laugh really hard 😂😂😂
Omg I’m rolling over here 🤣😂

Please OP do more of these !!!
What she deserves imo. "Oh Arthuuurrr"
If anyone deserved this it was Mary.

And here I am this whole time thinking that not excepting this hoe’s missions was the way to go…
Omg! That’s one of the best things i saw on RDR2!
I am dead 🤣🤣☠️
The sound of the dynamite whistling by and the timing of her speaking vs the explosion are perfect.
Arthur has a particular type...
LOL
Poor Arthur
father wouldn't know fire if i his bed caught on fire💀
Arthur: It was good to see ya

Mary: 🧟‍♀️👩‍🦲
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn…
Going out the window is the best part 😂
How’d she start on fire!? lol
Is it too bad if it felt a little good?😆
I can’t stop laughing
Fuckin dying over here. 🤣🤣
Lmaoo she flew out the fuckin window
Arthur is just fuck mary. Idc.
Arthur experiencing PTSD, colorized
Real time cutscenes will always be better
LMFAO!!!!!!!
I wonder what would have happened if she lost her other arm.
Aww he lit her heart up one final time
Turned her ass into darth vader
Yo it's like that Pink Floyd album
What if she had to use her right arm to pick up the suitcase?  Or, did the game realize that she had no right arm and it used her left?
The way she flew out this window was fucking hilarious
I'm glad somebody blew that bitch up
I think I need to do a full playthrough sabotaging the cutscenes
This is why I keep coming back to these RDR2 reddit posts. After months I still see something new and funny!! 🤣🤣
The part the absolutely sends me is the fucking ZING
Damn! Shock is one hell of a drug! “And *YOU* Arthur and *YOU*!”
That is fucking amazing. Learn something new every day!
I gotta figure how they did this. I tried a bunch of times during the same cutscene, and either they would run when I threw it, or if you get too close Arthur automatically puts it away.
I Need more of this 😂
Right out the window and good bye arm, lol
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
Mary the black night and King Arthur Morgan of Camelot......

It's a flesh wound...
Your arms off!
No it isn't! 
Yes it is!
I've had worse...
You lie!
Oh Arthur
That’s what she deserves
