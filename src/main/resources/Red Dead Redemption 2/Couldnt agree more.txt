At least now we know The golden Joysticks aren't something to be happy or excited for.
    Lmao thats true
    All the 9 year olds be default dancing at this news
        I've never wanted to hurt a child before, but whenever I see a kid at the gas station doing a fork-knife dance, I am suddenly overcome with an urge to drop kick them.
            Wuts a fortnite dance?
                It's a dance.
                    Show me?
                        No. Save some braincells

As someone over 18 who plays both RDR2 and Fortnite, I'm disappointed that RDR2 didn't come out on top.
    But we know who the best game is, and thats just an award
        Exactly. RDR2 is one of the greatest games I've ever played.
            If I had only one game to play forever, it would be rdr2. That's a fact
                It'll take you the rest of your life to find, and correctly kill, the legendary songbirds
                    There are no legendary songbirds. There may be certain birds that are very rare, but no legendary birds at all.
                        Yet. There will be a songbird slayer role which has 100 ranks in Online in 2021.

You’ll have to achieve rank 20 in tree climbing, with at least 10,000 trees climbed before you can progress. In one session, and a crash will mean starting from 0 again.
                            Came back to look at the top of all time. This makes me sad
                I wish. I've played since it can out daily pretty much. I hate online now and can barely play it. Like fix your fucking animal spawns Rockstar. I work 10-14 hours a day. I wanna hunt an relax when I get home. I DO NOT want it to take 3 weeks to fill my trader wagon because I can't find any large animals. 

Story mode is fuckin outstanding though and so replayable. I'd still choose Fable LC, or Skyrim I think.
                Minecraft would imo be the best game to play forever. Red Dead would definitely be a close second though.
                    I don’t play Minecraft. Isn’t it virtual LEGO?
                        Jesus
        Exactly, some dumb kid said to me roblox was better that rdr2.
            Those aren't even relatively comparible. Rdr2 is such a story driven, open world game with developed characters and refined details how can Roblox even be used in the same sentence.
                That’s what I said. But some bots say no. Like how dumb can you fucking get?
                    Stubborn and retarded, and unable to appreciate or at least acknowledge quality.
                        I know. It is insanely stupid why a game of a bunch of fucking block heads lagging and killing each other Is better than rdr2
    We all know that was bullshit. RDR2 won, regardless
        U cant just say it won. Although it may have deserved  it, you cant just announce that. Thats like the “trump isnt My president” bullshit
            Watch me.

#IT WON
            It won!
            Wait... do you think people who say "X isn't my President" literally mean they claim he isn't the actual President?
                What? No, its when people say trump isnt MY president, its stupid because he factually is. Its not up for debate. Its a stated fact that donald j trump is your president if you are a member of the us
                    Of course he is *literally* the POTUS. That's not what that statement means though. They are saying that he dosn't *represent* their beliefs. If you like him or not, you understand he is a decisive figure. People who don't like what he stands for are ashamed to have him represent their country. 

Its not quite a metaphor, but closer to one than a literal statement. Which is basicly the same thing being said here. *Obviously* RDR2 didn't win that award. But it is the better game. 

They are not saying it literally won the award, only emphasizing that it should have.
                        Thats not true, people who believe it should have won say that it SHOULD have won. Not that it did, which is not true.
                    The bottom line here is that this is reddit. If I posted a picture of my face deepfaked into a pineapple captioned “I am a pineapple” that doesn’t mean I factually think I’m a pineapple. And it really doesn’t mean you should break down the rather simple logic that I am NOT in fact- a pineapple.
            1. It did.

2. He isn't.

                    We found the 9 year old everyone!!! \^\^\^\^\^\^
            And you would be wrong to say such blasphemous bullshit.
                Yeah why the fuck are people downvoting factual truths like what
                    Welcome to reddit
                        J
            Trump isn’t my president, because he won’t be a president soon
                He is factually your president. Even if you dont like him, he is by definition your presdient.
                    I don’t have a real opinion on him, plus, presidents are the most forgettable thing, stop making politics out of nothing
                        What? Im explaining how, although rdr2 should have won, it literally didnt win. People cant just say “it won” even though it factually did not win. I myself prefer rdr2 over fortnite, but fortnite is, by definition, game of the year. Even if you dont agree w it.
                            Yeah but you should know on reddit if you say trump the world ends realize that and you should be good and yes, trump is the American president and yes Fortnite won who gives a shit it’s an award that only the fandom that won will remember and trump is someone that only the people who hate on him will remember I’ll probably forget writing this stupid fucking argument where I’ll probably look at it on accident and cringe thinking “holy shit i was dumb” I’m cringing right now writing this because I don’t think it’s good enough, I’m finding plot holes in my own fucking argument and usually those plot holes aren't used now I’m just ranting about how insecure during arguments I am.
                                Cool i still hate redditors besides u, the one logical one
                                    I am far from logical bud, like me having a mental breakdown about how the longer my arguments are the more plot holes they get.
    Me too...
    I'm 34 and play both. Red dead is a masterpiece and is the pinnacle of gaming. With that said Fortnite is played more and appeals to a larger audience. The way the meta always changes and keeps the game fresh is something that I have never experienced in my almost 30 years of playing video games. Red dead should have won but fortnite is deserving of the title.
        I’ve never gotten into online gaming so I’m a little biased
            Gotcha, I love both online multiplayer and single player. Unfortunately multiplayer is taking over studios. To much money in it to waste time on single players. Multiplayer is like bars for millenials. Why go out and spend a fortune at the bar when you can stay home, smoke a joint, drink a beer and shoot your homie in the face.
                This but without video games. And me instead of my mate.
                    #HashtagSuicideForTheHomies
                Yikes am I a boomer trapped in a millennials body? I go to the bar all the time.
                    No, you're a person with normal social skills who was probably raised with a quality male role model in the home. I doubt you think e-girls are alluring, also. Probably don't cry about "chads" (whatever tf that means).

If you were a Boomer trapped in a Millennial body you'd be lying about going to Woodstock and/or Vietnam, and divircing your wife for your thot secretary.
                You just described my Friday nights
        >rdr2 is the pinnacle of gaming

Shit casuals say 

(no I don't play fortnite)
            "HeRpA DuR, iM a GaMEr aNd CaLl PeOpLe I DoNT AgReE WiTH CaSUals."

Do you actually have something to add to the conversation or do you just go around spewing your mental diarrhea all over the place?
                Yeah I want to add to the conversation that it's stupid to unironically call any game the pinnacle of gaming, especially one without any particular claim to that title
                    The graphics are realistic and the story is more compelling than any game of the last several years. You have one that you feel better deserves the title?
                        How many games do you play a year to feel confident making that story claim (I'm gonna pretend you didn't use graphics as one of your two points)

And yeah I'd feel that the "pinnacle of gaming" would have maybe uh exceptional gameplay that sets it apart? Portal 2 has a great story and also a unique, challenging, and compelling fundamental gameplay concept that gets applied in new ways constantly throughout the game. I'm not even a huge portal fan that's just an easy example.
                            I literally play every major title that comes out and alot of the minors/indie games. I'm 34 and started on the Atari and original NES. I've played pretty much every mainstream console that has ever came out. That's fine that you dont agree, obviously art is subjective. Portal 2 was a great puzzle game but it is nowhere near what RDR2 is. I've have just chilled for hours, hunting and soaking in the atmosphere. Which I dont find myself doing much in any other game. Maybe I'm partial cause I grew up watching westerns with my dad. There was many times during the story missions I had actual emotion fueled reactions. Whether it be the Braithwaite Manor mission when you go down the long driveway with the crew or the plot point that marks a end to one of the characters. Great story telling, awesome game loop, beautiful graffix. RDR2 is my personal favorite game of this generation and has raised the bar for future single player games.
                                I just think it's hard to make an argument for the gameplay being truly exceptional, and impossible to make an argument for "pinnacle of gaming" without exceptional gameplay. You could make a case for it being the pinnacle of open-world simulation-lite games but there are so many games with more depth and refinement in the core mechanics (the gameplay). 

The closest thing I can think of to a pinnacle is super smash bros melee honestly. The core gameplay is just so engaging that it's one of the most popular games in its genre 20 years after release. Compare that to rdr2, which gets eclipsed in story/aesthetic by plenty of literature/film (and arguably other games) and in gameplay. Noone will be streaming rdr2 in 20 years because the only thing that truly sets it far apart from other games is the fact that its developer has by far the most experience in its genre (a genre with prohibitively high development costs that limit the number of competitors).
        Ok boomer, every competitive pvp game has a meta. Overwatch, bf, COD, LoL....there are metas for every hero and weapons.... fortnite is trash, wasn’t the meta at one point a giant robot that could kill everything?
            "Ok boomer" haha, really showing your intelligence kid.
                Says the guy assuming I’m a kid. You’re 34 that makes you a boomer....
                    No, it doesnt jackass. 34 makes me a millenial. Boomers are in their 50s/60s
                        Nah mate you’re in denial
                            Whatever kid. Maybe next time ask your parents before you jump on to reddit.
                                I love it how my original comment was about every game having metas and the metas in fornite are lame with giant robots and shit.....yet you’re still bothered by the “ok boomer” comment. Maybe you should go speak to your mommy cuz seems like you need some growing up bud.
                                    I admit it, it's the first time I have ever been called a boomer. Especially since you dont even know what a boomer is. That was more interesting than the other shit that fell out of your head.
    I really cannot take the gaming opinions of adults who play Fortnite seriously.

It's the Doritos of video games.
        What's wrong with Doritos?
            A lot of things, actually. Ask that question to your doctor or a nutritionist some time.
    It reflects on your name
    Yeah i agree but rdr2 should have gotten it i dont play that orther gamebin my opinion its stupid rdr2 is so way better
        It's okay to have a different opinion. I'm more partial to RDR2, anyways. The only reason I started playing Fortnite was because my little bro wanted someone to play with him.
            Oh yeah well thats a good a reason to play any game lol but yeah i play orther games but i am very partial to RDR2 and RDR2 online
Fortnite is only fun if you git gud, which means playing 5/6+ hours a day. RDR2 is enjoyable no matter how much time you put into it bc the story/gameplay is so good.
    I play RDR to avoid the annoyance of watching my target build a scale replica of the World Trade Center in the span of a second and a half because they got scared of a leaf touching their shin lol
    6 hours a day of Fortnite, what is that a torture test
        That’s minimum
            installing the Epic Store launcher is torture enough for me. Good thing I'll do neither
    This is very true I was good at the game at season 6/5 and was enjoying it. But all of a sudden everyone got good and I didn’t like it afterwards and consider it garbage also because of how much they changed the game they don’t listen to the community
    Fortnite is exactly the kind of game I despise: online multiplayer, no story, constant grinding for stuff, in game purchases to get around grinding for said stuff.

I incidentally don’t like Red Dead Online for this reason though they at least put in effort to create story.
    But Fortnite is a competitive multiplayer game. That’s the entire point. Your analysis is like saying Red Dead 2 is only fun if you do the quests or explore the world.
Oh yeah! RDR2 needs a beast pc to run
    NASA super computer
        Still wont run it 4k 60 fps
            Looking at the specs for KOTOR and it runs in 480p 👀 might give it a run for it’s money
                Knight of the old republic? Thats way old
                    Oh yes 😎😂
                    Just because its old doesnt mean its not good!
    I play with a I7 7700k, 16GB, 1070 8GB, and it runs fine on max settings.
        "cries in 1440pp"
    I run it at 1440 on a 5700 xt just fine, and I’d consider it to be a very middle range card.
Golden joysticks really don’t mean much I don’t think. Bit I really was surprised how RDR2 managed to win everything save for GOTY. God of war was a great game tho I’ve heard
    Having played both, God Of War wins by a hair for me with its airtight gameplay, it’s damn near perfect.
        I’ve heard nothing but good things about it. I’ll maybe give it a try one day as I don’t own a PS4
    I have played both God of War and RDR2. Both amazing. Also was curious about Fortnite at soem point. My guess is people play it because their friends do. Nothing special
        That and it’s on a lot more platforms and requires low specs for pc so there’s definitely a larger Audience than RDR and GoW which is PS exclusive
            And cross platform creates a enormous user base. That’s gotta help. 

I have no interest in playing it still.
    only 'proper' video game awards is just that, the VGA's, at least in my opinion
        I agree
    Recently finished both. And I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the way the game plays in god of war. Not a single cut scene. Like watching a movie.
Fortnight appeals to the lowest common denominator.
    I hear thst a lot. Its true
    It has players that will spend 1000 dollars on skins.
Is the golden joysticks a big thing because ive literally never heard of it/ cannot remember ever hearing about it
    Me neither until now. But they dont seem to knkw much about gaming, judging from this
How does Fortnite even win game of the year in a year it didn’t release?
This meme is almost 2 years old
“It was time for Thomas to leave, he had seen everything”
Exactly,  considering fortnite is just a cash grab shit game. Ahit even EA managed to put out a royale that seems less money hungry than fortnite, and thats saying something.
    I'm gonna say it. Fortnite is a good game.

Now before you fucking smash the downvote button and break your mouse / screen, hear me out.

Fortnite is constantly updating and adding new content, the community is active, and no you don't have to be a fucking pro to enjoy it. I'm certainly not, I only play maybe once or twice in a given month and I have fun playing it. It's a free game, which means I can play it with all of my friends and cross platform is a thing now too.

If you hate the game just because of the player base and the hype around it, take a step back and take an actual objective look at it.

And yes, I am 18+.
        I don't care for the player base but the game just doesn't appeal to me in general. 

The hype doesn't annoy me, while I think at this point I believe most are tired of Fortnite being the only game the media is aware of, as with anything if you talk about it enough your interest in hearing about it more goes away. 

Updates and extra content aside, the base game will always stay the same, so if you're not into the BR genre there's no amount of updates they can add that will sway that opinion. 

With that said, I'm of the mindset to each their own and could care less about an award being given to the obvious popular vote. 

Gaming isn't and shouldn't be an argument of which is better as you can't compare RDR2 and Fortnite given how different the gameplay is. 

Do I agree that Fortnite is the game of the year based on gameplay? Absolutely not. But it should be obvious to most why it won considering it's held insane amounts of players since it's release.
            This. My point is simply that the game gets bad rep for being publicised so heavily and the player base being mostly kids.

One thing I will say is that fortnite is not completely a Battle Royale game. Aside from creative mode and save the world, the Battle Royale version of the game offers community made game modes aside from Solo, Duos, Squads and Team Rumble as well, which can be pretty fun. Notably the grappling gun one (forget the name) and the Beach Assault were very fun and not Battle Royale based.
            RDR2 isn’t appealing to many too. People find it more like a chore to loot each and every object. The problem of weapons stuck in horse randomly. The game is slow pace which chase of most people. Also, the online is a complete shit, I can’t play the game with fun online as it constantly kick me out (server issue) and the game is full of grinding.

People who say that grinding is there because there’s nothing else to do online are just idiots. Have you played single player? The game literally gives you access to all the things in single player and I’m not even bored a min. I do whatever I please (hunt, shoot, ride on my horse, do stranger mission, go to salon) and I don’t have to grind in single player thus I can enjoy the game. Online is just for cash grab and you people don’t realise it but just supporting it blindly. 

Fortnite is a wonderful game (I hate the player base too) and it’s fast paced, addictive and also purely free to play. No one asks you to grind or pay to get what you want (guns/perks), only aesthetics which doesn’t affect your gameplay. Whereas RDR2 online requires you to grind forever to level up and get money to buy the gun you need so you can have an advantage (also the perks that boosts your skills). This gives an undue advantage to people who buy money and also who played the game for more time. 

If I bought RDR2 recently, I would be punished for going online as people would be having advantages of having good guns/horse/perks and I can’t have a level competition.

Just because you love RDR2 doesn’t mean those who think fortnite is good are wrong. I personally love RDR2, but I respect when fortnite won the award. It deserved it.

If a game garners more amount of players, then there is something in that game that does something better than any other games. Also fortnite has a single player or PvE type of gameplay which people need to buy (where they can play against zombies). So it has different modes too.

P.S: I’m more into Pubg than fortnite but I still respect the decision.
                I wasn't really talking about RDR2 at all other than saying the two games can't be compared to one another. 

I finished RDR2 to completion and have played a handful of games on Fortnite, I would say overall my experience on RDR2 was far superior, but again to each their own, Fortnite just doesn't appeal to me as a whole.
        I dislike the game because it to me represents everything that’s wrong with online FPS games now. Skins and grinding and unlocks and perks. I miss CS 1.6 and DOD where you had a KD rate not some pointless pink knife.  

Also I’m not interested in those types of games anymore. I like Hell Let Loose though, the players are all great and team oriented. For the most part.
        It's getting constantly updated because it's a cash grab and has to stay relevant. It's still a shit game. The community is active because it's free and relevant. It's still a shit game. It's player base is mostly kids and you tubers, which makes it still a shit game.
        Purely from a content update/addition perspective, Epic runs train on R*. 

I’m still waiting for GTA V single player DLC that was promised.
    How is Fortnite money hungry by putting out optional cosmetics for sale on a FREE GAME?
    Yep and the game looks like a cartoon. No wonder children love it
    A cash grab? You can literally play the game for free, indefinitely. Only cosmetics are paid and you can even earn some for free. Apex literally had a $175 skin set (Iron Crown Event) where the best item could only be unlocked if you either spent $175 on in-game currency or lootboxes.
    How is fortnite a cash grab, also it used to be a very good game
        Used to now all it is is nostalgia from seasons 1-3
            Yes but when it won the award it was still a very good game
        Haha, welcome to RDR2 subreddit. People call fortnite players as kids but only if you look clearly, you’ll find most of the “adults” in RDR2 player base acts like “kids”.

Downvoting someone who has different opinion? That’s childish.

Also, fortnite just sells skins for money which doesn’t affect the gameplay and the game is free with dedicated server is considered cash grab.

RDR2 sells guns/horse/perks for money to be easily accessed through money and the game is very expensive with no dedicated server but only player based servers are called “well they need money to provide good game, so it is worth it”. 

I play RDR2 regularly and I agree RDR2 is not for everyone and it has very versatile gameplay and the serene feel in single player. But don’t diss a game because they have a larger fan base.

I’ve seen little to zero complaints about the online problems in fortnite community/fan base. Now go to RDR2 online forums and you’ll see millions of complaints from the early access time and still those problems haven’t been fixed. And you call RDR2 to be masterpiece. I paid a huge amount for a game which I can’t play half of the game (only single player works perfectly), and you expect it to be a masterpiece or win best game award? 

I love the game but I find no difference in immature fans in RDR community too. Grow up, fortnite won. Nothing we can do except congratulate the developers.
            I mean I am a kid lol (14) but I don’t understand the hate for fortnite, at the time of the award it was a better game than RDR2 for sure
Seriously? A shameless pubg copy gets GOTY but not one of the biggest and most detailed games of all time? Bullshit
    this didnt age well
What the heck!? Hell no! 
I wish they create a boundary between multiplayers and single player story games when it comes to awarding
Multiplayers are for fun and pleasure for me. 
But single player story driven games? Well its affects your emotions by being attached to every protagonist of the game. 
A different kind of feel to it just like RDR2. Just sayn ✌️
    But you can dance in fortnite
        Ehem, are you trying to imply that you can't in rdr2?

https://youtu.be/8LVFZiE7d_E
    I agree 100%
Please tell me they at least only compared the online part
    Probably! I dont know for sure. It has to be so
I've got to be honest I think this is a fair win, people can hate fortnite all they want but the truth is fortnite  for the longest time has seen constant weekly updates, huge hyped up events and refreshing themes every season until recently (with the whole season 2 being delayed) red dead on the other hand as much as I think the single player is a master piece in so many ways I do think the multiplayer side has significantly hurt it even today with how much they have improved the online there are still alot of on going issue's and alot more that needs to be done, the online part of red dead doesint even hold a candle to fortnite. 

Some might argue that the online and single player are separate in which I would have to disagree, when making a decision based on the game of the year reward you have to take into account all content of a game if you don't include a section of a game than it can't be reviewed fairly, if red dead didn't have the online part I do think it would beat fortnite hands down but last year and even now the online prevents that.

I don't hate the online I've been playing it alot lately it's just a personal comparisons, maybe within the next year the online will reach a point where it is game of the year worthy in which I am hopeing for.
    I have to agree, Fortnite is a quality game and I believe a similar effort has been put into. Yes I love Red Dead way better but the multiplayer was huge disappointment. I honestly feel like it should not have had one and just had DLC I would have gladly paid another $60 for twice the story line rather than $60 for in game currency and frustrating game play. Online story mode is garbage.
        Not sure why you'd need to buy online currency.  I'm practically swimming in money just by playing the game as intended.
    It's not a fair win cause one was 2017 and the other 2018 so fortunate shouldn't have been a contender
        It is fair, it’s not judged for when a game is released, the games are judged and awarded on the state they are in during that year in which fortnite had a really good year last year because of the chapter 2 thing it had going while red dead suffered from the online part because of the lack of content and heaps of bugs it had for majority of the year.
Rdr2 is the best game all around ever created.
    Not trying to be mean, and it is your opinion,

But thats dumb
Yup. Loved Fortnite at the time, but God of War IV and RDR2 deserved it hands down more.
They came out in different years though
The answer to that is accessibility. Fortnite is cross platform, highly accessible, widely supported. There's a reason so many people play it.

As much as I love the game (RDR2), playing it over a year after its release,  I'm not surprised it didn't win. The game has one of the rockiest PC releases of all time. The PC market isn't a market you can just alienate anymore. 

As a standalone title, it did deserve game of the year imo, but Rockstar and it's practices did not.
I bet if you asked pro game critics, not even one would choose Fortnite over Red Dead 2. Or just someone with a brain and not "horseshit for brains".
I’m 15 and I think fortnite is the source of all cancer... May I vote?
    You have my blessing to do so man
They don't even have the attention span to appreciate the story line of RDR2.


Also don't forget kids chose Justin Bebier over Linkin Park in the Kids Choice Awards.
I had a somewhat heated argument with some homies; I was mad that a friend didn’t *want* to play RDR2 for I forget what reasons


I was saying that this game is probably **THE** game to play from the last four decades.
    Unless you are PC gamer and the thing wont run no matter how speced out ur pc is because of the endless bugs.

I acknowledge this game is a work of art. I haven't been this obsessed with anything in years-- yet I almost refunded because the DRM had some stupid kind of error and wouldn't even open. So a software that i didn't even want (Steam purchase) designed to do constant network checks and facilitate social play wasn't allowing me to run my SINGLEPLAYER game. This ticks off a lot of boxes on the list of everything wrong with the direction that the game industry is going in.
        Console peasants come out on top this time 👏
            Indeed. Hypothetically if you could run anything, this is still THAT game
These kind of Award shows are just a popularity contest. They don't mean anything and if anyone actually takes this seriously, then you need to reconsider your life choices....
Well considering Fortnite has a larger demographic and RDR2 has a few problems that hold it back from perfection, I understand.
TIY the Golden Joysticks are garbage.
I like Fortnite but RDR2 is definitely the better game here
As someone not at legal age to play red dead this greatly disappoints me
    I think mental age and maturity are to be taken in consideration aswell. Ninja is nearly 30 and does Fortnite dances like its nothing lmao
        *Guess I’m legal then*
            I would say so
We should raise the voting age to 30
    Im nearly thirty and still watch Teen Titans Go
        I feel you. Nearly thirty and all my hobbies are those of a teenager. Maybe men never grow up
Hell, with all the recent problems with Rdr2, I'd probably vote... Well, not for fortnite, that's for sure, but I'd probably vote for Satan. RDR2 is a masterpiece, imo, but trying to play online is a total crap shoot.
    I dont ever play online. The story is way too good
        Ikr?!?! I still spend hours playing it, despite having completed the epilogue. I'm currently trying to get to 100%, which I've never attempted with any other game, just because I love it.
What are the Golden Joysticks? Never heard of it before this right here.
    I dont know lol. But if they give awards to Fortnite instead of Red Dead I dont care about them
You guys may not like it, but the most popular game of the year is most likely going to win game of the year. Lol
    Truth hurts. Being popular though, does not mean it is the best game
        Does not but when it comes to fan voting, you’re not necessarily voting for the best game
I respect your input and your comment, the idea of fortnite was cool, the visuals were fun and not too serious, but because I'm 25, I rarely need any attention to be "cool" that's simply a high school portrayal of popularity, and is almost completely useless in reality. I simply despise fortnite, and more importantly I hate epic games, my favorite game was bought out by them and im slowly hating rocket league for it. So yes, RDR2 is way better, but I dont agree that fortnite is "not bad" I still think it is garbage all the same, pubg was a far better alternative, albeit it has it's fair share of problems. But tbh most battle royals games have very little replay value in my opinion, I do not find any of them to be something to spend any surmountable amount of time on
Fuckin nasty
Gatekeeper
Oh really? A free game wins?
Also fortnite came out the year before so it was major bullshit
    Doesnt stop people from voting for the Witcher 3 every year
At first I thought you were taking about fortnite winning and I was like wtf
At an awards show I don't care about (which is probably all of them)? So what?
2 year old meme being posted because Fortnite bad, give karma

What a garbage post.
    Thats Reddit for you
People still play that trash?
    Still very popular
I feel bad for the people that feel like Fortnite deserved it, RDR2 is the best game in the past decade, we need a new plague for all these kids
    /r/killthosewhodisagree/
    Kill kids for playing a game? You want them to vote for rdr2 even if they didn't play it? Fortnite is 12+, rdr2 is 18+.
        Should ask these 12 year olds what they like about Fortnite.
            cartoony visuals, fun gameplay for them, culture they can be immersed in (dances, toys, etc.) 

no one has the right to tell someone else what to enjoy. i dont like fortnite because it not my type of game, but i dont hate kids for liking it. i think its a little cringey when kids do the dances in public, but we have all done cringey shit when we were kids.
        Yes
If this is real someone is gonna die
    Lmaoooo chill my dude
So true
Rdr2 is undoubtably one of the best games ever made
Blasphemous
I don't really play much games after having a baby. But I loved playing RDR2 I think its one of the best games I've ever played. I didn't like Fortnite at all.
    Do you like your baby though
The amount of fun I had playing rdr2’s story tops any other game. The amount of times I have replayed the first couple chapters I could probably re-enact each scene
How can a years old game be Goty? Isn't there a requirement that it has to release in that year or something?
Fortnite came out in 2017 so it wouldn't have been qualified
Red dead’s singleplayer alone beats fortnite, but they probably lost because the online brought the game down
This is old news.. And the Golden joystick is like the onion for gaming
Omfg, did this actually happen? And how the **** is a 3 year old game getting game of the year? It's time is done, that isnt how this shit works. You dont see citizen Kaine or titanic getting Oscar's anymore, BECAUSE IT'S OLD.

God damn children ruining the awards and robbing RDR2.
Fortnite didn't introduce me to an amazing cast of characters, nor did it tell me a compelling story. 

Comparing Fortnite to RDR2 is like comparing a big mac to a ribeye steak cooked by Salt Bae himself.

Sure, they're both edible, and they both might taste good...but only one could be considered a masterpiece.
Rockstar should have fixed their issues with servers. It would have been a cinch.
Lord forgive me for what my dead eyes about to do.
Woow
Rdr2 needed a full coop campaign. Also Rockstars monitization of multi player is very greedy.
Kind of hard to compare when they are completely different games. RDR2 is obviously more compelling and has a better story but fortnite has had an impact on a larger portion of the gaming community. Apples and oranges. Why can’t we love both??
Its like comparing Mcdonalds and Mirazur. Or the Godfather: Part 2 and Transformers.
Fortnite bad upvotes to the left

<--------------
Although I agree rdr2 is amazing, it's kind of stupid discussing it in a subreddit that is obviously biased
And you tell me the world is fine
Well maybe rockstar shouldn't have delayed it's pc release then maybe I'd give a fuck.
Fortnite probably should have won. I agree that red dead is a far superior game to Fortnite but I believe that game of the year should be a game that affects society the most and creates the biggest impact and I don’t think a game has done that like Fortnite has since minecraft was at its height.
I've got a feeling the person who posted this and all the people who upvoted this post are the ones who are under 18.If not by birth then they're mentally under 18 years old.
gwt it? because FARTSHIT BAAAAAAAAD FOOTSHIT BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaAazaaaaaasaaaaaasaaad


give me my le reddit platinum you fuxking retards
And why most top 10 GOTY lists all had to have some kind of disclaimer explaining why Fortnite isn't on there, same thing for PUBG last year. Because everyone's playing it but everyone also knows it's really shit...
Well it was my game of the year... PSN stats say I spent 392 hours playing RDR2 this year... 3 hours playing fortnite...
Y’all still beating this dead horse?
The kids in my class all like fortnite and I’m just siting in the corner looking at rdr2 memes
Wasn't this last year? Are people still harping on about it?
Well now we know that we'll never have to get excited for this award show every agian
*holy music stops*
Wtf is the golden joysticks
Big F
Red Dead is way better like how did Fortnite even take them over?!
Fortnite completely changed the cultural landscape for games while RDR2 is a niche, kinda artsy game for a specific group of people so I agree with the choice.
Confession: I think a battle royale game mode for the RDR 2 map would be...interesting. (Does it exist? I dont play online...) Albeit have some unique features and rules.
Do people seriously still bitch about Fortnite?
Ew, why Fortnite
Kinda disagree cos I'm 11 and me and like the entire grade hate fortnite.
A game Made with a shitty engine lost against a masterpiece who development took 8 years ? Having a free game with 20$ skins doesn’t make it a “good game” just take a look at fornite, no effort, rdr2 is so detailed
I mean tbf fortnite left more of a cultural impact
Oops nobody is watching your award show anymore
Fortnite is horse shit compared to rdr2
How the fuck? Fortnite is garbage.. it’s literally who can build better wins doesn’t matter who has better aim.. it’s a shit game.
Thats a shame
Kids these days......-_-
If theater kids have to watch good musicals get robbed at the Tonys every year then I think gamers can get through this too.
I am 16 and I really enjoy Red Dead Redemption 2. It’s a fun game to play. The online is a fun to play with friends.
unbelievable...
What in tarnation?
I disagree with this post
Lol Fortnite didn't even come out in 2018
    It also didn't come out in 2019
wait people still think they're cool by hating on popular games?
Because fortnite is forever evolving. Constantly changing  while red dead only focuses on online every once in a while.
Fortnite is COMPLETE AND TOTAL GARBAGE... literally every ounce of fortnite can be found at your local landfill. Not joking, go look...
    You sound like a edgy 13 yr old trying to seem like he’s cool. Fortnite wasn’t a horrible game in itself but the culture that was built around it sucked all the fun out. Red Dead is still a better game but Fortnite itself isn’t bad either.
I don’t play Fortnite, but it definitively deserves it more than RDR2
    Fortnite is dog shit compared to rdr
it would make more sense if the comment read:  "This is why people under the age of 18 SHOULDN'T BE allowed to vote"

&#x200B;

the way the comment is currently phrased, it implies that ONLY people over 18 voted, meaning that those over 18 actually chose Fort Nite, which would be stupid, because only kids would choose that game as goty
    No, they said what they meant and you missed the point.  "Only kids would choose Fortnite as GOTY" is exactly the reason why you have to be 18 to vote for, you know, important things.
Fortnite isn't even a complete game, its still considered in Beta.
    “Early access”
So I don't think Fortnite should have won however it's not a terrible game either because at the end of the day it's just a game. It's a fairly well made game and the developers put a lot of time and effort into managing and attempting to keep it fresh for it's audience. 

I'm just not the audience it's meant for is all which is why I wish RDR2 won but it's just the opinion of some group of people in the end. Hell who knows years down the line those same people may change their opinions.
Bruv im 16 and rdr2 is way better
Illiterate motherfuckers
Yo you all need to stop drinking the coolaid. If you think RDR2 has a larger impact on video games as a whole then Fortnite you’re fucking crazy, I get if you don’t like Fortnite, Battle Royals are not everyone’s cup of tea, but come the fuck on.
Maybe it’s because fortnite actually plays like it supposed to. I hate it as much as the next guy, but until red dead works like it’s supposed to it’s shit. All red dead does is frustrate me.
Realistically, fortnite had a social presence rdr2 never did. Based on that popularity I'd say it qualifies as GOTY.
It won GOTY for a specific category, not overall. God of War won overall GOTY, and tbh I think that’s fair. Rdr2 is an amazing game, but any game that has “mount” and “choke this person for no reason” as the same button doesn’t deserve GOTY lol
The only people that don't like Fortnite are the 1s that completely suck at it and can't get the hang of building. RDR2 is and really good game but it gets boring fast... I play both and I'm 32 but I'll go a month or 2 with out playing RDR2 once I get bored of it but I do the same with Fortnite too.
 Shut the fuck up
Rdr2 won the popular vote but fortnite had more electoral votes clearly. Holy shit history is repeating!!!
Unpopular opinion: rdr2 is not so good as many of u think here. It has best open world ever, but in terms of plot it is bad. It has same engine as gta which means shooting sucks and fighting too. PC launch was bad and game is full of bugs which developeers don't give a fuck about. End of Arthur story seems artificial and last mission for John raises more unanswered questions which writers were lazy to answer through storytelling. On the other hand we have fortnite -- first battle royale which was built with battle royale in mind. PS: I played both, and I didn't play fortnite for a long time.
    If you want answers, play red dead 1. It's the sequel to red dead 2.
        I know about existence of rdr1, I am PC peasant though. Even if I get my hands on ps4 and play it still -- there will be no answer about last mission of rdr2: what Micah and Dutch were doing in shack? What dialog between them and John means (John was like: "U know why I am here, Dutch" and Dutch: "Me too, son", etc).
            Being a pc gamer isn't all that bad, regardless of what people say (better than mobile I say lol). Well, if you have a dirty mind like I do, you can easily imagine what they were doing in that shack, but the clean version has them hiding out there with their new gang. When John showed up there, Dutch knew that John wanted to kill Micah, and was planning to do that very thing himself. He was letting John know that, without letting on to Micah (let's be honest here, Micah wasn't the brightest of the bunch, just mean and greedy). Halfway through the story mode, I started to really want to kill Dutch with every action I took. At that point, I didn't know that RDR1 was the sequel, and that it was about John going after Dutch, at the behest of the US government. Now, I'm seriously considering getting that game.
The real answer is rdr if the game was playable, but it's not so it doesn't deserve to win.
    Lol what??
    r/usernamechecksout
        Salty lol
xix santa yaya is true
You see I'm under the age of 18 by a few years and I would vote for rdr2 over stupid fortnite
Honey where's my belt I gotta go beat some 8 yr lds
Personally whenever someone will ask me I’m always answering rdr cuz it’s simply true rdr is simply better game and Fortnite went on hype during this time
Honestly I think voting age should be raised probably. Anyway yeah why the hell didn’t RDR2 win?
All JIMMY'S hate Uncle Arthur. 😀
18 Year old: Actually looking in to both games to see which one is better

9 Year old Timmy: OMG FORTNITE IS DA BEST!!!1!!!11!!11
Fortnite was a better game though.
I like Fortnite, but it should have been Red Dead 2 100%.
Lmao thats true
All the 9 year olds be default dancing at this news
    I've never wanted to hurt a child before, but whenever I see a kid at the gas station doing a fork-knife dance, I am suddenly overcome with an urge to drop kick them.
        Wuts a fortnite dance?
            It's a dance.
                Show me?
                    No. Save some braincells
Fr
But we know who the best game is, and thats just an award
    Exactly. RDR2 is one of the greatest games I've ever played.
        If I had only one game to play forever, it would be rdr2. That's a fact
            It'll take you the rest of your life to find, and correctly kill, the legendary songbirds
                There are no legendary songbirds. There may be certain birds that are very rare, but no legendary birds at all.
                    Yet. There will be a songbird slayer role which has 100 ranks in Online in 2021.

You’ll have to achieve rank 20 in tree climbing, with at least 10,000 trees climbed before you can progress. In one session, and a crash will mean starting from 0 again.
                        Came back to look at the top of all time. This makes me sad
            I wish. I've played since it can out daily pretty much. I hate online now and can barely play it. Like fix your fucking animal spawns Rockstar. I work 10-14 hours a day. I wanna hunt an relax when I get home. I DO NOT want it to take 3 weeks to fill my trader wagon because I can't find any large animals. 

Story mode is fuckin outstanding though and so replayable. I'd still choose Fable LC, or Skyrim I think.
            Minecraft would imo be the best game to play forever. Red Dead would definitely be a close second though.
                I don’t play Minecraft. Isn’t it virtual LEGO?
                    Jesus
    Exactly, some dumb kid said to me roblox was better that rdr2.
        Those aren't even relatively comparible. Rdr2 is such a story driven, open world game with developed characters and refined details how can Roblox even be used in the same sentence.
            That’s what I said. But some bots say no. Like how dumb can you fucking get?
                Stubborn and retarded, and unable to appreciate or at least acknowledge quality.
                    I know. It is insanely stupid why a game of a bunch of fucking block heads lagging and killing each other Is better than rdr2
We all know that was bullshit. RDR2 won, regardless
    U cant just say it won. Although it may have deserved  it, you cant just announce that. Thats like the “trump isnt My president” bullshit
        Watch me.

#IT WON
        It won!
        Wait... do you think people who say "X isn't my President" literally mean they claim he isn't the actual President?
            What? No, its when people say trump isnt MY president, its stupid because he factually is. Its not up for debate. Its a stated fact that donald j trump is your president if you are a member of the us
                Of course he is *literally* the POTUS. That's not what that statement means though. They are saying that he dosn't *represent* their beliefs. If you like him or not, you understand he is a decisive figure. People who don't like what he stands for are ashamed to have him represent their country. 

Its not quite a metaphor, but closer to one than a literal statement. Which is basicly the same thing being said here. *Obviously* RDR2 didn't win that award. But it is the better game. 

They are not saying it literally won the award, only emphasizing that it should have.
                    Thats not true, people who believe it should have won say that it SHOULD have won. Not that it did, which is not true.
                The bottom line here is that this is reddit. If I posted a picture of my face deepfaked into a pineapple captioned “I am a pineapple” that doesn’t mean I factually think I’m a pineapple. And it really doesn’t mean you should break down the rather simple logic that I am NOT in fact- a pineapple.
        1. It did.

2. He isn't.

                    J
        Trump isn’t my president, because he won’t be a president soon
            He is factually your president. Even if you dont like him, he is by definition your presdient.
                I don’t have a real opinion on him, plus, presidents are the most forgettable thing, stop making politics out of nothing
                    What? Im explaining how, although rdr2 should have won, it literally didnt win. People cant just say “it won” even though it factually did not win. I myself prefer rdr2 over fortnite, but fortnite is, by definition, game of the year. Even if you dont agree w it.
                        Yeah but you should know on reddit if you say trump the world ends realize that and you should be good and yes, trump is the American president and yes Fortnite won who gives a shit it’s an award that only the fandom that won will remember and trump is someone that only the people who hate on him will remember I’ll probably forget writing this stupid fucking argument where I’ll probably look at it on accident and cringe thinking “holy shit i was dumb” I’m cringing right now writing this because I don’t think it’s good enough, I’m finding plot holes in my own fucking argument and usually those plot holes aren't used now I’m just ranting about how insecure during arguments I am.
                            Cool i still hate redditors besides u, the one logical one
                                I am far from logical bud, like me having a mental breakdown about how the longer my arguments are the more plot holes they get.
Me too...
I'm 34 and play both. Red dead is a masterpiece and is the pinnacle of gaming. With that said Fortnite is played more and appeals to a larger audience. The way the meta always changes and keeps the game fresh is something that I have never experienced in my almost 30 years of playing video games. Red dead should have won but fortnite is deserving of the title.
    I’ve never gotten into online gaming so I’m a little biased
        Gotcha, I love both online multiplayer and single player. Unfortunately multiplayer is taking over studios. To much money in it to waste time on single players. Multiplayer is like bars for millenials. Why go out and spend a fortune at the bar when you can stay home, smoke a joint, drink a beer and shoot your homie in the face.
            This but without video games. And me instead of my mate.
                #HashtagSuicideForTheHomies
            Yikes am I a boomer trapped in a millennials body? I go to the bar all the time.
                No, you're a person with normal social skills who was probably raised with a quality male role model in the home. I doubt you think e-girls are alluring, also. Probably don't cry about "chads" (whatever tf that means).

If you were a Boomer trapped in a Millennial body you'd be lying about going to Woodstock and/or Vietnam, and divircing your wife for your thot secretary.
            You just described my Friday nights
    >rdr2 is the pinnacle of gaming

Shit casuals say 

(no I don't play fortnite)
        "HeRpA DuR, iM a GaMEr aNd CaLl PeOpLe I DoNT AgReE WiTH CaSUals."

Do you actually have something to add to the conversation or do you just go around spewing your mental diarrhea all over the place?
            Yeah I want to add to the conversation that it's stupid to unironically call any game the pinnacle of gaming, especially one without any particular claim to that title
                The graphics are realistic and the story is more compelling than any game of the last several years. You have one that you feel better deserves the title?
                    How many games do you play a year to feel confident making that story claim (I'm gonna pretend you didn't use graphics as one of your two points)

And yeah I'd feel that the "pinnacle of gaming" would have maybe uh exceptional gameplay that sets it apart? Portal 2 has a great story and also a unique, challenging, and compelling fundamental gameplay concept that gets applied in new ways constantly throughout the game. I'm not even a huge portal fan that's just an easy example.
                        I literally play every major title that comes out and alot of the minors/indie games. I'm 34 and started on the Atari and original NES. I've played pretty much every mainstream console that has ever came out. That's fine that you dont agree, obviously art is subjective. Portal 2 was a great puzzle game but it is nowhere near what RDR2 is. I've have just chilled for hours, hunting and soaking in the atmosphere. Which I dont find myself doing much in any other game. Maybe I'm partial cause I grew up watching westerns with my dad. There was many times during the story missions I had actual emotion fueled reactions. Whether it be the Braithwaite Manor mission when you go down the long driveway with the crew or the plot point that marks a end to one of the characters. Great story telling, awesome game loop, beautiful graffix. RDR2 is my personal favorite game of this generation and has raised the bar for future single player games.
                            I just think it's hard to make an argument for the gameplay being truly exceptional, and impossible to make an argument for "pinnacle of gaming" without exceptional gameplay. You could make a case for it being the pinnacle of open-world simulation-lite games but there are so many games with more depth and refinement in the core mechanics (the gameplay). 

The closest thing I can think of to a pinnacle is super smash bros melee honestly. The core gameplay is just so engaging that it's one of the most popular games in its genre 20 years after release. Compare that to rdr2, which gets eclipsed in story/aesthetic by plenty of literature/film (and arguably other games) and in gameplay. Noone will be streaming rdr2 in 20 years because the only thing that truly sets it far apart from other games is the fact that its developer has by far the most experience in its genre (a genre with prohibitively high development costs that limit the number of competitors).
    Ok boomer, every competitive pvp game has a meta. Overwatch, bf, COD, LoL....there are metas for every hero and weapons.... fortnite is trash, wasn’t the meta at one point a giant robot that could kill everything?
        "Ok boomer" haha, really showing your intelligence kid.
            Says the guy assuming I’m a kid. You’re 34 that makes you a boomer....
                No, it doesnt jackass. 34 makes me a millenial. Boomers are in their 50s/60s
                    Nah mate you’re in denial
                        Whatever kid. Maybe next time ask your parents before you jump on to reddit.
                            I love it how my original comment was about every game having metas and the metas in fornite are lame with giant robots and shit.....yet you’re still bothered by the “ok boomer” comment. Maybe you should go speak to your mommy cuz seems like you need some growing up bud.
                                I admit it, it's the first time I have ever been called a boomer. Especially since you dont even know what a boomer is. That was more interesting than the other shit that fell out of your head.
I really cannot take the gaming opinions of adults who play Fortnite seriously.

It's the Doritos of video games.
    What's wrong with Doritos?
        A lot of things, actually. Ask that question to your doctor or a nutritionist some time.
It reflects on your name
Yeah i agree but rdr2 should have gotten it i dont play that orther gamebin my opinion its stupid rdr2 is so way better
    It's okay to have a different opinion. I'm more partial to RDR2, anyways. The only reason I started playing Fortnite was because my little bro wanted someone to play with him.
        Oh yeah well thats a good a reason to play any game lol but yeah i play orther games but i am very partial to RDR2 and RDR2 online
I play RDR to avoid the annoyance of watching my target build a scale replica of the World Trade Center in the span of a second and a half because they got scared of a leaf touching their shin lol
6 hours a day of Fortnite, what is that a torture test
    That’s minimum
        installing the Epic Store launcher is torture enough for me. Good thing I'll do neither
This is very true I was good at the game at season 6/5 and was enjoying it. But all of a sudden everyone got good and I didn’t like it afterwards and consider it garbage also because of how much they changed the game they don’t listen to the community
Fortnite is exactly the kind of game I despise: online multiplayer, no story, constant grinding for stuff, in game purchases to get around grinding for said stuff.

I incidentally don’t like Red Dead Online for this reason though they at least put in effort to create story.
But Fortnite is a competitive multiplayer game. That’s the entire point. Your analysis is like saying Red Dead 2 is only fun if you do the quests or explore the world.
NASA super computer
    Still wont run it 4k 60 fps
        Looking at the specs for KOTOR and it runs in 480p 👀 might give it a run for it’s money
            Knight of the old republic? Thats way old
                Oh yes 😎😂
                Just because its old doesnt mean its not good!
I play with a I7 7700k, 16GB, 1070 8GB, and it runs fine on max settings.
    "cries in 1440pp"
I run it at 1440 on a 5700 xt just fine, and I’d consider it to be a very middle range card.
Having played both, God Of War wins by a hair for me with its airtight gameplay, it’s damn near perfect.
    I’ve heard nothing but good things about it. I’ll maybe give it a try one day as I don’t own a PS4
I have played both God of War and RDR2. Both amazing. Also was curious about Fortnite at soem point. My guess is people play it because their friends do. Nothing special
    That and it’s on a lot more platforms and requires low specs for pc so there’s definitely a larger Audience than RDR and GoW which is PS exclusive
        And cross platform creates a enormous user base. That’s gotta help. 

I have no interest in playing it still.
only 'proper' video game awards is just that, the VGA's, at least in my opinion
    I agree
Recently finished both. And I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the way the game plays in god of war. Not a single cut scene. Like watching a movie.
I hear thst a lot. Its true
It has players that will spend 1000 dollars on skins.
Me neither until now. But they dont seem to knkw much about gaming, judging from this
I'm gonna say it. Fortnite is a good game.

Now before you fucking smash the downvote button and break your mouse / screen, hear me out.

Fortnite is constantly updating and adding new content, the community is active, and no you don't have to be a fucking pro to enjoy it. I'm certainly not, I only play maybe once or twice in a given month and I have fun playing it. It's a free game, which means I can play it with all of my friends and cross platform is a thing now too.

If you hate the game just because of the player base and the hype around it, take a step back and take an actual objective look at it.

And yes, I am 18+.
    I don't care for the player base but the game just doesn't appeal to me in general. 

The hype doesn't annoy me, while I think at this point I believe most are tired of Fortnite being the only game the media is aware of, as with anything if you talk about it enough your interest in hearing about it more goes away. 

Updates and extra content aside, the base game will always stay the same, so if you're not into the BR genre there's no amount of updates they can add that will sway that opinion. 

With that said, I'm of the mindset to each their own and could care less about an award being given to the obvious popular vote. 

Gaming isn't and shouldn't be an argument of which is better as you can't compare RDR2 and Fortnite given how different the gameplay is. 

Do I agree that Fortnite is the game of the year based on gameplay? Absolutely not. But it should be obvious to most why it won considering it's held insane amounts of players since it's release.
        This. My point is simply that the game gets bad rep for being publicised so heavily and the player base being mostly kids.

One thing I will say is that fortnite is not completely a Battle Royale game. Aside from creative mode and save the world, the Battle Royale version of the game offers community made game modes aside from Solo, Duos, Squads and Team Rumble as well, which can be pretty fun. Notably the grappling gun one (forget the name) and the Beach Assault were very fun and not Battle Royale based.
        RDR2 isn’t appealing to many too. People find it more like a chore to loot each and every object. The problem of weapons stuck in horse randomly. The game is slow pace which chase of most people. Also, the online is a complete shit, I can’t play the game with fun online as it constantly kick me out (server issue) and the game is full of grinding.

People who say that grinding is there because there’s nothing else to do online are just idiots. Have you played single player? The game literally gives you access to all the things in single player and I’m not even bored a min. I do whatever I please (hunt, shoot, ride on my horse, do stranger mission, go to salon) and I don’t have to grind in single player thus I can enjoy the game. Online is just for cash grab and you people don’t realise it but just supporting it blindly. 

Fortnite is a wonderful game (I hate the player base too) and it’s fast paced, addictive and also purely free to play. No one asks you to grind or pay to get what you want (guns/perks), only aesthetics which doesn’t affect your gameplay. Whereas RDR2 online requires you to grind forever to level up and get money to buy the gun you need so you can have an advantage (also the perks that boosts your skills). This gives an undue advantage to people who buy money and also who played the game for more time. 

If I bought RDR2 recently, I would be punished for going online as people would be having advantages of having good guns/horse/perks and I can’t have a level competition.

Just because you love RDR2 doesn’t mean those who think fortnite is good are wrong. I personally love RDR2, but I respect when fortnite won the award. It deserved it.

If a game garners more amount of players, then there is something in that game that does something better than any other games. Also fortnite has a single player or PvE type of gameplay which people need to buy (where they can play against zombies). So it has different modes too.

P.S: I’m more into Pubg than fortnite but I still respect the decision.
            I wasn't really talking about RDR2 at all other than saying the two games can't be compared to one another. 

I finished RDR2 to completion and have played a handful of games on Fortnite, I would say overall my experience on RDR2 was far superior, but again to each their own, Fortnite just doesn't appeal to me as a whole.
    I dislike the game because it to me represents everything that’s wrong with online FPS games now. Skins and grinding and unlocks and perks. I miss CS 1.6 and DOD where you had a KD rate not some pointless pink knife.  

Also I’m not interested in those types of games anymore. I like Hell Let Loose though, the players are all great and team oriented. For the most part.
    It's getting constantly updated because it's a cash grab and has to stay relevant. It's still a shit game. The community is active because it's free and relevant. It's still a shit game. It's player base is mostly kids and you tubers, which makes it still a shit game.
    Purely from a content update/addition perspective, Epic runs train on R*. 

I’m still waiting for GTA V single player DLC that was promised.
How is Fortnite money hungry by putting out optional cosmetics for sale on a FREE GAME?
Yep and the game looks like a cartoon. No wonder children love it
A cash grab? You can literally play the game for free, indefinitely. Only cosmetics are paid and you can even earn some for free. Apex literally had a $175 skin set (Iron Crown Event) where the best item could only be unlocked if you either spent $175 on in-game currency or lootboxes.
How is fortnite a cash grab, also it used to be a very good game
    Used to now all it is is nostalgia from seasons 1-3
        Yes but when it won the award it was still a very good game
    Haha, welcome to RDR2 subreddit. People call fortnite players as kids but only if you look clearly, you’ll find most of the “adults” in RDR2 player base acts like “kids”.

Downvoting someone who has different opinion? That’s childish.

Also, fortnite just sells skins for money which doesn’t affect the gameplay and the game is free with dedicated server is considered cash grab.

RDR2 sells guns/horse/perks for money to be easily accessed through money and the game is very expensive with no dedicated server but only player based servers are called “well they need money to provide good game, so it is worth it”. 

I play RDR2 regularly and I agree RDR2 is not for everyone and it has very versatile gameplay and the serene feel in single player. But don’t diss a game because they have a larger fan base.

I’ve seen little to zero complaints about the online problems in fortnite community/fan base. Now go to RDR2 online forums and you’ll see millions of complaints from the early access time and still those problems haven’t been fixed. And you call RDR2 to be masterpiece. I paid a huge amount for a game which I can’t play half of the game (only single player works perfectly), and you expect it to be a masterpiece or win best game award? 

I love the game but I find no difference in immature fans in RDR community too. Grow up, fortnite won. Nothing we can do except congratulate the developers.
        I mean I am a kid lol (14) but I don’t understand the hate for fortnite, at the time of the award it was a better game than RDR2 for sure
this didnt age well
But you can dance in fortnite
    Ehem, are you trying to imply that you can't in rdr2?

https://youtu.be/8LVFZiE7d_E
I agree 100%
Probably! I dont know for sure. It has to be so
I have to agree, Fortnite is a quality game and I believe a similar effort has been put into. Yes I love Red Dead way better but the multiplayer was huge disappointment. I honestly feel like it should not have had one and just had DLC I would have gladly paid another $60 for twice the story line rather than $60 for in game currency and frustrating game play. Online story mode is garbage.
    Not sure why you'd need to buy online currency.  I'm practically swimming in money just by playing the game as intended.
It's not a fair win cause one was 2017 and the other 2018 so fortunate shouldn't have been a contender
    It is fair, it’s not judged for when a game is released, the games are judged and awarded on the state they are in during that year in which fortnite had a really good year last year because of the chapter 2 thing it had going while red dead suffered from the online part because of the lack of content and heaps of bugs it had for majority of the year.
Not trying to be mean, and it is your opinion,

But thats dumb
You have my blessing to do so man
Unless you are PC gamer and the thing wont run no matter how speced out ur pc is because of the endless bugs.

I acknowledge this game is a work of art. I haven't been this obsessed with anything in years-- yet I almost refunded because the DRM had some stupid kind of error and wouldn't even open. So a software that i didn't even want (Steam purchase) designed to do constant network checks and facilitate social play wasn't allowing me to run my SINGLEPLAYER game. This ticks off a lot of boxes on the list of everything wrong with the direction that the game industry is going in.
    Console peasants come out on top this time 👏
        Indeed. Hypothetically if you could run anything, this is still THAT game
I think mental age and maturity are to be taken in consideration aswell. Ninja is nearly 30 and does Fortnite dances like its nothing lmao
    *Guess I’m legal then*
        I would say so
Im nearly thirty and still watch Teen Titans Go
    I feel you. Nearly thirty and all my hobbies are those of a teenager. Maybe men never grow up
I dont ever play online. The story is way too good
    Ikr?!?! I still spend hours playing it, despite having completed the epilogue. I'm currently trying to get to 100%, which I've never attempted with any other game, just because I love it.
I dont know lol. But if they give awards to Fortnite instead of Red Dead I dont care about them
Truth hurts. Being popular though, does not mean it is the best game
    Does not but when it comes to fan voting, you’re not necessarily voting for the best game
Doesnt stop people from voting for the Witcher 3 every year
Thats Reddit for you
Still very popular
/r/killthosewhodisagree/
Kill kids for playing a game? You want them to vote for rdr2 even if they didn't play it? Fortnite is 12+, rdr2 is 18+.
    Should ask these 12 year olds what they like about Fortnite.
        cartoony visuals, fun gameplay for them, culture they can be immersed in (dances, toys, etc.) 

no one has the right to tell someone else what to enjoy. i dont like fortnite because it not my type of game, but i dont hate kids for liking it. i think its a little cringey when kids do the dances in public, but we have all done cringey shit when we were kids.
    Yes
Lmaoooo chill my dude
Do you like your baby though
It also didn't come out in 2019
You sound like a edgy 13 yr old trying to seem like he’s cool. Fortnite wasn’t a horrible game in itself but the culture that was built around it sucked all the fun out. Red Dead is still a better game but Fortnite itself isn’t bad either.
Fortnite is dog shit compared to rdr
No, they said what they meant and you missed the point.  "Only kids would choose Fortnite as GOTY" is exactly the reason why you have to be 18 to vote for, you know, important things.
“Early access”
If you want answers, play red dead 1. It's the sequel to red dead 2.
    I know about existence of rdr1, I am PC peasant though. Even if I get my hands on ps4 and play it still -- there will be no answer about last mission of rdr2: what Micah and Dutch were doing in shack? What dialog between them and John means (John was like: "U know why I am here, Dutch" and Dutch: "Me too, son", etc).
        Being a pc gamer isn't all that bad, regardless of what people say (better than mobile I say lol). Well, if you have a dirty mind like I do, you can easily imagine what they were doing in that shack, but the clean version has them hiding out there with their new gang. When John showed up there, Dutch knew that John wanted to kill Micah, and was planning to do that very thing himself. He was letting John know that, without letting on to Micah (let's be honest here, Micah wasn't the brightest of the bunch, just mean and greedy). Halfway through the story mode, I started to really want to kill Dutch with every action I took. At that point, I didn't know that RDR1 was the sequel, and that it was about John going after Dutch, at the behest of the US government. Now, I'm seriously considering getting that game.
Lol what??
r/usernamechecksout
    Salty lol
I've never wanted to hurt a child before, but whenever I see a kid at the gas station doing a fork-knife dance, I am suddenly overcome with an urge to drop kick them.
    Wuts a fortnite dance?
        It's a dance.
            Show me?
                No. Save some braincells
Exactly. RDR2 is one of the greatest games I've ever played.
    If I had only one game to play forever, it would be rdr2. That's a fact
        It'll take you the rest of your life to find, and correctly kill, the legendary songbirds
            There are no legendary songbirds. There may be certain birds that are very rare, but no legendary birds at all.
                Yet. There will be a songbird slayer role which has 100 ranks in Online in 2021.

You’ll have to achieve rank 20 in tree climbing, with at least 10,000 trees climbed before you can progress. In one session, and a crash will mean starting from 0 again.
                    Came back to look at the top of all time. This makes me sad
        I wish. I've played since it can out daily pretty much. I hate online now and can barely play it. Like fix your fucking animal spawns Rockstar. I work 10-14 hours a day. I wanna hunt an relax when I get home. I DO NOT want it to take 3 weeks to fill my trader wagon because I can't find any large animals. 

Story mode is fuckin outstanding though and so replayable. I'd still choose Fable LC, or Skyrim I think.
        Minecraft would imo be the best game to play forever. Red Dead would definitely be a close second though.
            I don’t play Minecraft. Isn’t it virtual LEGO?
                Jesus
Exactly, some dumb kid said to me roblox was better that rdr2.
    Those aren't even relatively comparible. Rdr2 is such a story driven, open world game with developed characters and refined details how can Roblox even be used in the same sentence.
        That’s what I said. But some bots say no. Like how dumb can you fucking get?
            Stubborn and retarded, and unable to appreciate or at least acknowledge quality.
                I know. It is insanely stupid why a game of a bunch of fucking block heads lagging and killing each other Is better than rdr2
U cant just say it won. Although it may have deserved  it, you cant just announce that. Thats like the “trump isnt My president” bullshit
    Watch me.

#IT WON
    It won!
    Wait... do you think people who say "X isn't my President" literally mean they claim he isn't the actual President?
        What? No, its when people say trump isnt MY president, its stupid because he factually is. Its not up for debate. Its a stated fact that donald j trump is your president if you are a member of the us
            Of course he is *literally* the POTUS. That's not what that statement means though. They are saying that he dosn't *represent* their beliefs. If you like him or not, you understand he is a decisive figure. People who don't like what he stands for are ashamed to have him represent their country. 

Its not quite a metaphor, but closer to one than a literal statement. Which is basicly the same thing being said here. *Obviously* RDR2 didn't win that award. But it is the better game. 

They are not saying it literally won the award, only emphasizing that it should have.
                Thats not true, people who believe it should have won say that it SHOULD have won. Not that it did, which is not true.
            The bottom line here is that this is reddit. If I posted a picture of my face deepfaked into a pineapple captioned “I am a pineapple” that doesn’t mean I factually think I’m a pineapple. And it really doesn’t mean you should break down the rather simple logic that I am NOT in fact- a pineapple.
    1. It did.

2. He isn't.

        Yeah why the fuck are people downvoting factual truths like what
            Welcome to reddit
                J
    Trump isn’t my president, because he won’t be a president soon
        He is factually your president. Even if you dont like him, he is by definition your presdient.
            I don’t have a real opinion on him, plus, presidents are the most forgettable thing, stop making politics out of nothing
                What? Im explaining how, although rdr2 should have won, it literally didnt win. People cant just say “it won” even though it factually did not win. I myself prefer rdr2 over fortnite, but fortnite is, by definition, game of the year. Even if you dont agree w it.
                    Yeah but you should know on reddit if you say trump the world ends realize that and you should be good and yes, trump is the American president and yes Fortnite won who gives a shit it’s an award that only the fandom that won will remember and trump is someone that only the people who hate on him will remember I’ll probably forget writing this stupid fucking argument where I’ll probably look at it on accident and cringe thinking “holy shit i was dumb” I’m cringing right now writing this because I don’t think it’s good enough, I’m finding plot holes in my own fucking argument and usually those plot holes aren't used now I’m just ranting about how insecure during arguments I am.
                        Cool i still hate redditors besides u, the one logical one
                            I am far from logical bud, like me having a mental breakdown about how the longer my arguments are the more plot holes they get.
I’ve never gotten into online gaming so I’m a little biased
    Gotcha, I love both online multiplayer and single player. Unfortunately multiplayer is taking over studios. To much money in it to waste time on single players. Multiplayer is like bars for millenials. Why go out and spend a fortune at the bar when you can stay home, smoke a joint, drink a beer and shoot your homie in the face.
        This but without video games. And me instead of my mate.

        Yikes am I a boomer trapped in a millennials body? I go to the bar all the time.
            No, you're a person with normal social skills who was probably raised with a quality male role model in the home. I doubt you think e-girls are alluring, also. Probably don't cry about "chads" (whatever tf that means).

If you were a Boomer trapped in a Millennial body you'd be lying about going to Woodstock and/or Vietnam, and divircing your wife for your thot secretary.

>rdr2 is the pinnacle of gaming

Shit casuals say 

(no I don't play fortnite)
    "HeRpA DuR, iM a GaMEr aNd CaLl PeOpLe I DoNT AgReE WiTH CaSUals."

Do you actually have something to add to the conversation or do you just go around spewing your mental diarrhea all over the place?
        Yeah I want to add to the conversation that it's stupid to unironically call any game the pinnacle of gaming, especially one without any particular claim to that title
            The graphics are realistic and the story is more compelling than any game of the last several years. You have one that you feel better deserves the title?
                How many games do you play a year to feel confident making that story claim (I'm gonna pretend you didn't use graphics as one of your two points)

And yeah I'd feel that the "pinnacle of gaming" would have maybe uh exceptional gameplay that sets it apart? Portal 2 has a great story and also a unique, challenging, and compelling fundamental gameplay concept that gets applied in new ways constantly throughout the game. I'm not even a huge portal fan that's just an easy example.
                    I literally play every major title that comes out and alot of the minors/indie games. I'm 34 and started on the Atari and original NES. I've played pretty much every mainstream console that has ever came out. That's fine that you dont agree, obviously art is subjective. Portal 2 was a great puzzle game but it is nowhere near what RDR2 is. I've have just chilled for hours, hunting and soaking in the atmosphere. Which I dont find myself doing much in any other game. Maybe I'm partial cause I grew up watching westerns with my dad. There was many times during the story missions I had actual emotion fueled reactions. Whether it be the Braithwaite Manor mission when you go down the long driveway with the crew or the plot point that marks a end to one of the characters. Great story telling, awesome game loop, beautiful graffix. RDR2 is my personal favorite game of this generation and has raised the bar for future single player games.
                        I just think it's hard to make an argument for the gameplay being truly exceptional, and impossible to make an argument for "pinnacle of gaming" without exceptional gameplay. You could make a case for it being the pinnacle of open-world simulation-lite games but there are so many games with more depth and refinement in the core mechanics (the gameplay). 

The closest thing I can think of to a pinnacle is super smash bros melee honestly. The core gameplay is just so engaging that it's one of the most popular games in its genre 20 years after release. Compare that to rdr2, which gets eclipsed in story/aesthetic by plenty of literature/film (and arguably other games) and in gameplay. Noone will be streaming rdr2 in 20 years because the only thing that truly sets it far apart from other games is the fact that its developer has by far the most experience in its genre (a genre with prohibitively high development costs that limit the number of competitors).
Ok boomer, every competitive pvp game has a meta. Overwatch, bf, COD, LoL....there are metas for every hero and weapons.... fortnite is trash, wasn’t the meta at one point a giant robot that could kill everything?
    "Ok boomer" haha, really showing your intelligence kid.
        Says the guy assuming I’m a kid. You’re 34 that makes you a boomer....
            No, it doesnt jackass. 34 makes me a millenial. Boomers are in their 50s/60s
                Nah mate you’re in denial
                    Whatever kid. Maybe next time ask your parents before you jump on to reddit.
                        I love it how my original comment was about every game having metas and the metas in fornite are lame with giant robots and shit.....yet you’re still bothered by the “ok boomer” comment. Maybe you should go speak to your mommy cuz seems like you need some growing up bud.
                            I admit it, it's the first time I have ever been called a boomer. Especially since you dont even know what a boomer is. That was more interesting than the other shit that fell out of your head.
What's wrong with Doritos?
    A lot of things, actually. Ask that question to your doctor or a nutritionist some time.
It's okay to have a different opinion. I'm more partial to RDR2, anyways. The only reason I started playing Fortnite was because my little bro wanted someone to play with him.
    Oh yeah well thats a good a reason to play any game lol but yeah i play orther games but i am very partial to RDR2 and RDR2 online
That’s minimum
    installing the Epic Store launcher is torture enough for me. Good thing I'll do neither
Still wont run it 4k 60 fps
    Looking at the specs for KOTOR and it runs in 480p 👀 might give it a run for it’s money
        Knight of the old republic? Thats way old
            Oh yes 😎😂
            Just because its old doesnt mean its not good!
"cries in 1440pp"
I’ve heard nothing but good things about it. I’ll maybe give it a try one day as I don’t own a PS4
That and it’s on a lot more platforms and requires low specs for pc so there’s definitely a larger Audience than RDR and GoW which is PS exclusive
    And cross platform creates a enormous user base. That’s gotta help. 

I have no interest in playing it still.
I agree
I don't care for the player base but the game just doesn't appeal to me in general. 

The hype doesn't annoy me, while I think at this point I believe most are tired of Fortnite being the only game the media is aware of, as with anything if you talk about it enough your interest in hearing about it more goes away. 

Updates and extra content aside, the base game will always stay the same, so if you're not into the BR genre there's no amount of updates they can add that will sway that opinion. 

With that said, I'm of the mindset to each their own and could care less about an award being given to the obvious popular vote. 

Gaming isn't and shouldn't be an argument of which is better as you can't compare RDR2 and Fortnite given how different the gameplay is. 

Do I agree that Fortnite is the game of the year based on gameplay? Absolutely not. But it should be obvious to most why it won considering it's held insane amounts of players since it's release.
    This. My point is simply that the game gets bad rep for being publicised so heavily and the player base being mostly kids.

One thing I will say is that fortnite is not completely a Battle Royale game. Aside from creative mode and save the world, the Battle Royale version of the game offers community made game modes aside from Solo, Duos, Squads and Team Rumble as well, which can be pretty fun. Notably the grappling gun one (forget the name) and the Beach Assault were very fun and not Battle Royale based.
    RDR2 isn’t appealing to many too. People find it more like a chore to loot each and every object. The problem of weapons stuck in horse randomly. The game is slow pace which chase of most people. Also, the online is a complete shit, I can’t play the game with fun online as it constantly kick me out (server issue) and the game is full of grinding.

People who say that grinding is there because there’s nothing else to do online are just idiots. Have you played single player? The game literally gives you access to all the things in single player and I’m not even bored a min. I do whatever I please (hunt, shoot, ride on my horse, do stranger mission, go to salon) and I don’t have to grind in single player thus I can enjoy the game. Online is just for cash grab and you people don’t realise it but just supporting it blindly. 

Fortnite is a wonderful game (I hate the player base too) and it’s fast paced, addictive and also purely free to play. No one asks you to grind or pay to get what you want (guns/perks), only aesthetics which doesn’t affect your gameplay. Whereas RDR2 online requires you to grind forever to level up and get money to buy the gun you need so you can have an advantage (also the perks that boosts your skills). This gives an undue advantage to people who buy money and also who played the game for more time. 

If I bought RDR2 recently, I would be punished for going online as people would be having advantages of having good guns/horse/perks and I can’t have a level competition.

Just because you love RDR2 doesn’t mean those who think fortnite is good are wrong. I personally love RDR2, but I respect when fortnite won the award. It deserved it.

If a game garners more amount of players, then there is something in that game that does something better than any other games. Also fortnite has a single player or PvE type of gameplay which people need to buy (where they can play against zombies). So it has different modes too.

P.S: I’m more into Pubg than fortnite but I still respect the decision.
        I wasn't really talking about RDR2 at all other than saying the two games can't be compared to one another. 

I finished RDR2 to completion and have played a handful of games on Fortnite, I would say overall my experience on RDR2 was far superior, but again to each their own, Fortnite just doesn't appeal to me as a whole.
I dislike the game because it to me represents everything that’s wrong with online FPS games now. Skins and grinding and unlocks and perks. I miss CS 1.6 and DOD where you had a KD rate not some pointless pink knife.  

Also I’m not interested in those types of games anymore. I like Hell Let Loose though, the players are all great and team oriented. For the most part.
It's getting constantly updated because it's a cash grab and has to stay relevant. It's still a shit game. The community is active because it's free and relevant. It's still a shit game. It's player base is mostly kids and you tubers, which makes it still a shit game.
Purely from a content update/addition perspective, Epic runs train on R*. 

I’m still waiting for GTA V single player DLC that was promised.
Used to now all it is is nostalgia from seasons 1-3
    Yes but when it won the award it was still a very good game
Haha, welcome to RDR2 subreddit. People call fortnite players as kids but only if you look clearly, you’ll find most of the “adults” in RDR2 player base acts like “kids”.

Downvoting someone who has different opinion? That’s childish.

Also, fortnite just sells skins for money which doesn’t affect the gameplay and the game is free with dedicated server is considered cash grab.

RDR2 sells guns/horse/perks for money to be easily accessed through money and the game is very expensive with no dedicated server but only player based servers are called “well they need money to provide good game, so it is worth it”. 

I play RDR2 regularly and I agree RDR2 is not for everyone and it has very versatile gameplay and the serene feel in single player. But don’t diss a game because they have a larger fan base.

I’ve seen little to zero complaints about the online problems in fortnite community/fan base. Now go to RDR2 online forums and you’ll see millions of complaints from the early access time and still those problems haven’t been fixed. And you call RDR2 to be masterpiece. I paid a huge amount for a game which I can’t play half of the game (only single player works perfectly), and you expect it to be a masterpiece or win best game award? 

I love the game but I find no difference in immature fans in RDR community too. Grow up, fortnite won. Nothing we can do except congratulate the developers.
    I mean I am a kid lol (14) but I don’t understand the hate for fortnite, at the time of the award it was a better game than RDR2 for sure
Ehem, are you trying to imply that you can't in rdr2?

https://youtu.be/8LVFZiE7d_E
Not sure why you'd need to buy online currency.  I'm practically swimming in money just by playing the game as intended.
It is fair, it’s not judged for when a game is released, the games are judged and awarded on the state they are in during that year in which fortnite had a really good year last year because of the chapter 2 thing it had going while red dead suffered from the online part because of the lack of content and heaps of bugs it had for majority of the year.
Console peasants come out on top this time 👏
    Indeed. Hypothetically if you could run anything, this is still THAT game
*Guess I’m legal then*
    I would say so
I feel you. Nearly thirty and all my hobbies are those of a teenager. Maybe men never grow up
Ikr?!?! I still spend hours playing it, despite having completed the epilogue. I'm currently trying to get to 100%, which I've never attempted with any other game, just because I love it.
Does not but when it comes to fan voting, you’re not necessarily voting for the best game
Should ask these 12 year olds what they like about Fortnite.
    cartoony visuals, fun gameplay for them, culture they can be immersed in (dances, toys, etc.) 

no one has the right to tell someone else what to enjoy. i dont like fortnite because it not my type of game, but i dont hate kids for liking it. i think its a little cringey when kids do the dances in public, but we have all done cringey shit when we were kids.
Yes
I know about existence of rdr1, I am PC peasant though. Even if I get my hands on ps4 and play it still -- there will be no answer about last mission of rdr2: what Micah and Dutch were doing in shack? What dialog between them and John means (John was like: "U know why I am here, Dutch" and Dutch: "Me too, son", etc).
    Being a pc gamer isn't all that bad, regardless of what people say (better than mobile I say lol). Well, if you have a dirty mind like I do, you can easily imagine what they were doing in that shack, but the clean version has them hiding out there with their new gang. When John showed up there, Dutch knew that John wanted to kill Micah, and was planning to do that very thing himself. He was letting John know that, without letting on to Micah (let's be honest here, Micah wasn't the brightest of the bunch, just mean and greedy). Halfway through the story mode, I started to really want to kill Dutch with every action I took. At that point, I didn't know that RDR1 was the sequel, and that it was about John going after Dutch, at the behest of the US government. Now, I'm seriously considering getting that game.
Salty lol
Wuts a fortnite dance?
    It's a dance.
        Show me?
            No. Save some braincells
If I had only one game to play forever, it would be rdr2. That's a fact
    It'll take you the rest of your life to find, and correctly kill, the legendary songbirds
        There are no legendary songbirds. There may be certain birds that are very rare, but no legendary birds at all.
            Yet. There will be a songbird slayer role which has 100 ranks in Online in 2021.

You’ll have to achieve rank 20 in tree climbing, with at least 10,000 trees climbed before you can progress. In one session, and a crash will mean starting from 0 again.
                Came back to look at the top of all time. This makes me sad
    I wish. I've played since it can out daily pretty much. I hate online now and can barely play it. Like fix your fucking animal spawns Rockstar. I work 10-14 hours a day. I wanna hunt an relax when I get home. I DO NOT want it to take 3 weeks to fill my trader wagon because I can't find any large animals. 

Story mode is fuckin outstanding though and so replayable. I'd still choose Fable LC, or Skyrim I think.
    Minecraft would imo be the best game to play forever. Red Dead would definitely be a close second though.
        I don’t play Minecraft. Isn’t it virtual LEGO?
            Jesus
Those aren't even relatively comparible. Rdr2 is such a story driven, open world game with developed characters and refined details how can Roblox even be used in the same sentence.
    That’s what I said. But some bots say no. Like how dumb can you fucking get?
        Stubborn and retarded, and unable to appreciate or at least acknowledge quality.
            I know. It is insanely stupid why a game of a bunch of fucking block heads lagging and killing each other Is better than rdr2
Watch me.

#IT WON
It won!
Wait... do you think people who say "X isn't my President" literally mean they claim he isn't the actual President?
    What? No, its when people say trump isnt MY president, its stupid because he factually is. Its not up for debate. Its a stated fact that donald j trump is your president if you are a member of the us
        Of course he is *literally* the POTUS. That's not what that statement means though. They are saying that he dosn't *represent* their beliefs. If you like him or not, you understand he is a decisive figure. People who don't like what he stands for are ashamed to have him represent their country. 

Its not quite a metaphor, but closer to one than a literal statement. Which is basicly the same thing being said here. *Obviously* RDR2 didn't win that award. But it is the better game. 

They are not saying it literally won the award, only emphasizing that it should have.
            Thats not true, people who believe it should have won say that it SHOULD have won. Not that it did, which is not true.
        The bottom line here is that this is reddit. If I posted a picture of my face deepfaked into a pineapple captioned “I am a pineapple” that doesn’t mean I factually think I’m a pineapple. And it really doesn’t mean you should break down the rather simple logic that I am NOT in fact- a pineapple.
1. It did.

2. He isn't.

    Yeah why the fuck are people downvoting factual truths like what
        Welcome to reddit
            J
Trump isn’t my president, because he won’t be a president soon
    He is factually your president. Even if you dont like him, he is by definition your presdient.
        I don’t have a real opinion on him, plus, presidents are the most forgettable thing, stop making politics out of nothing
            What? Im explaining how, although rdr2 should have won, it literally didnt win. People cant just say “it won” even though it factually did not win. I myself prefer rdr2 over fortnite, but fortnite is, by definition, game of the year. Even if you dont agree w it.
                Yeah but you should know on reddit if you say trump the world ends realize that and you should be good and yes, trump is the American president and yes Fortnite won who gives a shit it’s an award that only the fandom that won will remember and trump is someone that only the people who hate on him will remember I’ll probably forget writing this stupid fucking argument where I’ll probably look at it on accident and cringe thinking “holy shit i was dumb” I’m cringing right now writing this because I don’t think it’s good enough, I’m finding plot holes in my own fucking argument and usually those plot holes aren't used now I’m just ranting about how insecure during arguments I am.
                    Cool i still hate redditors besides u, the one logical one
                        I am far from logical bud, like me having a mental breakdown about how the longer my arguments are the more plot holes they get.
Gotcha, I love both online multiplayer and single player. Unfortunately multiplayer is taking over studios. To much money in it to waste time on single players. Multiplayer is like bars for millenials. Why go out and spend a fortune at the bar when you can stay home, smoke a joint, drink a beer and shoot your homie in the face.
    This but without video games. And me instead of my mate.
        #HashtagSuicideForTheHomies
    Yikes am I a boomer trapped in a millennials body? I go to the bar all the time.
        No, you're a person with normal social skills who was probably raised with a quality male role model in the home. I doubt you think e-girls are alluring, also. Probably don't cry about "chads" (whatever tf that means).

If you were a Boomer trapped in a Millennial body you'd be lying about going to Woodstock and/or Vietnam, and divircing your wife for your thot secretary.
    You just described my Friday nights
"HeRpA DuR, iM a GaMEr aNd CaLl PeOpLe I DoNT AgReE WiTH CaSUals."

Do you actually have something to add to the conversation or do you just go around spewing your mental diarrhea all over the place?
    Yeah I want to add to the conversation that it's stupid to unironically call any game the pinnacle of gaming, especially one without any particular claim to that title
        The graphics are realistic and the story is more compelling than any game of the last several years. You have one that you feel better deserves the title?
            How many games do you play a year to feel confident making that story claim (I'm gonna pretend you didn't use graphics as one of your two points)

And yeah I'd feel that the "pinnacle of gaming" would have maybe uh exceptional gameplay that sets it apart? Portal 2 has a great story and also a unique, challenging, and compelling fundamental gameplay concept that gets applied in new ways constantly throughout the game. I'm not even a huge portal fan that's just an easy example.
                I literally play every major title that comes out and alot of the minors/indie games. I'm 34 and started on the Atari and original NES. I've played pretty much every mainstream console that has ever came out. That's fine that you dont agree, obviously art is subjective. Portal 2 was a great puzzle game but it is nowhere near what RDR2 is. I've have just chilled for hours, hunting and soaking in the atmosphere. Which I dont find myself doing much in any other game. Maybe I'm partial cause I grew up watching westerns with my dad. There was many times during the story missions I had actual emotion fueled reactions. Whether it be the Braithwaite Manor mission when you go down the long driveway with the crew or the plot point that marks a end to one of the characters. Great story telling, awesome game loop, beautiful graffix. RDR2 is my personal favorite game of this generation and has raised the bar for future single player games.
                    I just think it's hard to make an argument for the gameplay being truly exceptional, and impossible to make an argument for "pinnacle of gaming" without exceptional gameplay. You could make a case for it being the pinnacle of open-world simulation-lite games but there are so many games with more depth and refinement in the core mechanics (the gameplay). 

The closest thing I can think of to a pinnacle is super smash bros melee honestly. The core gameplay is just so engaging that it's one of the most popular games in its genre 20 years after release. Compare that to rdr2, which gets eclipsed in story/aesthetic by plenty of literature/film (and arguably other games) and in gameplay. Noone will be streaming rdr2 in 20 years because the only thing that truly sets it far apart from other games is the fact that its developer has by far the most experience in its genre (a genre with prohibitively high development costs that limit the number of competitors).
"Ok boomer" haha, really showing your intelligence kid.
    Says the guy assuming I’m a kid. You’re 34 that makes you a boomer....
        No, it doesnt jackass. 34 makes me a millenial. Boomers are in their 50s/60s
            Nah mate you’re in denial
                Whatever kid. Maybe next time ask your parents before you jump on to reddit.
                    I love it how my original comment was about every game having metas and the metas in fornite are lame with giant robots and shit.....yet you’re still bothered by the “ok boomer” comment. Maybe you should go speak to your mommy cuz seems like you need some growing up bud.
                        I admit it, it's the first time I have ever been called a boomer. Especially since you dont even know what a boomer is. That was more interesting than the other shit that fell out of your head.
A lot of things, actually. Ask that question to your doctor or a nutritionist some time.
Oh yeah well thats a good a reason to play any game lol but yeah i play orther games but i am very partial to RDR2 and RDR2 online

Yikes am I a boomer trapped in a millennials body? I go to the bar all the time.
    No, you're a person with normal social skills who was probably raised with a quality male role model in the home. I doubt you think e-girls are alluring, also. Probably don't cry about "chads" (whatever tf that means).

If you were a Boomer trapped in a Millennial body you'd be lying about going to Woodstock and/or Vietnam, and divircing your wife for your thot secretary.
You just described my Friday nights
Yeah I want to add to the conversation that it's stupid to unironically call any game the pinnacle of gaming, especially one without any particular claim to that title
    The graphics are realistic and the story is more compelling than any game of the last several years. You have one that you feel better deserves the title?
        How many games do you play a year to feel confident making that story claim (I'm gonna pretend you didn't use graphics as one of your two points)

And yeah I'd feel that the "pinnacle of gaming" would have maybe uh exceptional gameplay that sets it apart? Portal 2 has a great story and also a unique, challenging, and compelling fundamental gameplay concept that gets applied in new ways constantly throughout the game. I'm not even a huge portal fan that's just an easy example.
            I literally play every major title that comes out and alot of the minors/indie games. I'm 34 and started on the Atari and original NES. I've played pretty much every mainstream console that has ever came out. That's fine that you dont agree, obviously art is subjective. Portal 2 was a great puzzle game but it is nowhere near what RDR2 is. I've have just chilled for hours, hunting and soaking in the atmosphere. Which I dont find myself doing much in any other game. Maybe I'm partial cause I grew up watching westerns with my dad. There was many times during the story missions I had actual emotion fueled reactions. Whether it be the Braithwaite Manor mission when you go down the long driveway with the crew or the plot point that marks a end to one of the characters. Great story telling, awesome game loop, beautiful graffix. RDR2 is my personal favorite game of this generation and has raised the bar for future single player games.
                I just think it's hard to make an argument for the gameplay being truly exceptional, and impossible to make an argument for "pinnacle of gaming" without exceptional gameplay. You could make a case for it being the pinnacle of open-world simulation-lite games but there are so many games with more depth and refinement in the core mechanics (the gameplay). 

The closest thing I can think of to a pinnacle is super smash bros melee honestly. The core gameplay is just so engaging that it's one of the most popular games in its genre 20 years after release. Compare that to rdr2, which gets eclipsed in story/aesthetic by plenty of literature/film (and arguably other games) and in gameplay. Noone will be streaming rdr2 in 20 years because the only thing that truly sets it far apart from other games is the fact that its developer has by far the most experience in its genre (a genre with prohibitively high development costs that limit the number of competitors).
Says the guy assuming I’m a kid. You’re 34 that makes you a boomer....
    No, it doesnt jackass. 34 makes me a millenial. Boomers are in their 50s/60s
        Nah mate you’re in denial
            Whatever kid. Maybe next time ask your parents before you jump on to reddit.
                I love it how my original comment was about every game having metas and the metas in fornite are lame with giant robots and shit.....yet you’re still bothered by the “ok boomer” comment. Maybe you should go speak to your mommy cuz seems like you need some growing up bud.
                    I admit it, it's the first time I have ever been called a boomer. Especially since you dont even know what a boomer is. That was more interesting than the other shit that fell out of your head.
Knight of the old republic? Thats way old
    Oh yes 😎😂
    Just because its old doesnt mean its not good!
I wasn't really talking about RDR2 at all other than saying the two games can't be compared to one another. 

I finished RDR2 to completion and have played a handful of games on Fortnite, I would say overall my experience on RDR2 was far superior, but again to each their own, Fortnite just doesn't appeal to me as a whole.
Show me?
    No. Save some braincells
There are no legendary songbirds. There may be certain birds that are very rare, but no legendary birds at all.
    Yet. There will be a songbird slayer role which has 100 ranks in Online in 2021.

You’ll have to achieve rank 20 in tree climbing, with at least 10,000 trees climbed before you can progress. In one session, and a crash will mean starting from 0 again.
        Came back to look at the top of all time. This makes me sad
I don’t play Minecraft. Isn’t it virtual LEGO?
    Jesus
Stubborn and retarded, and unable to appreciate or at least acknowledge quality.
    I know. It is insanely stupid why a game of a bunch of fucking block heads lagging and killing each other Is better than rdr2
Of course he is *literally* the POTUS. That's not what that statement means though. They are saying that he dosn't *represent* their beliefs. If you like him or not, you understand he is a decisive figure. People who don't like what he stands for are ashamed to have him represent their country. 

Its not quite a metaphor, but closer to one than a literal statement. Which is basicly the same thing being said here. *Obviously* RDR2 didn't win that award. But it is the better game. 

They are not saying it literally won the award, only emphasizing that it should have.
    Thats not true, people who believe it should have won say that it SHOULD have won. Not that it did, which is not true.
The bottom line here is that this is reddit. If I posted a picture of my face deepfaked into a pineapple captioned “I am a pineapple” that doesn’t mean I factually think I’m a pineapple. And it really doesn’t mean you should break down the rather simple logic that I am NOT in fact- a pineapple.
r/iamverybadass
    How does that apply to this
        r/oblivious
I had a seizure reading this

Also dont tell people to kill themselves your looking more like an a$$ saying that
TILT
1. Go fuck yourself.
2. No he isn't,  and you can fuck off, you cunt.
3. Why are you mentally crippled? 

Go suckstart a pump action.
    If you're in the U.S. then yes he is an will be again for the next four years. TRUMP 2020!!
        No, he isn't,  and no, he won't.
    Ok person who says welcome to my ted talk at the end
We found the 9 year old everyone!!! \^\^\^\^\^\^
Welcome to reddit

I don’t have a real opinion on him, plus, presidents are the most forgettable thing, stop making politics out of nothing
    What? Im explaining how, although rdr2 should have won, it literally didnt win. People cant just say “it won” even though it factually did not win. I myself prefer rdr2 over fortnite, but fortnite is, by definition, game of the year. Even if you dont agree w it.
        Yeah but you should know on reddit if you say trump the world ends realize that and you should be good and yes, trump is the American president and yes Fortnite won who gives a shit it’s an award that only the fandom that won will remember and trump is someone that only the people who hate on him will remember I’ll probably forget writing this stupid fucking argument where I’ll probably look at it on accident and cringe thinking “holy shit i was dumb” I’m cringing right now writing this because I don’t think it’s good enough, I’m finding plot holes in my own fucking argument and usually those plot holes aren't used now I’m just ranting about how insecure during arguments I am.
            Cool i still hate redditors besides u, the one logical one
                I am far from logical bud, like me having a mental breakdown about how the longer my arguments are the more plot holes they get.
