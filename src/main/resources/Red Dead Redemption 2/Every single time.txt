[[Every single time]]





You can find some cool stuff while talking to these guys. I had this one guy tell me about how his family starved/ froze to death in the mountains, but he got away. That makes me think that his family is the one that all perished in that house up north, the house with the shallow graves by the frozen lake
    Look into Strangeman‚Äôs YT channel. There is a video on this particular interaction. It‚Äôs based on a real life event that happened when some settlers got lost in the snow and had to eat each other. Lake Isabelle in the Grizzlies is named after one of the survivors.

Edit: changed from Mr. Strange to Strangeman xP
        The Donner Party
            Makes me think of Wagons East. Such a good movie.
            I think this is it, too. The event is tragic and very infamous. I think the film *The Shining* also references the Donner party
            There‚Äôs also Donner Falls up north in the map, named after the same irl wagon party
            My 4th grade teacher told the story fo this family in detail and little 10 year old me had nightmares about cannibals and stuff. XD
            There‚Äôs a great Last Podcast On The Left episode on this.
                And that's, when the cannibalism started üéâ
                    Hail yourself!
            Last Podcast on the Left has an awesome series on that
            I only know about them because of Hazardous Tales!
        If you venture up in the grizzlies snow area, you‚Äôll find a wagon and two skeletons I think. It‚Äôs been a while but i found them
            Can also find a couple huddled together on the way to that dude for the gunslinger stranger mission. Poor bastards.
        Shit, I was hoping that it wasn't too big of a stretch! It's awesome that it goes even deeper than I thought, even to the point of changing the name of the land
        Strangeman**
            Ty, you‚Äôre absolutely right
        The survivor in question is Isabella Breen, the last survivor of the Donner party, died in 1935. She was a baby (1 year old) at the time of the disaster.

The entire thing was very dark, they actually murdered and ate two Indians in their party who ironically refused to participate in cannibalism so they attempted to run away.
        I literally just got done watching that video 10 minutes ago.
        I wanna like his channel, but the lack of voiceover really bothers me.
        I saw the frozen couple in the grizzlies once! I don't remember where but right now I am trying to find it!
    HOW?! Every single one threatened me to leave and then started shooting
        Happens most times but sometimes you find folk that will let ya chill
        Some guys prefer to ramble rather than shoot you
        The chill ones typically are sitting at least, never met one that was standing to be friendly.
        Put your gun away before you walk up...
    Holy shit there is a campfire with two frozen people up in the mountains
        I remember them because exploring the mountains is so memorable. There's a *lot* of cool shit up there
    I havent played in a long time but there is a couple that is frozen, huddled together at their campsite, that is run down in the snow. They have a letter I believe, maybe it has something to do with that?
        they have the panoramic map
        I found them when I was searching for the white Arabian
    There is a house in the grizzlies right next to the snow region with two dead people in it. In the cabin there is a ton of food eaten on the counter which is insinuating that they starved to death. There was also a note but I don‚Äôt remember what It said.
    Every time I go to one of these campsites they just tell me to fuck off and shoot me
        Like 5% of the time they won't
    They always just shoot me.
        95% of the time they'll just shoot ya. When you greet the nice ones it'll be obvious because they're say something like "sit down, do you want to listen?"
    Or, you can find a bunch of KKK members to throw a fire bottle at :P
I say 95% of the time they be trying to kill you. But I still go every time just to see if its ever that 5% where they don't
    I‚Äôve approached these camps dozens of times over my playthroughs and literally not once have they not just threatened to shoot me if I didn‚Äôt leave immediately. Does your honour level effect it? I usually do high honour playthroughs but maybe since it isn‚Äôt maxed out when I‚Äôm trying
        [deleted]
            It‚Äôs to make you feel like a pussy before you get capped apparently.
    I think it's just done to make the world feel more alive, and I guess it makes sense that the majority of people that are out camping don't like when an outlaw looking feller on a house rides up to their spot
        Outlaw??? I have max honor thank you very much
            I wonder if appearance plays a part tho. unless you have a literal badge of honor to suggest otherwise, you probably look like a ne‚Äôer-do-well.
                Naw my Arthur is constantly dresses in his most dapper (something fancy from the tailors in Saint Denis) and they still always try to shoot me
                    Ikr, people always comment on how thuggish Arthur looks when I have a symmetrical leather jacket, a swanky vest, deluxe boots and literal fancy pants equipped
        I wouldn't like it either if someone rode up to me on a house!
            Hahahah oops
        Sometimes in cities it works too
    The 5% gets you some real cool interactions and extra info and maybe you get a story or something
    I always check out campfires in hopes it‚Äôs a rival gang camp. But on my honorable playthrough, it‚Äôs sad when a rando camper threatens me. It‚Äôs like chill out dude, I‚Äôm just patrolling for goddamn O‚ÄôDriscolls. Trying to keep the wilderness safe.
I love riding up on an O‚ÄôDriscoll camp at night and throwing a stick of dynamite right in the middle of the campfire. Then, after it explodes and fire explodes everywhere, just sit back and pick off flaming O‚ÄôDriscolls in the middle of the infernal chaos.
    I keep trying to help fellers open the safes they're trying to crack, with that method. Not my fault they stand so close to the dynamite
        I once saw these guys and turned away and left and then they stood too close to their own dynamite and killed themselves... actually kinda sad :/
            I've seen that one by Clay & Clive.

"I'll spend it in your honor, fellers." I believe he said ü§£
                I got it as John and I think he says, ‚Äúwhat a stupid way to go. Well, thanks!‚Äù Or something like that
        I always shoot the dynamite arrow at the safe. 3 birds with 1 arrow you know.
        If it works it works.
    O driscolls was ya?
    "Ahh, peace and quiet!"
    Is o driscall camp(s) available after epilogue?
        I think you can find camps for the other new gangs. I don‚Äôt think the O‚ÄôDriscolls are around in the epilogue.
            Replaced by the Laramie boys I think
                Probably rebranded because some psycho was running around shooting anyone named O‚ÄôDriscoll.
                Different areas though. New Hanover vs. Big Valley
    Honestly, same. It never gets old üòÇ
I came across a camp of Lemoyne Raiders near Rhodes a while back. The oldest of the bunch was a former Confederate soldier and was telling war stories. I ducked down in a bush and listened to him tell his story. Then, I walked out and antagonized them, and Arthur said something along the lines of ‚Äúwill you just shut up with your damn stories?‚Äù After the fight broke out and I killed them all, Arthur said ‚Äúno more war stories for you fellers.‚Äù

That‚Äôs why I always ride up whenever I see campfire smoke. Love the unique little interactions you can get. Love this game to death.
    I‚Äôve done the exact same! Love how immersive the game can be. Glad to see other people play out all the strings this game has to offer.
        A big part of the reason why I do it is because Arthur always has dialogue that actually fits the scenario rather than just generic ‚Äúsay mean things, then kill enemies‚Äù dialogue. It‚Äôs such a great touch and it‚Äôs so immersive that Arthur actually acknowledges the situation that‚Äôs going on.
    Yup did the same thing. Except I threw a dynamite and they all died. Then he said "no more war stories for you fellers"
Actually ran into someone in at denis that didn‚Äôt start shooting as soon as they saw me. Smoked a cigar with the fellow and carried on. Wish the rest of red dead was that tame lol
    ‚ÄúMornin partner.‚Äù  
‚ÄúYOU TAKE ONE MORE GODDAMN STEP AND I‚ÄôLL FILL YOU WITH LEAD.‚Äù  

Well, only one possible response to such rudeness
        Lol everyone acts tough until you break out the bolas. And yes I will waste the $30 on people who mess with me.
        Famous last words of a rude motherfuker who is later found with a tomahawk in his head...
            Another death by natural causes in the old west. You hate to see it.
                That's what he gets for being alone out in the wild during Tomahawk mating season.
        Don't forget starting to shoot you if you block the path in the middle of a plain for 15 seconds
    Yeah that's only happened to me a few times, wish it happened slightly more often.
    GET OUT BEFORE I PUT A BULLET IN YOUR HEAD *BANG BANG BANG*
    whattabout that one guy who is drinking himself to death and tells you how he was in the war and killed people and then passes out from drinking. that guy was cool
        Yeah. Pretty sure I threw him on the fire.
            I definitely threw his ass in the fire lmao.
                Also threw him on the fire
    There are a few who welcome you to the campsite to chill....i feel extra bad when i murder them.  I do it quick and painless like sawed off to the back of the head easy. Never saw it comin
One guy I met was drunk and I gave him some more whiskey. He told me a story before collapsing. I think he died but idk
    If you loot him after he passes out you get a unique item I think, I believe its like a native American band?
        Yes - and I felt gross knowing where it came from.
    He just passes out for being so drunk, but the 3 rounds i put in his face afterwards sure kills me üíÄ
He talks about Fort Riggs and how he was paid to kill to rest of the Indians and how he regrets it.
        I shoulda killed him too then
            The game actually gives you negative honor for killing him, meaning that he‚Äôs either neutral honor or positive honor probably since he regrets his actions. Considering the game gives you positive honor killing KKK members and that old slave catcher (the guy from Rhodes) it‚Äôs easy to see that he was probably forced to do it.
    He passes out actually you can hear him sleep. I  stowed him on my horse and spend 3 days with him there sleeping lol
        What happened when he woke up?
            He never did üò©gave up after 3 days of having him on my horse going from one side of the map to the other. I thought it would‚Äôve been a good opportunity for a funny random event where he wakes up and he‚Äôs all confused. Almost got mauled by a grizzly and he slept through that
                Must‚Äôve been some hard liquor he was drinking.
When I started to explore the open world for the first time, I saw a smoke just outside Valentine and when I got there, there was a only a family trying to build house for themselves and the dad was angry for his lazy sons. After a while another visit to Valentine, I saw the smoke again and wondered.

When I got there, some bandits are attacking the old man and his sons. So I joined the fight against the bandits. After we defeated the enemy, dad thanked me and got angry for his sons' incapability to fight. It was a good encounter and I thought all of those smoke missions will be just like this one. Sadly never encountered another like this one.
    There's a few more interactions with them. If the house hasn't been completed, you can help them out a little more.
    I never even saw that house until the epilogue. I was like ‚Äúthe frick is this here abode‚Äù and I looked it up and realized I‚Äôd missed like 6 stranger missions
    I had something similar but the angry dad started shooting at me after the fight because I was trespassing.
    They turned on me.
        After I killed the bandits the dad glitched and tried to kill me...... so let‚Äôs just say that house is going to go unfinished lol
            He resurrects.  I had to kill him, too and then he asked me for a loan to finish the house, so I guess we're good.
                good thing I have 5k although just put a spare 1k into the camp lol
    oh, seen the dad twice so far not seen the bandits yet. might need to go back then lol
    Yes I've got that too. It's pretty cool
I once helped some dudes make moonshine lmao fun stuff
    Yea I was preparing to delete someone‚Äôs face with explosive rounds from my volcanic pistol, but instead I gave him Indian tobacco for some moonshine. :)
    I hated that interaction because I couldn‚Äôt find Indian tobacco anywhere
    Sadly we have to kill them in the end :( lol they ask for Oleander Sage (Poisonous)
        That‚Äôs in one kind of moonshine in the online, I think?
    Same but online
I always give them the option of handing over their goods first. Unless I'm in a hurry, then its a meat cleaver to the skull. Im playing as death after all and I have a busy schedule to keep.

Those losers in Saint Dennis aren't going to run themselves over with a chariot or set themselves on fire with fire bottles now are they?
Sat with a guy and chatted for a bit.  He warned me about the inbred murderer couple (I had already found and killed them, but it was still a nice gesture).  Then he was like, ‚Äúyou just keep chillin‚Äô if you want, I‚Äôm off.‚Äù  Then he left and I found a perfect rabbit carcass hanging there!

I yelled after him, ‚ÄúTHANK YOU, YOU‚ÄôRE THE ONLY NICE PERSON!‚Äù
    I swear, that game felt like a mini westworld
Player 1: Aims for the travelers head through rifle‚Äôs scope

Player 2: Goes near and shoots off his head with a shotgun

Player 3: Leashes and drags him for a mile
    Gotta get that rope challenge done!
    Player 4: wounds every npc in the area, chases then to the ground, ties them up, lays them out in a line and reads them a list of their crimes before setting them free
        Player 4 when he realizes that even the npc could only camp in the wilderness. Then how‚Äôs it possible to see other npc‚Äôs nearby?
            Huh? Like people riding on the roads that have hawk-vision and somehow see you committing  crime from .75 miles away
                True that. But, most of the times the camps of travelers are in wilderness. I don‚Äôt usually get wanted for killing them unless there‚Äôs roads nearby.
It's so nice when that one guy FINALLY let's you sit with him
    Some guy let me sit with him for a while, I started making coffee and he started blasting, WTF!!
        Probably a tea kinda guy
            Hahahahaha!
Kill them. Only finding a pear or an apple in this poor fella's campfire. Feel ashamed of your behavior. Repeat.
I was hunting in Saint Denis' marshes. I shot a bird I was looking for out of the sky and the guy at the camp opens fire on me. Then I lose honor when I defend myself.
    So much in that game. Basically impossible to be good because the AI is so dumb.
        Do yourself a favor and search Red Dead Logic on youtube.
            I've seen a few live action jokes about it.
not always. sometimes they want to have a chat
When the campers are friendly it‚Äôs interesting to talk to them
Totally accurate for me. I usually just roll up and shotgun any living thing I see then steal their stuff
fr you know i gotta rob them fools
Just........cant.......help.......myself....!
Me: Hey Friend

Random NPC:You want to taste lead boah?
Man I just try to hang out at there camp with them but none of them wants visitors
Every single camp i find orders me to get out.

Nobody wants to talk.

Most of them shoots me in back while i already leaving
expect when its William, then you just give plants and get some speciale tonic
Commenting on an old threat but damn do I love doing this. Four years and multiple play throughs in this game and two things I love doing at finding random lemoyne raider camps and blasting all of them and then finding the murfree brood ones in Roanoke where they‚Äôre looting the people they just killed and you get to sort of ‚Äúavenge‚Äù the family they killed. You ever notice how there‚Äôs the parents dead but there‚Äôs clearly a child‚Äôs doll at the picnic area and no child in sight? Sad
Soooo right
Too accurate
Damn O'Driscolls
My username is relevant to this I think
LMAO. They so hostile though. These campers should get put in the gang section.
I purposely go cause i know they are going to get angry at me and give me a reason to kill them.
This one really spoke to me.
I always brutally murder them and hide their body
    Me too
When i was hunting for the legendary bison i found a campfire with some folk that propably froze to death up the hill there. In that camp there was a note or a photograph but i cant remember what was written or shown on it.
"Do I need stuff? No, but they have stuff. Better take a look."
Fun fact: If you Lasso the camper, and drag them over they camp fire to let them burn alive, you won‚Äôt lose honor! Now you can kill random campers with no consequences!
So anyways, I started blastin.
Best crossover of all time
Same
Not just me then.
I may or may not have literally quoted that one of the times
ESPECIALLY O'Driscolls.
This is a mood
Dude looks like octane from apex
I did this my first play through. I‚Äôm actually in the middle of my second run rn and im tryna be a good boi. So instead I talk to the campers. Unless they don‚Äôt like being bothered. In which case I try to run away but sometimes I gotta shoot back in self defense and then I lose honor. Some of those dudes need to chill out a little bit and give me chance to actually leave them alone instead of just trying to murder me because I was even near them.
I ran into some people, don‚Äôt remember which gang they were from but they had I think a cop or soldier(blue uniform) as a prisoner. I got close and they attacked me. During our gunfight the prisoner who was tied up ended up getting shot. So I wonder if I could have freed him.
Or I'm just like..."A possible companion who wants to chat?!"
I don't remember puttin' up a welcome sign on my tent!
I pause and save game. Then go kill them... I save often as Ive has the most nutty shit happen before and then it auto saves and I only can go back to a save from 30 min to an hour ago so now I save often lol
I only do that if they tell me to get lost. Which they almost always do.
That is so me, I‚Äôll stop whatever I‚Äôm doing to go murder a campsite ü§£ü§£ü§£
I thought I was the only one
This i≈ü literally me ;D
I thought it was just me
THIS ONE^^^ üôè
wow

this is terrible
Only when it's O'Driscalls boys or the Lemoyne raiders. Or just flat out fucked up people. Like the guy that was spying on Charlotte? She was I think in like chapter 5. Also I know I spelled the first one wrong, I don't know how and autocorrect wasn't helping. Sorry
I can‚Äôt control it I have to
Yup, checks out
And we all go over acting friendly, say that the NPCEs are rude for pointing gun at us and then obliterate them with a tiny revolver with explosive rounds.

i like to get creative with it ü§£ü§£sometimes ill drag them with the horse maybe ill stab em mid convo or if they lucky ill hit then with the rifle ü§†
one of the better memes I‚Äôve seen lol

Considering the game gives you positive honor killing KKK members and that old slave catcher (the guy from Rhodes) it‚Äôs easy to see that he was probably forced to do it.
He passes out actually you can hear him sleep. I  stowed him on my horse and spend 3 days with him there sleeping lol
    What happened when he woke up?
        He never did üò©gave up after 3 days of having him on my horse going from one side of the map to the other. I thought it would‚Äôve been a good opportunity for a funny random event where he wakes up and he‚Äôs all confused. Almost got mauled by a grizzly and he slept through that
            Must‚Äôve been some hard liquor he was drinking.
There's a few more interactions with them. If the house hasn't been completed, you can help them out a little more.
I never even saw that house until the epilogue. I was like ‚Äúthe frick is this here abode‚Äù and I looked it up and realized I‚Äôd missed like 6 stranger missions
I had something similar but the angry dad started shooting at me after the fight because I was trespassing.
They turned on me.
    After I killed the bandits the dad glitched and tried to kill me...... so let‚Äôs just say that house is going to go unfinished lol
        He resurrects.  I had to kill him, too and then he asked me for a loan to finish the house, so I guess we're good.
            good thing I have 5k although just put a spare 1k into the camp lol
oh, seen the dad twice so far not seen the bandits yet. might need to go back then lol
Yes I've got that too. It's pretty cool
Yea I was preparing to delete someone‚Äôs face with explosive rounds from my volcanic pistol, but instead I gave him Indian tobacco for some moonshine. :)
I hated that interaction because I couldn‚Äôt find Indian tobacco anywhere
Sadly we have to kill them in the end :( lol they ask for Oleander Sage (Poisonous)
    That‚Äôs in one kind of moonshine in the online, I think?
Same but online
I swear, that game felt like a mini westworld
Gotta get that rope challenge done!
Player 4: wounds every npc in the area, chases then to the ground, ties them up, lays them out in a line and reads them a list of their crimes before setting them free
    Player 4 when he realizes that even the npc could only camp in the wilderness. Then how‚Äôs it possible to see other npc‚Äôs nearby?
        Huh? Like people riding on the roads that have hawk-vision and somehow see you committing  crime from .75 miles away
            True that. But, most of the times the camps of travelers are in wilderness. I don‚Äôt usually get wanted for killing them unless there‚Äôs roads nearby.
Some guy let me sit with him for a while, I started making coffee and he started blasting, WTF!!
    Probably a tea kinda guy
        Hahahahaha!
So much in that game. Basically impossible to be good because the AI is so dumb.
    Do yourself a favor and search Red Dead Logic on youtube.
        I've seen a few live action jokes about it.
Me too
The Donner Party
    Makes me think of Wagons East. Such a good movie.
    I think this is it, too. The event is tragic and very infamous. I think the film *The Shining* also references the Donner party
    There‚Äôs also Donner Falls up north in the map, named after the same irl wagon party
    My 4th grade teacher told the story fo this family in detail and little 10 year old me had nightmares about cannibals and stuff. XD
    There‚Äôs a great Last Podcast On The Left episode on this.
        And that's, when the cannibalism started üéâ
            Hail yourself!
    Last Podcast on the Left has an awesome series on that
    I only know about them because of Hazardous Tales!
If you venture up in the grizzlies snow area, you‚Äôll find a wagon and two skeletons I think. It‚Äôs been a while but i found them
    Can also find a couple huddled together on the way to that dude for the gunslinger stranger mission. Poor bastards.
Shit, I was hoping that it wasn't too big of a stretch! It's awesome that it goes even deeper than I thought, even to the point of changing the name of the land
Strangeman**
    Ty, you‚Äôre absolutely right
The survivor in question is Isabella Breen, the last survivor of the Donner party, died in 1935. She was a baby (1 year old) at the time of the disaster.

The entire thing was very dark, they actually murdered and ate two Indians in their party who ironically refused to participate in cannibalism so they attempted to run away.
I literally just got done watching that video 10 minutes ago.
I wanna like his channel, but the lack of voiceover really bothers me.
I saw the frozen couple in the grizzlies once! I don't remember where but right now I am trying to find it!
Happens most times but sometimes you find folk that will let ya chill
Some guys prefer to ramble rather than shoot you
The chill ones typically are sitting at least, never met one that was standing to be friendly.
Put your gun away before you walk up...
I remember them because exploring the mountains is so memorable. There's a *lot* of cool shit up there
they have the panoramic map
I found them when I was searching for the white Arabian
Like 5% of the time they won't
95% of the time they'll just shoot ya. When you greet the nice ones it'll be obvious because they're say something like "sit down, do you want to listen?"

    It‚Äôs to make you feel like a pussy before you get capped apparently.
Outlaw??? I have max honor thank you very much
    I wonder if appearance plays a part tho. unless you have a literal badge of honor to suggest otherwise, you probably look like a ne‚Äôer-do-well.
        Naw my Arthur is constantly dresses in his most dapper (something fancy from the tailors in Saint Denis) and they still always try to shoot me
            Ikr, people always comment on how thuggish Arthur looks when I have a symmetrical leather jacket, a swanky vest, deluxe boots and literal fancy pants equipped
I wouldn't like it either if someone rode up to me on a house!
    Hahahah oops
Sometimes in cities it works too
I once saw these guys and turned away and left and then they stood too close to their own dynamite and killed themselves... actually kinda sad :/
    I've seen that one by Clay & Clive.

"I'll spend it in your honor, fellers." I believe he said ü§£
        I got it as John and I think he says, ‚Äúwhat a stupid way to go. Well, thanks!‚Äù Or something like that
I always shoot the dynamite arrow at the safe. 3 birds with 1 arrow you know.
If it works it works.
I think you can find camps for the other new gangs. I don‚Äôt think the O‚ÄôDriscolls are around in the epilogue.
    Replaced by the Laramie boys I think
        Probably rebranded because some psycho was running around shooting anyone named O‚ÄôDriscoll.
        Different areas though. New Hanover vs. Big Valley
A big part of the reason why I do it is because Arthur always has dialogue that actually fits the scenario rather than just generic ‚Äúsay mean things, then kill enemies‚Äù dialogue. It‚Äôs such a great touch and it‚Äôs so immersive that Arthur actually acknowledges the situation that‚Äôs going on.
Lol everyone acts tough until you break out the bolas. And yes I will waste the $30 on people who mess with me.
Famous last words of a rude motherfuker who is later found with a tomahawk in his head...
    Another death by natural causes in the old west. You hate to see it.
        That's what he gets for being alone out in the wild during Tomahawk mating season.
Don't forget starting to shoot you if you block the path in the middle of a plain for 15 seconds
Yeah. Pretty sure I threw him on the fire.
    I definitely threw his ass in the fire lmao.
        Also threw him on the fire
Yes - and I felt gross knowing where it came from.
I shoulda killed him too then
    The game actually gives you negative honor for killing him, meaning that he‚Äôs either neutral honor or positive honor probably since he regrets his actions. Considering the game gives you positive honor killing KKK members and that old slave catcher (the guy from Rhodes) it‚Äôs easy to see that he was probably forced to do it.

    He never did üò©gave up after 3 days of having him on my horse going from one side of the map to the other. I thought it would‚Äôve been a good opportunity for a funny random event where he wakes up and he‚Äôs all confused. Almost got mauled by a grizzly and he slept through that
        Must‚Äôve been some hard liquor he was drinking.
After I killed the bandits the dad glitched and tried to kill me...... so let‚Äôs just say that house is going to go unfinished lol
    He resurrects.  I had to kill him, too and then he asked me for a loan to finish the house, so I guess we're good.
