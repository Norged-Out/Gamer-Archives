[[Perfect cast for RdR2 movie D]]





If Roger Clark is available, I'd like to see him as Arthur again
    “Do you like jelly beans?

I got some jelly beans...”
        You’re a wanted man mr Morgan
            5000 dollars for me, can i turn myself in
            Or hugh Jackman
                No. Why not just the original Actors? Now if some of them can't or just don't want to then sure, grab someone else. But other than that, just cast the actual Actors that have been through the whole game already. Either way, no matter what, games turning into movies usually never turn out good. Especially since RDR2 is a huge free roam game that let's you have quite a bit of freedom.
    He loves his character and makes videos in his voice all the time. I’m sure he’d lose a few kg if it meant playing as Arthur
        Yeah but even then losing weight is too much to ask for I want him as him
            yeah he can make well fed Arthur the canon Arthur
            Its really not if he is asked to be in a movie. Actors have very strict diets and exercises before filming. I’m not saying make him a superhero but look as much like Arthur as possible
            I mean he did the motion capture so he’s got the frame. Also I don’t recall him being notably chunky, just... maybe living in a bit better conditions than Arthur was
    Yeah I don't understand why so many of these and to be changed. Many of the cast could play their own characters best, because they have years of experience as them.
        Yes, I can't imagine some of Arthur's lines by someone other than Clark, like "we're more ghosts than people". "I'm afraid" and BOAH
    Eh, I don’t know... of course because of the voice, but he looks so different from the character! At least to me.
        I honestly think Arthur’s voice would be more important than his appearance
            I feel the exact same way, if he doesn't sound like Arthur it's not Arthur and I could honestly say the same about most of the characters.
        I actually think fat Arthur looks quite similar to Roger. Plus, it looks like Rog has been losing weight! :)
        And Chris Hemsworth is closer?
            I never said that...
            He needs a little more beard and then I will decide again
        There's a photo of Roger Clark leaner and he looks alot like Arthur there. And if he leaned out more now he'll look even more so like Arthur cause of the wrinkles and signs of age.

        Arthur's face is based on Roger's.. Their faces are pretty similar when compared. And Roger is much more than just the voice of Arthur. If he is played by a guy like Chris Hemsworth or Brad Pitt, it's not the same character anymore. Only Roger Clark can pull of perfect Arthur. Only Rob Wiethoff can be perfect John Marston. Only B.B Davis can make perfect Dutch.. U know. And if Ben's or Roger's weight is a problem for you, they can always hit the gym. Roger isn't even fat
        They digitally slimed him down for the role.
            Yeah, that’s kind of my point... he isn’t built like Arthur (too short and “doughy”), and the face also doesn’t quite match. If we’re talking about a live-action film, as we are here, where they wouldn’t be digitally enhancing him much if at all.
                Arthur also isn't supposed to be some prince charming either. 
So hemsworth is a shit pick.   He's supposed to look like a big dumb country brute.  Him looking like a dumb brute is mentioned over and over again through out the game.
                    You say he's suppose to look like a dumb brute, but my boy Arthur is the most beatiful man alive.
                        Yeah he’s like a rugged brad pitt.
                            Saying that though i think brad pitt works better as Arthur.
                                Yep
                            I gave my Arthur slicked back (or middle parted?) long hair and he looked like Legends of the Fall Brad Pitt.
                        haha, well at least the working girls agree.
                        My Arthur cleans up nicely as well.
                        I agree, he sure is mighty fine
                        >my boy Arthur is the most beatiful man alive.

Sorry to tell you this...
                        “Pretty Boah?!”
                    One of my favorite things about him, acts all tough and dumb when in reality he’s a very intelligent man.
                        It's a cornerstone of his character, being more complex than appearances.
                        Which the journal showcases so well. Something you could miss if you never bothered to read every entry.
                        Hosea says something about that in a camp interaction - along the lines of “that big and dumb act might work on some folks, but I know you better.”
                    I always thought Arthur was kind of handsome for a bunch of pixels. Definitely not in the typical sort of way, though, so I agree on the Hemsworth thing. 

If only Bruce Campbell was younger, I think the chin would suit Arthur better.
                        Arthur is pretty good looking...I mean...it's not like I'm into dudes it's just...like you're like kissing on some gay dude and like holding his like muscles 'cause his arms just are like wrapped around you and you feel like so safe 'cause you're like... not that you're gay or nothing but God you just want to bury yourself in his chest and just live there forever....

                            Oh boy have I got a [movie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokeback_Mountain) for you.
                                [deleted]
                                    How many gay cowpoke (huehuehue) movies are there?
                            Arthur whispering in your ear, *"There's a good boah."*
                        A young Rory McCann with better hair would be ideal to me, if he could pull of the accent (If they ever made a live action adaptation I hope arthur's accent will be western instead of Louisianan).
                    I alqays thought Arthur was hot and charming in that rugged and rough fashion of his
                        I think this is a matter of falling in love with the character.   
remember when the game was first announced and trailers started dropping. The fan base was absolutely livid about the idea of playing as a 'big dumb hick' etc... 
where marston clearly hearkened back to a man-with-no-name vibes, Arthur calls back to 'the duke'.  In the game we have a lot of control over how he looks and couple that with the very well written redemption arc, and he's hard not to love, but based on appearances and a few teaser trailers alone, the fan base was absolutely not thrilled about his appearance.
                    Arthur is SUPPOSED to be whatever you want him to be. Roger said it himself, "YOU GUYS ARE ARTHUR”
                        I'm talking about the narrative of the story, not the gameplay. Because in a live adaptation, arthur would be set in stone, not subject to the choices of the viewers.
                            But even in the game he gets called a pretty boy, for example the bar fight in Valentine with Javier.
                    every one calls him a pretty boy in the story tho.
                        nah, it happens a few times, and far less frequent than comments about him being a brute or "smarter than he looks" or "just stand there and look intimidating" etc...
                        “Pretty boah? PRETTY BOAH?! You gotta be kidding me...”

He is sexy af, though, even if he doesn’t realize it.
                    Josh brolin would be my pick for Arthur
                        If her were younger i'd be all in on that. 
Arthur is 36 tho.
                    What do you mean? Arthur is beautiful af comparing to other characters
                    I get more of a jake Gyllenhaal vibe from this particular pic'.

Both are too handsome for the role.

OP, you had me up until simpson on the end.

I mean you get more acting from a lump of coal.
                    I agree, also think Buscemi and Momoa are bad picks. It would be better to have the actual voice actors of Arthur and Marston play as the live action characters I think.  Definitely no Jessica Simpson.
                    Yeah Hemsworth as Morgan is the worst casting choice on the list. But those are some tough shoes to fill...boa!
                    The entire list is a shit pick.
                I agree with the doughy bit, but Arthur is 6’1, so is Roger. If Roger slims down for the roll I think he’d be perfect
            if it works then great, but i dont really want another tarkin
    I just want to see him in anything now. The dude’s an amazing actor and his other output is pretty scant.
    I’d like to keep Micahs voice actor in the same role, that’s a guy who looks JUST like his character haha
        cant do the same with Dutch sadly. The face might match but have you seen how much of a unit his voice actor is?
Hahahaha! John C. Reilly as Uncle! PERFECT!
    The best casting choice on this list
    Lumbego!
        It’s very serious!
    I'd like jack black, but John is also amazing.
        Hmmm.. okay. And Jack Black would probably do a Red Dead movie for free
        John C. Reilly is a superior actor. Jack Black is pretty much just himself in everything but Reilly has demonstrated some range.
Man, don't do Steve Buscemi like that. He's not a rat.
    But I’d be damned if he couldn’t play a good one.
        He played such a good one in Fargo I could totally see that
        If you watch boardwalk empire youd see he plays that character to really well
            Was gonna say that
    Was going to say the same thing. Hell, put Shia in that role.
        I was going to say the same thing
            Even Ben Foster (from 3:10 to Yuma and the Punisher).
                Not the Watford goalie?
        Actual cannibal Shia Labeouf?
            Do you partake in a legendary fight with shia LaBeouf
    Also why not just use Micah’s voice actor? He pretty much is Micah in real life. (As far as looks and voice) 
https://i.imgur.com/nGgYe8k.jpg
        Most of these can easily be casted by their voice actors. And they'd be cheaper to pay than the mountain of A-Listers.
            Lol, right? Can you imagine how much Clint Eastwood costs to have in a movie?
                Eastwood also would make a terrible Hosea.  I can't think of a single character he's ever played that was anything close.  Christoph Waltz would be a better choice.
                    Christoph Waltz could play every single character in RDR2, including the women and children.
                        And not just the men, but the women, and the children too
    I truly thought mr pink was the rat for a good portion of reservoir dogs
    Your out if you’re element Donnie!
        You got your “your” and your “you’re” mixed up.
        V. I. LENIN. VLADIMIR ILYICH ULYANOV!
            I am the walrus!
    I think Micah should be the guy who plays grima wormtongue in LotR
        Brad Dourif 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad\_Dourif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Dourif)

He's really good.  

He did a wonderful job as Chucky in the Child's Play series.
            He was the Doc in Deadwood and a serial killer in star trek.
        oh fuck, that's good!
        Personally I think Norman Reedus would make a great Micah. He seems like he could play a good asshole, and add the mustache and you're golden.
    I think he’d make a better Seth
    Yeah. He doesn't seem right to me. Sam Rockwell could be amazing in that role, however.
        I’ve always envisioned Sam Rockwell as Micah so I’m glad to see someone else say it !
            I think he'd be perfect in look and temperament.
    I think Micah’s actor Peter Blomquist could easily just play his character. I mean he looks exactly like Micah. Some would even say Peter looks more like Micah than Micah looks like Micah
    I think Walton Goggins would be a good Micah.
Going way too much of facial similarities. Some of those actors would be tragically miscast in those roles.

EDIT: A couple of my suggestions: Christoph Waltz is the right age to play Hosea, and his performance in Django Unchained really lends itself to the role IMO.

Clive Standen for Arthur. About the right age, the right grizzled kind of look, and his stint in Vikings showed him able to handle a complex role. My second choice for the role would be Luke Evans. Roger Clarke himself is an obvious choice but it would require a lot of work to make him look the part and I've never seen him on the screen so can't comment on his acting ability.

Tom Hardy for Micah. He was so good as the backstabbing villain in the Revenant I watched it three times before I realised it was him.

Dutch is a hard one. You need someone with a commanding screen presence to sell that "I have a PLAN" language and really make you believe it. Off the top of my head at short notice, Josh Brolin comes to mind. The ideal casting if we could reach through time and space would of course be Tombstone era Powers Boothe, but alas.
    Swanson and Javier cast off of *similar facial hair* ....
        Tbh, Jeremy Irons could probably do a decent Swanson portrayal
            Jeremy Irons can do anything. He'd be a better Karen than Jessica Simpson.
                Anyone would be a better Karen than Jessica Simpson.
                Yeahthe list was pretty good up until Jessica Simpson.
                    Don't know much about some of them, but I'm not a fan of several. This list focused alot on look alikes rather than actual actor. Love Hemsworth, love Buscemi, love Eastwood, but none of them fit those characters at all. I don't know enough about Nick Katt, but it literally looks like they grabbed him for the facial hair lol. Not big on Reedus as John either, but that's not a huge complaint.
                Agreed
        Jeremy Irons would be a great Swanson but tbh he's mostly just great. I'd actually possibly cast him in a live action adaptation as Hosea (Clint Eastwood is a miscast. Hosea is warm and expressive, while Clint has made his mansions playing stoic types)
            I agree irons should play hosea
                He nails those mentor figure type roles
            The guy from gangs of New York could play dutch
                Daniel Day Lewis. He is outstanding in anything he does, he'd be an excellent Dutch
        The ‘tash on Jeremy Irons is fake and shopped in, so fair to say that one wasn’t done on facial hair.
        right? who tf is Nicky Katt? lmao I would choose Michael Pena
        Wait are you saying that’s not shopped?
        That mustache is photshopped bruh
    Clint Eastwood is far too much of a tough guy to play light-hearted dad conman hosea
        jeremy irons too
            I think maybe he could pull it off but it's weird to cast an actor based off his facial hair

Chris Hemsworth however is perfect I'd love to see him play Arthur
        That's what I thought too
        He's also way too old to play him. Hosea is supposed to be around 55 years old in the game (according to Red Dead wiki at least) and Clint Eastwood is 90 years old already.
        Perhaps, but he might pull it off. He’s pulled off some weird movie stuff before, watch some of his movies and they might surprise you lol I can see him playing him Hosea Matthews, he’s played a bit of everything and he would know what to do
            Yeah, I feel like people are half choosing due to type-casted actors but some of these guys could switch it up a ton. It's not about the roles they've played well, but how well they play varied roles
        Definitely - for me John Slattery is the obvious choice for Hosea - Clint would be great as Landon Ricketts though
        I rather have William H Macy in that role.
        Robert Duvall ftw.
    Came to say this, what a shitty way to create a fantasy cast.
        Also I feel like fan castings never take into account fame. Like they'll hire a huge A Lister for a role that in a movie would have like 2 minutes screen time.
            Yup. Between relying too much on physical appearance and trying to produce All-Star casts, I'm generally not a fan of fantasy casting at all. 

Like, let's say this is a 2 1/2 movie. If you're trying to condense out the main points of RDR2 into that, you're probably focusing the film on Arthur, John, Dutch, Micah, Abigail, Sadie, and Charles. Bill and Javier are relegated to pretty small parts (and only not eliminated outright due to consideration for a sequel). As beloved as he is, in a condensed story, Hosea is possibly eliminated too. Swanson and Straus are very likely out. Karen and Uncle might pop up for a moment a relief a couple times, but that's about it. 

Realistically, if they were going to do RDR2 too as a production, makes more sense to shoot for a 40 episode Netflix/HBO/Amazon style series. And that's probably going to change the actors you go for. Doesn't really need to be an All-Star cast
                Yeah I think all the characters you listed as small parts would be basically cameos in a movie. I think in a movie you'd probably drop the plot of John being wounded at the start, so you'd be able to reduce the roles of Javier, Bill, and Lenny even further. I'd actually argue you would reduce Charles' role too. Though that's contentious because he's the main POC in the film. But ultimately the bond between Arthur and John is important so you'd focus on that 

A movie would also probably drop the epilogue and end with a certain death. So Abigail would definitely be reduced (Maggie from TWD would fit a smallish role in a big movie tho tbh). I think Hosea would be in it because of his importance in the morality of the group. You need that shock second act death that serves as a turning point in the film.
                    > I'd actually argue you would reduce Charles' role too. Though that's contentious because he's the main POC in the film. But ultimately the bond between Arthur and John is important so you'd focus on that 

Between him being the main POC and the fact that Arthur, John, Sadie, and Charles are the ones fighting on the same side at the end is why I think Charles would still be a pretty major character.
                    Agreed, also I'd like to point out that Hosea was an important figure in the story as he contrasted Dutch >!and his death played some part in Dutch's insanity later on imo!<
                Fuck it, a TV series about the gang before 1899 would be awesome
                    A series about the game would be awesome. Just open the series on the running up into the mountains to get away from the law. Go save John in the first episode, introduce Sadie in the second, head down into the Heartlands by the end of the third.
            Beyond that even is the fact that the vast mayority of the film budget would have to go to the cast... fans Love picking A-listers.
                Well, I guess that's what makes them A-listers.
            A-Listers in 2-minute roles and then absolute Z-Listers for the Leads. Who even is Nick D’Amici? Is there anything making him the right pick for Dutch beyond...having a mustache? 

It’s the most obvious casting in the world: Josh Brolin. There you go, done. He doesn’t have the exact same bone structure as Dutch but it’s not like that matters at all. There are also a fuckton of actors that would be great for Lenny but for some reason he’s not even here.
    Thank you, came to give some of these a Big ol'  Ooooof
    "We need an Indian to play Charles Smith."

"How about Momoa?"

"He *does* have tribal tattoos..."
        Thank you I was gonna say a Black and Native American character and Momoa looks nothing like the character.
            Or the white guy to play the Mexican...
        But he's to big a build for Charles
        Trevante Rhodes would be a better Charles imho. Momoa is a little too flashy, Charles is more softspoken and subtle.
        Hey, at least they didn't white-wash it...*insert Will Smith gif about 'he a little confused but got the right spirit'*
    Very true. But this is a fantastic fit for facial similarity on almost all of them.

Also John C. Riley as Uncle would be gut-busting.
        This is a good one. I also always imagined John C. Riley as the union soldier in Valentine that lost his arm
            Mickey. I thought the same thing.
    If it were strictly facial similarities, I don’t think you could get closer for John Marston than Taylor Kitsch. Even the voice sounds similar.
        Texas forever
        100% agree.
    Totally agree. This is a terrible list
    Daniel Day Lewis perfect for Dutch.
        DDL is perfect in everything.
    I can't think of a worse choice for Marston than Norman Reedus.
    Yup. How the characters look wouldn't be all that important imo. 

Also, casting the Native American/Black character with a Hawaiian dude. And not using a Latino actor for a Mexican character. Yeah, that's probably not going to go well.
    The actor playing John was doing Boondock Saints (at 30 years old) when the actor playing Arthur was in High School.
        Yeah, Boondock era Reedus might have been a good call, but at his current age? No way. Hemsworth is actually older than Arthur is canonically, but he doesn't have the same rugged character. He couldn't pull off the tired Gunslinger at the end of his rope.

EDIT: Scratch that, Hemsworth is a great actor and he definitely could pull that role off. But it would be his version of it, and it wouldn't look or feel like Arthur.
            I feel like Hemsworth is probably too good looking and charming. But he *is* a very good actor, he might be able to pull it off.
    Jeff Bridges would be my shout for Dutch. Charisma and physical presence. He'd be good in the weathered yet polished look.
    Jeffrey Dean Morgan has the right amount of gravitas to play Dutch.
    Liam Neeson as Dutch.
    Josh Brolin is probably the only actor who could play Dutch as well as or better than Benjamin Byron Davis.
    Tombstone era Powers Boothe would be so amazing for Dutch.

Also I know this post is over a year old but I just wanted to say that.
Yeah Charles is a black/Indian man. And Jessica Simpson is a bad actress
    Charles's casting kind of made me mad lol. Him being half Native is also extremely plot relevant for the last chunk.
        I know that's literally what drives for most of the game. Obviously these were picked based on looks. But even Jason mamoa doesn't look like charles
            And Steve buscemi as Micah? Doesn’t look like him and it’s a bad fit too
        Seriously, they didn't even TRY and fit Lenny in here either and couldn't be bothered to put any effort into a suitable actor choice for Charles, so I wrote this off and barely glanced at the rest.   


Nikky Katt isn't even fucking Hispanic.  Whitewashing pisses me off on most days, but this was just goddamned blatant.
            Whitewashing and "well he's not entirely white so they can basically play any Native American/Hawaiian/Maori/Hispanic character" annoys me so much.
            Michael B Jordan for Lenny? Young, kinda funny, but can also be a badass
                I'd say Lakeith Stanfield for Lenny personally.
    Yeah, think it would be pretty important for him to actually be half black half native, otherwise it would just be selling the role short.
        Maybe Jamiee Fox in a Django type role?
            Possibly, but I imagine he would have to be a big dude, like Charles. Plus Jamie Fox doesn't really look native enough. As far as badass black cowboys though, Jamie Fox has set the bar.
                Trevante Rhodes
                    Hmm, never seen him in anything, but he doesn't look native enough. I think Charles looks more native than he does black, so you could probably get away with a native actor that's not black more than you could a black actor that's not native.
    Also no Lenny?
        Donald glover as lenny
            [deleted]
        Lenny? Lenny?...LENNY?
    Yeah, you absolutely couldn't get away with that casting, nor do I think he'd do a good job with it.

I was thinking Zahn McClarnon could do a good job with the role.
        Oh yeah he was good in Fargo.
    Juno Temple would be a really good fit. Amazing actress.
I’m not a fan of Steve for Micah. Love his acting but the personality seems off. Also I think Clint is too old for Hosea. In my opinion of course. 

Maybe Micah - Johnny Knoxville with a wig and Hosea - I cant think of. Yet someone more smooth less intimidating. Robert Duvall is too old. Harrison Ford?
    Oh a tanned up Harrison Ford would be excellent
        I mean, that statement can be used in just about any context.
        On the contary Mark Hamill would be better
        Eh, I think Harrison Ford is past his prime, mostly because he doesn't really want to put in the effort anymore. Which is totally fine, but I think if we're thinking about them actually making the movie today, we're not going to get the best performance out of Harrison.
    Knoxville is a great pick
    Steve should be cast as the chain smoking stranger that starts the cigarette card side quest.
        That's perfect
    I'd say Sam Rockwell would be an even better fit for Micah
        Amazing too.
        I thought the same thing! I think he'd be perfect in looks and demeanor.
        100% Sam Rockwell would be perfect
    I think Gary Oldman would be great for Hosea.
        A mean tweet written for Gary Oldman on Jimmy Kimmel:

"Gary Oldman sucks and his accents are annoying as shit!"


Gary's reaction:

"Yep!"
    Harrison Ford is also super old though.
        While I thought Eastwood and Duval are around 90 years old I didn't realize Ford is 78, I was thinking Ford is late 60s early 70s and would be closer to Hosea age but nope.
            He just looks younger I guess but you’re so right.
    Kevin costner maybe?
        Love that idea. Just somebody who can have that funky voice, super smooth, almost like his demeanor in MR. Brooks. Loved his play off him and William Hurt. Smoothness from tin cup. Man this can go well
    Hi, I’m Johnny Knoxville and this is The Betrayal
        Hi I'm Johnny Knoxville and this is the rat prank
    I think Gary Oldman would be great for Hosea.
Now get those characters in one movie?... Guess it's impossible. It would work more like a short series, like the Quentin Tarantino 4x 1h cut for the hateful eight.
    Wait where can I find the hateful eight thing? Love that movie
        Netflix in the U.S.
            Damn I’m in the uk and don’t have a vpn
    > 4x 1h cut for the hateful eight

Fuck not available in my country :( just rewatched the movie and i wish it was longer
        My comment is now sponsored by Nord VPN ;)

In my Netflix it isn't available, so I had to use a VPN. Totally worth it for just this xD
    This many big name actors in one movie would be ridiculously expensive too.
...Jessica Simpson? I want to have a quiet word with whoever made this
    They’re probably a huge Dukes of Hazard (2005) fan.
        I'm confused, was Dukes of Hazard bad? Been a real long time since I watched it.
            Just that she hasn’t been relevant as an actress since that movie came out 15 years ago. Thought it was funny OP thought of her to cast. She’s not looking very Daisy Duke these days.
    Tbh half of these are terrible suggestions.
    Juno temple would be my pick.
LEEEEENNNNNY?!
    Can't believe i had to scroll so far to reach this much needed comment.
        Can’t believe they didn’t add LEMMY!
        Was doing the same. Tilly is missing as well. OP not know any black actors? Lol.
            Lakeith Stanfield would make a great Lenny IMO
    ?ynneL
Josiah Trelawny - Christoph Waltz
    You are right, dear boy!
    Or even better as Strauss
        O think he'd be better Trelawny than Strauss.
            Maybe, i keep imagining him from the role from Django and Inglorious Basterds, he's really good at playing germans
                Yeah because he's from Österreich.
    Strauss instead!
        Waltz is too good for Strauss. Strauss is side character of side characters and sometimes I don't remember him when I start a new game. If he'd play Trelawny same way as Dr. Schulz, he would became my favorite character and putting him in a role of Strauss would be waste of his talent.
Y’all just gonna forget Domhnall Gleeson as Sean?
    Even in death, everyone forgets about Sean. Would be funny if Sean Bean was cast to play Sean.
    YESS
Some of these are just absurd.
Wow Lauren Cohan is perfect for Abigail! Thank you I’ve been trying to place who she reminds me of since I started playing haha. 

Whenever you ask how she is and she does that “I’m fine Arthur.” but she’s a bit grumpy it’s defo Lauren Cohan
    I’ve always seen Abigail as Mila Kunis. She would be perfect casting in my opinion
        I was actually thinking Laura Prepon as Abigail
Diego Luna as Javier. Loved him in Rogue One.
And I promise I’m not being a Star Wars fanboy but John Boyega would make a good Charles Smith too. Similar body type and I think he could pull off the lace front wig he’d have to wear to portray him.
    “John Boyega” and “lace front wig” is a phrase combo I am glad to have read today lol.
        Hey if Henry Cavill can do it for The Witcher why can’t John do it for Redemption. (Btw that’s what Hollywood is gonna change the title to. Red Dead Redemption is too long and not snappy enough for Big Hollywood)
            But it bounces off the tongue in such a fun way!
    Or Pedro Pascal as Javier
    Holy crap I'm so glad I wasn't the only one to think John Boyega for Charles. Harden and slow is american accent, have him hit the gym, add some makeup scars and a wig and you've got it!
Micah's actual actor is much better.
    Buscemi is awesome waaaaaaat, definitely shouldn’t play Micah tho
    Mr. Pink disagrees.
    Never saw Boardwalk Empire huh?
Tom Hardy would know exactly how to play Morgan
    Tom Hardy's role in The Revenant was basically Micah in my mind.
        FUCK, I forgot how good that movie is.
    Tom Hardy is fucking masterful
    Might be a bit old for the part but I can see Josh Brolin pulling off a good Arthur too.  

Most of the list is kinda meh but John C. Reilly as Uncle is inspired.
    I think he could pull of the 'dumb brute' look while actually being intelligent, but he's too short imo. I wouldn't want the movie to have to rely on camera angles and shit to make him look big and intimidating like they did with Bane.
        Or just u know... Roger Clark
            if he cut some fat and put on some muscle he'd be great.
Need someone else for Micah (maybe David Harbour there) and Dutch needs to be larger than life.  A glowing, ethereal, presence.  

Ed Harris is perfect for Milton.

Christoph Waltz would make a better Strauss.

Jessica Simpson no way

Gotta swap out Momoa with an actual Native American

Also, where is Grimshaw?
    Judi Dench obviously
    This is off the top of my head, but I think Leon DiCaprio could work for Dutch. It's not exactly on-brand but I think he could make it work. He's a little old, but Daniel Day-Lewis would also be a great choice.
        Lmao I also said Daniel Day Lewis as Dutch.
    Kathy Bates
Daniel Day Lewis as Dutch?? I just re-watched Gangs of New York and i figured he’d play a really good Dutch
    I think he’d be a great Hosea
        Hell, he could even do a really good Trelawny now that I think of it!
    Absofuckinlutely. Brilliant.
I think eastwood is too old for hosea. And reedus is WAY too old for John
    Eastwood doesn’t have the right personality for Hosea either.
    Doubt Clint would even want to act in it, last western he played in was Unforgiven and that was in 1992.
I agree with them all except Jason Momoa and Jesica Simpson.
    Charlize Theron is throwing me off a bit too. It’s close, but I think there could be someone better.
        they should legit just get Alex Mckenna, she's perfect with voice and looks.
        Evan Rachel Wood
    Yes, that's what i wanted to say.
No Offense but this is one of the worst cast i have ever seen.   
if you base it on looks, then it's pretty good.
    Agreed there are a few fits, but it's mostly non-sense.
director: Tarantino

plot twist: Arthur lives
    You're gonna see a lot of uncle's feet and a 20 min revenge porn scene at the end blasting the shit out of Micah and Dutch.
    Director: M night shyamalan

plot twist: it was water all along
    Dutch wakes up in Tahiti. He’s an 8 year old child. The whole thing was a dream
        Have you ever seen a Tarantino?
            No, I’m afraid of spiders.
Jack Black as uncle would be legendary
    Too much energy for Uncle.
Where's Tilly and Mary-Beth...and Jack....and Pearson
    And Lenny? And Sean? And Grimshaw?
    Logan Browning as Tilly 
https://www.hypehair.com/328182/were-obsessed-with-logan-brownings-curly-cornrows/
    I think John C. Reilly would be a better Pearson
If your goal is purely to cast based on looks... uh... sure. But half of these are massive miscasts in terms of the actual acting.

Also Momoa as a Native American is uuhhh....
    >Momoa as a Native American

And Katt as a mexican, OP literally just based it off of facial hair lol
Uncle hahaha. I would've went keanu reeves for John. Clint Eastwood is too old now, in his younger years for sure though
    Keanu is in his 50s... he looks good for 50, but put him next to someone in their late 20s and it'll be obvious. 

Arthur shouldn't be someone that's incredibly handsome, but someone with hollywood good looks would work for John.  part of john being the 'golden boy' or 'prized pony'.
        Yeah, I don't think Norman Reedus or Keanu is a good pick for John. They're both in their 50s. 

I'd pick someone much younger, especially given John is supposed to be mid-late 20s during the bulk of RDR2.
    John C Riley is a goddamn classic. I love watching that guy in anything
    [deleted]
        He's old af to play John and tbh his acting is bad, Jake Gyllenhaal is better imo
    Keanu 20 years ago would have been a good Marston, maybe
Half the budget on actors alone
I'd take Tom Hardy as Arthur, because of his work in Lawless. I think he would be a perfect Arthur.
    Tom Hardy is one of the greatest actors of our generation, I thought he might make a great Arthur, but I also think he would make a phenomenal Dutch. His skill set would allow him to portray any of the main cast and I think he would do an amazing job.
        I would go with Dutch, he is a REALLY complex character, Tom Hardy could play Dutch's slow progress to complete madness really well
Fuck now I really badly want a rdr2 movie
nah man....not Hemsworth.....nah...can't let you do my boy Arthur like that.   You get your ass whupped for something like that man.
Clint Eastwood no. He is too old now and in any case he made his name playing strong taciturn characters, not a loquacious charmer like Hosea.
Jason momoa should be nowhere near this
I think you could pick someone else for Sadie and it be better and forget Jessica Simpson but pretty good overall
    How about... Alex McKenna?
    Kiera Knightley as Sadie
This is kinda fucked up but Lauren Cohen does look exactly like Abigail wow
Nah this is pretty bad actually, like 90% of these choices are based on facial similarities alone and some on just their damn facial hair
Jessica Simpson is a straight up HORRIBLE actress. She couldn't even play a dumbass on That 70s Show without making it seem forced.
LENNNNNAAAAYYYYYYYYY WHERE ARE YA?
Who knew a post on this sub could make me so cranky after looking at it.
Sorry but this aint the one
Jessica Simpson? What is this 2005?
Very interesting. Many good choices, but Clint Eastwood feels a bit to old and a bit too grumpy to be Hosea imho. I don’t have a good suggestion to replace him with though.
    Sean Bean
        Sean Bean has to be Davey, look-a-like and well.. dies.
        Damn, now you're talkin'. I love that idea. Even works out for >!Sean Bean's notoriety for always taking roles where he dies!<
Lauren Cohan and Ed Harris are cast pretty perfect, but a red dead movie would be horrible
How about we don’t whitewash and cast an actual Mexican actor for Javier and a Black/Indian for Charles.
    Right? The whitewashing couldn't be more blatantly obvious.  All these great hispanic and black actors out there and OP doesn't even bother to make an effort.  He didn't even include Lenny in this ffs
    And include the two black members!!
I would cast Chris Pine as Arthur. Keep Ed Harris for Agent Milton, and cast unknown actors for everyone else. The story is too important to be distracted from by all of these big name actors.

Also, unless they made a Lonesome Dove or Band of Brothers length of movie, a lot of these characters would not have enough screen time to justify these big name actors and the amount of money they would cost to hire.
    I had to look up Chris Pine, but yeah - I could see that! They’d have to “grizzle” him up a bit, though. He looks like a man who’s never been outside without a hat and sunblock. lol
        yeah i thought he was too baby faced until i googled "chris pine beard", honestly would fit well
            I always thought Arthur looked like cowboy Chris Pine.
        He almost looks the part in Hell or High Water. Google him in that movie.
            Guess I’m just used to a bearded Arthur, since I usually keep him that way - but yeah, I can see it!

[This clip](https://images.app.goo.gl/F5us5ipq8Jb4dbxT9) reminds me of the “I’m afraid” scene. 🥺
    why's everyone picking prince charming types for arthur?
he isn't supposed to be that handsome and sharp looking.
        I think he his supposed to be... to an extent.
Don’t do that, don’t make me hate Steve
i don’t know about steve buscemi as micah the rest are pretty good though, i could see tom hardy as a good arthur too but i like the chris hemsworth as well
I dunno. I think [Anson Mount](https://a-cdn.serienjunkies.de/920/1/5/anson-mount-1534.jpg) would make a perfect John Marsten
Some good choices, some not so good, if he hadn’t retired, I think Daniel Day-Lewis would have killed it as Dutch
    Holy shit yea
Clint Eastwood is 90 years old. According to the Wiki, Hosea was born in 1844 which would've made him shy of 60. And no offense to Eastwood, he was a decent cowboy, but he was not really a great actor for fatherly figures like Hosea was. I'd sooner go for a Gary Oldman or Willem Dafoe.
For Micah you could just use his actual voice actor as he’s the character that looks most alike his actor

Either that or clayne Crawford, don’t be making Steve a rat
Ed Harris as Milton is genius
I think Ben Foster makes a better Micah.
    Walton Goggins as a southern Micah would be awesome
Jesus guys why the hell do you want a movie? The games already better than any movie could do with the stories premise
Chris Hemworth's too young to play Arthur. 

Josh Brolin or Kevin Sorbo would've been good picks for him.
    Oof. Josh Brolin!  You nailed that.
    Hemsworth's 37 and Arthur's 36
    Surprised this was this far down. Josh Brolin was my first thought. He fits perfectly in that role. 

Hemsworth is a good action movie star, but he's too much of a pretty boy to play this kind of role.
This is the worst casting I've ever seen in my life. XD
Eastwood and Reedus would be really good actually. Never noticed it
    Too old
I disagree with most selections but a few
Those first 2 rows are just aweful picks. Like the last 2
Dunno about the rest but Chris Hemsworth and Jason Momoa don't really fit here.
Naaah
Jesica Simpson? It’s not 2003 cmon now
No Chris hemsworth. Boooo.
Chris Hemsworth has too much of a "bruh" feel to me to be an authentic Arthur. I think Josh Brolin might be a better choice. Also, Ed Harris is waay to badass to be Milton, maybe go more in a Alfie Allen direction. I'd trade out Jeremy Irons on Swanson for Sam Elliot , since Irons is a British ninny and would most likely overact the role. Javier would be John Leguizamo for me, Karen would be January Jones, Sadie would be Alicia Vikander, Dutch would be Kurt Russel, and maybe Michael Biehn for Micah.
I disagree with every one of these lol
I hate to be this guy, but I don’t like a lot of your chosen cast. 
I think Arthur should be a gruffer man, Hemsworth isn’t bad on the face of it but I don’t think his acting is strong enough. Especially overcoming the Hemsworth effect. I don’t think he could really pull off the lost violent soul who’s way of life is dying. I could be wrong here though since I can’t think of anyone better. Ultimately I think you need a stronger actor. Edit: Harbour might actually be your guy here. 

Clint, on the other hand, is way too gruff for Hosea. Hosea is a gentle soul in many ways. Clint is anything but gentle. Hosea is a smooth talker, Clints acting is often wordless. Someone like pierce Brosnan would be good. Ya know, someone who is still very handsome in their old age and just has that charm. 

Idk much about Damici but a few clips I watched didn’t really capture that cult leader inspiring nature Dutch has. Would be interested to be proven wrong here. The inspiring speech making shifting into paranoid delusions is important here. I actually think Leo would do wonders but he’s one of the best so not crazy. He already did Django so I doubt he does a second western. Depp is another interesting thought but the sane parts might be too sane. I think I’m going to settle on Christian Bale.

Buscemi as Micah is a hard no for me. Steve could do it cause he’s a great actor, but I think you want someone a little younger and brash. Steve at this point is older, and would really translate the sliminess, but not the aggressiveness. I really think someone unknown is best here, but that’s not the game. (Feel the same way about Arthur).  Hugo Weaving is good. Spacey if he wasn’t cancelled could do some interesting things with Micah. Walton Goggins is probably my choice. 

Momoa might be the worst one. Momoa almost always plays a big brute as a big brute. Charles is anything but a big brute in personality. He’s thoughtful and soft spoken. Momoa doesn’t have that in him IMO. Terrence Howard or Fish might be able to pull it off, both are a little old though. There are a lot of talented black actors for this, but many are too small. 

Reedus is pretty good for John. Definitely don’t hate it, and he’s got the voice for it. Still might be someone better out there but I can’t find ‘em. 

Harbour for Bill is a great choice. He’s probably too famous now for a smaller part like that though. But dream away. I think Harbour could play Arthur though too. He really captures that lost brute aesthetic. 

Irons is great, could play anything. Fame level, as with Harbour, would be a problem. 

Abigail, also well casted. Although idk if it even matters for Abigail. She has a pretty uninteresting character IMo. 

Uncle - another perfect casting

Strauss - Gary Oldman or Christoph Waltz. C’mon. 

Javier - idk nick latt very well either but they look alike so Ill give benefit of the doubt

Charlize is over casted as it is as beautiful blonde woman who can be tough. Too glamorous. Yes Sadie is beautiful, but I think she shouldn’t be played by a model type and more of GnD type. Rosamund Pike maybe even Blake Lively. Even Scarlett is better here IMo than Charlize

Nailed Ed Harris though. 

And idc about Karen so sure. 

Just to add a couple. 
Kieran = couple choices but Tom Felton, Radcliffe, or josh Hutcherson

Mary-Beth = chloe Grace moretz. Might be a little young but she has that bookworm shy look
Sean - idk who can do the accent so off look and acting ability alone, Domnhall Gleeson is the obvious choice, but I think Simon Pegg could nail it. 

Lenny - is actually easy since you don’t have to deal with size like Charles. Michael B, Chadwick, Nate Parker all could do it. 

Mr. Pearson - the obvious choice for everyone is going to be Brian Baumgartner but I don’t think he’s got it. Dead serious, not for laughs. Danny Devito might really shine in this role. 

Grimshaw - there’s really a wealth of older women actresses but Julianne Moore is good, but Signourney weaver could really kill this. 

Tilly - Raven-Symone lol or China Anne (might be too young but I think Tilly is pretty young)

Jack - I mean who even cares. Can I just say Jon lipniki and pretend it’s 2001. Or just grab Will from Stranger things and call it a day. 

I think that’s the whole camp?
    >Domnhall Gleeson as Sean! Genius!
Pacific islander, Native American, same thing right?
Clint Eastwood is about 25 years too old to play Hosea. John C. Reilly as Uncle is fucking inspired, though. Especially since he gets to do a lot of the campfire songs and the guy has a great singing voice.
I love Steve buscemi way to much to see him as Micah
I thinks it's funny how people always fantasy cast a man in his 50s to play a mid-20s John Marston. Especially in this casting, where John is now 14 years older than Arthur.
Theres so much more to casting than looking like the character
Why are Charles and Javier not cast as actors who share their ethnicities. Bit weird how you made everyone white lol. Other than that it’s a pretty good ensemble.
We just going to pretend that Jeff Bridges wouldn't be the perfect Dutch?
As an Aussie, no to Chris Hemsworth. Arthur's voice is focal part of his character, an Aussie accent would ruin it
This cast is shit lol
This is more like look alike than a casting. However i agree with most of these choices. 
I couldn't see clint Eastwood wood as Hosea. He is my Arthur back in thr days.
Also how Indian Black man Charles is Jason Momoa
For Arthur i suggest Daniel Day-Lewis. Mel Gibson as dutch , Jeff Bridges as Micah
    DDL is too old and too thin.   
Arthur needs to be a mid 30's tall brute looking guy. Not super sharp looking or handsome.
        DDL should be Dutch
Dave Chapelle as Lenny
    Tyler James Williams has always been my choice.
    Too old for the role.
        Most of these choices are too old for the role.
    John Boyega
Its lacking some Daniel Day Lewis
Nglost of these are pretty bad
Why is no one talking about the 15/10 choice for Charlize Theron as Sadie Adler.
Making me question my sexuality even more dammit.
Dunno about Eastwood for Hosea, he has a look of him in the face, but Hosea isn't really an Eastwood type character.
Lou Diamond Phillips kind of *has* to be Rain Falls, right?
Only if Hemsworth can do the dialect hahaha. Really well done this. 

Edit: Don't think Eastwood could play a role like Hosea bit still a great post
Clint Eastwood couldn't pull off a likeable Hosea. If you had Sam Elliot as Hosea this would be perfect.
I think Hugh Laurie looks more like Hosea Matthews
Surprised I haven’t seen anyone mention Jeff Bridges for Dutch, considering his voice is damn near perfect for the role. With a little makeup he could look the part as well.
I’d rather see Bradley Cooper as Arthur
    Him or Hugh Jackman
        Didn’t think of him, also a great choice
This is fucking awful
Largely spot on but I'd make the following changes:

Arthur - Josh Brolin
Dutch - J.K. Simmons
Micah - Jon Bernthal
Hosea - Robert Duvall
I wish they'd make a red dead movie but rockstar have said they have no interest in turning one of their games into a movie
I like it :D
Charlize TOP :)
Ed Harrison ans Milton is perfect
i feel like rdr2 woulded work as a movie because of the time it takes to finish it if they were going to do someting like this it would be better as a 8 part tv show 8 episodes - 8 chapters but still really good list
Damn that's a pretty good cast list. Maybe my main issue is Hemsworth as Arthur. Don't think he's a good enough actor to play such an amazing role to be honest.

&#x200B;

edit: typo
Why do gamers now want Norman on everything?
I think Josh Brolin would make a really good Dutch
Not bad. Id cast someone else for Micah Bell, maybe Charlie Hunnam. And John Boyega as Lenny
    Chadwick Boseman gets my Lenny vote
Seriously, not going with Jeff Bridges for Dutch??????
    Goddamnit I had to scroll waaaaaaaayyyyy down here to find someone mention Jeff Bridges for Dutch, which I thought would be the easiest first choice out of any of the characters!
Tar and feather me if need be, but it seems weird to take the only two characters of color and not cast them accordingly. (Mamoa isn't white but he's also not Black or Native American; yes, I know Black/Native Charles Smith was voiced by a South Asian dude in the game, it was a bad idea then, too; Nicky Katt is rather obvious) I do see the aesthetic similarities and I think it's a great list otherwise.
I was thinking about how I wish they could make this into a movie. I have some friends in their 60s that I watch a lot of movies with and they love westerns.

But no matter what they do, they would not be able to create a movie with the depth that the game had. All the little moments with the people in towns, the hunting, the side missions would have to be cut for the movie. 

Maybe if they made it into a tv show it could work though!  Longer and more drawn out with slow parts mixed into the action.
I know he's played this type of character alot. But Jeff Bridges would be an excellent Dutch.

Edit: I love Chris Hemsworth but I think Tom Hardy would be badass as Arthur. I'm OK with either though.
Ben foster would make a much better Micah.
idk i feel like poc characters should be played by poc? jason momoa is hawaiian and white so he’s not native american or black, and nicky katt is just full white, according to google anyway. 

could be fun though i would love to see clint eastwood in action again!
Lenny??
But who should be cast as Gavin?
Hemsworth as Arthur would be a misfire, especially if Norman was John - especially given Reedus is about a decade older

Michael Fassbender would make an excellent arthur, hes about the right age and has some resemblance, or, maybe a bit more bold, Will Arnett (slightly more *inspired* choice ill admit) 

Always saw Brad Pitt as a good choice for older John, younger John im less sure - a roughed up Logan Lerman perhaps? Or if you wanted older James Marsden is a great cowboy

I actually think the rest of the picks are solid, Steve Buscemi as Micah is inspired but low-key brilliant

Only other one that doesn't fit is Hosea - Clint is too old, though he'd be great for Landonn Ricketts - John Slattery would be my pick for Hosea
Clint would not be right for Hosea. Hosea wouldn't yell at an empty chair
You know nowadays there’re people that’s gonna point out that Jason Momoa isn’t a Native American and that he shouldn’t play one.
Lenny? Lenny!? LENNY WHERE ARE YOU? LENNY?!?
I don’t think Eastwood would make a good hosea. He was more happy grandpa then hard ass grandpa
What would be interesting is Danny Trejo as Dutch.
Or maybe there shouldn't be a movie because the game is already great? I don't know why people act like live action movies are the pinnacle of storytelling, and every narrative should aim to become one. RDR doesn't need a movie to justify its quality. People talk about how they want X game or animated show to be adapted to live action, then are somehow surprised when it's not as good. If a game is great, how about just leave it as a great game? There is no chance that live action cast would be as good as the characters we already have.
Kinda whitewashed the minorities imo
I just cannot see Eastwood as Hosea. The faces are similar, but I can’t see the personality matching at all.  Eastwood always plays a quiet, brooding, tough guy, frequently close to committing a murder spree. Hosea is kind of an analytical advisor and the voice of reason.
The labor cost alone prevents this from being made lol
Where's Lenny?!
Man, Lauren Cohen is perfect casting, they're twins!!
I don’t actually think you played the game if this is the cast you envisioned
Was with you right up until Jessica Simpson lol
Tom hardy as Arthur would be lit
Steve buscemi is a little too old
Movies are a worse medium than video games. Video games don't need movies
This would be the most expensive movie of all time
Honestly , the only ones I agree with are Lauren Cohan, David harbour and John c reliey. Otherwise not really. And NO ONE is Arthur except for Roger Clark
Micah should obviously be played by Kid Rock.
Wow Abigail though that’s a good match
Too much based on physical similarities rather than character potential
why would Jason Momoa play charles lmao
Chris Hemsworth looks literally nothing like Arthur Morgan
You fucked up the first one with Arthur so I stopped reading. Hes very clearly based on Josh brolin.
No. Just no
The perfect cast is the original cast itself.

If I were to change atleast one cast member, I would want John Walsh as Hosea.

I know John Walsh is not an actor at all, but he literally has the look and sound of Hosea.
More like "which actor looks like a RDR2 character"
There are two ethnic people, Charles Smith who is half native and half black, but the choice made to play him, Jason Momoa is a half Hawaiian half European decent.

Javier is Hispanic but Nicky Katt is completely European decent. How about choosing someone who is from those ethnic groups instead of white washing the only to ethnic characters in the Van Der linde gang.
I’m glad I’m not the only one who sees a resemblance between Norman Reedus and John Marston!
Haven’t gotten past the first line but Jesus this is such bad casting
Red dead 2 doesnt need a movie lol.
Games dont need movies period.
This looks like a list that is only made from a dude living in the midwest and only watches select timey C+ rated movies would do
Chris Pine for Arthur

Ben Foster for Micah

Gary Oldman for Hosea, Clint wayyy too old.
Hard pass on everything but some of the bottom two rows.  Chris Hemsworth, wtf did you even play the game
I mostly agree except for Hosea (fuck clint eastwood), Charles (cast an indigenous person or someone black with indigenous family), Uncle (fuck john reilly), and Emily (jessica simpson just isnt talented honestly)
Pretty whitewashed
You had me right up until Jessica Simpson.
The fact that Ben foster was left out of this cast is a fucking sin against god.
Steve Buscemi? Really? 😆
Should probably cast a Native American as a Native American.
Absolute shit tier casting
Perfect except for the arthur casting. Good job.
Charles Smith should be played by someone with native heritage they don’t get anywhere near enough rep as good guys in western films
Bro this is horrible.. why in the hell would that guy play Dutch?!
YnneL?
Jason Momoa doesn’t even look remotely black. Steve Buscemi is much to old for the role. Reedus and irons would kill those roles great cast. Chris doesn’t have the acting chops you can’t just look the part. Arthur is a troubled person and even though Hemsworth has improved I don’t think he’s there.
Steve bucsemi would be an awful micah cause hes too damn likable
Daniel Day Lewis as Dutch preferably.
Daniel day Lewis as Dutch and Brad Pitt as Micah imo
Yes except for Steve Buscemi. I don’t think he would play a good Micah. And Micah is just one of those characters that completely destroy the story if they aren’t cast right.
Why you gotta do my man Buscemi like that?
It would probably be better as a tv series
Voice actors, I don't see why not? They look like their characters seeing a s they're modeled after em, only thing would be charles actor isnt black nor native and dutch actor would have to lose weight
Clint Eastwood.. in a RDR2 Movie... epic.
All good choices expect Arthur in my opinion otherwise spot on.
Most yeah, some nah.
all are spot on except maybe Micah and Dutch. like really Buscemi is 63 years old
Just gonna leave Lenny out like that
Reverend Swanson one is perfect.
Red dead basically is a movie
Clint Eastwood and hosea look identical wtf
Clint Eastwood and hosea look identical
I think all of them fit except maybe Jessica Simpson as Karen
How about we make charles a real Native American/ black guy
Do people forget the actual actors who played these characters in the first place? They weren't just sitting in a recording booth doing voices, every cutscene is acted out with mocap. So why the hell wouldn't you just recast everyone?
Brad Dourif as Micah. Not Buscemi.
Clint Eastwood is one of the best actors of all time and he already has experience in westerns so I wonder how good he would do Hosea
Charles should be played by a native man, not a Hawaiian man
This is terrible. All just poplour actors for the hell of it. Since when did Chris look anything like Arthur?
Wouldn’t be able to get past Arthur not having Arthur’s voice
All of these ideas are shit.
    Yeah these are pretty bad. Almost all of them make zero sense with the actors ages alone. 

Hosea isn't fucking 90 years old. Steve Buscemi is about 20 years too old to be Micah. Norman is also about 20 years older than John would be. Not sure about Milton, but I doubt he's supposed to be in his late 60s. And the choices for Sadie and Katie are about 20 years too old as well. Terrible choices for most of these. 

And Jason Mamoa as Charles is just laughable at best.
Chris Hemsworth saying Boah would crack me up lol
I disagree with the Charles casting. Charles is a half Black half native. You need someone with a darker skin tone. Also Charles is sticky and short, compared to the rest of the gang. Jason is too tall. Let’s not whitewash Charles please
Or you could pretty much just use the same cast from the game.
Has anyone seen Lenny? Lemmy?! Nlemmy!?
Hemsworth?
I'd be hard pressed to pick a worse arthur.
Jason Momoa is Pacific Islander and Charles is Native American/Black. Also buscemi as Micah?
How u gonna not cast a black guy to play Charles tho.... Also how you gonna cast a white dude to play Javier.... Come on guys yall can do better than that
“Do you like jelly beans?

I got some jelly beans...”
    You’re a wanted man mr Morgan
        5000 dollars for me, can i turn myself in
        Or hugh Jackman
            No. Why not just the original Actors? Now if some of them can't or just don't want to then sure, grab someone else. But other than that, just cast the actual Actors that have been through the whole game already. Either way, no matter what, games turning into movies usually never turn out good. Especially since RDR2 is a huge free roam game that let's you have quite a bit of freedom.
He loves his character and makes videos in his voice all the time. I’m sure he’d lose a few kg if it meant playing as Arthur
    Yeah but even then losing weight is too much to ask for I want him as him
        yeah he can make well fed Arthur the canon Arthur
        Its really not if he is asked to be in a movie. Actors have very strict diets and exercises before filming. I’m not saying make him a superhero but look as much like Arthur as possible
        I mean he did the motion capture so he’s got the frame. Also I don’t recall him being notably chunky, just... maybe living in a bit better conditions than Arthur was
Yeah I don't understand why so many of these and to be changed. Many of the cast could play their own characters best, because they have years of experience as them.
    Yes, I can't imagine some of Arthur's lines by someone other than Clark, like "we're more ghosts than people". "I'm afraid" and BOAH
Eh, I don’t know... of course because of the voice, but he looks so different from the character! At least to me.
    I honestly think Arthur’s voice would be more important than his appearance
        I feel the exact same way, if he doesn't sound like Arthur it's not Arthur and I could honestly say the same about most of the characters.
    I actually think fat Arthur looks quite similar to Roger. Plus, it looks like Rog has been losing weight! :)
    And Chris Hemsworth is closer?
        I never said that...
        He needs a little more beard and then I will decide again
    There's a photo of Roger Clark leaner and he looks alot like Arthur there. And if he leaned out more now he'll look even more so like Arthur cause of the wrinkles and signs of age.

https://www.google.com/search?q=roger+clark&client=ms-android-samsung-ga-rev1&prmd=ivn&sxsrf=ALeKk02WJ1DZZ0xkh6Aff1nO6_brQ6p_fA:1597552182307&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiUp9jS8Z7rAhXWMd4KHYSUC7IQ_AUoAXoECB0QAQ&cshid=1597552064518&biw=412&bih=775&dpr=2.63#imgrc=_UIB8tuwfTZbNM
    Arthur's face is based on Roger's.. Their faces are pretty similar when compared. And Roger is much more than just the voice of Arthur. If he is played by a guy like Chris Hemsworth or Brad Pitt, it's not the same character anymore. Only Roger Clark can pull of perfect Arthur. Only Rob Wiethoff can be perfect John Marston. Only B.B Davis can make perfect Dutch.. U know. And if Ben's or Roger's weight is a problem for you, they can always hit the gym. Roger isn't even fat
    They digitally slimed him down for the role.
        Yeah, that’s kind of my point... he isn’t built like Arthur (too short and “doughy”), and the face also doesn’t quite match. If we’re talking about a live-action film, as we are here, where they wouldn’t be digitally enhancing him much if at all.
            Arthur also isn't supposed to be some prince charming either. 
So hemsworth is a shit pick.   He's supposed to look like a big dumb country brute.  Him looking like a dumb brute is mentioned over and over again through out the game.
                You say he's suppose to look like a dumb brute, but my boy Arthur is the most beatiful man alive.
                    Yeah he’s like a rugged brad pitt.
                        Saying that though i think brad pitt works better as Arthur.
                            Yep
                        I gave my Arthur slicked back (or middle parted?) long hair and he looked like Legends of the Fall Brad Pitt.
                    haha, well at least the working girls agree.
                    My Arthur cleans up nicely as well.
                    I agree, he sure is mighty fine
                    >my boy Arthur is the most beatiful man alive.

Sorry to tell you this...
                    “Pretty Boah?!”
                One of my favorite things about him, acts all tough and dumb when in reality he’s a very intelligent man.
                    It's a cornerstone of his character, being more complex than appearances.
                    Which the journal showcases so well. Something you could miss if you never bothered to read every entry.
                    Hosea says something about that in a camp interaction - along the lines of “that big and dumb act might work on some folks, but I know you better.”
                I always thought Arthur was kind of handsome for a bunch of pixels. Definitely not in the typical sort of way, though, so I agree on the Hemsworth thing. 

If only Bruce Campbell was younger, I think the chin would suit Arthur better.
                    Arthur is pretty good looking...I mean...it's not like I'm into dudes it's just...like you're like kissing on some gay dude and like holding his like muscles 'cause his arms just are like wrapped around you and you feel like so safe 'cause you're like... not that you're gay or nothing but God you just want to bury yourself in his chest and just live there forever....

                            [deleted]
                                How many gay cowpoke (huehuehue) movies are there?
                        Arthur whispering in your ear, *"There's a good boah."*
                    A young Rory McCann with better hair would be ideal to me, if he could pull of the accent (If they ever made a live action adaptation I hope arthur's accent will be western instead of Louisianan).
                I alqays thought Arthur was hot and charming in that rugged and rough fashion of his
                    I think this is a matter of falling in love with the character.   
remember when the game was first announced and trailers started dropping. The fan base was absolutely livid about the idea of playing as a 'big dumb hick' etc... 
where marston clearly hearkened back to a man-with-no-name vibes, Arthur calls back to 'the duke'.  In the game we have a lot of control over how he looks and couple that with the very well written redemption arc, and he's hard not to love, but based on appearances and a few teaser trailers alone, the fan base was absolutely not thrilled about his appearance.
                Arthur is SUPPOSED to be whatever you want him to be. Roger said it himself, "YOU GUYS ARE ARTHUR”
                    I'm talking about the narrative of the story, not the gameplay. Because in a live adaptation, arthur would be set in stone, not subject to the choices of the viewers.
                        But even in the game he gets called a pretty boy, for example the bar fight in Valentine with Javier.
                every one calls him a pretty boy in the story tho.
                    nah, it happens a few times, and far less frequent than comments about him being a brute or "smarter than he looks" or "just stand there and look intimidating" etc...
                    “Pretty boah? PRETTY BOAH?! You gotta be kidding me...”

He is sexy af, though, even if he doesn’t realize it.
                Josh brolin would be my pick for Arthur
                    If her were younger i'd be all in on that. 
Arthur is 36 tho.
                What do you mean? Arthur is beautiful af comparing to other characters
                I get more of a jake Gyllenhaal vibe from this particular pic'.

Both are too handsome for the role.

OP, you had me up until simpson on the end.

I mean you get more acting from a lump of coal.
                I agree, also think Buscemi and Momoa are bad picks. It would be better to have the actual voice actors of Arthur and Marston play as the live action characters I think.  Definitely no Jessica Simpson.
                Yeah Hemsworth as Morgan is the worst casting choice on the list. But those are some tough shoes to fill...boa!
                The entire list is a shit pick.
            I agree with the doughy bit, but Arthur is 6’1, so is Roger. If Roger slims down for the roll I think he’d be perfect
        if it works then great, but i dont really want another tarkin
I just want to see him in anything now. The dude’s an amazing actor and his other output is pretty scant.
I’d like to keep Micahs voice actor in the same role, that’s a guy who looks JUST like his character haha
    cant do the same with Dutch sadly. The face might match but have you seen how much of a unit his voice actor is?
The best casting choice on this list
Lumbego!
    It’s very serious!
I'd like jack black, but John is also amazing.
    Hmmm.. okay. And Jack Black would probably do a Red Dead movie for free
    John C. Reilly is a superior actor. Jack Black is pretty much just himself in everything but Reilly has demonstrated some range.
But I’d be damned if he couldn’t play a good one.
    He played such a good one in Fargo I could totally see that
    If you watch boardwalk empire youd see he plays that character to really well
        Was gonna say that
Was going to say the same thing. Hell, put Shia in that role.
    I was going to say the same thing
        Even Ben Foster (from 3:10 to Yuma and the Punisher).
            Not the Watford goalie?
    Actual cannibal Shia Labeouf?
        Do you partake in a legendary fight with shia LaBeouf
Also why not just use Micah’s voice actor? He pretty much is Micah in real life. (As far as looks and voice) 
https://i.imgur.com/nGgYe8k.jpg
    Most of these can easily be casted by their voice actors. And they'd be cheaper to pay than the mountain of A-Listers.
        Lol, right? Can you imagine how much Clint Eastwood costs to have in a movie?
            Eastwood also would make a terrible Hosea.  I can't think of a single character he's ever played that was anything close.  Christoph Waltz would be a better choice.
                Christoph Waltz could play every single character in RDR2, including the women and children.
                    And not just the men, but the women, and the children too
I truly thought mr pink was the rat for a good portion of reservoir dogs

    You got your “your” and your “you’re” mixed up.
    V. I. LENIN. VLADIMIR ILYICH ULYANOV!
        I am the walrus!
I think Micah should be the guy who plays grima wormtongue in LotR
    Brad Dourif 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad\_Dourif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Dourif)

He's really good.  

He did a wonderful job as Chucky in the Child's Play series.
        He was the Doc in Deadwood and a serial killer in star trek.
    oh fuck, that's good!
    Personally I think Norman Reedus would make a great Micah. He seems like he could play a good asshole, and add the mustache and you're golden.
I think he’d make a better Seth
Yeah. He doesn't seem right to me. Sam Rockwell could be amazing in that role, however.
    I’ve always envisioned Sam Rockwell as Micah so I’m glad to see someone else say it !
        I think he'd be perfect in look and temperament.
I think Micah’s actor Peter Blomquist could easily just play his character. I mean he looks exactly like Micah. Some would even say Peter looks more like Micah than Micah looks like Micah
I think Walton Goggins would be a good Micah.
Swanson and Javier cast off of *similar facial hair* ....
    Tbh, Jeremy Irons could probably do a decent Swanson portrayal
        Jeremy Irons can do anything. He'd be a better Karen than Jessica Simpson.
            Anyone would be a better Karen than Jessica Simpson.
            Yeahthe list was pretty good up until Jessica Simpson.
                Don't know much about some of them, but I'm not a fan of several. This list focused alot on look alikes rather than actual actor. Love Hemsworth, love Buscemi, love Eastwood, but none of them fit those characters at all. I don't know enough about Nick Katt, but it literally looks like they grabbed him for the facial hair lol. Not big on Reedus as John either, but that's not a huge complaint.
            Agreed
    Jeremy Irons would be a great Swanson but tbh he's mostly just great. I'd actually possibly cast him in a live action adaptation as Hosea (Clint Eastwood is a miscast. Hosea is warm and expressive, while Clint has made his mansions playing stoic types)
        I agree irons should play hosea
            He nails those mentor figure type roles
        The guy from gangs of New York could play dutch
            Daniel Day Lewis. He is outstanding in anything he does, he'd be an excellent Dutch
    The ‘tash on Jeremy Irons is fake and shopped in, so fair to say that one wasn’t done on facial hair.
    right? who tf is Nicky Katt? lmao I would choose Michael Pena
    Wait are you saying that’s not shopped?
    That mustache is photshopped bruh
Clint Eastwood is far too much of a tough guy to play light-hearted dad conman hosea
    jeremy irons too
        I think maybe he could pull it off but it's weird to cast an actor based off his facial hair

Chris Hemsworth however is perfect I'd love to see him play Arthur
    That's what I thought too
    He's also way too old to play him. Hosea is supposed to be around 55 years old in the game (according to Red Dead wiki at least) and Clint Eastwood is 90 years old already.
    Perhaps, but he might pull it off. He’s pulled off some weird movie stuff before, watch some of his movies and they might surprise you lol I can see him playing him Hosea Matthews, he’s played a bit of everything and he would know what to do
        Yeah, I feel like people are half choosing due to type-casted actors but some of these guys could switch it up a ton. It's not about the roles they've played well, but how well they play varied roles
    Definitely - for me John Slattery is the obvious choice for Hosea - Clint would be great as Landon Ricketts though
    I rather have William H Macy in that role.
    Robert Duvall ftw.
Came to say this, what a shitty way to create a fantasy cast.
    Also I feel like fan castings never take into account fame. Like they'll hire a huge A Lister for a role that in a movie would have like 2 minutes screen time.
        Yup. Between relying too much on physical appearance and trying to produce All-Star casts, I'm generally not a fan of fantasy casting at all. 

Like, let's say this is a 2 1/2 movie. If you're trying to condense out the main points of RDR2 into that, you're probably focusing the film on Arthur, John, Dutch, Micah, Abigail, Sadie, and Charles. Bill and Javier are relegated to pretty small parts (and only not eliminated outright due to consideration for a sequel). As beloved as he is, in a condensed story, Hosea is possibly eliminated too. Swanson and Straus are very likely out. Karen and Uncle might pop up for a moment a relief a couple times, but that's about it. 

Realistically, if they were going to do RDR2 too as a production, makes more sense to shoot for a 40 episode Netflix/HBO/Amazon style series. And that's probably going to change the actors you go for. Doesn't really need to be an All-Star cast
            Yeah I think all the characters you listed as small parts would be basically cameos in a movie. I think in a movie you'd probably drop the plot of John being wounded at the start, so you'd be able to reduce the roles of Javier, Bill, and Lenny even further. I'd actually argue you would reduce Charles' role too. Though that's contentious because he's the main POC in the film. But ultimately the bond between Arthur and John is important so you'd focus on that 

A movie would also probably drop the epilogue and end with a certain death. So Abigail would definitely be reduced (Maggie from TWD would fit a smallish role in a big movie tho tbh). I think Hosea would be in it because of his importance in the morality of the group. You need that shock second act death that serves as a turning point in the film.
                > I'd actually argue you would reduce Charles' role too. Though that's contentious because he's the main POC in the film. But ultimately the bond between Arthur and John is important so you'd focus on that 

Between him being the main POC and the fact that Arthur, John, Sadie, and Charles are the ones fighting on the same side at the end is why I think Charles would still be a pretty major character.
                Agreed, also I'd like to point out that Hosea was an important figure in the story as he contrasted Dutch >!and his death played some part in Dutch's insanity later on imo!<
            Fuck it, a TV series about the gang before 1899 would be awesome
                A series about the game would be awesome. Just open the series on the running up into the mountains to get away from the law. Go save John in the first episode, introduce Sadie in the second, head down into the Heartlands by the end of the third.
        Beyond that even is the fact that the vast mayority of the film budget would have to go to the cast... fans Love picking A-listers.
            Well, I guess that's what makes them A-listers.
        A-Listers in 2-minute roles and then absolute Z-Listers for the Leads. Who even is Nick D’Amici? Is there anything making him the right pick for Dutch beyond...having a mustache? 

It’s the most obvious casting in the world: Josh Brolin. There you go, done. He doesn’t have the exact same bone structure as Dutch but it’s not like that matters at all. There are also a fuckton of actors that would be great for Lenny but for some reason he’s not even here.
Thank you, came to give some of these a Big ol'  Ooooof
"We need an Indian to play Charles Smith."

"How about Momoa?"

"He *does* have tribal tattoos..."
    Thank you I was gonna say a Black and Native American character and Momoa looks nothing like the character.
        Or the white guy to play the Mexican...
    But he's to big a build for Charles
    Trevante Rhodes would be a better Charles imho. Momoa is a little too flashy, Charles is more softspoken and subtle.
    Hey, at least they didn't white-wash it...*insert Will Smith gif about 'he a little confused but got the right spirit'*
Very true. But this is a fantastic fit for facial similarity on almost all of them.

Also John C. Riley as Uncle would be gut-busting.
    This is a good one. I also always imagined John C. Riley as the union soldier in Valentine that lost his arm
        Mickey. I thought the same thing.
If it were strictly facial similarities, I don’t think you could get closer for John Marston than Taylor Kitsch. Even the voice sounds similar.
    Texas forever
    100% agree.
Totally agree. This is a terrible list
Daniel Day Lewis perfect for Dutch.
    DDL is perfect in everything.
I can't think of a worse choice for Marston than Norman Reedus.
Yup. How the characters look wouldn't be all that important imo. 

Also, casting the Native American/Black character with a Hawaiian dude. And not using a Latino actor for a Mexican character. Yeah, that's probably not going to go well.
The actor playing John was doing Boondock Saints (at 30 years old) when the actor playing Arthur was in High School.
    Yeah, Boondock era Reedus might have been a good call, but at his current age? No way. Hemsworth is actually older than Arthur is canonically, but he doesn't have the same rugged character. He couldn't pull off the tired Gunslinger at the end of his rope.

EDIT: Scratch that, Hemsworth is a great actor and he definitely could pull that role off. But it would be his version of it, and it wouldn't look or feel like Arthur.
        I feel like Hemsworth is probably too good looking and charming. But he *is* a very good actor, he might be able to pull it off.
Jeff Bridges would be my shout for Dutch. Charisma and physical presence. He'd be good in the weathered yet polished look.
Jeffrey Dean Morgan has the right amount of gravitas to play Dutch.
Liam Neeson as Dutch.
Josh Brolin is probably the only actor who could play Dutch as well as or better than Benjamin Byron Davis.
Tombstone era Powers Boothe would be so amazing for Dutch.

Also I know this post is over a year old but I just wanted to say that.
Charles's casting kind of made me mad lol. Him being half Native is also extremely plot relevant for the last chunk.
    I know that's literally what drives for most of the game. Obviously these were picked based on looks. But even Jason mamoa doesn't look like charles
        And Steve buscemi as Micah? Doesn’t look like him and it’s a bad fit too
    Seriously, they didn't even TRY and fit Lenny in here either and couldn't be bothered to put any effort into a suitable actor choice for Charles, so I wrote this off and barely glanced at the rest.   


Nikky Katt isn't even fucking Hispanic.  Whitewashing pisses me off on most days, but this was just goddamned blatant.
        Whitewashing and "well he's not entirely white so they can basically play any Native American/Hawaiian/Maori/Hispanic character" annoys me so much.
        Michael B Jordan for Lenny? Young, kinda funny, but can also be a badass
            I'd say Lakeith Stanfield for Lenny personally.
Yeah, think it would be pretty important for him to actually be half black half native, otherwise it would just be selling the role short.
    Maybe Jamiee Fox in a Django type role?
        Possibly, but I imagine he would have to be a big dude, like Charles. Plus Jamie Fox doesn't really look native enough. As far as badass black cowboys though, Jamie Fox has set the bar.
            Trevante Rhodes
                Hmm, never seen him in anything, but he doesn't look native enough. I think Charles looks more native than he does black, so you could probably get away with a native actor that's not black more than you could a black actor that's not native.
Also no Lenny?
    Donald glover as lenny
        [deleted]
    Lenny? Lenny?...LENNY?
Yeah, you absolutely couldn't get away with that casting, nor do I think he'd do a good job with it.

I was thinking Zahn McClarnon could do a good job with the role.
    Oh yeah he was good in Fargo.
Juno Temple would be a really good fit. Amazing actress.
Oh a tanned up Harrison Ford would be excellent
    I mean, that statement can be used in just about any context.
    On the contary Mark Hamill would be better
    Eh, I think Harrison Ford is past his prime, mostly because he doesn't really want to put in the effort anymore. Which is totally fine, but I think if we're thinking about them actually making the movie today, we're not going to get the best performance out of Harrison.
Knoxville is a great pick
Steve should be cast as the chain smoking stranger that starts the cigarette card side quest.
    That's perfect
I'd say Sam Rockwell would be an even better fit for Micah
    Amazing too.
    I thought the same thing! I think he'd be perfect in looks and demeanor.
    100% Sam Rockwell would be perfect
I think Gary Oldman would be great for Hosea.
    A mean tweet written for Gary Oldman on Jimmy Kimmel:

"Gary Oldman sucks and his accents are annoying as shit!"


Gary's reaction:

"Yep!"
Harrison Ford is also super old though.
    While I thought Eastwood and Duval are around 90 years old I didn't realize Ford is 78, I was thinking Ford is late 60s early 70s and would be closer to Hosea age but nope.
        He just looks younger I guess but you’re so right.
Kevin costner maybe?
    Love that idea. Just somebody who can have that funky voice, super smooth, almost like his demeanor in MR. Brooks. Loved his play off him and William Hurt. Smoothness from tin cup. Man this can go well
Hi, I’m Johnny Knoxville and this is The Betrayal
    Hi I'm Johnny Knoxville and this is the rat prank
I think Gary Oldman would be great for Hosea.
Wait where can I find the hateful eight thing? Love that movie
    Netflix in the U.S.
        Damn I’m in the uk and don’t have a vpn
> 4x 1h cut for the hateful eight

Fuck not available in my country :( just rewatched the movie and i wish it was longer
    My comment is now sponsored by Nord VPN ;)

In my Netflix it isn't available, so I had to use a VPN. Totally worth it for just this xD
This many big name actors in one movie would be ridiculously expensive too.
They’re probably a huge Dukes of Hazard (2005) fan.
    I'm confused, was Dukes of Hazard bad? Been a real long time since I watched it.
        Just that she hasn’t been relevant as an actress since that movie came out 15 years ago. Thought it was funny OP thought of her to cast. She’s not looking very Daisy Duke these days.
Tbh half of these are terrible suggestions.
Juno temple would be my pick.
Can't believe i had to scroll so far to reach this much needed comment.
    Can’t believe they didn’t add LEMMY!
    Was doing the same. Tilly is missing as well. OP not know any black actors? Lol.
        Lakeith Stanfield would make a great Lenny IMO
?ynneL
You are right, dear boy!
Or even better as Strauss
    O think he'd be better Trelawny than Strauss.
        Maybe, i keep imagining him from the role from Django and Inglorious Basterds, he's really good at playing germans
            Yeah because he's from Österreich.
Strauss instead!
    Waltz is too good for Strauss. Strauss is side character of side characters and sometimes I don't remember him when I start a new game. If he'd play Trelawny same way as Dr. Schulz, he would became my favorite character and putting him in a role of Strauss would be waste of his talent.
Even in death, everyone forgets about Sean. Would be funny if Sean Bean was cast to play Sean.
YESS
I’ve always seen Abigail as Mila Kunis. She would be perfect casting in my opinion
    I was actually thinking Laura Prepon as Abigail
“John Boyega” and “lace front wig” is a phrase combo I am glad to have read today lol.
    Hey if Henry Cavill can do it for The Witcher why can’t John do it for Redemption. (Btw that’s what Hollywood is gonna change the title to. Red Dead Redemption is too long and not snappy enough for Big Hollywood)
        But it bounces off the tongue in such a fun way!
Or Pedro Pascal as Javier
Holy crap I'm so glad I wasn't the only one to think John Boyega for Charles. Harden and slow is american accent, have him hit the gym, add some makeup scars and a wig and you've got it!
Buscemi is awesome waaaaaaat, definitely shouldn’t play Micah tho
Mr. Pink disagrees.
Never saw Boardwalk Empire huh?
Tom Hardy's role in The Revenant was basically Micah in my mind.
    FUCK, I forgot how good that movie is.
Tom Hardy is fucking masterful
Might be a bit old for the part but I can see Josh Brolin pulling off a good Arthur too.  

Most of the list is kinda meh but John C. Reilly as Uncle is inspired.
I think he could pull of the 'dumb brute' look while actually being intelligent, but he's too short imo. I wouldn't want the movie to have to rely on camera angles and shit to make him look big and intimidating like they did with Bane.
    Or just u know... Roger Clark
        if he cut some fat and put on some muscle he'd be great.
Judi Dench obviously
This is off the top of my head, but I think Leon DiCaprio could work for Dutch. It's not exactly on-brand but I think he could make it work. He's a little old, but Daniel Day-Lewis would also be a great choice.
    Lmao I also said Daniel Day Lewis as Dutch.
Kathy Bates
I think he’d be a great Hosea
    Hell, he could even do a really good Trelawny now that I think of it!
Absofuckinlutely. Brilliant.
Eastwood doesn’t have the right personality for Hosea either.
Doubt Clint would even want to act in it, last western he played in was Unforgiven and that was in 1992.
Charlize Theron is throwing me off a bit too. It’s close, but I think there could be someone better.
    they should legit just get Alex Mckenna, she's perfect with voice and looks.
    Evan Rachel Wood
Yes, that's what i wanted to say.
Agreed there are a few fits, but it's mostly non-sense.
You're gonna see a lot of uncle's feet and a 20 min revenge porn scene at the end blasting the shit out of Micah and Dutch.
Director: M night shyamalan

plot twist: it was water all along
Dutch wakes up in Tahiti. He’s an 8 year old child. The whole thing was a dream
    Have you ever seen a Tarantino?
        No, I’m afraid of spiders.
Too much energy for Uncle.
And Lenny? And Sean? And Grimshaw?
Logan Browning as Tilly 
https://www.hypehair.com/328182/were-obsessed-with-logan-brownings-curly-cornrows/
I think John C. Reilly would be a better Pearson
>Momoa as a Native American

And Katt as a mexican, OP literally just based it off of facial hair lol
Keanu is in his 50s... he looks good for 50, but put him next to someone in their late 20s and it'll be obvious. 

Arthur shouldn't be someone that's incredibly handsome, but someone with hollywood good looks would work for John.  part of john being the 'golden boy' or 'prized pony'.
    Yeah, I don't think Norman Reedus or Keanu is a good pick for John. They're both in their 50s. 

I'd pick someone much younger, especially given John is supposed to be mid-late 20s during the bulk of RDR2.
John C Riley is a goddamn classic. I love watching that guy in anything
[deleted]
    He's old af to play John and tbh his acting is bad, Jake Gyllenhaal is better imo
Keanu 20 years ago would have been a good Marston, maybe
Tom Hardy is one of the greatest actors of our generation, I thought he might make a great Arthur, but I also think he would make a phenomenal Dutch. His skill set would allow him to portray any of the main cast and I think he would do an amazing job.
    I would go with Dutch, he is a REALLY complex character, Tom Hardy could play Dutch's slow progress to complete madness really well
How about... Alex McKenna?
Kiera Knightley as Sadie
Sean Bean
    Sean Bean has to be Davey, look-a-like and well.. dies.
    Damn, now you're talkin'. I love that idea. Even works out for >!Sean Bean's notoriety for always taking roles where he dies!<
Right? The whitewashing couldn't be more blatantly obvious.  All these great hispanic and black actors out there and OP doesn't even bother to make an effort.  He didn't even include Lenny in this ffs
And include the two black members!!
I had to look up Chris Pine, but yeah - I could see that! They’d have to “grizzle” him up a bit, though. He looks like a man who’s never been outside without a hat and sunblock. lol
    yeah i thought he was too baby faced until i googled "chris pine beard", honestly would fit well
        I always thought Arthur looked like cowboy Chris Pine.
    He almost looks the part in Hell or High Water. Google him in that movie.
        Guess I’m just used to a bearded Arthur, since I usually keep him that way - but yeah, I can see it!

[This clip](https://images.app.goo.gl/F5us5ipq8Jb4dbxT9) reminds me of the “I’m afraid” scene. 🥺
why's everyone picking prince charming types for arthur?
he isn't supposed to be that handsome and sharp looking.
    I think he his supposed to be... to an extent.
Holy shit yea
Walton Goggins as a southern Micah would be awesome
Oof. Josh Brolin!  You nailed that.
Hemsworth's 37 and Arthur's 36
Surprised this was this far down. Josh Brolin was my first thought. He fits perfectly in that role. 

Hemsworth is a good action movie star, but he's too much of a pretty boy to play this kind of role.
Too old
>Domnhall Gleeson as Sean! Genius!
DDL is too old and too thin.   
Arthur needs to be a mid 30's tall brute looking guy. Not super sharp looking or handsome.
    DDL should be Dutch
Tyler James Williams has always been my choice.
Too old for the role.
    Most of these choices are too old for the role.
John Boyega
Him or Hugh Jackman
    Didn’t think of him, also a great choice
Chadwick Boseman gets my Lenny vote
Goddamnit I had to scroll waaaaaaaayyyyy down here to find someone mention Jeff Bridges for Dutch, which I thought would be the easiest first choice out of any of the characters!
Yeah these are pretty bad. Almost all of them make zero sense with the actors ages alone. 

Hosea isn't fucking 90 years old. Steve Buscemi is about 20 years too old to be Micah. Norman is also about 20 years older than John would be. Not sure about Milton, but I doubt he's supposed to be in his late 60s. And the choices for Sadie and Katie are about 20 years too old as well. Terrible choices for most of these. 

And Jason Mamoa as Charles is just laughable at best.
You’re a wanted man mr Morgan
    5000 dollars for me, can i turn myself in
    Or hugh Jackman
        No. Why not just the original Actors? Now if some of them can't or just don't want to then sure, grab someone else. But other than that, just cast the actual Actors that have been through the whole game already. Either way, no matter what, games turning into movies usually never turn out good. Especially since RDR2 is a huge free roam game that let's you have quite a bit of freedom.
Yeah but even then losing weight is too much to ask for I want him as him
    yeah he can make well fed Arthur the canon Arthur
    Its really not if he is asked to be in a movie. Actors have very strict diets and exercises before filming. I’m not saying make him a superhero but look as much like Arthur as possible
    I mean he did the motion capture so he’s got the frame. Also I don’t recall him being notably chunky, just... maybe living in a bit better conditions than Arthur was
Yes, I can't imagine some of Arthur's lines by someone other than Clark, like "we're more ghosts than people". "I'm afraid" and BOAH
I honestly think Arthur’s voice would be more important than his appearance
    I feel the exact same way, if he doesn't sound like Arthur it's not Arthur and I could honestly say the same about most of the characters.
I actually think fat Arthur looks quite similar to Roger. Plus, it looks like Rog has been losing weight! :)
And Chris Hemsworth is closer?
    I never said that...
    He needs a little more beard and then I will decide again
There's a photo of Roger Clark leaner and he looks alot like Arthur there. And if he leaned out more now he'll look even more so like Arthur cause of the wrinkles and signs of age.

https://www.google.com/search?q=roger+clark&client=ms-android-samsung-ga-rev1&prmd=ivn&sxsrf=ALeKk02WJ1DZZ0xkh6Aff1nO6_brQ6p_fA:1597552182307&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiUp9jS8Z7rAhXWMd4KHYSUC7IQ_AUoAXoECB0QAQ&cshid=1597552064518&biw=412&bih=775&dpr=2.63#imgrc=_UIB8tuwfTZbNM
Arthur's face is based on Roger's.. Their faces are pretty similar when compared. And Roger is much more than just the voice of Arthur. If he is played by a guy like Chris Hemsworth or Brad Pitt, it's not the same character anymore. Only Roger Clark can pull of perfect Arthur. Only Rob Wiethoff can be perfect John Marston. Only B.B Davis can make perfect Dutch.. U know. And if Ben's or Roger's weight is a problem for you, they can always hit the gym. Roger isn't even fat
They digitally slimed him down for the role.
    Yeah, that’s kind of my point... he isn’t built like Arthur (too short and “doughy”), and the face also doesn’t quite match. If we’re talking about a live-action film, as we are here, where they wouldn’t be digitally enhancing him much if at all.
        Arthur also isn't supposed to be some prince charming either. 
So hemsworth is a shit pick.   He's supposed to look like a big dumb country brute.  Him looking like a dumb brute is mentioned over and over again through out the game.
            You say he's suppose to look like a dumb brute, but my boy Arthur is the most beatiful man alive.
                Yeah he’s like a rugged brad pitt.
                    Saying that though i think brad pitt works better as Arthur.
                        Yep
                    I gave my Arthur slicked back (or middle parted?) long hair and he looked like Legends of the Fall Brad Pitt.
                haha, well at least the working girls agree.
                My Arthur cleans up nicely as well.
                I agree, he sure is mighty fine
                >my boy Arthur is the most beatiful man alive.

Sorry to tell you this...
                “Pretty Boah?!”
            One of my favorite things about him, acts all tough and dumb when in reality he’s a very intelligent man.
                It's a cornerstone of his character, being more complex than appearances.
                Which the journal showcases so well. Something you could miss if you never bothered to read every entry.
                Hosea says something about that in a camp interaction - along the lines of “that big and dumb act might work on some folks, but I know you better.”
            I always thought Arthur was kind of handsome for a bunch of pixels. Definitely not in the typical sort of way, though, so I agree on the Hemsworth thing. 

If only Bruce Campbell was younger, I think the chin would suit Arthur better.
                Arthur is pretty good looking...I mean...it's not like I'm into dudes it's just...like you're like kissing on some gay dude and like holding his like muscles 'cause his arms just are like wrapped around you and you feel like so safe 'cause you're like... not that you're gay or nothing but God you just want to bury yourself in his chest and just live there forever....

                    Oh boy have I got a [movie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokeback_Mountain) for you.
                        [deleted]
                            How many gay cowpoke (huehuehue) movies are there?
                    Arthur whispering in your ear, *"There's a good boah."*
                A young Rory McCann with better hair would be ideal to me, if he could pull of the accent (If they ever made a live action adaptation I hope arthur's accent will be western instead of Louisianan).
            I alqays thought Arthur was hot and charming in that rugged and rough fashion of his
                I think this is a matter of falling in love with the character.   
remember when the game was first announced and trailers started dropping. The fan base was absolutely livid about the idea of playing as a 'big dumb hick' etc... 
where marston clearly hearkened back to a man-with-no-name vibes, Arthur calls back to 'the duke'.  In the game we have a lot of control over how he looks and couple that with the very well written redemption arc, and he's hard not to love, but based on appearances and a few teaser trailers alone, the fan base was absolutely not thrilled about his appearance.
            Arthur is SUPPOSED to be whatever you want him to be. Roger said it himself, "YOU GUYS ARE ARTHUR”
                I'm talking about the narrative of the story, not the gameplay. Because in a live adaptation, arthur would be set in stone, not subject to the choices of the viewers.
                    But even in the game he gets called a pretty boy, for example the bar fight in Valentine with Javier.
            every one calls him a pretty boy in the story tho.
                nah, it happens a few times, and far less frequent than comments about him being a brute or "smarter than he looks" or "just stand there and look intimidating" etc...
                “Pretty boah? PRETTY BOAH?! You gotta be kidding me...”

He is sexy af, though, even if he doesn’t realize it.
            Josh brolin would be my pick for Arthur
                If her were younger i'd be all in on that. 
Arthur is 36 tho.
            What do you mean? Arthur is beautiful af comparing to other characters
            I get more of a jake Gyllenhaal vibe from this particular pic'.

Both are too handsome for the role.

OP, you had me up until simpson on the end.

I mean you get more acting from a lump of coal.
            I agree, also think Buscemi and Momoa are bad picks. It would be better to have the actual voice actors of Arthur and Marston play as the live action characters I think.  Definitely no Jessica Simpson.
            Yeah Hemsworth as Morgan is the worst casting choice on the list. But those are some tough shoes to fill...boa!
            The entire list is a shit pick.
        I agree with the doughy bit, but Arthur is 6’1, so is Roger. If Roger slims down for the roll I think he’d be perfect
    if it works then great, but i dont really want another tarkin
cant do the same with Dutch sadly. The face might match but have you seen how much of a unit his voice actor is?
It’s very serious!
Hmmm.. okay. And Jack Black would probably do a Red Dead movie for free
John C. Reilly is a superior actor. Jack Black is pretty much just himself in everything but Reilly has demonstrated some range.
He played such a good one in Fargo I could totally see that
If you watch boardwalk empire youd see he plays that character to really well
    Was gonna say that
I was going to say the same thing
    Even Ben Foster (from 3:10 to Yuma and the Punisher).
        Not the Watford goalie?
Actual cannibal Shia Labeouf?
    Do you partake in a legendary fight with shia LaBeouf
Most of these can easily be casted by their voice actors. And they'd be cheaper to pay than the mountain of A-Listers.
    Lol, right? Can you imagine how much Clint Eastwood costs to have in a movie?
        Eastwood also would make a terrible Hosea.  I can't think of a single character he's ever played that was anything close.  Christoph Waltz would be a better choice.
            Christoph Waltz could play every single character in RDR2, including the women and children.
                And not just the men, but the women, and the children too
You got your “your” and your “you’re” mixed up.

Brad Dourif 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad\_Dourif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Dourif)

He's really good.  

He did a wonderful job as Chucky in the Child's Play series.
    He was the Doc in Deadwood and a serial killer in star trek.
oh fuck, that's good!
Personally I think Norman Reedus would make a great Micah. He seems like he could play a good asshole, and add the mustache and you're golden.
I’ve always envisioned Sam Rockwell as Micah so I’m glad to see someone else say it !
    I think he'd be perfect in look and temperament.
Tbh, Jeremy Irons could probably do a decent Swanson portrayal
    Jeremy Irons can do anything. He'd be a better Karen than Jessica Simpson.
        Anyone would be a better Karen than Jessica Simpson.
        Yeahthe list was pretty good up until Jessica Simpson.
            Don't know much about some of them, but I'm not a fan of several. This list focused alot on look alikes rather than actual actor. Love Hemsworth, love Buscemi, love Eastwood, but none of them fit those characters at all. I don't know enough about Nick Katt, but it literally looks like they grabbed him for the facial hair lol. Not big on Reedus as John either, but that's not a huge complaint.
        Agreed
Jeremy Irons would be a great Swanson but tbh he's mostly just great. I'd actually possibly cast him in a live action adaptation as Hosea (Clint Eastwood is a miscast. Hosea is warm and expressive, while Clint has made his mansions playing stoic types)
    I agree irons should play hosea
        He nails those mentor figure type roles
    The guy from gangs of New York could play dutch
        Daniel Day Lewis. He is outstanding in anything he does, he'd be an excellent Dutch
The ‘tash on Jeremy Irons is fake and shopped in, so fair to say that one wasn’t done on facial hair.
right? who tf is Nicky Katt? lmao I would choose Michael Pena
Wait are you saying that’s not shopped?
That mustache is photshopped bruh
jeremy irons too
    I think maybe he could pull it off but it's weird to cast an actor based off his facial hair

Chris Hemsworth however is perfect I'd love to see him play Arthur
That's what I thought too
He's also way too old to play him. Hosea is supposed to be around 55 years old in the game (according to Red Dead wiki at least) and Clint Eastwood is 90 years old already.
Perhaps, but he might pull it off. He’s pulled off some weird movie stuff before, watch some of his movies and they might surprise you lol I can see him playing him Hosea Matthews, he’s played a bit of everything and he would know what to do
    Yeah, I feel like people are half choosing due to type-casted actors but some of these guys could switch it up a ton. It's not about the roles they've played well, but how well they play varied roles
Definitely - for me John Slattery is the obvious choice for Hosea - Clint would be great as Landon Ricketts though
I rather have William H Macy in that role.
Robert Duvall ftw.
Also I feel like fan castings never take into account fame. Like they'll hire a huge A Lister for a role that in a movie would have like 2 minutes screen time.
    Yup. Between relying too much on physical appearance and trying to produce All-Star casts, I'm generally not a fan of fantasy casting at all. 

Like, let's say this is a 2 1/2 movie. If you're trying to condense out the main points of RDR2 into that, you're probably focusing the film on Arthur, John, Dutch, Micah, Abigail, Sadie, and Charles. Bill and Javier are relegated to pretty small parts (and only not eliminated outright due to consideration for a sequel). As beloved as he is, in a condensed story, Hosea is possibly eliminated too. Swanson and Straus are very likely out. Karen and Uncle might pop up for a moment a relief a couple times, but that's about it. 

Realistically, if they were going to do RDR2 too as a production, makes more sense to shoot for a 40 episode Netflix/HBO/Amazon style series. And that's probably going to change the actors you go for. Doesn't really need to be an All-Star cast
        Yeah I think all the characters you listed as small parts would be basically cameos in a movie. I think in a movie you'd probably drop the plot of John being wounded at the start, so you'd be able to reduce the roles of Javier, Bill, and Lenny even further. I'd actually argue you would reduce Charles' role too. Though that's contentious because he's the main POC in the film. But ultimately the bond between Arthur and John is important so you'd focus on that 

A movie would also probably drop the epilogue and end with a certain death. So Abigail would definitely be reduced (Maggie from TWD would fit a smallish role in a big movie tho tbh). I think Hosea would be in it because of his importance in the morality of the group. You need that shock second act death that serves as a turning point in the film.
            > I'd actually argue you would reduce Charles' role too. Though that's contentious because he's the main POC in the film. But ultimately the bond between Arthur and John is important so you'd focus on that 

Between him being the main POC and the fact that Arthur, John, Sadie, and Charles are the ones fighting on the same side at the end is why I think Charles would still be a pretty major character.
            Agreed, also I'd like to point out that Hosea was an important figure in the story as he contrasted Dutch >!and his death played some part in Dutch's insanity later on imo!<
        Fuck it, a TV series about the gang before 1899 would be awesome
            A series about the game would be awesome. Just open the series on the running up into the mountains to get away from the law. Go save John in the first episode, introduce Sadie in the second, head down into the Heartlands by the end of the third.
    Beyond that even is the fact that the vast mayority of the film budget would have to go to the cast... fans Love picking A-listers.
        Well, I guess that's what makes them A-listers.
    A-Listers in 2-minute roles and then absolute Z-Listers for the Leads. Who even is Nick D’Amici? Is there anything making him the right pick for Dutch beyond...having a mustache? 

It’s the most obvious casting in the world: Josh Brolin. There you go, done. He doesn’t have the exact same bone structure as Dutch but it’s not like that matters at all. There are also a fuckton of actors that would be great for Lenny but for some reason he’s not even here.
Thank you I was gonna say a Black and Native American character and Momoa looks nothing like the character.
    Or the white guy to play the Mexican...
But he's to big a build for Charles
Trevante Rhodes would be a better Charles imho. Momoa is a little too flashy, Charles is more softspoken and subtle.
Hey, at least they didn't white-wash it...*insert Will Smith gif about 'he a little confused but got the right spirit'*
This is a good one. I also always imagined John C. Riley as the union soldier in Valentine that lost his arm
    Mickey. I thought the same thing.
Texas forever
100% agree.
DDL is perfect in everything.
Yeah, Boondock era Reedus might have been a good call, but at his current age? No way. Hemsworth is actually older than Arthur is canonically, but he doesn't have the same rugged character. He couldn't pull off the tired Gunslinger at the end of his rope.

EDIT: Scratch that, Hemsworth is a great actor and he definitely could pull that role off. But it would be his version of it, and it wouldn't look or feel like Arthur.
    I feel like Hemsworth is probably too good looking and charming. But he *is* a very good actor, he might be able to pull it off.
I know that's literally what drives for most of the game. Obviously these were picked based on looks. But even Jason mamoa doesn't look like charles
    And Steve buscemi as Micah? Doesn’t look like him and it’s a bad fit too
Seriously, they didn't even TRY and fit Lenny in here either and couldn't be bothered to put any effort into a suitable actor choice for Charles, so I wrote this off and barely glanced at the rest.   


Nikky Katt isn't even fucking Hispanic.  Whitewashing pisses me off on most days, but this was just goddamned blatant.
    Whitewashing and "well he's not entirely white so they can basically play any Native American/Hawaiian/Maori/Hispanic character" annoys me so much.
    Michael B Jordan for Lenny? Young, kinda funny, but can also be a badass
        I'd say Lakeith Stanfield for Lenny personally.
Maybe Jamiee Fox in a Django type role?
    Possibly, but I imagine he would have to be a big dude, like Charles. Plus Jamie Fox doesn't really look native enough. As far as badass black cowboys though, Jamie Fox has set the bar.
        Trevante Rhodes
            Hmm, never seen him in anything, but he doesn't look native enough. I think Charles looks more native than he does black, so you could probably get away with a native actor that's not black more than you could a black actor that's not native.
Donald glover as lenny
    [deleted]
Lenny? Lenny?...LENNY?
Oh yeah he was good in Fargo.
I mean, that statement can be used in just about any context.
On the contary Mark Hamill would be better
Eh, I think Harrison Ford is past his prime, mostly because he doesn't really want to put in the effort anymore. Which is totally fine, but I think if we're thinking about them actually making the movie today, we're not going to get the best performance out of Harrison.
That's perfect
Amazing too.
I thought the same thing! I think he'd be perfect in looks and demeanor.
100% Sam Rockwell would be perfect
A mean tweet written for Gary Oldman on Jimmy Kimmel:

"Gary Oldman sucks and his accents are annoying as shit!"


Gary's reaction:

"Yep!"
While I thought Eastwood and Duval are around 90 years old I didn't realize Ford is 78, I was thinking Ford is late 60s early 70s and would be closer to Hosea age but nope.
    He just looks younger I guess but you’re so right.
Love that idea. Just somebody who can have that funky voice, super smooth, almost like his demeanor in MR. Brooks. Loved his play off him and William Hurt. Smoothness from tin cup. Man this can go well
Hi I'm Johnny Knoxville and this is the rat prank
Netflix in the U.S.
    Damn I’m in the uk and don’t have a vpn
My comment is now sponsored by Nord VPN ;)

In my Netflix it isn't available, so I had to use a VPN. Totally worth it for just this xD
I'm confused, was Dukes of Hazard bad? Been a real long time since I watched it.
    Just that she hasn’t been relevant as an actress since that movie came out 15 years ago. Thought it was funny OP thought of her to cast. She’s not looking very Daisy Duke these days.
Can’t believe they didn’t add LEMMY!
Was doing the same. Tilly is missing as well. OP not know any black actors? Lol.
    Lakeith Stanfield would make a great Lenny IMO
O think he'd be better Trelawny than Strauss.
    Maybe, i keep imagining him from the role from Django and Inglorious Basterds, he's really good at playing germans
        Yeah because he's from Österreich.
Waltz is too good for Strauss. Strauss is side character of side characters and sometimes I don't remember him when I start a new game. If he'd play Trelawny same way as Dr. Schulz, he would became my favorite character and putting him in a role of Strauss would be waste of his talent.
I was actually thinking Laura Prepon as Abigail
Hey if Henry Cavill can do it for The Witcher why can’t John do it for Redemption. (Btw that’s what Hollywood is gonna change the title to. Red Dead Redemption is too long and not snappy enough for Big Hollywood)
    But it bounces off the tongue in such a fun way!
FUCK, I forgot how good that movie is.
Or just u know... Roger Clark
    if he cut some fat and put on some muscle he'd be great.
Lmao I also said Daniel Day Lewis as Dutch.
Hell, he could even do a really good Trelawny now that I think of it!
they should legit just get Alex Mckenna, she's perfect with voice and looks.
Evan Rachel Wood
Have you ever seen a Tarantino?
    No, I’m afraid of spiders.
Yeah, I don't think Norman Reedus or Keanu is a good pick for John. They're both in their 50s. 

I'd pick someone much younger, especially given John is supposed to be mid-late 20s during the bulk of RDR2.
He's old af to play John and tbh his acting is bad, Jake Gyllenhaal is better imo
I would go with Dutch, he is a REALLY complex character, Tom Hardy could play Dutch's slow progress to complete madness really well
Sean Bean has to be Davey, look-a-like and well.. dies.
Damn, now you're talkin'. I love that idea. Even works out for >!Sean Bean's notoriety for always taking roles where he dies!<
yeah i thought he was too baby faced until i googled "chris pine beard", honestly would fit well
    I always thought Arthur looked like cowboy Chris Pine.
He almost looks the part in Hell or High Water. Google him in that movie.
    Guess I’m just used to a bearded Arthur, since I usually keep him that way - but yeah, I can see it!

[This clip](https://images.app.goo.gl/F5us5ipq8Jb4dbxT9) reminds me of the “I’m afraid” scene. 🥺
I think he his supposed to be... to an extent.
DDL should be Dutch
Most of these choices are too old for the role.
Didn’t think of him, also a great choice
5000 dollars for me, can i turn myself in
Or hugh Jackman
    No. Why not just the original Actors? Now if some of them can't or just don't want to then sure, grab someone else. But other than that, just cast the actual Actors that have been through the whole game already. Either way, no matter what, games turning into movies usually never turn out good. Especially since RDR2 is a huge free roam game that let's you have quite a bit of freedom.
yeah he can make well fed Arthur the canon Arthur
Its really not if he is asked to be in a movie. Actors have very strict diets and exercises before filming. I’m not saying make him a superhero but look as much like Arthur as possible
I mean he did the motion capture so he’s got the frame. Also I don’t recall him being notably chunky, just... maybe living in a bit better conditions than Arthur was
I feel the exact same way, if he doesn't sound like Arthur it's not Arthur and I could honestly say the same about most of the characters.
I never said that...
He needs a little more beard and then I will decide again
Yeah, that’s kind of my point... he isn’t built like Arthur (too short and “doughy”), and the face also doesn’t quite match. If we’re talking about a live-action film, as we are here, where they wouldn’t be digitally enhancing him much if at all.
    Arthur also isn't supposed to be some prince charming either. 
So hemsworth is a shit pick.   He's supposed to look like a big dumb country brute.  Him looking like a dumb brute is mentioned over and over again through out the game.
        You say he's suppose to look like a dumb brute, but my boy Arthur is the most beatiful man alive.
            Yeah he’s like a rugged brad pitt.
                Saying that though i think brad pitt works better as Arthur.
                    Yep
                I gave my Arthur slicked back (or middle parted?) long hair and he looked like Legends of the Fall Brad Pitt.
            haha, well at least the working girls agree.
            My Arthur cleans up nicely as well.
            I agree, he sure is mighty fine
            >my boy Arthur is the most beatiful man alive.

Sorry to tell you this...
            “Pretty Boah?!”
        One of my favorite things about him, acts all tough and dumb when in reality he’s a very intelligent man.
            It's a cornerstone of his character, being more complex than appearances.
            Which the journal showcases so well. Something you could miss if you never bothered to read every entry.
            Hosea says something about that in a camp interaction - along the lines of “that big and dumb act might work on some folks, but I know you better.”
        I always thought Arthur was kind of handsome for a bunch of pixels. Definitely not in the typical sort of way, though, so I agree on the Hemsworth thing. 

If only Bruce Campbell was younger, I think the chin would suit Arthur better.
            Arthur is pretty good looking...I mean...it's not like I'm into dudes it's just...like you're like kissing on some gay dude and like holding his like muscles 'cause his arms just are like wrapped around you and you feel like so safe 'cause you're like... not that you're gay or nothing but God you just want to bury yourself in his chest and just live there forever....

                Oh boy have I got a [movie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokeback_Mountain) for you.
                    [deleted]
                        How many gay cowpoke (huehuehue) movies are there?
                Arthur whispering in your ear, *"There's a good boah."*
            A young Rory McCann with better hair would be ideal to me, if he could pull of the accent (If they ever made a live action adaptation I hope arthur's accent will be western instead of Louisianan).
        I alqays thought Arthur was hot and charming in that rugged and rough fashion of his
            I think this is a matter of falling in love with the character.   
remember when the game was first announced and trailers started dropping. The fan base was absolutely livid about the idea of playing as a 'big dumb hick' etc... 
where marston clearly hearkened back to a man-with-no-name vibes, Arthur calls back to 'the duke'.  In the game we have a lot of control over how he looks and couple that with the very well written redemption arc, and he's hard not to love, but based on appearances and a few teaser trailers alone, the fan base was absolutely not thrilled about his appearance.
        Arthur is SUPPOSED to be whatever you want him to be. Roger said it himself, "YOU GUYS ARE ARTHUR”
            I'm talking about the narrative of the story, not the gameplay. Because in a live adaptation, arthur would be set in stone, not subject to the choices of the viewers.
                But even in the game he gets called a pretty boy, for example the bar fight in Valentine with Javier.
        every one calls him a pretty boy in the story tho.
            nah, it happens a few times, and far less frequent than comments about him being a brute or "smarter than he looks" or "just stand there and look intimidating" etc...
            “Pretty boah? PRETTY BOAH?! You gotta be kidding me...”

He is sexy af, though, even if he doesn’t realize it.
        Josh brolin would be my pick for Arthur
            If her were younger i'd be all in on that. 
Arthur is 36 tho.
        What do you mean? Arthur is beautiful af comparing to other characters
        I get more of a jake Gyllenhaal vibe from this particular pic'.

Both are too handsome for the role.

OP, you had me up until simpson on the end.

I mean you get more acting from a lump of coal.
        I agree, also think Buscemi and Momoa are bad picks. It would be better to have the actual voice actors of Arthur and Marston play as the live action characters I think.  Definitely no Jessica Simpson.
        Yeah Hemsworth as Morgan is the worst casting choice on the list. But those are some tough shoes to fill...boa!
        The entire list is a shit pick.
    I agree with the doughy bit, but Arthur is 6’1, so is Roger. If Roger slims down for the roll I think he’d be perfect
if it works then great, but i dont really want another tarkin
Was gonna say that
Even Ben Foster (from 3:10 to Yuma and the Punisher).
    Not the Watford goalie?
Do you partake in a legendary fight with shia LaBeouf
Lol, right? Can you imagine how much Clint Eastwood costs to have in a movie?
    Eastwood also would make a terrible Hosea.  I can't think of a single character he's ever played that was anything close.  Christoph Waltz would be a better choice.
        Christoph Waltz could play every single character in RDR2, including the women and children.
            And not just the men, but the women, and the children too
I am the walrus!
He was the Doc in Deadwood and a serial killer in star trek.
I think he'd be perfect in look and temperament.
Jeremy Irons can do anything. He'd be a better Karen than Jessica Simpson.
    Anyone would be a better Karen than Jessica Simpson.
    Yeahthe list was pretty good up until Jessica Simpson.
        Don't know much about some of them, but I'm not a fan of several. This list focused alot on look alikes rather than actual actor. Love Hemsworth, love Buscemi, love Eastwood, but none of them fit those characters at all. I don't know enough about Nick Katt, but it literally looks like they grabbed him for the facial hair lol. Not big on Reedus as John either, but that's not a huge complaint.
    Agreed
I agree irons should play hosea
    He nails those mentor figure type roles
The guy from gangs of New York could play dutch
    Daniel Day Lewis. He is outstanding in anything he does, he'd be an excellent Dutch
I think maybe he could pull it off but it's weird to cast an actor based off his facial hair

Chris Hemsworth however is perfect I'd love to see him play Arthur
Yeah, I feel like people are half choosing due to type-casted actors but some of these guys could switch it up a ton. It's not about the roles they've played well, but how well they play varied roles
Yup. Between relying too much on physical appearance and trying to produce All-Star casts, I'm generally not a fan of fantasy casting at all. 

Like, let's say this is a 2 1/2 movie. If you're trying to condense out the main points of RDR2 into that, you're probably focusing the film on Arthur, John, Dutch, Micah, Abigail, Sadie, and Charles. Bill and Javier are relegated to pretty small parts (and only not eliminated outright due to consideration for a sequel). As beloved as he is, in a condensed story, Hosea is possibly eliminated too. Swanson and Straus are very likely out. Karen and Uncle might pop up for a moment a relief a couple times, but that's about it. 

Realistically, if they were going to do RDR2 too as a production, makes more sense to shoot for a 40 episode Netflix/HBO/Amazon style series. And that's probably going to change the actors you go for. Doesn't really need to be an All-Star cast
    Yeah I think all the characters you listed as small parts would be basically cameos in a movie. I think in a movie you'd probably drop the plot of John being wounded at the start, so you'd be able to reduce the roles of Javier, Bill, and Lenny even further. I'd actually argue you would reduce Charles' role too. Though that's contentious because he's the main POC in the film. But ultimately the bond between Arthur and John is important so you'd focus on that 

A movie would also probably drop the epilogue and end with a certain death. So Abigail would definitely be reduced (Maggie from TWD would fit a smallish role in a big movie tho tbh). I think Hosea would be in it because of his importance in the morality of the group. You need that shock second act death that serves as a turning point in the film.
        > I'd actually argue you would reduce Charles' role too. Though that's contentious because he's the main POC in the film. But ultimately the bond between Arthur and John is important so you'd focus on that 

Between him being the main POC and the fact that Arthur, John, Sadie, and Charles are the ones fighting on the same side at the end is why I think Charles would still be a pretty major character.
        Agreed, also I'd like to point out that Hosea was an important figure in the story as he contrasted Dutch >!and his death played some part in Dutch's insanity later on imo!<
    Fuck it, a TV series about the gang before 1899 would be awesome
        A series about the game would be awesome. Just open the series on the running up into the mountains to get away from the law. Go save John in the first episode, introduce Sadie in the second, head down into the Heartlands by the end of the third.
Beyond that even is the fact that the vast mayority of the film budget would have to go to the cast... fans Love picking A-listers.
    Well, I guess that's what makes them A-listers.
A-Listers in 2-minute roles and then absolute Z-Listers for the Leads. Who even is Nick D’Amici? Is there anything making him the right pick for Dutch beyond...having a mustache? 

It’s the most obvious casting in the world: Josh Brolin. There you go, done. He doesn’t have the exact same bone structure as Dutch but it’s not like that matters at all. There are also a fuckton of actors that would be great for Lenny but for some reason he’s not even here.
Or the white guy to play the Mexican...
Mickey. I thought the same thing.
I feel like Hemsworth is probably too good looking and charming. But he *is* a very good actor, he might be able to pull it off.
And Steve buscemi as Micah? Doesn’t look like him and it’s a bad fit too
Whitewashing and "well he's not entirely white so they can basically play any Native American/Hawaiian/Maori/Hispanic character" annoys me so much.
Michael B Jordan for Lenny? Young, kinda funny, but can also be a badass
    I'd say Lakeith Stanfield for Lenny personally.
Possibly, but I imagine he would have to be a big dude, like Charles. Plus Jamie Fox doesn't really look native enough. As far as badass black cowboys though, Jamie Fox has set the bar.
    Trevante Rhodes
        Hmm, never seen him in anything, but he doesn't look native enough. I think Charles looks more native than he does black, so you could probably get away with a native actor that's not black more than you could a black actor that's not native.
[deleted]
He just looks younger I guess but you’re so right.
Damn I’m in the uk and don’t have a vpn

    nah, it happens a few times, and far less frequent than comments about him being a brute or "smarter than he looks" or "just stand there and look intimidating" etc...
    “Pretty boah? PRETTY BOAH?! You gotta be kidding me...”

He is sexy af, though, even if he doesn’t realize it.
Josh brolin would be my pick for Arthur
    If her were younger i'd be all in on that. 
Arthur is 36 tho.
What do you mean? Arthur is beautiful af comparing to other characters
I get more of a jake Gyllenhaal vibe from this particular pic'.

Both are too handsome for the role.

OP, you had me up until simpson on the end.

I mean you get more acting from a lump of coal.
I agree, also think Buscemi and Momoa are bad picks. It would be better to have the actual voice actors of Arthur and Marston play as the live action characters I think.  Definitely no Jessica Simpson.
Yeah Hemsworth as Morgan is the worst casting choice on the list. But those are some tough shoes to fill...boa!
The entire list is a shit pick.
Christoph Waltz could play every single character in RDR2, including the women and children.
    And not just the men, but the women, and the children too
Don't know much about some of them, but I'm not a fan of several. This list focused alot on look alikes rather than actual actor. Love Hemsworth, love Buscemi, love Eastwood, but none of them fit those characters at all. I don't know enough about Nick Katt, but it literally looks like they grabbed him for the facial hair lol. Not big on Reedus as John either, but that's not a huge complaint.
> I'd actually argue you would reduce Charles' role too. Though that's contentious because he's the main POC in the film. But ultimately the bond between Arthur and John is important so you'd focus on that 

Between him being the main POC and the fact that Arthur, John, Sadie, and Charles are the ones fighting on the same side at the end is why I think Charles would still be a pretty major character.
Agreed, also I'd like to point out that Hosea was an important figure in the story as he contrasted Dutch >!and his death played some part in Dutch's insanity later on imo!<
A series about the game would be awesome. Just open the series on the running up into the mountains to get away from the law. Go save John in the first episode, introduce Sadie in the second, head down into the Heartlands by the end of the third.
Hmm, never seen him in anything, but he doesn't look native enough. I think Charles looks more native than he does black, so you could probably get away with a native actor that's not black more than you could a black actor that's not native.
Yeah he’s like a rugged brad pitt.
    Saying that though i think brad pitt works better as Arthur.
        Yep
    I gave my Arthur slicked back (or middle parted?) long hair and he looked like Legends of the Fall Brad Pitt.
haha, well at least the working girls agree.
My Arthur cleans up nicely as well.
I agree, he sure is mighty fine
>my boy Arthur is the most beatiful man alive.

Sorry to tell you this...
“Pretty Boah?!”
It's a cornerstone of his character, being more complex than appearances.
Which the journal showcases so well. Something you could miss if you never bothered to read every entry.
Hosea says something about that in a camp interaction - along the lines of “that big and dumb act might work on some folks, but I know you better.”
Arthur is pretty good looking...I mean...it's not like I'm into dudes it's just...like you're like kissing on some gay dude and like holding his like muscles 'cause his arms just are like wrapped around you and you feel like so safe 'cause you're like... not that you're gay or nothing but God you just want to bury yourself in his chest and just live there forever....

            How many gay cowpoke (huehuehue) movies are there?
    Arthur whispering in your ear, *"There's a good boah."*
A young Rory McCann with better hair would be ideal to me, if he could pull of the accent (If they ever made a live action adaptation I hope arthur's accent will be western instead of Louisianan).
I think this is a matter of falling in love with the character.   
remember when the game was first announced and trailers started dropping. The fan base was absolutely livid about the idea of playing as a 'big dumb hick' etc... 
where marston clearly hearkened back to a man-with-no-name vibes, Arthur calls back to 'the duke'.  In the game we have a lot of control over how he looks and couple that with the very well written redemption arc, and he's hard not to love, but based on appearances and a few teaser trailers alone, the fan base was absolutely not thrilled about his appearance.
I'm talking about the narrative of the story, not the gameplay. Because in a live adaptation, arthur would be set in stone, not subject to the choices of the viewers.
    But even in the game he gets called a pretty boy, for example the bar fight in Valentine with Javier.
