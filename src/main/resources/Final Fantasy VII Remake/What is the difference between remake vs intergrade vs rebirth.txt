[[What is the difference between remake vs intergrade vs rebirth]]


I'm a PC player looking to play this game. I just finished FF 16 and I'm looking to play this next, but I don't understand the different versions/names. Is rebirth a DLC? What is intergrade? If someone can clear this up for me I would appreciate it.


Ill make this real simple:

Remake is the first entry in the modern FF7 Trilogy.

Intergrade is the DLC to Remake. You need Remake to play this.

Rebirth is the sequel, the second entry to the modern FF7 Trilogy.
    Intergrade is not the DLC. The DLC is called Intermission. Intergrade is the rerelease of FF7 Remake that includes Intermission.
Intergrade is just the name they gave the ps5 upgrade of the ps4 game and it's the version that was ported to PC. It contains a few minor graphical upgrades and the yuffie DLC (technically that is called Intermission but it's included with the PC version so there's no point in calling them different names, only makes it more confusing.)

Rebirth is a full on sequel to 7R/intergrade. Just think of it as FF7R-2.
FF7 Remake is the first game in a trilogy of remakes that'll be remaking Final Fantasy VII. That released on PS4, and Intergrade was the PS5/PC re-release that included a DLC story called InterMission. Rebirth is the second part of that trilogy, currently exclusive to PS5, that goes up to roughly the halfway point of the OG. 

Remake and Rebirth are still separate games though. Rebirth isn't really simply just a Part 2.
It honestly is a cluster for people to approach.

FF7 Remake is the first game in the series. It came out for PS4 and has a PS5 upgrade version. It has one DLC, called 'Intermission.' FF7 Intergrade is basically the bundle that includes the PS5 version and the Intermission dlc (I think?) 

Ff7 Rebirth is a totally new game which continues the story line. It is not a DLC.

important to add, Rebirth will still take a while to be released on PC, so, if you're a PC player, take your time with the first game. but as you said you played XVI, you own a PS5, so, it doesn't matter, as you can jump into it when you want, but i recommend playing both games on the same platform, as you get summon materia on Rebirth by having completed saves on Remake and Intermission DLC
        I will just add, that the summon materia you get are cool - leviathan and ramuh are two of my faves in the series - but no necessary. You get access to others that are far more powerful (6) plus the 3 starters. So I wouldn't use it to make the decision for me.



The ps5 demo gives you a pretty good accessory though. So if you prefer PC I'd do that for Remake, and then move to PS5
Originally FF 7 is a completed game, just as FF 16. There is no relation between FF ??.
The FF 7 was remade, but they will be in three parts, instead of whole game as original.

FF 7 Remake: part 1.

FF 7 Remake Intermission: DLC for part 1.

FF 7 Remake Intergrade: both part 1 & DLC, with some graphic upgrade as they target next generation console (PS5) at the time.

FF 7 Rebirth: part 2.

FF 7 ???: part 3, this will be in the future.
    If part 3 isn't called Reunion I'll eat a shoe


>!🫰!<
        Crisis core remaster is already called Reunion, it would be very strange to call part III the same way...
            True, though since they're going through a whole multi world thing I personally wouldn't preclude it
        They’ve already said they wanted to call part 2 reunion but couldn’t due to crisis core, so it’s unlikely part 3 will be called it
            Homecoming then
                FFVII: The Winter Soldier
Intergrade is not the DLC. The DLC is called Intermission. Intergrade is the rerelease of FF7 Remake that includes Intermission.
