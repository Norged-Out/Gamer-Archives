[[Hitbox Porn]]





Now I know why they call it hitbox porn. Because I shouldn't be looking at this while at work.
    plot twist: youre a porn actor.

Unless you fight the Ogre. Or any enemy with grab attacks. That's just hitbox gore.
    Ditto with Snake-Eyes
        A lot of people seem to have trouble with Snake Eyes' grab.

One trick I learned was that the metal hat blocks it. If I hesitated dodging, I'd just pull out the hat. 
            I found that out too. All the bosses have something that you can use to make the fight a little easier. 

For the Bull, you can jump over most of his charges and slash at him in mid air.

Lady butterfly you can knock out of the air with the shuriken.

Corrupted Monk you can use Divine Confetti to increase damage. 
                Corrupted Monk you can also use snap seeds on. They absolutely fuck her up.

                        Here's something I'm not sure if others found for that encounter: If you grapple as fast as possible to the furthest, highest branch when entering the fight, if you jump over her immediately there's a small window to deathblow her first phase. Immediately grapple back up, deathblow her second phase because she always goes into the illusion thing. Its 100% consistent if you're fast enough, and makes it so you only ever have to fight her third phase.
                            I tried to do this so many times I ended up spending more time trying to make the fight easier than I would have just fighting her normally.
                        Yeah just get in close, use it, stun and a good chunk of damage. Divine confetti works well too.
                Yea when I started to realize this it reminded me of megaman lol getting different arm attachments in order use their weakness against them.
                    I think that's where the replay value will come from in this game. The order you do things will change the experince.
                For the bull, I was runnin’ around him like a bull in a china shop.
                Or you can skip phase 2 by doing an air deathblow.
                What about Genichiro? I’ve been stuck for 4 days
                    Third phase, in the air when he uses lightening. Jump and slice it. It hits him back and takes about 1/4 to 1/5 of his health.

First and second phase, always circle around counter clockwise, and dodge to the right.  Mikuri counter to quickly so the first phase. During the second phase he tends to do sweeping attacks more so just jump on his head when you see him extend his blade to the side before he becomes a beyblade.

Most of all?

Make your own playstyle. The game is made to where you can craft what's easiest for you. Use what fangs you have wolf and look at your skills you've learned along the way.
                        I finally fucking beat him. I’ve been stuck on it for so long when I beat him I almost threw up
                poo tosser can be speared with double rt/r2 to pull the centipede out for massive damage during second phase
                to be honest the bull isnt that hard if you have patience. You can literally run in circles around the arena and sneak in a hit or parry here or there. really if you have the patience you can run around, hit him in the back, run away adn keep doing it until he dies.

the key with this game is most of the time sprinting and jumping are more effective at dodging. you only really want to hit the dodge button if your going to counter or do a quick sidestep. if your trying to backstep with dodge most of the time your gonna get hit anyway because you dont move far/fast enough. and sometimes since the hitboxes are great you can leap over the attack anyway.  


nearly every time i die its because i virtually never use dodge and i need to for mikiri counter suddenly and miss a grand opportunity, or hit dodge by accident intending to leap away.
                For the bulls you can just stay behind, close to the back legs and he cant hit you. Just dodge the charge attack when he starts doing it and stay on his ass wacking him for easy cheese
                Skakskdxjkskskdskskekskaoaaslsl omg you can hit her with shuriken? I equipped it on my 11th attempt but when I got inside I just said "yeah that's not going to work anyway" and continued getting murdered.
            I found out you can actually block this grab, you just got to wait until the hook part comes up behind you and as she pull it back, deflect it.  Holy shit did this make a difference.
                So it's a weapon attack and not a grapple, makes sense you can deflect it.
                    yeh, I see that it's definitely just a weapon attack now, since most unblockable grabs in this game are through hands or legs (Lady Butterfly).
                HMMMMMM. See, the hat blocks that hook part with sparks, so I never thought about deflecting it. I just assumed all grabs were unblockable and undeflectable.

But if that grab is deflectable, are others?

HMMMMM
                    That's what I'm thinking, I'm guessing no because it's a semi grab and slash because it's not their hands that are grabbing you which are 100% unblockable.
            I just panic jumped backwards and it worked
            I found that just jumping backwards avoids it 99% of the time. 
            Very solid advice. I didn't have issues jumping away, because sidestepping timing was not working out for me consistently. The hat would trivialize the mini bosses - attacking and deflecting their attacks isn't difficult by the time you fight them imo.
            Sabimaru also works wonders against any of the snake eyes bosses. They're super weak against poison apparently.
                They set on fire really easily too. I guess it's the gunpowder.

All the Gun Fort-type gunmen burn in one hit, while the snake-eyes duo take 2 flame hits to burn without oil.
            I thought it was a swipe, so jumped on her. That allways works for me.
                She can pull you out of the air
            For the grab I eventually found that dodging into her to the right always worked and created time to pop in a few attacks.
            What is "metal hat"? 
                Prosthetic tool called Iron Fortress. Sold by an NPC near the Ashina Castle Old Grave warp (which is an area at the bottom of the castle, around the rear) 
            If you footstomp him you interupt the move so treat it like a sweep and your good
            If you lure snake eyes into the poison pit, the fight takes care of itself. 
            Snake Eyes get completely trivialized by double ichimonji, she doesnt even try to grab if you just deflect -> ichimonji double -> deflect etc.
            I actually didn't have trouble with Snake Eyes hitbox.  The problem I had was the area you fight her in.  She's backed up against a wall, and if you counter her grab with jump, you can't follow up with the second jump attack.  Instead, you perform a wall jump, making you jump way above her and getting out of sync with the fight.  She was usually in the middle of another combo or performing the grab attack again by the time I landed, usually insta-killing me.

And she's completely surrounded by walls.  It doesn't matter if you draw her out into the small open part in the middle, because she quickly gets pushed back up against a wall.
            Metal hat blocks all grabs i think
            Or you can just jump away.
            The hat seems to be designed with that entire area in mind. I turtle up and scuttle across the bridges at the Gun Fort to avoid all the sniper shots.
            For snake eyes, just jump back and jump back in. Easy as pie.
            I just deflected the grab
        I just cheesed snake eyes because fuck that noise, not dealing with that shit
            [removed]
                -Use a stealth candy


-Grapple to her location


-Backstab her


-Run the fuck away


-Grapple to the Buddha statue's hand that's near the bonfire, at the end of the room


-Wait for her ass to be fully poisoned



-Finish her off when she has 1 HP

                    [removed]
                    I did this without the stealth candy. Not too bad, just clear out the other 4 or 5 guys in the area. Her gun has a few seconds delay between attacks so if you can predict when to juke you can swerve between her shots and time the death blows on the others. Then just hide up on a hill and poke your head out every so often to keep her shooting while standing in the poison. 
                        Wait, what poison are we talking about? I didn't see any poison around the gunfort approach?
                            Nah, that's a different Snake Eyes (probs her sister). There's one more in Ashina Depths, near Poison Pool idol. 
                            For the one you’re talking about, there is a small cliff to the left when you first start that battle. If you stand on top of the cliff and get her to chase you then you jump off the cliff, she will follow you off and upon landing she opens herself up to 1 or 2 attacks. Walk back up to the top of the cliff and repeat 
                On the island in front of her is a lean-to structure with stairs/ramp on one side. Lure her up there and jump down towards the Buddha. Turn around and she'll be going ham on the air above your head. I used ichimonji to hit above me and just whittled down both her DBs. Pure fuckin cheese
                You can stealth without candy and basically attack her constantly and deflect her attack and Dodge her grab late. My mistake the first couple of times was because I dodged her grab early and she just turns and grabs.
                In case you need a guide for the other snake eyes in sunken Valley, I wrote a detailed guide[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sekiro/comments/b6siq2/how_to_easily_kill_snake_eyes_shirafuji/). 
                Another way is to backstab the gunner that is high on the rocks and take control of him through puppeteer. Stand behind him as he rains fire on snake eyes and be ready to backstab again when you lose control, rinse and repeat till snake eyes is low enough for you to give a death blow. 
                And it you want to cheese the first one, grapple to her, run past to the left, jump up and hug the wall, run out on the bridge, dodge the bullets and run right back, wait while hugging the wall until Snake-eyes de-aggro you. boom sneak-stab the cunt and enjoy the kill-screen after only having to deal with half her Hp!
                She (and the other snake eyes where there are NO poison pools) are cake with the poison sword prosthetic. Especially the upgraded one.
                I fought snake eyes in the hidden pools area and just got him into the poison and watch poison drain health, then went in for the one hit deathblow and ran away and repeated.
                No need to cheese. Two words: Double Ichimonji
                Get her on a ledge and you just stand a little below...worked for me!
                As well as the other guys explanation, Snake Eyes is vulnerable Ichimonji. Two attacks and an ichimonji will stagger snake eyes and they’ll jump back, dash forward attack twice and do another and it’ll loop.

This is how I killed both snake eyes.
                Another tip, stealth her after killing the enemies, then use an oil and stunlock her with fire.
                I was able to cheese the Ashina Depths Snake Eyes by getting her onto the roof of the hut and dropping down the side, then just staying there and doing jump attacks.
            Same let her suck on poison 
                That’s it...suck out all the poison. 
            You just jump away for the grab and get in  their face for everything else. The one near the Gun Fort was fucking me up until I was super aggressive and deflected everything. That grab sucks hard, but I was able to get down jumping away - it's the only perilous attack they have. They're severely disadvantaged against your quick sword strikes and deflection. The one in the Depths just sucks because they want to fight between that slope and wall.
            I just ran around until she did a charge shot rushed in got like 2 hits and repeated til she was super low
            the iron fortress prosthetic really helped for me!

&#x200B;
            Which one?
            I took no shame in cheesing that bitch because the game gives us almost no opportunity for cheese.
            I'll be honest that fight is really fucking cool when you actually get it right.  The grab is almost always the move but jumping backwards and running in for a hit works just as well.  And actually getting those fights perfectly is pretty sweet.
        Never mind snake eyes. The hit box on the snake is fucking disgusting. I don't need to watch replays to see that I was five feet away from the snakes body but I still get smashed.
            Right? It's not a case of timing or spacing - I just get teleported into her grab and shot to death. 
        Yep, fuck that bitch. She literally ruined my day yesterday with that hitbox bullshit. I'm literally high up in the air and she manages to grab me as if I'm standing right next to her. Fuck hitting through walls and fuck stupid camera too. Classic From Software bullshit pretty much. I mean, I love you guys, but this shit needs to be sorted out, it's been 10 years and 6 games but the problems persist. Or is it the part of the challenge? 
            But FromSoft also provides the polar opposite of what you're describing. It's the reason we're all in this thread.
                Yes, you're right, I just needed to vent my emotions that day. In my experience about 90% of the time hitbox detection is perfect, but that 10% can ruin your day especially in tense situations when you're on your last couple of HPs and near beating an enemy. FromSoft games are very fair with almost every death being due to lack of skill/attention, that's why dying to bad camera or collision/hitbox detection is infuriating. FromSoft games are the only ones that I ever rage-quitted in my life lol
            What's weird is that this wasn't an issue in Demon's souls. Weapons were almost too well modeled if memory serves, and you pretty much had to get a thrust weapon for navigating the stonefang tunnels, or your weapon would ricochet off the walls.
        Protip: jump away from the grab, don't doge. It works far better.
        i literally jump to the right on that sweep and it misses 100% of the time, even in a tight environment.

you've probably beaten her/them by now, but if anyone else hasn't, a directional jump is super effective.
        I got really good at dodging that attack. Just dash sideways and then backwards. Works everytime. Or double back. Double side may also work. You can't just dodge once though
    the fucking >!guardian ape!< ... absolute hitbox gore on one of the grabs.
    That shit is so annoying. He grabbed me when I was a good 3 yards to the left. It didn't make any sense.
    I was really hoping they would fix that for this game. That and dog AI that suicides off cliffs and gets stuck. :(
    Fuck the 2nd ogre. 
        There’s a SECOND ONE?!?!?!
            Nvm u can cheese that one
                It's still surprisingly difficult. I summed the first ogre destroying me up to just me being a beginner.

The second proved me wrong.
    giant dude feeding giant carp has a pretty big grab hitbox also
    I legit have a video of that damned chained ogre doing a near 180 with his grab attack. 
    None of them did any bs attacks to me.
    unless you fight a boss or mid-boss or maybe is just ps4 or just my gameplay i have 1gb of recorded hitbox bullshit.
    Hello Guardian Ape.
    Or the foot stomp of the Demon of Hatred
    That Artorias Overhead the Owl does is ridiculous as well
    Guardian Ape's lunging grab is so aggravating. You can be giving him a foot massage from behind and he will still grab you.
        That's his first phase, right? Weirdly enough I beat Guardian Ape last weekend, and the two Apes yesterday. Never got captured in his lunging grab. Phase 2 gave me a MUCH harder time.
    ive noticed that grab attacks and long range thrust/dive attacks have the same issue that DS2 had where they would basically just track you no matter what you did, but not nearly as often.   Still,  fucks you though.
    Oh good. I thought the game was just fucking me in particular.
This gif gets less and less quality every time I see it 
    more Jp...GIFs?
Whenever I verse these guys, I feel like my hit box is the size of an elephant. 🙃
    True. Those hitbox porn moments seem pretty rare. It happens a lot more often that the hitbox is a lot bigger than it seems (especially on grabs for example). 
        And the tracking of some enemies. OMG the tracking.

I need to stop pressing B/O lol. 
            The reason they added so much tracking is to force you to use deflect more. The intention is that you use dodge, jump and deflect in the appropiate situations and not rely on one defense for everything.

Its designed like rock paper scissors.
                I swear this game is almost harder for DS veterans because of the muscle memory you need to unlearn. 🤣
                    Yeah but once you learn it, it's incredibly satisfying going toe to toe with a boss or miniboss, deflecting, countering, and punishing without stopping until the deathblow.
                        Block while jumping ability=godly
                            I must get this!
                            I feel like such a badass when I block mid-air
                                It’s even better when you deflect mid air, very satisfying. 
                                    That's more or less what I meant! When I get a parry mid-air is what I should have said! Couldn't agree more though, my friend!
                            I tried blocking in mid air against physical attacks, and I was unable to actually use it effectively. I was doing so badly that I thought the mid air block was only for projectiles. 

Why would you jump and then block against physical attacks anyways?
                                wondering the same. wasnt even useful for gyoubu
                                When hit and running you can ninja jump tf out of there and block on your way out to protect your booty
                                The best spot is against demon of hatred when he jumps in the air.

Jump when hes about to land, if you are still too near, the shockwave will hit you so you block to deflect the airblast. If you are far enough, you can grapple back in.

Ita also good against genichiro with his jump stab mixup. If you predict a sweep and jump but he slashes instead, you cam still block to save yourself.

Lastly against projectiles when you jump towards musket and arrows.
                        Genichiro was so satisfying to fight, everything clicked like a boss or two before but it was this fight where it became a strategic fight with the multiple deflects combos and parry's. God damn best boss fight so far.
                            oh you are gonna love the end game
                            I wouldn't hesitate to say that Genichiro is up there with Ornstein/Smough or Lady Maria for how much I love fighting them. Amazing boss fight, and though he's hard as hell he really is fair and you can predict his moves/manipulate him at least to an extent. 

&#x200B;

This is what videogames should be. 
                            This fight felt like the most fair fight. Lol. So good.
                            Phase 2 was much easier imo^
                        My first post on this sub was me saying the game isn’t for me and I wanted a refund but couldn’t get one. I was stuck at the very first general but now I’m addicted to Samurai death matches. Beat the lance guy on the horse on my second try. Once you get into it everything around you disappears and when it goes right it’s a feeling no other game can give. I haven’t played another game since I started Sekiro and I never played any other soulsbourne. 
                            > the lance guy on the horse

HIS NAME IS GYOUBU MASATAKA ONIWA!
                                How could I forget. Sorry I’m still just a puppy. 
                                    There’s a YouTube video on how to cheese her....I caved and and watched because it was looking pretty bleak, it’s funny how broken it is 
                                    Do you remember what he says when he enters the battlefield? :P
                                AND THE CASTLE GATES WILL REMAIN CLOSED!
                                AS I BREATHE, YOU WILL NOT PASS THE CASTLE GATES!
                                Such a great introduction to the games first big boss.
                                Man that VA didn’t have to go so hard, he did that for us 
                            THAT... [points at this comment] That right there is why these games are so good. At first, you want to break something, it's so unfair. The regular enemies swarm you and stun lock you to death, you can't block or dodge like you want to, deflect "isn't working..." you grow to hate it, it's so frustrating.

But then you learn.

You start to clue into enemy patterns, reading the opportune moments to retaliate, you learn the area and how to sneak past or stealth kill, you get abilities to augment your arsenal and toughen up your character to last longer... suddenly, these "impossible" encounters become routine displays of shinobi badassery. That unarmed monk that smashed you before gets Ichimonji: Double smashed in the face, you vault over, deal a deathblow, use his blood for mist cover, and you're grappling back into the trees before the others have even noticed... you get better. And for all that practice, you start to feel better about your gameplay and you savor those victories. Winning isn't just a matter of course, it's a badge of honor, and you earned it.

This is why, when people holler about an "easy" mode for these games, I have to laugh. If you truly think the soulsborne games need an easy mode, you aren't ready to play them. 
                                > If you truly think the soulsborne games need an easy mode, you aren't ready to play them.

My sentiment exactly. They're designed to be precise, challenging systems and they are exactly what they're supposed to be. 
                                “Easy Mode” is default on your first play through, that’s all you get folks. The only way it gets easier is if you figure it out. 
                            After you find Kuro at the beginning of the game there's a miniboss right through the gate (where ashina reservoir idol is later in the game). This guy killed me probably 20+ times before I stopped trying to dodge and hit him and instead started reacting to his moves and deflecting. Once I decided to do that he went down instantly. However it wasn't until Gyoubu that I really felt like I was "getting" it. Many people go for Butterfly as their first boss, but I don't think she is supposed to be. Gyoubu is designed perfectly to teach you how to play at that point. He has powerful attacks that can kill you in 1-2 hits but they are all very clearly telegraphed, don't have any weird irregular timing and are easily punishable if deflected. This made me kill him on the first attempt and I finally got the feeling I was doing things right.   
If I had gone for lady Butterfly first things might have been different. 
                                I did Butterfly first. It changed the game for me. Until then I had MASSIVE trouble with the game. But that fight taught me how important knowing what defense ability to use, specifically to not be afraid of blocking. Also that fight was awesome. I felt real dumb cause I didn’t know the difference between mini-boss and real boss until then. I’ve played all Soulsbourne games and I walked in that room and was like “oh right.. bosses have cutscenes.” 

I refused to leave until I killed her, so the next boss I found was super easy. The game is still hard to me, but I fucking love it. It’s one of my absolute favorite games of all time now. Every time I’m like “I’m a master of this” I walk into something new. 

Pro tip: Save Divine Confetti and don’t use it on the optional guys, until you unlock the merchant that sells an infinite amount. 
                                    Keep hearing this and she will fall today.
                                    I died to her hellas probably 20+ times because I was still too much in dark souls mode. My kill attempt I did everything perfect dont think I even got hit once and interrupted every leap with a shuriken. My GF was watching me and was like "woah, that was badass" and had some second hand excitement for me since she watched me eat shit over and over to her. 
                                    Where is the merchant that sells infinite amount? I cannot even come close to competing with Headless and everywhere I've read has told me Divine Confetti is required to beat him. (Only boss I've attempted and gave up on, even LadyButterfly I kept at after fifty or more deaths) 
                                I dont understand how butterfly could be the first boss for someone. Wouldn't you have to at least fight the drunkard first?
                                    Real boss, drunkard is a mini boss
                                Butterfly isn’t meant as first boss LOL, she’s waaay too difficult but I forced myself through anyway
                                    I found her pretty easy once I realized the game was very serious about the dodge counter, if you dodge past her and attack she does not counter that and it does health damage, making her  much more manageable. 
                                    She’s actually really slow with huge openings. But hey. Different strikes for different folks. 
                        Just fought Genichiro. Basically the only way to fight him....if you play defensively, he will royally fuck you. repeatedly.
                            For him, and the Snake Eyes sisters, you can win by attacking until they try to strike back, deflect, then attacking again. FORCE them to do moves you know are coming and can deflect with ease. When you control what they do, you control the battle. For additional breaking power, chomp an Ako's Sugar (red candy) before that. They might do something unexpected or go for a perilous attack, so just react to that, readjust, and resume. You'll find that once you master deflection, a lot of fights become much easier.
                        I really gotta say, for as much crap as she gets, Lady Butterfly is like the *perfect* boss for this stuff. Attacking rapidly and then deflecting like three times after feels so goddamn epic lol.
                            I think Genichiro is a better example actually. Butterfly has some god awful reaction times (hyper quick, obscenely wide hitboxes, far too much vitality). Honestly, I don't think she's a good fight at all, especially for how early you're able to face her, she's just a commonly talked about boss because of how many players get stonewalled on her (and a lot of those only beat her through cheese and then try to say what a great boss she is!).

She gave me more trouble than the final boss on my first playthrough, and while some of that is due to better learning the systems and improving at the game, I still maintain that she's just not a very well made encounter.
                        Yeah last night I was up in lady butterfly’s face like “bitch ima mother fucking shinobi, fuck with meeeeee!!!!!” Then I died.
                        Dude. When you get to like 1/4 health after resurrect and you get that high-posture enemy's bar to start turning orange and that switch turns on to start blitzing them is so satisfying. The way the tide turns in mini-boss fights is different from the other fromsoft games. It's not simply chipping away at health or exploiting mid-fight AI/waiting for an opening like the other games, it's actually feeling like you have to get an enemy on their heels. Because of the way the combat is, a lot of fights feel like you make it out alive by the skin of your teeth. 
                    It absolutely does deliberately and intentionally punish trying to play it like Dark Souls, which has been hilarious while trying to learn the game.
                    I always play any souls game only using some weapon with both hands. Learned to never use block or parry(i suck at parrying in souls games) because they was not as reliable as just rolling away. I dont need to say sekiro is being harder to me than when I tried darksouls for the first time but i'll get there.
                        I’m keen to go back to DS and do a dex build with no shield. 
                            The best kind of build for any souls game, this and quality build. Quality with red iron twin blade in ds2 was insane
                    It really is. I still want to roll INTO every fucking swing. So, everyone I know is ravaged by dragon rot. 
                        Same. I caught on with the perfect blocking, but those enemies with high posture you're supposed to wear down by dodging and countering, I get wrecked trying to time like DS. 
                    I got bloodborne and couldn’t get past the first few stages. It was just too difficult for me and I decided I’d play it later. I lost the game and I did sigh in relief. Now my fingers are twitching to buy this game so bad. I’ve been reading how this is harder than the DS and BB games too. Pretty sure I might impulse buy this later this week. 
                        I'm in the same boat as you in bloodborne but have gotten a decent way through this game.

Bloodborne just felt too slow for me, so if that was the reason for you than get this game cause it fixes that.
                    Yeah exactly. My instinct is to roll and dodge, not block so much. I had to retrain my brain to adjust and it took hours. Now if I go back to play Souls or Bloodborne, I’m fucked. 
                    This. This is totally my experience!
                    You are entirely, 100% correct. And I love it! I love that it's so similar but so unique at the same time, bringing the same design mentality of Dark souls with a whole new combat system. 

&#x200B;

I am loving this game a LOT more than I thought I would. 
                    Definitely.  I feel like they did sime stuff JUST to fuck with the vets: Like B/O being a forward lunge instead of a backstep.
                    Absolutely agree, played every Souls game religiously and this one gave me a run for my money this first week, but now that I’ve finally learnt the combat it’s so much more fun. Thanks, Lady Butterfly! 
                    Can confirm. This games beating my ass and I can’t break out of old habits. 
                    Until you get to a later boss and the game forces you to abandon everything you learn and fight it DS/BB style. Fun boss, good lore, but it seemed like a slap in the face.
                    I went into the game not treating it like a new game rather than a Souls game, so it was actually super easy for me to come to grips with the combat. Game’s still tough as nails though.
                    Just rebind block to B lol
                The problem is that they then add some unblockable moves with the same tracking so its not immediately obvious how to avoid the attack (Ogre and Demon of Hatred)
                But I like rock, paper, scissors, dodge. (jokes)

Although, you do have to admit the tracking can get a bit redic in some situations, to the point it even makes the enemy animations look strange. (not a big deal though, since soulsborne has always had little things like clipping, totally worth it)
                    Yeah it happens mostly for grabs.

I think this might be intentional because almost every grab attack in the Soulsbourne games has had wierd hitboxes. Maybe its because they want the dodge window to be tight and sacrifice the animation for a tighter hitbox. IDK but it seems unlikely that the are capable of making good hitboxes but fail to do it on literally every grab attack.

I mean Dancers terrible telegrab was never patched out or anything ....

                    The only viable response to thrusts is the mikiri counter.
                        Can't even jump over them it's bs but really drives the point home.
                            No it drives the point up your ass.
                        Deflect works, too. But Mikiri does more poise damage.
                    dodge into thrust attacks not sideways 
                    Mikiri Counter and deflect (but mostly Mikiri) are pretty much the only reliable ways to not take damage from a thrust. Unless you can get out of range entirely before he shish-kebabs you.
                    Mikri dodge. Once you get it you can practice it on the training dummy guy. Dodge into thrust attacks and you step on their weapon. It's one of the first ones in 2nd skill tree. If your talking about the guy with the big ass lance or w.e that hangs out in the building you initially find kuro in, he hits pretty fuckin hard.
                    >shaft of his spear 

*lenny face* 

You don’t have Mikiri Counter? 
                    [This would explain it](https://giphy.com/gifs/shia-labeouf-12NUbkX6p4xOO4)
                    The fucking red eyed giant.........................

So much salt.
                    >when I try to dodge instead of deflecting

>doing wrong stuff on reflexes

>enemies shouldn't hit me

>enemies shouldn't deal full damage

[You must know how that sounds like, right?](https://pics.me.me/git-gud-28126051.png). 

You clearly know how to fix your problems, you're just complaining it doesn't work the way you want it to. The way Souls used to. Adapt


                It sounds like a good decision, but the tracking really psyches me out. I've learned since the early hours that the deflection play is not always the solution, and you have to play a bit more aggressively. Saw one guy take out Genichiro with an absurd amount of dodging, for example. Yet I always feel discouraged from trying it on anything but a few moves because of the tracking. 
                Can’t deflect a grab 
            fucking snake eyes grab is the biggest bullshit. I swear she spins around like a beyblade and only need 1 pixel to hit you and you are gonna get executed.
                Make sure to jump backwards, not dodge.. gamechanger once I started doing that with Snake Eyes.
                    Yea I've killed her already. Amount of times, I got grabbed though. 
                        I just let her die of poison 
                            Nice to see a fellow professional around here. It may have taken 15 minutes and 4-6 shuriken but I showed her who's boss.
                            I've cheesed stuff in other souls games. Determined to beat everybody without obvious cheese. 
                        Same. Was stuck for several hours on that bastard. Finally figured out to play super aggressively and everything worked out.
                I haven't been able to try it yet but I read somewhere that you can actually deflect the pull back of her grab making this a lot easier. Will have to try that in NG+. 
                    I think aslong as it's not their hand grabbing you, you can parry some grabs with a perfect parry. Atleast the grabs that involves impalement. For all I know you can parry hands to but I have yet to try that 
                I thought I had jumping it down, basically you jump over it and then head bop her. It would keep you above the hit box and keep you nice and close to keep wailing on her.

Unfortunately, the timing was just too tight and I would sometimes teleport into it if I jumped too late.

But, I'm not really mad about it. Jump away works basically everytime. Then I just speared her right back into my face and started slashing.
                I find it weird the grab is the move everyone is complaining about. For me. I couldn't wait for her to do her grab because it was the easiest to avoid and go in for two hits.
            Same lol. 
            >!snake eyes reporting in!<
            It’s this. It’s not the hit boxes themselves but the tracking. The hit-boxes are exceptionally tight. The tracking is the part that gets you.


            No joke but if you're in that situation, jump on their heads. I have found that jumping on a opponents head has put me into safety more times than not. On top of that, it can lower their posture a lot if they are lunging and thrusting, it counts like a counter. 
            the tracking works against the enemies, you are supposed to deflect and the tracking makes sure they keep hitting you and you can keep deflecting. 
            This!!! It’s basically “fuck your dodge!”
            It took me an hour to beat the first real mini boss because I kept dodging non-stop.
            try swapping deflect with dodge in the keybinds - as a DS guy this changed everything for me
            The Shinobi combo where they follow up with that lock-on kick comes to mind. The Pose he takes tells me "Block", but for some reason the Symbol makes me want to Circle-step out of there.

I really, really need to start my Subimaru combo right there when he takes the pose so I don't get my soul kicked out of my body lmao
            Dodge grab attacks, jump/kick sweeps, Dodge towards thrusts (mikiri counter), deflect the rest
            I had to mentally train myself to stop dashing with the shadow swordsman because his kick has tracking. 
            The tracking is fine on everything except the grabs, because even when you react appropriately and dodge they’ll still rotate to get you and suck you in with the huge bullshit hitbox.
        Grabs are actually the the least tracking attacks, most can be evaded with a single side dodge. But some do have extra bullshit hitbox, like the rifle snakeeye girl
            Or the frost chain ogre. His hands are like magnets or some shit. He's like the first boss, barely.  


Related note, I just beat him and backed up my save and both saves are fucked. I think I just quit the game. Spent like 15 hours grinding gear and maxing skills and FUCK.
                Why are you messing with the saves? 
                    Well, I read that PC version is somehow corrupting saves, so I wanted to prevent that.

Copied entire folder and pasted, game loads and I'm back to square one.

Tried contents from copied folder, same.

So. I'm probably gonna rethink how I spend my time. That was a lot of stress.
                        There's a script that you can use to backup the game. I use it every time I rest at an idol or beat a boss. 
        I think that's purely psychological.

You're more likely to believe that someone cut you with a blade, even when it only grazes you slightly. But if you dodge someone who tries to grab you, and they only gently caress your ass, you'll call BS.

Good example is the red eye ogre in the beginning. He tries to grab you with both hands, but if he only touches you with the back of one of his hands, you kind of teleport in there. If he did the same movement with two swords, you'd think that you definitely just got stabbed.


        
I'm pretty sure the hitboxes/iframes actually differ depending on whether you block, dodge, or jump. There are attacks where you can visually dodge them and still get hit, but if you jump the attack can visually clip through you and yet not hit. 
            Yea, the Corrupted Monk's upward slash would hit me alot if I was too close even if I blocked
        Seriously.  Grabs are ridiculous.  I keep ash ready for them,  doesn't work on everything though.  But man..... hate grabs
            If you've unlocked the umbrella you can use that to block grabs. But yeah, some of those hitboxes are ridiculous. 
                 Didn't think it would block grabs, good to know thanks. 
        I once got killed by seven spear stabbing the air about 30 cm to the right of me.

I probably dodged too late (or should've just mikiri'd instead), but it was still slightly annoying.
        Looking at you, ogre. Piece of shit. Was so satisfying to beat though
        I just met the shotgun miniboss and it feels like dodging the hook attack is impossible
            I know, feels super random. Jumping worked best for me. Also, use poison blades. 
        But you can get those moments while fighting lady butterfly
    It's the grabs that annoy me, it looks like i should be in the clear but it vacuums me back in and get caught anyway. Mostly with the ape boss jump belly flop grab.
        Jesus Christ the rest of that fight was absolutely perfect EXCEPT for the jump grab roll bullshit
        I had to run backwards to dodge that
    Whenever you fight* them. You say him versus you, but verse is not a verb form of versus. 
    I swear chained ogre would grab me from a mile away.....
        Totally. I’d be standing by his left hip or ankle and GRAB! Never been so mad. 
    Is your settings on elephant?
This is probably the most satisfying GIF on the sub.
    Now I want this on loop. 
        The gif is already on loop. What do you mean?

            It's just a video for me. 
                Put it on loop.
    From Software makes the best hit box porn
Gif from vid of Marcus, also known as ENB. 
    ...is he still a thing? Honestly I felt like he's sorta been replaced by the other YouTube channels.  Good for him if he's still making content but he never shows up in my feed anymore.  Vati mantis and the likes do
        Ye but he is doing an old school walkthrough of sekiro atm on youtube, in the style of his old from the dark series
            his dark souls 2 walkthrough/lore summary was great. dunno if he good that for ds1, I followed him when the game first came out but then not so much.
                Yeah I felt like shortly after 2i just never saw him anymore
                    It's YouTube, not a fashion show... it shows you what you want to see dude.

His Sekiro play though is the best out there hands down.
                Agreed the one for ds2 is the best imo but I probably think that because I'm a heretic who thinks thats the best souls gamr
        Hes mainly on twitch nowadays
        [deleted]
            Oh cool.  Glad he's able to put family first.  I have to work 60hours a week almost,  I barely game anymore but enjoy family time or sleep.  
        ENB's Bloodborne walkthrough was amazing. He was full of knowledge, not just item locations and fight mechanics, but the lore and story, he made the game better for me in a way. Think he had worked on the official guide, like the hardcopy. 

&#x200B;

I watch cowboy now though. 
        Of course! Nothing beats ENB's souls playthroughs 
        He started making YouTube content again just this past week for Sekiro. Similar style as his From The Dark series, but not to the same level at the moment since he's working on finding the lore still. As mentioned by u/Highflyer108, Marcus is on Twitch now.
            Yeah I have no twitch time.  I barely even game but I'd rather game then watch
        If you just watch a video or two of him they will start popping up again. It's more to do with YouTube's algorithm than anything. Like I like to watch a lot of Rust content so my recommended usually has the new rust videos when I go on but I didn't watch any for a few days and they just stopped showing up until I started watching again.
I haven't watched vaatis channel in a while so his recent video didn't show up for me when they always used to show up when I watched him more regularly.
            Oh.  My YouTube is a wreck.  I have toddlers.... it has no idea if that's how that works
        Marcus is great if you want a deep dive into the lore and if you really want to savor the game and level design, but I found that can be a detriment if you just want a quick 100% walkthrough.

That said, I love Marcus and his enthusiasm for FromSoft games is infectious.
There's this.

Then there's times when my Ichimonji strike goes clean through an enemy with no effect.

Grumble grumble.
    Reading things like this is why I'm skeptical about getting into this game. Stuff like that makes me rage quit so fast. 
        Eh, it's rare when it happens, but it's no less frustrating since it takes a bit to wind it up, and having it just glitch through for no damage, getting hit by the enemy is just salt in the wound.

But the game is still great regardless, though I do personally keep a stress ball nearby at all times.
        Its quite rare when that happens, I'd 100% suggest getting this game. It doesn't even feel like a game to me, it otherworldly. The universe they built this in is so deep and so well fleshed out I feel more like I'm having a religious experience.
        If you rage quit easily (no shame in that) then it probably isn’t the game for you. The only way you can really complete the game is to train your brain to see every death as “I learned something about that enemy” otherwise you simply will not have fun.
            I have a question about the xp loss upon death. Say I get to a hard part and  I die very many times. Does than mean I'll potentially lose the ability to reach max level? 
                Nah you can grind for levels at an easy spot. Once you get a skill you don’t lose it. Just grind somewhere and spend levels as you get them
        Incredible game I wouldn't avoid it because of that
        Honestly if that kind of thing makes you rage, then yeah, you might be better off not getting into it.  It's a good game, but if I didn't have the attachment I have to the Soulborne games, I probably would have just given up on this shit a long time ago.  There are quite a lot of bullshit moments, especially grab attacks are broken as fuck across the board, and the dodge windows are ridiculously small, way smaller than in their other games.  
        For me it's the absurd tracking on a lot of attacks that makes some fights feel cheap/cheesy.  Which was put there by the devs to force you to deflect (and as a nice f.u. to DS vets).    
  

On the bright side, if you've not already gotten into the DS mentality of dodging everything you might feel right at home. A large majority of attacks are deflectable, even when you might not think they are (IE the big brute lookin guys with the large hammer/mace).
Is it my turn to post this gif tomorrow?
    Ye
    with less quality or frames
Noice
Still my favourite is jump kick combo - jump over dem sweeps and punish with kicks <3
    Oh The sweet feeling of breaking someones posture as you head stomp them, just to fall with the takedown. Only close competitor is when you do it with a mikiri counter and just stab them clean
        Yeah getting an aerial takedown on a sweeping enemy is pure gold. 
I just Nightjar Slash'd over Genichiro's sweep.
    I love that move and that sounds beautiful to me
        Definitely outclassed by a jump and headstomp, but it's so damned stylish

            I agree but sometimes they're crafty with the up slash. 
    It's my favorite move so far. Great for getting back up in their faces after jumping away from a perilous attack.
    I did not know you could Nightjar sweeps
NANI?!
With the exception of grabs the hit boxes are really tight in this game. 
    not rly, many enemies can hit you hard while u are standing AT THEIR BACK, and they are landing a FORWARD attack in front of them. the finaly boss does it, the  Orge's leg kick does it, and so many others :S
        I'm comparing it to dark souls which has horrible hitboxes by comparison.
            which one tho? third game was quite okay, i didnt see SO huge bullshit hits which i see in sekiro. 100+ hrs
Meanwhile I get grabbed mid air by the zombies in the abandoned dungeon when they have both arms parallel to the ground
I have had so many hit box porn moments in this game. From Software did a superb job with hit boxes for Sekiro imo. Beating BB I know I thought, “man that’s some bullshit” at least a few times through.


With Sekiro I’m like, “well I fucked up”.
absolutely delicious
This looks amazing, but could it be a result of invincibility frames? It sort of looks like there's a little dodge or something there that could have a few.
    I don't think this move has iframes. And even if it did, this still looks amazing. 
        Can confirm none of the combat arts have iframes. Some have hyper armour but there was no hit marker here to indicate that. 
        I agree, it's really awesome. Just the animation alone and the fluidity is super impressive. I watched it like twenty times. 
    It is.
Okey this gif was the final tick. here I come Sekiro!
I came
If you time it right you can do the same thing with lady butterfly’s counter attack, looks so badass
    Her sweep? I have done that once or twice, it looks so awesome, like straight out of a martial arts movie. You start the whirlwind slash and with the right timing it just makes you jump over her kunai.

Hitboxes in this game are definitely fantastic. The tracking on some moves is so insanely amped it makes up for it, but for the most part I know if I got hit it's because I fucked up. 
    The best part is that it’s clear as day where and how you mess up, so you can correct it faster and identify patterns better.
More often hitboxes like this :(

[https://youtu.be/jlUae-i7KDI](https://youtu.be/jlUae-i7KDI)

Its barely hits you, and you pressed O, but hit is registered in some time after ;(

Im about red hit from knight. 
    I did notice that thrust attacks seem to have a larger area of effect around the physical sword, however the Mikiri counter is also very generous so it kind of balances out.
        Mikiri is superb, yeah :)
        The thrust seems like it’s kind of “auto aimed” like if you roll to the side the spear or sword follows you. I ended up getting tired of it and just perfecting the circle move where I stomp on their weapon. Totally worth. So satisfying too.
        
I can never do it so I just jump away and definitely didn't get the skill upgrade lol.
            You have to press B/Circle and not in any direction - I take my thumb off the stick when I see kanji. Don't do it as soon as you see the kanji, but like half a second after. One. two. Count it out, and on two press B. Eventually you'll do it on reflex. 

Goomba stomps on sweeps work the same, but you have to jump jump - one. two. three. with two and three being jumps. Grabs I jump away from because side stepping is less forgiving, but side step counter slash is how you *should* deal with those.
                This needs to be a thread. Best advice for the counters and each time I've heard all time. 

You actually stated it as rhythm. Agreed on jump away. 
                    I'm not great at this game yet, but I played a lot of Souls and Monster Hunter. Most of the time people react too fast when they're doing poorly rather than too slow. These games have beats to them, and the attacks have a rhythm. It helps me to practice on a boss first with sloppy blocking, and then counting out those hits and finding the spaces. These bosses have patterns, and I find the way they string them together really intricate and beautiful for game design. I'm usually too impressed to get frustrated, and I know when I figure it out I'll be that much better. This game is sooo fucking good at teaching you, and swordfighting is such a violent, satisfying ballet.
                In my experience you can press forward too and it still works, because pressing B does the same thing as pressing forward B

        I mean he's pretty clearly out of the way by the time the sparks show up so I can see why it would seem unfair.   
But it doesn't really have anything to do with bad hitboxes, this is clearly an intentional design choice forcing you to use the correct counter/timing. He maybe still could have dodged that sideways with correct timing but the dodge started way before the actual attack so it doesn't count.    

If it wasn't designed like this you could just dodge spam everything and the entire combat system would break down, so it's a compromise having slightly less realistic hitboxes on perilous attacks in exchange for a more fun system of counters. 
            Sparks showing up 2 frames later than this hit occuring doesn't mean the hit wasn't registered on the two frames in which the sword is inside the players back knee. Why there is a delay to them I don't know, perhaps it waits on all hits to the character to show the hit sparks.
Either way it can't seem unfair when 1) he got hit 2) he failed to use the right ability against a thrust attack.

The fact he took the trouble to check it in slow motion (and missed it clips his knee?), take time to edit and upload a clip and blame hitboxes instead of just recognizing he didn't mikiri counter or deflect the thrust is what I take from his post.
                I can only give a general reply, but games don't usually do everything on every update. Hit detection is probably high priority here, but maybe the consequences happen on the next update to allow a late deflect response. Similar to how many platformers let you still jump for a frame or so, when you already completely ran off the edge.
    I know nothing about this but the sword clearly goes thru your knee. That's got to hurt.
        Trouble not in the sword goes thru knee, trouble that animation of damage starts only after 2 frames.  

It sucks :)
Wait until guardian ape and enjoy his sword hitboxes...
I want to play this game in slow motion just to enjoy those glorious animations.
    This!!!!
There's so many instances where this combat art results in a cool dodge.
    Absolver (the game) has the most cinematic combat.  Check it out!
So satisfying
I can't stop watching this. 
Oh dear...
This is beautiful.
Is this really a FromSoftware game?
r/hitboxporn
I'm a DS vet and I swear I cannot get a hold of the combat in this game.  Basically, stand still, tap l1?
    I’m a DS vet as well, and am having to adapt too. I’ve found that it’s more of a dance like fighting style. I always go by “attack until you’re deflected, deflect until you can attack”. It works for a good amount of enemies. 
        that sounds like great advice
            Anything to try and help man. :)
            Be *very* aggressive. Generally you want to open fights with shuriken+dash or a sprint attack and keep attacking until you’re deflected, you’ll notice because the spark from the blades will be a different color and the sound will be louder, then deflect until an opening to attack again. Thrusts can be deflected (deflected meaning parried, just holding L1 to block is not the same as deflecting) but generally you want to use one of your skills to counter it, sweeps need to be jumped over, and grabs you can technically dodge away from but I just sprint away because the hit boxes on grabs are overtuned. 

For boss fights you need to control the fight. In Souls you wait for the boss to finish its chain and get some hits in, but letting the boss control the pacing of the fight in Sekiro will get you killed. Being in the bosses face forcing them to deflect allows you to manipulate their move sets the same way that proper spacing does in Souls and BB, so it’s generally your best bet. The dodge works like it does in Nioh where it’s a tool to get out of enemy range not something to iframe through attacks, so break those old habits early. 
                >but letting the boss control the pacing of the fight in Sekiro will get you killed

Actually this is a cheese strat that work for basically every enemies, it's slower than just killing through poise but you can bait out every attack the same attack over and over 
                Man I’m trying to break the habits, but damn it’s hard. 
And then you have the fight against >!Corrupted monk!< where they seem to have the hitbox of a damn silo.
    Fuck corrupted monk.
For every moment like this in a FromSoft game, there's about ten more where it's the complete opposite. 
    You right but it's moments like these that make it all worth it.
I swear every time this gets reposted the resolution is worse haha xD
*Hot damn*, that was absolutely beautiful. I believe I have just bust a nut, excuse me.
Darksouls 3 got me into the souls series and Bloodborne and now Sekiro I honestly love Fromsoft games 
I just masturbated my weener.
Funny thing i found is anyone you fight who uses a sword like you, getting in the face and forcing them to sword fight really messes them up because while most bosses are great at chasing they seem to struggle with distancing. They all do the same thing, some kind of leap, and shuriken is a huge punish for airborne targets 
This is some straight Battousai shit
My boss read porn and then saw the gif. He walked away extremely confused.
For certain enemies, sure. I love when I'm at the apes ass and I teleport into his hands when he's going for a grab move.
Most of these comments lead me to believe that a lot of y'all haven't fought the final boss in Silvergrass Field yet. If you thought Genichiro was difficult, you're in for an absolute miserable world of hurt.
If there was anything that was going to convince me to play Sekiro, this was it! Wow!
[Meanwhile my Hitbox] (https://imgur.com/F2wgaeR)
Thanks for blessing my eyes 3 years later, OP. I’m playing through all the souls games and I still haven’t reached Sekiro.

The jank hit boxes of Ds2 is hurting my soul (I played DeS remake, Ds1, & bloodborne) but this makes me so excited to get to sekiro
There's a really similar hotbox porn that can happen with lady butterfly. The counterattack has you duck a bit, and that's enough that if you counterattack her as she's following up with a high slash you can duck below her attack and hit her. It's beautiful.
That’s some fucking movie level shit right there
The spear version of this dude kicked my ass Into the ground. 
Absolute elegance, straight out of a cutscene
I had a very similar experience where that i dodged a sweeping attack by wolf being in the jumping portion of his special attack. Was pretty snazzy. 
I had a friend yesterday that accidentally hit crouch mid fight at the perfect moment, causing a rifle shot to go high and miss at the same time an upward perilous spear hit lost its tracking and went wide. I told him how amazing that level of detail was, and then I saw this. Perfection
He should have hit the sword
Too bad this didn’t make it in the actual game ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
This makes me want a game where there's no drudge button but when you attack you move so you dodge certain attacks. 
Flag it 18+, damn it
Sekiro is so fucking good lol
I swear when this happened to me in game i didn't believe, sometimes i accidentally escape from sweep attacks the moment Sekiro jumps to do the spin attack, it's so damn epic
Meanwhile Genichiros arrows hit me from 3 feet away
This gif is just proof I'm actually bad at the game.
This is a fucking beautiful gif, the animation in this game from the glimpses I've seen is amazing. I can't wait to pick it up and playthrough it myself one day.
There should totally be a mode to slow the game down. I could watch this slow combat all day. I think it would also be a way to help those struggling learn the tells of some of the tougher enemy moves. And it wouldn't really make the game much easier because you would still be committed to the move you choose. Either way it would be awesome;)
Where's the lube and box of tissues at? Might pull an all nighter here. 
Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne had some amazing hitbox porn, but this game is something from another planet.
more like hurtbox porn tho
I enjoyed all 3 pixels of that
This same thing happens on Lady Butterfly. Her one counter roundhouse kick can be dodged under by using that same attack in the gif.
This happens with me every time I fight the corrupted monk
I love how much the quality takes a dump each time this gif is reposted. 
Then how come any enemies grab attacking me snap and slide right to me even when I dodge (the games suggested way of dealing with grab attacks)?
    There are different types of grabs as well. The guardian ape lunge, you jump over. It makes sense, he's lunging for your legs. The genichiro grab, you back off since hes grabbing you with his hands. The snake eyes grab, you dodge to the side since shes pulling you with a hook. Many grabs you can jump over but you have to do it early so their tracking breaks when you get behind them.
You dont want tp jump over spears or long range weapons of you can help it since they can poke you out of the air. React to your opponent. Not every grab is equal.
        Noted, I hadn't thought of this, thank you
Whirlwind slash does this so often I love it
I once dodged a bullet by taking a single step to the left from near point blank range.

It made me realize that guns in this game suck and you can literally just serpentine the bridge part.
    The mortar is a different story though. That Artillery fire.
You can do something similar with Lady Butterfly.  after she reflects your attack she spins back with a kick and if you do that spin slash like in the OP you go under her kick and then over the next
I accidentally press left stick while fighting genichiro and fucking ducked under his sword swing it was orgasmic
[Hitbox Porn](https://i.imgur.com/r6vdvXy.gif)
Haha, I accidentally used that ability a few times and dodged vertical strikes. It's pretty satisfying even if it was an accident.
I randomly beat Drunkard on my first try last night lol! And I’m not good at this game I don’t think, although it is starting to click for me. I wasn’t even expecting Juzou yet and I stumbled into his area and completely botched any chance of sneaking up on him or any of his goons. Still managed the victory somehow though. 
as the sword clips through the enemy super hard twice
that's actually pretty sweet .... 
And then there's demon of hatred
He clearly hit your sword xD
I audibly moaned
And then, there is [this](https://www.twitch.tv/elajjaz/clip/TsundereFancyEchidnaFutureMan).

It's hilarious.
Corrupted Monk either didn’t get the memo or my controller’s broken
Let me show you vids of me getting hit when I’m nowhere near the attack. 
I must be the only one that is having crazy trouble with this game. 
eh, he pulled his sword back from the miss and being on the ground way too quick
My my we’ve come a long way 
This is.. Beautiful.. 
Oh fuck I'm cumming
This seems rare. Hit boxes are my main complaint with the game. It seems like the attack tracking the enemies have includes a huge extended hit box window. 
stop posting the same gif for the 100 time
💦💦
Heyyyy, that's pretty good.
So smooth ❤️
Dude I have loved dark souls since demon souls, sekiro takes the cake though. Shino be da best
Sekiro has some good hitbox porn, but nowhere close to the hitbox porn DS has. I think it's because a lot of attacks track you like a homing beacon (which makes sense, since this is a game about deflecting not dodging) so you loose a lot of the good hitbox interactions. 
One Genichiro fight he knocked me flat on my back and proceeded to miss three combos because he slashed over Sekiro while he took a nap. 
I was watching someone stream the beginning of the game for a about 90 minutes. The game looks beautiful and plays beautifully, but honestly as desirable as those factors make the game for me, I know I don't have the reflexes or dexterity to actually play this game myself and enjoy it.

I mean, this clip is objectively beautiful, from a video game mechanic perspective. It looks SO GOOD. I could never match this with my own hands and eyes.

So I hope my favorite content creators continue to play, so I can enjoy the game through them.
    I don't really think the game requires great reflexes.  I say that, because I absolutely do not have them.  What it does require, is to be able to play the game by it's rules, not the way that might work in other games.  There's some subtle differences that will cause you to get destroyed in Sekiro if you don't realize them.

&#x200B;

\#1, dodging isn't that great in sekiro.

&#x200B;

\#2, spamming attack is terrible in sekiro, as the way the queuing system works, it will lock you into attacking when you should be blocking/deflecting.

&#x200B;

\#3, blocking \*speeds up your poise regen, it does not hinder it\*  This is completely alien to soulsborne players, who let's face it....make up a huge percentage of sekiro's fanbase.  We are so used to never blocking because we want to be able to parry, and because rolling/dodging was better in those games.

&#x200B;

\#4, jumping/jump attacking doesn't make sense at first as being a good strategy, but it completely wrecks so many different enemies, such as lord of seven ashinas.

&#x200B;

\#5 Damn it feels good to be a ninja
r/apexlegends I'm looking at you.
Oof... I love it 

Is this the move you get from the carp scale guy? Because I did t realize the opener was a dodge. Fucking neat. 
really mines the exact opposite ill be away and get hit
Woooo! *ric flair voice*
r/HitboxPorn
Low-key tough no cap
Aw man now there’s... something on my pants. 
This is more beautiful then watching uh...something beautiful. Bless your soul op 
this is basically asmr
That hits all the right buttons.

And by "that" I mean the guy doing that play. Damn.
he caught your sword you lost irl.
This is from the alpha at Gamescom. 

Still dank though.
Man, I like whirlwind slash, but Empowered mortal draw is 😍
    Very late reply but how did you get the empowered version? I only have mortal draw
        You have to finish basically the whole mushin skill tree, then you’ll get empowered mortal draw, it’s the bottom right one, idk why but I wasn’t able to unlock the middle right one
I love the game (still think BB and DS3 are better but not by much) but can we admit this really needs to finally be fixed?  I've got an insanely egregious Fume Knight one and a disgusting Lady Maria blood laser that I use in YouTube videos as my go to clips for this shit. 

This is awesome but my Fume Knight clip has him kill me with his thrust when I'm literally standing behind him.

Fixing this issue is important.  It makes the combat less viscerally real because models don't match what the game expects.

Grab moves remain horrendous.  The ogre is just as bad as the Executioners there's been zero improvement.
What game does it called? It looks sick. Sorry I am deaf and can not heard the sound.
    The name of this game is Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.
        Thanks! I already have it. This game must be sick! Thanks for commenter
Whirlwind is underrated as hell. Ichimonji is better, but I wouldn't have beat owl without whirlwind
The hitboxes in this game are some of the most precise I’ve ever seen in my life
It doesnt even look that good lol
I legit just came. Oh no
Hitbox porn for the flames of hatred doesn't exist and my God I wish it did 
How did you do that? Did you actually press L3 do go into stealth??
    He did the cross slash, L1 + R1
Please tag your NSFW. It’s easier to find. 
Jizzle my fizzle my dude
I'm drooling
I've read so many bad reviews saying hit boxes are broken . 
i just came
It's so funny when I see gifs like this because I feel like Sekiro has the absolute *worst* hitboxes of basically every FromSoftware game I've played. The grabs are fucked, Sekiro's hitbox seems to be the size of an elephant with thrust attacks, and any AOE attacks are far wider than their graphic shows.
    Hit boxes seem fine. A couple of grabs are dodgy, but overall I haven't gotten screwed by a hit box. Like, I've never wondered how something hit me. How the attack FOLLOWED me is another story. The tracking on everything is absolutely ridiculous.
        I've noticed several times that so many frames of the animatiin follow you, discouraging early dodges and deflects. This is true of projectiles as well. They will follow you until they are closer and then continue on a predefined path. If you can remain calm this is no issue, but if you panic and make a move too early, it is just as bad or worse than not making a move at all.
    It has been the complete opposite in my experience.
What’s the stray to beating these guys efficiently? I always get fucked up.
    Overwhelm them with attacks and deflect when needed so their posture bar get filled quickly. Also go for the back stab if possible.
More like i-frames.
All thrust attacks can be hitbox porn, or most likely, hitbox Gore. 
mmmm

&#x200B;
That gave me a hit of dopamine
yeah I noticed fromsoft finally fixed that in this iteration of the engine.  


People complain the engine is outdated due to graphics and shit, but what they dont understand is, fromsoft has a custom ARPG engine thats built to work entirely different from stuff like unreal or frostbite or unity. In the same way that coding an aRPG from frostbite would be annoying without documentation, making a FPS from DS engine would be expensive and tedious as fuck.  


I just really wish this game had one other style of ninja to choose from. it would be fun to have a second playthrough with a "mage style" that was based off ninjutsu and prosthetics more than direct combat, and maybe a few replacement katanas and more use of the spoiler taht has basically one use/attack and costs points to use.  


those things would take away from some of the absolute balancing the game has and its tight boss battles, but i still wish we had them.
This is just right down amazing. Was it intentional or accidental?
I think this just sold me on the game that was sexy
I’m gonna have to call hacks on this one
AWESOME!!!
How is he generating any power with that swing after he leaves the ground?
When you accidentally do the twist thingy and it looks cool but you get hit after
Forgive my ignorance, but what game is this?  Looks pretty fun.
    Sekiro: shadows die twice. Ton of fun
        Thank you very much.
What game is this?

Nvm
What game is this?
    Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
        Thanks👍
Is this game easier or harder then the dark soul games? And by how much. I've heard good things about it
    Harder for the new player. Once you "get" it, it's easier.
On average I expect people to take more time to beat the game but replays and speed runs would be faster
I can tell you’ve never played Team Fortress 2
    Ok?
        The hitreg in that game is terrible. Hit boxes are nearly as bad.
😮😮😮
What?I don’t understand
    He ducked under the swing by doing an attack
        Wow lol.NOICE!
r/hitboxporn
And then there are grab attacks with hitboxes sized like half of japanese prefecture.
That’s so hot.
Oh dang!!!!!! Gets me going!
Wait, that's illegal
How about an incoming THRUST attack, where you jump high enough in the air, the blade goes like 1 meter BELOW you and u still getting killed? huh? so stupid.
I don’t care what nobody says this is the most challenging game I ever played.
plot twist: youre a porn actor.

    Viagra replacement. If the erection doesn't go away in 4 hours, please consult your health care professional.
    His name is Buck Naked
        His name is Johnny Sekiro.
Ditto with Snake-Eyes
    A lot of people seem to have trouble with Snake Eyes' grab.

One trick I learned was that the metal hat blocks it. If I hesitated dodging, I'd just pull out the hat. 
        I found that out too. All the bosses have something that you can use to make the fight a little easier. 

For the Bull, you can jump over most of his charges and slash at him in mid air.

Lady butterfly you can knock out of the air with the shuriken.

Corrupted Monk you can use Divine Confetti to increase damage. 
            Corrupted Monk you can also use snap seeds on. They absolutely fuck her up.
                [deleted]
                    Here's something I'm not sure if others found for that encounter: If you grapple as fast as possible to the furthest, highest branch when entering the fight, if you jump over her immediately there's a small window to deathblow her first phase. Immediately grapple back up, deathblow her second phase because she always goes into the illusion thing. Its 100% consistent if you're fast enough, and makes it so you only ever have to fight her third phase.
                        I tried to do this so many times I ended up spending more time trying to make the fight easier than I would have just fighting her normally.
                    Yeah just get in close, use it, stun and a good chunk of damage. Divine confetti works well too.
            Yea when I started to realize this it reminded me of megaman lol getting different arm attachments in order use their weakness against them.
                I think that's where the replay value will come from in this game. The order you do things will change the experince.
            For the bull, I was runnin’ around him like a bull in a china shop.
            Or you can skip phase 2 by doing an air deathblow.
            What about Genichiro? I’ve been stuck for 4 days
                Third phase, in the air when he uses lightening. Jump and slice it. It hits him back and takes about 1/4 to 1/5 of his health.

First and second phase, always circle around counter clockwise, and dodge to the right.  Mikuri counter to quickly so the first phase. During the second phase he tends to do sweeping attacks more so just jump on his head when you see him extend his blade to the side before he becomes a beyblade.

Most of all?

Make your own playstyle. The game is made to where you can craft what's easiest for you. Use what fangs you have wolf and look at your skills you've learned along the way.
                    I finally fucking beat him. I’ve been stuck on it for so long when I beat him I almost threw up
            poo tosser can be speared with double rt/r2 to pull the centipede out for massive damage during second phase
            to be honest the bull isnt that hard if you have patience. You can literally run in circles around the arena and sneak in a hit or parry here or there. really if you have the patience you can run around, hit him in the back, run away adn keep doing it until he dies.

the key with this game is most of the time sprinting and jumping are more effective at dodging. you only really want to hit the dodge button if your going to counter or do a quick sidestep. if your trying to backstep with dodge most of the time your gonna get hit anyway because you dont move far/fast enough. and sometimes since the hitboxes are great you can leap over the attack anyway.  


nearly every time i die its because i virtually never use dodge and i need to for mikiri counter suddenly and miss a grand opportunity, or hit dodge by accident intending to leap away.
            For the bulls you can just stay behind, close to the back legs and he cant hit you. Just dodge the charge attack when he starts doing it and stay on his ass wacking him for easy cheese
            Skakskdxjkskskdskskekskaoaaslsl omg you can hit her with shuriken? I equipped it on my 11th attempt but when I got inside I just said "yeah that's not going to work anyway" and continued getting murdered.
        I found out you can actually block this grab, you just got to wait until the hook part comes up behind you and as she pull it back, deflect it.  Holy shit did this make a difference.
            So it's a weapon attack and not a grapple, makes sense you can deflect it.
                yeh, I see that it's definitely just a weapon attack now, since most unblockable grabs in this game are through hands or legs (Lady Butterfly).
            HMMMMMM. See, the hat blocks that hook part with sparks, so I never thought about deflecting it. I just assumed all grabs were unblockable and undeflectable.

But if that grab is deflectable, are others?

HMMMMM
                That's what I'm thinking, I'm guessing no because it's a semi grab and slash because it's not their hands that are grabbing you which are 100% unblockable.
        I just panic jumped backwards and it worked
        I found that just jumping backwards avoids it 99% of the time. 
        Very solid advice. I didn't have issues jumping away, because sidestepping timing was not working out for me consistently. The hat would trivialize the mini bosses - attacking and deflecting their attacks isn't difficult by the time you fight them imo.
        Sabimaru also works wonders against any of the snake eyes bosses. They're super weak against poison apparently.
            They set on fire really easily too. I guess it's the gunpowder.

All the Gun Fort-type gunmen burn in one hit, while the snake-eyes duo take 2 flame hits to burn without oil.
        I thought it was a swipe, so jumped on her. That allways works for me.
            She can pull you out of the air
        For the grab I eventually found that dodging into her to the right always worked and created time to pop in a few attacks.
        What is "metal hat"? 
            Prosthetic tool called Iron Fortress. Sold by an NPC near the Ashina Castle Old Grave warp (which is an area at the bottom of the castle, around the rear) 
        If you footstomp him you interupt the move so treat it like a sweep and your good
        If you lure snake eyes into the poison pit, the fight takes care of itself. 
        Snake Eyes get completely trivialized by double ichimonji, she doesnt even try to grab if you just deflect -> ichimonji double -> deflect etc.
        I actually didn't have trouble with Snake Eyes hitbox.  The problem I had was the area you fight her in.  She's backed up against a wall, and if you counter her grab with jump, you can't follow up with the second jump attack.  Instead, you perform a wall jump, making you jump way above her and getting out of sync with the fight.  She was usually in the middle of another combo or performing the grab attack again by the time I landed, usually insta-killing me.

And she's completely surrounded by walls.  It doesn't matter if you draw her out into the small open part in the middle, because she quickly gets pushed back up against a wall.
        Metal hat blocks all grabs i think
        Or you can just jump away.
        The hat seems to be designed with that entire area in mind. I turtle up and scuttle across the bridges at the Gun Fort to avoid all the sniper shots.
        For snake eyes, just jump back and jump back in. Easy as pie.
        I just deflected the grab
    I just cheesed snake eyes because fuck that noise, not dealing with that shit
        [removed]
            -Use a stealth candy


-Grapple to her location


-Backstab her


-Run the fuck away


-Grapple to the Buddha statue's hand that's near the bonfire, at the end of the room


-Wait for her ass to be fully poisoned



-Finish her off when she has 1 HP

                [removed]
                I did this without the stealth candy. Not too bad, just clear out the other 4 or 5 guys in the area. Her gun has a few seconds delay between attacks so if you can predict when to juke you can swerve between her shots and time the death blows on the others. Then just hide up on a hill and poke your head out every so often to keep her shooting while standing in the poison. 
                    Wait, what poison are we talking about? I didn't see any poison around the gunfort approach?
                        Nah, that's a different Snake Eyes (probs her sister). There's one more in Ashina Depths, near Poison Pool idol. 
                        For the one you’re talking about, there is a small cliff to the left when you first start that battle. If you stand on top of the cliff and get her to chase you then you jump off the cliff, she will follow you off and upon landing she opens herself up to 1 or 2 attacks. Walk back up to the top of the cliff and repeat 
            On the island in front of her is a lean-to structure with stairs/ramp on one side. Lure her up there and jump down towards the Buddha. Turn around and she'll be going ham on the air above your head. I used ichimonji to hit above me and just whittled down both her DBs. Pure fuckin cheese
            You can stealth without candy and basically attack her constantly and deflect her attack and Dodge her grab late. My mistake the first couple of times was because I dodged her grab early and she just turns and grabs.
            In case you need a guide for the other snake eyes in sunken Valley, I wrote a detailed guide[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sekiro/comments/b6siq2/how_to_easily_kill_snake_eyes_shirafuji/). 
            Another way is to backstab the gunner that is high on the rocks and take control of him through puppeteer. Stand behind him as he rains fire on snake eyes and be ready to backstab again when you lose control, rinse and repeat till snake eyes is low enough for you to give a death blow. 
            And it you want to cheese the first one, grapple to her, run past to the left, jump up and hug the wall, run out on the bridge, dodge the bullets and run right back, wait while hugging the wall until Snake-eyes de-aggro you. boom sneak-stab the cunt and enjoy the kill-screen after only having to deal with half her Hp!
            She (and the other snake eyes where there are NO poison pools) are cake with the poison sword prosthetic. Especially the upgraded one.
            I fought snake eyes in the hidden pools area and just got him into the poison and watch poison drain health, then went in for the one hit deathblow and ran away and repeated.
            No need to cheese. Two words: Double Ichimonji
            Get her on a ledge and you just stand a little below...worked for me!
            As well as the other guys explanation, Snake Eyes is vulnerable Ichimonji. Two attacks and an ichimonji will stagger snake eyes and they’ll jump back, dash forward attack twice and do another and it’ll loop.

This is how I killed both snake eyes.
            Another tip, stealth her after killing the enemies, then use an oil and stunlock her with fire.
            I was able to cheese the Ashina Depths Snake Eyes by getting her onto the roof of the hut and dropping down the side, then just staying there and doing jump attacks.
        Same let her suck on poison 
            That’s it...suck out all the poison. 
        You just jump away for the grab and get in  their face for everything else. The one near the Gun Fort was fucking me up until I was super aggressive and deflected everything. That grab sucks hard, but I was able to get down jumping away - it's the only perilous attack they have. They're severely disadvantaged against your quick sword strikes and deflection. The one in the Depths just sucks because they want to fight between that slope and wall.
        I just ran around until she did a charge shot rushed in got like 2 hits and repeated til she was super low
        the iron fortress prosthetic really helped for me!

&#x200B;
        Which one?
        I took no shame in cheesing that bitch because the game gives us almost no opportunity for cheese.
        I'll be honest that fight is really fucking cool when you actually get it right.  The grab is almost always the move but jumping backwards and running in for a hit works just as well.  And actually getting those fights perfectly is pretty sweet.
    Never mind snake eyes. The hit box on the snake is fucking disgusting. I don't need to watch replays to see that I was five feet away from the snakes body but I still get smashed.
        Right? It's not a case of timing or spacing - I just get teleported into her grab and shot to death. 
    Yep, fuck that bitch. She literally ruined my day yesterday with that hitbox bullshit. I'm literally high up in the air and she manages to grab me as if I'm standing right next to her. Fuck hitting through walls and fuck stupid camera too. Classic From Software bullshit pretty much. I mean, I love you guys, but this shit needs to be sorted out, it's been 10 years and 6 games but the problems persist. Or is it the part of the challenge? 
        But FromSoft also provides the polar opposite of what you're describing. It's the reason we're all in this thread.
            Yes, you're right, I just needed to vent my emotions that day. In my experience about 90% of the time hitbox detection is perfect, but that 10% can ruin your day especially in tense situations when you're on your last couple of HPs and near beating an enemy. FromSoft games are very fair with almost every death being due to lack of skill/attention, that's why dying to bad camera or collision/hitbox detection is infuriating. FromSoft games are the only ones that I ever rage-quitted in my life lol
        What's weird is that this wasn't an issue in Demon's souls. Weapons were almost too well modeled if memory serves, and you pretty much had to get a thrust weapon for navigating the stonefang tunnels, or your weapon would ricochet off the walls.
    Protip: jump away from the grab, don't doge. It works far better.
    i literally jump to the right on that sweep and it misses 100% of the time, even in a tight environment.

you've probably beaten her/them by now, but if anyone else hasn't, a directional jump is super effective.
    I got really good at dodging that attack. Just dash sideways and then backwards. Works everytime. Or double back. Double side may also work. You can't just dodge once though
the fucking >!guardian ape!< ... absolute hitbox gore on one of the grabs.
That shit is so annoying. He grabbed me when I was a good 3 yards to the left. It didn't make any sense.
I was really hoping they would fix that for this game. That and dog AI that suicides off cliffs and gets stuck. :(
Fuck the 2nd ogre. 
    There’s a SECOND ONE?!?!?!
        Nvm u can cheese that one
            It's still surprisingly difficult. I summed the first ogre destroying me up to just me being a beginner.

The second proved me wrong.
giant dude feeding giant carp has a pretty big grab hitbox also
I legit have a video of that damned chained ogre doing a near 180 with his grab attack. 
None of them did any bs attacks to me.
unless you fight a boss or mid-boss or maybe is just ps4 or just my gameplay i have 1gb of recorded hitbox bullshit.
Hello Guardian Ape.
Or the foot stomp of the Demon of Hatred
That Artorias Overhead the Owl does is ridiculous as well
Guardian Ape's lunging grab is so aggravating. You can be giving him a foot massage from behind and he will still grab you.
    That's his first phase, right? Weirdly enough I beat Guardian Ape last weekend, and the two Apes yesterday. Never got captured in his lunging grab. Phase 2 gave me a MUCH harder time.
ive noticed that grab attacks and long range thrust/dive attacks have the same issue that DS2 had where they would basically just track you no matter what you did, but not nearly as often.   Still,  fucks you though.
Oh good. I thought the game was just fucking me in particular.
more Jp...GIFs?
True. Those hitbox porn moments seem pretty rare. It happens a lot more often that the hitbox is a lot bigger than it seems (especially on grabs for example). 
    And the tracking of some enemies. OMG the tracking.

I need to stop pressing B/O lol. 
        The reason they added so much tracking is to force you to use deflect more. The intention is that you use dodge, jump and deflect in the appropiate situations and not rely on one defense for everything.

Its designed like rock paper scissors.
            I swear this game is almost harder for DS veterans because of the muscle memory you need to unlearn. 🤣
                Yeah but once you learn it, it's incredibly satisfying going toe to toe with a boss or miniboss, deflecting, countering, and punishing without stopping until the deathblow.
                    Block while jumping ability=godly
                        I must get this!
                        I feel like such a badass when I block mid-air
                            It’s even better when you deflect mid air, very satisfying. 
                                That's more or less what I meant! When I get a parry mid-air is what I should have said! Couldn't agree more though, my friend!
                        I tried blocking in mid air against physical attacks, and I was unable to actually use it effectively. I was doing so badly that I thought the mid air block was only for projectiles. 

Why would you jump and then block against physical attacks anyways?
                            wondering the same. wasnt even useful for gyoubu
                            When hit and running you can ninja jump tf out of there and block on your way out to protect your booty
                            The best spot is against demon of hatred when he jumps in the air.

Jump when hes about to land, if you are still too near, the shockwave will hit you so you block to deflect the airblast. If you are far enough, you can grapple back in.

Ita also good against genichiro with his jump stab mixup. If you predict a sweep and jump but he slashes instead, you cam still block to save yourself.

Lastly against projectiles when you jump towards musket and arrows.
                    Genichiro was so satisfying to fight, everything clicked like a boss or two before but it was this fight where it became a strategic fight with the multiple deflects combos and parry's. God damn best boss fight so far.
                        oh you are gonna love the end game
                        I wouldn't hesitate to say that Genichiro is up there with Ornstein/Smough or Lady Maria for how much I love fighting them. Amazing boss fight, and though he's hard as hell he really is fair and you can predict his moves/manipulate him at least to an extent. 

&#x200B;

This is what videogames should be. 
                        This fight felt like the most fair fight. Lol. So good.
                        Phase 2 was much easier imo^
                    My first post on this sub was me saying the game isn’t for me and I wanted a refund but couldn’t get one. I was stuck at the very first general but now I’m addicted to Samurai death matches. Beat the lance guy on the horse on my second try. Once you get into it everything around you disappears and when it goes right it’s a feeling no other game can give. I haven’t played another game since I started Sekiro and I never played any other soulsbourne. 
                        > the lance guy on the horse

HIS NAME IS GYOUBU MASATAKA ONIWA!
                            How could I forget. Sorry I’m still just a puppy. 
                                There’s a YouTube video on how to cheese her....I caved and and watched because it was looking pretty bleak, it’s funny how broken it is 
                                Do you remember what he says when he enters the battlefield? :P
                            AND THE CASTLE GATES WILL REMAIN CLOSED!
                            AS I BREATHE, YOU WILL NOT PASS THE CASTLE GATES!
                            Such a great introduction to the games first big boss.
                            Man that VA didn’t have to go so hard, he did that for us 
                        THAT... [points at this comment] That right there is why these games are so good. At first, you want to break something, it's so unfair. The regular enemies swarm you and stun lock you to death, you can't block or dodge like you want to, deflect "isn't working..." you grow to hate it, it's so frustrating.

But then you learn.

You start to clue into enemy patterns, reading the opportune moments to retaliate, you learn the area and how to sneak past or stealth kill, you get abilities to augment your arsenal and toughen up your character to last longer... suddenly, these "impossible" encounters become routine displays of shinobi badassery. That unarmed monk that smashed you before gets Ichimonji: Double smashed in the face, you vault over, deal a deathblow, use his blood for mist cover, and you're grappling back into the trees before the others have even noticed... you get better. And for all that practice, you start to feel better about your gameplay and you savor those victories. Winning isn't just a matter of course, it's a badge of honor, and you earned it.

This is why, when people holler about an "easy" mode for these games, I have to laugh. If you truly think the soulsborne games need an easy mode, you aren't ready to play them. 
                            > If you truly think the soulsborne games need an easy mode, you aren't ready to play them.

My sentiment exactly. They're designed to be precise, challenging systems and they are exactly what they're supposed to be. 
                            “Easy Mode” is default on your first play through, that’s all you get folks. The only way it gets easier is if you figure it out. 
                        After you find Kuro at the beginning of the game there's a miniboss right through the gate (where ashina reservoir idol is later in the game). This guy killed me probably 20+ times before I stopped trying to dodge and hit him and instead started reacting to his moves and deflecting. Once I decided to do that he went down instantly. However it wasn't until Gyoubu that I really felt like I was "getting" it. Many people go for Butterfly as their first boss, but I don't think she is supposed to be. Gyoubu is designed perfectly to teach you how to play at that point. He has powerful attacks that can kill you in 1-2 hits but they are all very clearly telegraphed, don't have any weird irregular timing and are easily punishable if deflected. This made me kill him on the first attempt and I finally got the feeling I was doing things right.   
If I had gone for lady Butterfly first things might have been different. 
                            I did Butterfly first. It changed the game for me. Until then I had MASSIVE trouble with the game. But that fight taught me how important knowing what defense ability to use, specifically to not be afraid of blocking. Also that fight was awesome. I felt real dumb cause I didn’t know the difference between mini-boss and real boss until then. I’ve played all Soulsbourne games and I walked in that room and was like “oh right.. bosses have cutscenes.” 

I refused to leave until I killed her, so the next boss I found was super easy. The game is still hard to me, but I fucking love it. It’s one of my absolute favorite games of all time now. Every time I’m like “I’m a master of this” I walk into something new. 

Pro tip: Save Divine Confetti and don’t use it on the optional guys, until you unlock the merchant that sells an infinite amount. 
                                Keep hearing this and she will fall today.
                                I died to her hellas probably 20+ times because I was still too much in dark souls mode. My kill attempt I did everything perfect dont think I even got hit once and interrupted every leap with a shuriken. My GF was watching me and was like "woah, that was badass" and had some second hand excitement for me since she watched me eat shit over and over to her. 
                                Where is the merchant that sells infinite amount? I cannot even come close to competing with Headless and everywhere I've read has told me Divine Confetti is required to beat him. (Only boss I've attempted and gave up on, even LadyButterfly I kept at after fifty or more deaths) 
                            I dont understand how butterfly could be the first boss for someone. Wouldn't you have to at least fight the drunkard first?
                                Real boss, drunkard is a mini boss
                            Butterfly isn’t meant as first boss LOL, she’s waaay too difficult but I forced myself through anyway
                                I found her pretty easy once I realized the game was very serious about the dodge counter, if you dodge past her and attack she does not counter that and it does health damage, making her  much more manageable. 
                                She’s actually really slow with huge openings. But hey. Different strikes for different folks. 
                    Just fought Genichiro. Basically the only way to fight him....if you play defensively, he will royally fuck you. repeatedly.
                        For him, and the Snake Eyes sisters, you can win by attacking until they try to strike back, deflect, then attacking again. FORCE them to do moves you know are coming and can deflect with ease. When you control what they do, you control the battle. For additional breaking power, chomp an Ako's Sugar (red candy) before that. They might do something unexpected or go for a perilous attack, so just react to that, readjust, and resume. You'll find that once you master deflection, a lot of fights become much easier.
                    I really gotta say, for as much crap as she gets, Lady Butterfly is like the *perfect* boss for this stuff. Attacking rapidly and then deflecting like three times after feels so goddamn epic lol.
                        I think Genichiro is a better example actually. Butterfly has some god awful reaction times (hyper quick, obscenely wide hitboxes, far too much vitality). Honestly, I don't think she's a good fight at all, especially for how early you're able to face her, she's just a commonly talked about boss because of how many players get stonewalled on her (and a lot of those only beat her through cheese and then try to say what a great boss she is!).

She gave me more trouble than the final boss on my first playthrough, and while some of that is due to better learning the systems and improving at the game, I still maintain that she's just not a very well made encounter.
                    Yeah last night I was up in lady butterfly’s face like “bitch ima mother fucking shinobi, fuck with meeeeee!!!!!” Then I died.
                    Dude. When you get to like 1/4 health after resurrect and you get that high-posture enemy's bar to start turning orange and that switch turns on to start blitzing them is so satisfying. The way the tide turns in mini-boss fights is different from the other fromsoft games. It's not simply chipping away at health or exploiting mid-fight AI/waiting for an opening like the other games, it's actually feeling like you have to get an enemy on their heels. Because of the way the combat is, a lot of fights feel like you make it out alive by the skin of your teeth. 
                It absolutely does deliberately and intentionally punish trying to play it like Dark Souls, which has been hilarious while trying to learn the game.
                I always play any souls game only using some weapon with both hands. Learned to never use block or parry(i suck at parrying in souls games) because they was not as reliable as just rolling away. I dont need to say sekiro is being harder to me than when I tried darksouls for the first time but i'll get there.
                    I’m keen to go back to DS and do a dex build with no shield. 
                        The best kind of build for any souls game, this and quality build. Quality with red iron twin blade in ds2 was insane
                It really is. I still want to roll INTO every fucking swing. So, everyone I know is ravaged by dragon rot. 
                    Same. I caught on with the perfect blocking, but those enemies with high posture you're supposed to wear down by dodging and countering, I get wrecked trying to time like DS. 
                I got bloodborne and couldn’t get past the first few stages. It was just too difficult for me and I decided I’d play it later. I lost the game and I did sigh in relief. Now my fingers are twitching to buy this game so bad. I’ve been reading how this is harder than the DS and BB games too. Pretty sure I might impulse buy this later this week. 
                    I'm in the same boat as you in bloodborne but have gotten a decent way through this game.

Bloodborne just felt too slow for me, so if that was the reason for you than get this game cause it fixes that.
                Yeah exactly. My instinct is to roll and dodge, not block so much. I had to retrain my brain to adjust and it took hours. Now if I go back to play Souls or Bloodborne, I’m fucked. 
                This. This is totally my experience!
                You are entirely, 100% correct. And I love it! I love that it's so similar but so unique at the same time, bringing the same design mentality of Dark souls with a whole new combat system. 

&#x200B;

I am loving this game a LOT more than I thought I would. 
                Definitely.  I feel like they did sime stuff JUST to fuck with the vets: Like B/O being a forward lunge instead of a backstep.
                Absolutely agree, played every Souls game religiously and this one gave me a run for my money this first week, but now that I’ve finally learnt the combat it’s so much more fun. Thanks, Lady Butterfly! 
                Can confirm. This games beating my ass and I can’t break out of old habits. 
                Until you get to a later boss and the game forces you to abandon everything you learn and fight it DS/BB style. Fun boss, good lore, but it seemed like a slap in the face.
                I went into the game not treating it like a new game rather than a Souls game, so it was actually super easy for me to come to grips with the combat. Game’s still tough as nails though.
                Just rebind block to B lol
            The problem is that they then add some unblockable moves with the same tracking so its not immediately obvious how to avoid the attack (Ogre and Demon of Hatred)
            But I like rock, paper, scissors, dodge. (jokes)

Although, you do have to admit the tracking can get a bit redic in some situations, to the point it even makes the enemy animations look strange. (not a big deal though, since soulsborne has always had little things like clipping, totally worth it)
                Yeah it happens mostly for grabs.

I think this might be intentional because almost every grab attack in the Soulsbourne games has had wierd hitboxes. Maybe its because they want the dodge window to be tight and sacrifice the animation for a tighter hitbox. IDK but it seems unlikely that the are capable of making good hitboxes but fail to do it on literally every grab attack.

I mean Dancers terrible telegrab was never patched out or anything ....

                The only viable response to thrusts is the mikiri counter.
                    Can't even jump over them it's bs but really drives the point home.
                        No it drives the point up your ass.
                    Deflect works, too. But Mikiri does more poise damage.
                dodge into thrust attacks not sideways 
                Mikiri Counter and deflect (but mostly Mikiri) are pretty much the only reliable ways to not take damage from a thrust. Unless you can get out of range entirely before he shish-kebabs you.
                Mikri dodge. Once you get it you can practice it on the training dummy guy. Dodge into thrust attacks and you step on their weapon. It's one of the first ones in 2nd skill tree. If your talking about the guy with the big ass lance or w.e that hangs out in the building you initially find kuro in, he hits pretty fuckin hard.
                >shaft of his spear 

*lenny face* 

You don’t have Mikiri Counter?

                The fucking red eyed giant.........................

So much salt.
                >when I try to dodge instead of deflecting

>doing wrong stuff on reflexes

>enemies shouldn't hit me

>enemies shouldn't deal full damage

[You must know how that sounds like, right?](https://pics.me.me/git-gud-28126051.png). 

You clearly know how to fix your problems, you're just complaining it doesn't work the way you want it to. The way Souls used to. Adapt


            It sounds like a good decision, but the tracking really psyches me out. I've learned since the early hours that the deflection play is not always the solution, and you have to play a bit more aggressively. Saw one guy take out Genichiro with an absurd amount of dodging, for example. Yet I always feel discouraged from trying it on anything but a few moves because of the tracking. 
            Can’t deflect a grab 
        fucking snake eyes grab is the biggest bullshit. I swear she spins around like a beyblade and only need 1 pixel to hit you and you are gonna get executed.
            Make sure to jump backwards, not dodge.. gamechanger once I started doing that with Snake Eyes.
                Yea I've killed her already. Amount of times, I got grabbed though. 
                    I just let her die of poison 
                        Nice to see a fellow professional around here. It may have taken 15 minutes and 4-6 shuriken but I showed her who's boss.
                        I've cheesed stuff in other souls games. Determined to beat everybody without obvious cheese. 
                    Same. Was stuck for several hours on that bastard. Finally figured out to play super aggressively and everything worked out.
            I haven't been able to try it yet but I read somewhere that you can actually deflect the pull back of her grab making this a lot easier. Will have to try that in NG+. 
                I think aslong as it's not their hand grabbing you, you can parry some grabs with a perfect parry. Atleast the grabs that involves impalement. For all I know you can parry hands to but I have yet to try that 
            I thought I had jumping it down, basically you jump over it and then head bop her. It would keep you above the hit box and keep you nice and close to keep wailing on her.

Unfortunately, the timing was just too tight and I would sometimes teleport into it if I jumped too late.

But, I'm not really mad about it. Jump away works basically everytime. Then I just speared her right back into my face and started slashing.
            I find it weird the grab is the move everyone is complaining about. For me. I couldn't wait for her to do her grab because it was the easiest to avoid and go in for two hits.
        Same lol. 
        >!snake eyes reporting in!<
        It’s this. It’s not the hit boxes themselves but the tracking. The hit-boxes are exceptionally tight. The tracking is the part that gets you.


        No joke but if you're in that situation, jump on their heads. I have found that jumping on a opponents head has put me into safety more times than not. On top of that, it can lower their posture a lot if they are lunging and thrusting, it counts like a counter. 
        the tracking works against the enemies, you are supposed to deflect and the tracking makes sure they keep hitting you and you can keep deflecting. 
        This!!! It’s basically “fuck your dodge!”
        It took me an hour to beat the first real mini boss because I kept dodging non-stop.
        try swapping deflect with dodge in the keybinds - as a DS guy this changed everything for me
        The Shinobi combo where they follow up with that lock-on kick comes to mind. The Pose he takes tells me "Block", but for some reason the Symbol makes me want to Circle-step out of there.

I really, really need to start my Subimaru combo right there when he takes the pose so I don't get my soul kicked out of my body lmao
        Dodge grab attacks, jump/kick sweeps, Dodge towards thrusts (mikiri counter), deflect the rest
        I had to mentally train myself to stop dashing with the shadow swordsman because his kick has tracking. 
        The tracking is fine on everything except the grabs, because even when you react appropriately and dodge they’ll still rotate to get you and suck you in with the huge bullshit hitbox.
    Grabs are actually the the least tracking attacks, most can be evaded with a single side dodge. But some do have extra bullshit hitbox, like the rifle snakeeye girl
        Or the frost chain ogre. His hands are like magnets or some shit. He's like the first boss, barely.  


Related note, I just beat him and backed up my save and both saves are fucked. I think I just quit the game. Spent like 15 hours grinding gear and maxing skills and FUCK.
            Why are you messing with the saves? 
                Well, I read that PC version is somehow corrupting saves, so I wanted to prevent that.

Copied entire folder and pasted, game loads and I'm back to square one.

Tried contents from copied folder, same.

So. I'm probably gonna rethink how I spend my time. That was a lot of stress.
                    There's a script that you can use to backup the game. I use it every time I rest at an idol or beat a boss. 
    I think that's purely psychological.

You're more likely to believe that someone cut you with a blade, even when it only grazes you slightly. But if you dodge someone who tries to grab you, and they only gently caress your ass, you'll call BS.

Good example is the red eye ogre in the beginning. He tries to grab you with both hands, but if he only touches you with the back of one of his hands, you kind of teleport in there. If he did the same movement with two swords, you'd think that you definitely just got stabbed.


    
I'm pretty sure the hitboxes/iframes actually differ depending on whether you block, dodge, or jump. There are attacks where you can visually dodge them and still get hit, but if you jump the attack can visually clip through you and yet not hit. 
        Yea, the Corrupted Monk's upward slash would hit me alot if I was too close even if I blocked
    Seriously.  Grabs are ridiculous.  I keep ash ready for them,  doesn't work on everything though.  But man..... hate grabs
        If you've unlocked the umbrella you can use that to block grabs. But yeah, some of those hitboxes are ridiculous. 
             Didn't think it would block grabs, good to know thanks. 
    I once got killed by seven spear stabbing the air about 30 cm to the right of me.

I probably dodged too late (or should've just mikiri'd instead), but it was still slightly annoying.
    Looking at you, ogre. Piece of shit. Was so satisfying to beat though
    I just met the shotgun miniboss and it feels like dodging the hook attack is impossible
        I know, feels super random. Jumping worked best for me. Also, use poison blades. 
    But you can get those moments while fighting lady butterfly
It's the grabs that annoy me, it looks like i should be in the clear but it vacuums me back in and get caught anyway. Mostly with the ape boss jump belly flop grab.
    Jesus Christ the rest of that fight was absolutely perfect EXCEPT for the jump grab roll bullshit
    I had to run backwards to dodge that
Whenever you fight* them. You say him versus you, but verse is not a verb form of versus. 
I swear chained ogre would grab me from a mile away.....
    Totally. I’d be standing by his left hip or ankle and GRAB! Never been so mad. 
Is your settings on elephant?
Now I want this on loop. 
    The gif is already on loop. What do you mean?

        It's just a video for me. 
            Put it on loop.
From Software makes the best hit box porn
...is he still a thing? Honestly I felt like he's sorta been replaced by the other YouTube channels.  Good for him if he's still making content but he never shows up in my feed anymore.  Vati mantis and the likes do
    Ye but he is doing an old school walkthrough of sekiro atm on youtube, in the style of his old from the dark series
        his dark souls 2 walkthrough/lore summary was great. dunno if he good that for ds1, I followed him when the game first came out but then not so much.
            Yeah I felt like shortly after 2i just never saw him anymore
                It's YouTube, not a fashion show... it shows you what you want to see dude.

His Sekiro play though is the best out there hands down.
            Agreed the one for ds2 is the best imo but I probably think that because I'm a heretic who thinks thats the best souls gamr
    Hes mainly on twitch nowadays
    [deleted]
        Oh cool.  Glad he's able to put family first.  I have to work 60hours a week almost,  I barely game anymore but enjoy family time or sleep.  
    ENB's Bloodborne walkthrough was amazing. He was full of knowledge, not just item locations and fight mechanics, but the lore and story, he made the game better for me in a way. Think he had worked on the official guide, like the hardcopy. 

&#x200B;

I watch cowboy now though. 
    Of course! Nothing beats ENB's souls playthroughs 
    He started making YouTube content again just this past week for Sekiro. Similar style as his From The Dark series, but not to the same level at the moment since he's working on finding the lore still. As mentioned by u/Highflyer108, Marcus is on Twitch now.
        Yeah I have no twitch time.  I barely even game but I'd rather game then watch
    If you just watch a video or two of him they will start popping up again. It's more to do with YouTube's algorithm than anything. Like I like to watch a lot of Rust content so my recommended usually has the new rust videos when I go on but I didn't watch any for a few days and they just stopped showing up until I started watching again.
I haven't watched vaatis channel in a while so his recent video didn't show up for me when they always used to show up when I watched him more regularly.
        Oh.  My YouTube is a wreck.  I have toddlers.... it has no idea if that's how that works
    Marcus is great if you want a deep dive into the lore and if you really want to savor the game and level design, but I found that can be a detriment if you just want a quick 100% walkthrough.

That said, I love Marcus and his enthusiasm for FromSoft games is infectious.
Reading things like this is why I'm skeptical about getting into this game. Stuff like that makes me rage quit so fast. 
    Eh, it's rare when it happens, but it's no less frustrating since it takes a bit to wind it up, and having it just glitch through for no damage, getting hit by the enemy is just salt in the wound.

But the game is still great regardless, though I do personally keep a stress ball nearby at all times.
    Its quite rare when that happens, I'd 100% suggest getting this game. It doesn't even feel like a game to me, it otherworldly. The universe they built this in is so deep and so well fleshed out I feel more like I'm having a religious experience.
    If you rage quit easily (no shame in that) then it probably isn’t the game for you. The only way you can really complete the game is to train your brain to see every death as “I learned something about that enemy” otherwise you simply will not have fun.
        I have a question about the xp loss upon death. Say I get to a hard part and  I die very many times. Does than mean I'll potentially lose the ability to reach max level? 
            Nah you can grind for levels at an easy spot. Once you get a skill you don’t lose it. Just grind somewhere and spend levels as you get them
    Incredible game I wouldn't avoid it because of that
    Honestly if that kind of thing makes you rage, then yeah, you might be better off not getting into it.  It's a good game, but if I didn't have the attachment I have to the Soulborne games, I probably would have just given up on this shit a long time ago.  There are quite a lot of bullshit moments, especially grab attacks are broken as fuck across the board, and the dodge windows are ridiculously small, way smaller than in their other games.  
    For me it's the absurd tracking on a lot of attacks that makes some fights feel cheap/cheesy.  Which was put there by the devs to force you to deflect (and as a nice f.u. to DS vets).    
  

On the bright side, if you've not already gotten into the DS mentality of dodging everything you might feel right at home. A large majority of attacks are deflectable, even when you might not think they are (IE the big brute lookin guys with the large hammer/mace).
Ye
with less quality or frames
Oh The sweet feeling of breaking someones posture as you head stomp them, just to fall with the takedown. Only close competitor is when you do it with a mikiri counter and just stab them clean
    Yeah getting an aerial takedown on a sweeping enemy is pure gold. 
I love that move and that sounds beautiful to me
    Definitely outclassed by a jump and headstomp, but it's so damned stylish

        I agree but sometimes they're crafty with the up slash. 
It's my favorite move so far. Great for getting back up in their faces after jumping away from a perilous attack.
I did not know you could Nightjar sweeps
not rly, many enemies can hit you hard while u are standing AT THEIR BACK, and they are landing a FORWARD attack in front of them. the finaly boss does it, the  Orge's leg kick does it, and so many others :S
    I'm comparing it to dark souls which has horrible hitboxes by comparison.
        which one tho? third game was quite okay, i didnt see SO huge bullshit hits which i see in sekiro. 100+ hrs
I don't think this move has iframes. And even if it did, this still looks amazing. 
    Can confirm none of the combat arts have iframes. Some have hyper armour but there was no hit marker here to indicate that. 
    I agree, it's really awesome. Just the animation alone and the fluidity is super impressive. I watched it like twenty times. 
It is.
Her sweep? I have done that once or twice, it looks so awesome, like straight out of a martial arts movie. You start the whirlwind slash and with the right timing it just makes you jump over her kunai.

The best part is that it’s clear as day where and how you mess up, so you can correct it faster and identify patterns better.
I did notice that thrust attacks seem to have a larger area of effect around the physical sword, however the Mikiri counter is also very generous so it kind of balances out.
    Mikiri is superb, yeah :)
    The thrust seems like it’s kind of “auto aimed” like if you roll to the side the spear or sword follows you. I ended up getting tired of it and just perfecting the circle move where I stomp on their weapon. Totally worth. So satisfying too.
    
I can never do it so I just jump away and definitely didn't get the skill upgrade lol.
        You have to press B/Circle and not in any direction - I take my thumb off the stick when I see kanji. Don't do it as soon as you see the kanji, but like half a second after. One. two. Count it out, and on two press B. Eventually you'll do it on reflex. 

Goomba stomps on sweeps work the same, but you have to jump jump - one. two. three. with two and three being jumps. Grabs I jump away from because side stepping is less forgiving, but side step counter slash is how you *should* deal with those.
            This needs to be a thread. Best advice for the counters and each time I've heard all time. 

You actually stated it as rhythm. Agreed on jump away. 
                I'm not great at this game yet, but I played a lot of Souls and Monster Hunter. Most of the time people react too fast when they're doing poorly rather than too slow. These games have beats to them, and the attacks have a rhythm. It helps me to practice on a boss first with sloppy blocking, and then counting out those hits and finding the spaces. These bosses have patterns, and I find the way they string them together really intricate and beautiful for game design. I'm usually too impressed to get frustrated, and I know when I figure it out I'll be that much better. This game is sooo fucking good at teaching you, and swordfighting is such a violent, satisfying ballet.
            In my experience you can press forward too and it still works, because pressing B does the same thing as pressing forward B

    I mean he's pretty clearly out of the way by the time the sparks show up so I can see why it would seem unfair.   
But it doesn't really have anything to do with bad hitboxes, this is clearly an intentional design choice forcing you to use the correct counter/timing. He maybe still could have dodged that sideways with correct timing but the dodge started way before the actual attack so it doesn't count.    

If it wasn't designed like this you could just dodge spam everything and the entire combat system would break down, so it's a compromise having slightly less realistic hitboxes on perilous attacks in exchange for a more fun system of counters. 
        Sparks showing up 2 frames later than this hit occuring doesn't mean the hit wasn't registered on the two frames in which the sword is inside the players back knee. Why there is a delay to them I don't know, perhaps it waits on all hits to the character to show the hit sparks.
Either way it can't seem unfair when 1) he got hit 2) he failed to use the right ability against a thrust attack.

The fact he took the trouble to check it in slow motion (and missed it clips his knee?), take time to edit and upload a clip and blame hitboxes instead of just recognizing he didn't mikiri counter or deflect the thrust is what I take from his post.
            I can only give a general reply, but games don't usually do everything on every update. Hit detection is probably high priority here, but maybe the consequences happen on the next update to allow a late deflect response. Similar to how many platformers let you still jump for a frame or so, when you already completely ran off the edge.
I know nothing about this but the sword clearly goes thru your knee. That's got to hurt.
    Trouble not in the sword goes thru knee, trouble that animation of damage starts only after 2 frames.  

It sucks :)
This!!!!
Absolver (the game) has the most cinematic combat.  Check it out!
I’m a DS vet as well, and am having to adapt too. I’ve found that it’s more of a dance like fighting style. I always go by “attack until you’re deflected, deflect until you can attack”. It works for a good amount of enemies. 
    that sounds like great advice
        Anything to try and help man. :)
        Be *very* aggressive. Generally you want to open fights with shuriken+dash or a sprint attack and keep attacking until you’re deflected, you’ll notice because the spark from the blades will be a different color and the sound will be louder, then deflect until an opening to attack again. Thrusts can be deflected (deflected meaning parried, just holding L1 to block is not the same as deflecting) but generally you want to use one of your skills to counter it, sweeps need to be jumped over, and grabs you can technically dodge away from but I just sprint away because the hit boxes on grabs are overtuned. 

For boss fights you need to control the fight. In Souls you wait for the boss to finish its chain and get some hits in, but letting the boss control the pacing of the fight in Sekiro will get you killed. Being in the bosses face forcing them to deflect allows you to manipulate their move sets the same way that proper spacing does in Souls and BB, so it’s generally your best bet. The dodge works like it does in Nioh where it’s a tool to get out of enemy range not something to iframe through attacks, so break those old habits early. 
            >but letting the boss control the pacing of the fight in Sekiro will get you killed

Actually this is a cheese strat that work for basically every enemies, it's slower than just killing through poise but you can bait out every attack the same attack over and over 
            Man I’m trying to break the habits, but damn it’s hard. 
Fuck corrupted monk.
You right but it's moments like these that make it all worth it.
There are different types of grabs as well. The guardian ape lunge, you jump over. It makes sense, he's lunging for your legs. The genichiro grab, you back off since hes grabbing you with his hands. The snake eyes grab, you dodge to the side since shes pulling you with a hook. Many grabs you can jump over but you have to do it early so their tracking breaks when you get behind them.
You dont want tp jump over spears or long range weapons of you can help it since they can poke you out of the air. React to your opponent. Not every grab is equal.
    Noted, I hadn't thought of this, thank you
The mortar is a different story though. That Artillery fire.
I don't really think the game requires great reflexes.  I say that, because I absolutely do not have them.  What it does require, is to be able to play the game by it's rules, not the way that might work in other games.  There's some subtle differences that will cause you to get destroyed in Sekiro if you don't realize them.

&#x200B;

\#1, dodging isn't that great in sekiro.

&#x200B;

\#2, spamming attack is terrible in sekiro, as the way the queuing system works, it will lock you into attacking when you should be blocking/deflecting.

&#x200B;

\#3, blocking \*speeds up your poise regen, it does not hinder it\*  This is completely alien to soulsborne players, who let's face it....make up a huge percentage of sekiro's fanbase.  We are so used to never blocking because we want to be able to parry, and because rolling/dodging was better in those games.

&#x200B;

\#4, jumping/jump attacking doesn't make sense at first as being a good strategy, but it completely wrecks so many different enemies, such as lord of seven ashinas.

&#x200B;

\#5 Damn it feels good to be a ninja
Very late reply but how did you get the empowered version? I only have mortal draw
    You have to finish basically the whole mushin skill tree, then you’ll get empowered mortal draw, it’s the bottom right one, idk why but I wasn’t able to unlock the middle right one
The name of this game is Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.
    Thanks! I already have it. This game must be sick! Thanks for commenter
He did the cross slash, L1 + R1
Hit boxes seem fine. A couple of grabs are dodgy, but overall I haven't gotten screwed by a hit box. Like, I've never wondered how something hit me. How the attack FOLLOWED me is another story. The tracking on everything is absolutely ridiculous.
    I've noticed several times that so many frames of the animatiin follow you, discouraging early dodges and deflects. This is true of projectiles as well. They will follow you until they are closer and then continue on a predefined path. If you can remain calm this is no issue, but if you panic and make a move too early, it is just as bad or worse than not making a move at all.
It has been the complete opposite in my experience.
Overwhelm them with attacks and deflect when needed so their posture bar get filled quickly. Also go for the back stab if possible.
Sekiro: shadows die twice. Ton of fun
    Thank you very much.
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
    Thanks👍
Harder for the new player. Once you "get" it, it's easier.
On average I expect people to take more time to beat the game but replays and speed runs would be faster
Ok?
    The hitreg in that game is terrible. Hit boxes are nearly as bad.
He ducked under the swing by doing an attack
    Wow lol.NOICE!
😆

A lot of people seem to have trouble with Snake Eyes' grab.

One trick I learned was that the metal hat blocks it. If I hesitated dodging, I'd just pull out the hat. 
    I found that out too. All the bosses have something that you can use to make the fight a little easier. 

For the Bull, you can jump over most of his charges and slash at him in mid air.

Lady butterfly you can knock out of the air with the shuriken.

Corrupted Monk you can use Divine Confetti to increase damage. 
        Corrupted Monk you can also use snap seeds on. They absolutely fuck her up.
            [deleted]
                Here's something I'm not sure if others found for that encounter: If you grapple as fast as possible to the furthest, highest branch when entering the fight, if you jump over her immediately there's a small window to deathblow her first phase. Immediately grapple back up, deathblow her second phase because she always goes into the illusion thing. Its 100% consistent if you're fast enough, and makes it so you only ever have to fight her third phase.
                    I tried to do this so many times I ended up spending more time trying to make the fight easier than I would have just fighting her normally.
                Yeah just get in close, use it, stun and a good chunk of damage. Divine confetti works well too.
        Yea when I started to realize this it reminded me of megaman lol getting different arm attachments in order use their weakness against them.
            I think that's where the replay value will come from in this game. The order you do things will change the experince.
        For the bull, I was runnin’ around him like a bull in a china shop.
        Or you can skip phase 2 by doing an air deathblow.
        What about Genichiro? I’ve been stuck for 4 days
            Third phase, in the air when he uses lightening. Jump and slice it. It hits him back and takes about 1/4 to 1/5 of his health.

First and second phase, always circle around counter clockwise, and dodge to the right.  Mikuri counter to quickly so the first phase. During the second phase he tends to do sweeping attacks more so just jump on his head when you see him extend his blade to the side before he becomes a beyblade.

Most of all?

Make your own playstyle. The game is made to where you can craft what's easiest for you. Use what fangs you have wolf and look at your skills you've learned along the way.
                I finally fucking beat him. I’ve been stuck on it for so long when I beat him I almost threw up
        poo tosser can be speared with double rt/r2 to pull the centipede out for massive damage during second phase
        to be honest the bull isnt that hard if you have patience. You can literally run in circles around the arena and sneak in a hit or parry here or there. really if you have the patience you can run around, hit him in the back, run away adn keep doing it until he dies.

the key with this game is most of the time sprinting and jumping are more effective at dodging. you only really want to hit the dodge button if your going to counter or do a quick sidestep. if your trying to backstep with dodge most of the time your gonna get hit anyway because you dont move far/fast enough. and sometimes since the hitboxes are great you can leap over the attack anyway.  


nearly every time i die its because i virtually never use dodge and i need to for mikiri counter suddenly and miss a grand opportunity, or hit dodge by accident intending to leap away.
        For the bulls you can just stay behind, close to the back legs and he cant hit you. Just dodge the charge attack when he starts doing it and stay on his ass wacking him for easy cheese
        Skakskdxjkskskdskskekskaoaaslsl omg you can hit her with shuriken? I equipped it on my 11th attempt but when I got inside I just said "yeah that's not going to work anyway" and continued getting murdered.
    I found out you can actually block this grab, you just got to wait until the hook part comes up behind you and as she pull it back, deflect it.  Holy shit did this make a difference.
        So it's a weapon attack and not a grapple, makes sense you can deflect it.
            yeh, I see that it's definitely just a weapon attack now, since most unblockable grabs in this game are through hands or legs (Lady Butterfly).
        HMMMMMM. See, the hat blocks that hook part with sparks, so I never thought about deflecting it. I just assumed all grabs were unblockable and undeflectable.

But if that grab is deflectable, are others?

HMMMMM
            That's what I'm thinking, I'm guessing no because it's a semi grab and slash because it's not their hands that are grabbing you which are 100% unblockable.
    I just panic jumped backwards and it worked
    I found that just jumping backwards avoids it 99% of the time. 
    Very solid advice. I didn't have issues jumping away, because sidestepping timing was not working out for me consistently. The hat would trivialize the mini bosses - attacking and deflecting their attacks isn't difficult by the time you fight them imo.
    Sabimaru also works wonders against any of the snake eyes bosses. They're super weak against poison apparently.
        They set on fire really easily too. I guess it's the gunpowder.

All the Gun Fort-type gunmen burn in one hit, while the snake-eyes duo take 2 flame hits to burn without oil.
    I thought it was a swipe, so jumped on her. That allways works for me.
        She can pull you out of the air
    For the grab I eventually found that dodging into her to the right always worked and created time to pop in a few attacks.
    What is "metal hat"? 
        Prosthetic tool called Iron Fortress. Sold by an NPC near the Ashina Castle Old Grave warp (which is an area at the bottom of the castle, around the rear) 
    If you footstomp him you interupt the move so treat it like a sweep and your good
    If you lure snake eyes into the poison pit, the fight takes care of itself. 
    Snake Eyes get completely trivialized by double ichimonji, she doesnt even try to grab if you just deflect -> ichimonji double -> deflect etc.
    I actually didn't have trouble with Snake Eyes hitbox.  The problem I had was the area you fight her in.  She's backed up against a wall, and if you counter her grab with jump, you can't follow up with the second jump attack.  Instead, you perform a wall jump, making you jump way above her and getting out of sync with the fight.  She was usually in the middle of another combo or performing the grab attack again by the time I landed, usually insta-killing me.

And she's completely surrounded by walls.  It doesn't matter if you draw her out into the small open part in the middle, because she quickly gets pushed back up against a wall.
    Metal hat blocks all grabs i think
    Or you can just jump away.
    The hat seems to be designed with that entire area in mind. I turtle up and scuttle across the bridges at the Gun Fort to avoid all the sniper shots.
    For snake eyes, just jump back and jump back in. Easy as pie.
    I just deflected the grab
I just cheesed snake eyes because fuck that noise, not dealing with that shit

        -Use a stealth candy


-Grapple to her location


-Backstab her


-Run the fuck away


-Grapple to the Buddha statue's hand that's near the bonfire, at the end of the room


-Wait for her ass to be fully poisoned



-Finish her off when she has 1 HP

            [removed]
            I did this without the stealth candy. Not too bad, just clear out the other 4 or 5 guys in the area. Her gun has a few seconds delay between attacks so if you can predict when to juke you can swerve between her shots and time the death blows on the others. Then just hide up on a hill and poke your head out every so often to keep her shooting while standing in the poison. 
                Wait, what poison are we talking about? I didn't see any poison around the gunfort approach?
                    Nah, that's a different Snake Eyes (probs her sister). There's one more in Ashina Depths, near Poison Pool idol. 
                    For the one you’re talking about, there is a small cliff to the left when you first start that battle. If you stand on top of the cliff and get her to chase you then you jump off the cliff, she will follow you off and upon landing she opens herself up to 1 or 2 attacks. Walk back up to the top of the cliff and repeat 
        On the island in front of her is a lean-to structure with stairs/ramp on one side. Lure her up there and jump down towards the Buddha. Turn around and she'll be going ham on the air above your head. I used ichimonji to hit above me and just whittled down both her DBs. Pure fuckin cheese
        You can stealth without candy and basically attack her constantly and deflect her attack and Dodge her grab late. My mistake the first couple of times was because I dodged her grab early and she just turns and grabs.
        In case you need a guide for the other snake eyes in sunken Valley, I wrote a detailed guide[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sekiro/comments/b6siq2/how_to_easily_kill_snake_eyes_shirafuji/). 
        Another way is to backstab the gunner that is high on the rocks and take control of him through puppeteer. Stand behind him as he rains fire on snake eyes and be ready to backstab again when you lose control, rinse and repeat till snake eyes is low enough for you to give a death blow. 
        And it you want to cheese the first one, grapple to her, run past to the left, jump up and hug the wall, run out on the bridge, dodge the bullets and run right back, wait while hugging the wall until Snake-eyes de-aggro you. boom sneak-stab the cunt and enjoy the kill-screen after only having to deal with half her Hp!
        She (and the other snake eyes where there are NO poison pools) are cake with the poison sword prosthetic. Especially the upgraded one.
        I fought snake eyes in the hidden pools area and just got him into the poison and watch poison drain health, then went in for the one hit deathblow and ran away and repeated.
        No need to cheese. Two words: Double Ichimonji
        Get her on a ledge and you just stand a little below...worked for me!
        As well as the other guys explanation, Snake Eyes is vulnerable Ichimonji. Two attacks and an ichimonji will stagger snake eyes and they’ll jump back, dash forward attack twice and do another and it’ll loop.

This is how I killed both snake eyes.
        Another tip, stealth her after killing the enemies, then use an oil and stunlock her with fire.
        I was able to cheese the Ashina Depths Snake Eyes by getting her onto the roof of the hut and dropping down the side, then just staying there and doing jump attacks.
    Same let her suck on poison 
        That’s it...suck out all the poison. 
    You just jump away for the grab and get in  their face for everything else. The one near the Gun Fort was fucking me up until I was super aggressive and deflected everything. That grab sucks hard, but I was able to get down jumping away - it's the only perilous attack they have. They're severely disadvantaged against your quick sword strikes and deflection. The one in the Depths just sucks because they want to fight between that slope and wall.
    I just ran around until she did a charge shot rushed in got like 2 hits and repeated til she was super low
    the iron fortress prosthetic really helped for me!

&#x200B;
    Which one?
    I took no shame in cheesing that bitch because the game gives us almost no opportunity for cheese.
    I'll be honest that fight is really fucking cool when you actually get it right.  The grab is almost always the move but jumping backwards and running in for a hit works just as well.  And actually getting those fights perfectly is pretty sweet.
Never mind snake eyes. The hit box on the snake is fucking disgusting. I don't need to watch replays to see that I was five feet away from the snakes body but I still get smashed.
    Right? It's not a case of timing or spacing - I just get teleported into her grab and shot to death. 
Yep, fuck that bitch. She literally ruined my day yesterday with that hitbox bullshit. I'm literally high up in the air and she manages to grab me as if I'm standing right next to her. Fuck hitting through walls and fuck stupid camera too. Classic From Software bullshit pretty much. I mean, I love you guys, but this shit needs to be sorted out, it's been 10 years and 6 games but the problems persist. Or is it the part of the challenge? 
    But FromSoft also provides the polar opposite of what you're describing. It's the reason we're all in this thread.
        Yes, you're right, I just needed to vent my emotions that day. In my experience about 90% of the time hitbox detection is perfect, but that 10% can ruin your day especially in tense situations when you're on your last couple of HPs and near beating an enemy. FromSoft games are very fair with almost every death being due to lack of skill/attention, that's why dying to bad camera or collision/hitbox detection is infuriating. FromSoft games are the only ones that I ever rage-quitted in my life lol
    What's weird is that this wasn't an issue in Demon's souls. Weapons were almost too well modeled if memory serves, and you pretty much had to get a thrust weapon for navigating the stonefang tunnels, or your weapon would ricochet off the walls.
Protip: jump away from the grab, don't doge. It works far better.
i literally jump to the right on that sweep and it misses 100% of the time, even in a tight environment.

you've probably beaten her/them by now, but if anyone else hasn't, a directional jump is super effective.
I got really good at dodging that attack. Just dash sideways and then backwards. Works everytime. Or double back. Double side may also work. You can't just dodge once though
There’s a SECOND ONE?!?!?!
    Nvm u can cheese that one
        It's still surprisingly difficult. I summed the first ogre destroying me up to just me being a beginner.

The second proved me wrong.
That's his first phase, right? Weirdly enough I beat Guardian Ape last weekend, and the two Apes yesterday. Never got captured in his lunging grab. Phase 2 gave me a MUCH harder time.
And the tracking of some enemies. OMG the tracking.

I need to stop pressing B/O lol. 
    The reason they added so much tracking is to force you to use deflect more. The intention is that you use dodge, jump and deflect in the appropiate situations and not rely on one defense for everything.

Its designed like rock paper scissors.
        I swear this game is almost harder for DS veterans because of the muscle memory you need to unlearn. 🤣
            Yeah but once you learn it, it's incredibly satisfying going toe to toe with a boss or miniboss, deflecting, countering, and punishing without stopping until the deathblow.
                Block while jumping ability=godly
                    I must get this!
                    I feel like such a badass when I block mid-air
                        It’s even better when you deflect mid air, very satisfying. 
                            That's more or less what I meant! When I get a parry mid-air is what I should have said! Couldn't agree more though, my friend!
                    I tried blocking in mid air against physical attacks, and I was unable to actually use it effectively. I was doing so badly that I thought the mid air block was only for projectiles. 

Why would you jump and then block against physical attacks anyways?
                        wondering the same. wasnt even useful for gyoubu
                        When hit and running you can ninja jump tf out of there and block on your way out to protect your booty
                        The best spot is against demon of hatred when he jumps in the air.

Jump when hes about to land, if you are still too near, the shockwave will hit you so you block to deflect the airblast. If you are far enough, you can grapple back in.

Ita also good against genichiro with his jump stab mixup. If you predict a sweep and jump but he slashes instead, you cam still block to save yourself.

Lastly against projectiles when you jump towards musket and arrows.
                Genichiro was so satisfying to fight, everything clicked like a boss or two before but it was this fight where it became a strategic fight with the multiple deflects combos and parry's. God damn best boss fight so far.
                    oh you are gonna love the end game
                    I wouldn't hesitate to say that Genichiro is up there with Ornstein/Smough or Lady Maria for how much I love fighting them. Amazing boss fight, and though he's hard as hell he really is fair and you can predict his moves/manipulate him at least to an extent. 

&#x200B;

This is what videogames should be. 
                    This fight felt like the most fair fight. Lol. So good.
                    Phase 2 was much easier imo^
                My first post on this sub was me saying the game isn’t for me and I wanted a refund but couldn’t get one. I was stuck at the very first general but now I’m addicted to Samurai death matches. Beat the lance guy on the horse on my second try. Once you get into it everything around you disappears and when it goes right it’s a feeling no other game can give. I haven’t played another game since I started Sekiro and I never played any other soulsbourne. 
                    > the lance guy on the horse

HIS NAME IS GYOUBU MASATAKA ONIWA!
                        How could I forget. Sorry I’m still just a puppy. 
                            There’s a YouTube video on how to cheese her....I caved and and watched because it was looking pretty bleak, it’s funny how broken it is 
                            Do you remember what he says when he enters the battlefield? :P
                        AND THE CASTLE GATES WILL REMAIN CLOSED!
                        AS I BREATHE, YOU WILL NOT PASS THE CASTLE GATES!
                        Such a great introduction to the games first big boss.
                        Man that VA didn’t have to go so hard, he did that for us 
                    THAT... [points at this comment] That right there is why these games are so good. At first, you want to break something, it's so unfair. The regular enemies swarm you and stun lock you to death, you can't block or dodge like you want to, deflect "isn't working..." you grow to hate it, it's so frustrating.

But then you learn.

You start to clue into enemy patterns, reading the opportune moments to retaliate, you learn the area and how to sneak past or stealth kill, you get abilities to augment your arsenal and toughen up your character to last longer... suddenly, these "impossible" encounters become routine displays of shinobi badassery. That unarmed monk that smashed you before gets Ichimonji: Double smashed in the face, you vault over, deal a deathblow, use his blood for mist cover, and you're grappling back into the trees before the others have even noticed... you get better. And for all that practice, you start to feel better about your gameplay and you savor those victories. Winning isn't just a matter of course, it's a badge of honor, and you earned it.

This is why, when people holler about an "easy" mode for these games, I have to laugh. If you truly think the soulsborne games need an easy mode, you aren't ready to play them. 
                        > If you truly think the soulsborne games need an easy mode, you aren't ready to play them.

My sentiment exactly. They're designed to be precise, challenging systems and they are exactly what they're supposed to be. 
                        “Easy Mode” is default on your first play through, that’s all you get folks. The only way it gets easier is if you figure it out. 
                    After you find Kuro at the beginning of the game there's a miniboss right through the gate (where ashina reservoir idol is later in the game). This guy killed me probably 20+ times before I stopped trying to dodge and hit him and instead started reacting to his moves and deflecting. Once I decided to do that he went down instantly. However it wasn't until Gyoubu that I really felt like I was "getting" it. Many people go for Butterfly as their first boss, but I don't think she is supposed to be. Gyoubu is designed perfectly to teach you how to play at that point. He has powerful attacks that can kill you in 1-2 hits but they are all very clearly telegraphed, don't have any weird irregular timing and are easily punishable if deflected. This made me kill him on the first attempt and I finally got the feeling I was doing things right.   
If I had gone for lady Butterfly first things might have been different. 
                        I did Butterfly first. It changed the game for me. Until then I had MASSIVE trouble with the game. But that fight taught me how important knowing what defense ability to use, specifically to not be afraid of blocking. Also that fight was awesome. I felt real dumb cause I didn’t know the difference between mini-boss and real boss until then. I’ve played all Soulsbourne games and I walked in that room and was like “oh right.. bosses have cutscenes.” 

I refused to leave until I killed her, so the next boss I found was super easy. The game is still hard to me, but I fucking love it. It’s one of my absolute favorite games of all time now. Every time I’m like “I’m a master of this” I walk into something new. 

Pro tip: Save Divine Confetti and don’t use it on the optional guys, until you unlock the merchant that sells an infinite amount. 
                            Keep hearing this and she will fall today.
                            I died to her hellas probably 20+ times because I was still too much in dark souls mode. My kill attempt I did everything perfect dont think I even got hit once and interrupted every leap with a shuriken. My GF was watching me and was like "woah, that was badass" and had some second hand excitement for me since she watched me eat shit over and over to her. 
                            Where is the merchant that sells infinite amount? I cannot even come close to competing with Headless and everywhere I've read has told me Divine Confetti is required to beat him. (Only boss I've attempted and gave up on, even LadyButterfly I kept at after fifty or more deaths) 
                        I dont understand how butterfly could be the first boss for someone. Wouldn't you have to at least fight the drunkard first?
                            Real boss, drunkard is a mini boss
                        Butterfly isn’t meant as first boss LOL, she’s waaay too difficult but I forced myself through anyway
                            I found her pretty easy once I realized the game was very serious about the dodge counter, if you dodge past her and attack she does not counter that and it does health damage, making her  much more manageable. 
                            She’s actually really slow with huge openings. But hey. Different strikes for different folks. 
                Just fought Genichiro. Basically the only way to fight him....if you play defensively, he will royally fuck you. repeatedly.
                    For him, and the Snake Eyes sisters, you can win by attacking until they try to strike back, deflect, then attacking again. FORCE them to do moves you know are coming and can deflect with ease. When you control what they do, you control the battle. For additional breaking power, chomp an Ako's Sugar (red candy) before that. They might do something unexpected or go for a perilous attack, so just react to that, readjust, and resume. You'll find that once you master deflection, a lot of fights become much easier.
                I really gotta say, for as much crap as she gets, Lady Butterfly is like the *perfect* boss for this stuff. Attacking rapidly and then deflecting like three times after feels so goddamn epic lol.
                    I think Genichiro is a better example actually. Butterfly has some god awful reaction times (hyper quick, obscenely wide hitboxes, far too much vitality). Honestly, I don't think she's a good fight at all, especially for how early you're able to face her, she's just a commonly talked about boss because of how many players get stonewalled on her (and a lot of those only beat her through cheese and then try to say what a great boss she is!).

She gave me more trouble than the final boss on my first playthrough, and while some of that is due to better learning the systems and improving at the game, I still maintain that she's just not a very well made encounter.
                Yeah last night I was up in lady butterfly’s face like “bitch ima mother fucking shinobi, fuck with meeeeee!!!!!” Then I died.
                Dude. When you get to like 1/4 health after resurrect and you get that high-posture enemy's bar to start turning orange and that switch turns on to start blitzing them is so satisfying. The way the tide turns in mini-boss fights is different from the other fromsoft games. It's not simply chipping away at health or exploiting mid-fight AI/waiting for an opening like the other games, it's actually feeling like you have to get an enemy on their heels. Because of the way the combat is, a lot of fights feel like you make it out alive by the skin of your teeth. 
            It absolutely does deliberately and intentionally punish trying to play it like Dark Souls, which has been hilarious while trying to learn the game.
            I always play any souls game only using some weapon with both hands. Learned to never use block or parry(i suck at parrying in souls games) because they was not as reliable as just rolling away. I dont need to say sekiro is being harder to me than when I tried darksouls for the first time but i'll get there.
                I’m keen to go back to DS and do a dex build with no shield. 
                    The best kind of build for any souls game, this and quality build. Quality with red iron twin blade in ds2 was insane
            It really is. I still want to roll INTO every fucking swing. So, everyone I know is ravaged by dragon rot. 
                Same. I caught on with the perfect blocking, but those enemies with high posture you're supposed to wear down by dodging and countering, I get wrecked trying to time like DS. 
            I got bloodborne and couldn’t get past the first few stages. It was just too difficult for me and I decided I’d play it later. I lost the game and I did sigh in relief. Now my fingers are twitching to buy this game so bad. I’ve been reading how this is harder than the DS and BB games too. Pretty sure I might impulse buy this later this week. 
                I'm in the same boat as you in bloodborne but have gotten a decent way through this game.

Bloodborne just felt too slow for me, so if that was the reason for you than get this game cause it fixes that.
            Yeah exactly. My instinct is to roll and dodge, not block so much. I had to retrain my brain to adjust and it took hours. Now if I go back to play Souls or Bloodborne, I’m fucked. 
            This. This is totally my experience!
            You are entirely, 100% correct. And I love it! I love that it's so similar but so unique at the same time, bringing the same design mentality of Dark souls with a whole new combat system. 

&#x200B;

I am loving this game a LOT more than I thought I would. 
            Definitely.  I feel like they did sime stuff JUST to fuck with the vets: Like B/O being a forward lunge instead of a backstep.
            Absolutely agree, played every Souls game religiously and this one gave me a run for my money this first week, but now that I’ve finally learnt the combat it’s so much more fun. Thanks, Lady Butterfly! 
            Can confirm. This games beating my ass and I can’t break out of old habits. 
            Until you get to a later boss and the game forces you to abandon everything you learn and fight it DS/BB style. Fun boss, good lore, but it seemed like a slap in the face.
            I went into the game not treating it like a new game rather than a Souls game, so it was actually super easy for me to come to grips with the combat. Game’s still tough as nails though.
            Just rebind block to B lol
        The problem is that they then add some unblockable moves with the same tracking so its not immediately obvious how to avoid the attack (Ogre and Demon of Hatred)
        But I like rock, paper, scissors, dodge. (jokes)

Although, you do have to admit the tracking can get a bit redic in some situations, to the point it even makes the enemy animations look strange. (not a big deal though, since soulsborne has always had little things like clipping, totally worth it)
            Yeah it happens mostly for grabs.

I think this might be intentional because almost every grab attack in the Soulsbourne games has had wierd hitboxes. Maybe its because they want the dodge window to be tight and sacrifice the animation for a tighter hitbox. IDK but it seems unlikely that the are capable of making good hitboxes but fail to do it on literally every grab attack.

I mean Dancers terrible telegrab was never patched out or anything ....

            The only viable response to thrusts is the mikiri counter.
                Can't even jump over them it's bs but really drives the point home.
                    No it drives the point up your ass.
                Deflect works, too. But Mikiri does more poise damage.
            dodge into thrust attacks not sideways 
            Mikiri Counter and deflect (but mostly Mikiri) are pretty much the only reliable ways to not take damage from a thrust. Unless you can get out of range entirely before he shish-kebabs you.
            Mikri dodge. Once you get it you can practice it on the training dummy guy. Dodge into thrust attacks and you step on their weapon. It's one of the first ones in 2nd skill tree. If your talking about the guy with the big ass lance or w.e that hangs out in the building you initially find kuro in, he hits pretty fuckin hard.
            >shaft of his spear 

*lenny face* 

You don’t have Mikiri Counter? 
            [This would explain it](https://giphy.com/gifs/shia-labeouf-12NUbkX6p4xOO4)
            The fucking red eyed giant.........................

So much salt.
            >when I try to dodge instead of deflecting

>doing wrong stuff on reflexes

>enemies shouldn't hit me

>enemies shouldn't deal full damage

[You must know how that sounds like, right?](https://pics.me.me/git-gud-28126051.png). 

You clearly know how to fix your problems, you're just complaining it doesn't work the way you want it to. The way Souls used to. Adapt


        It sounds like a good decision, but the tracking really psyches me out. I've learned since the early hours that the deflection play is not always the solution, and you have to play a bit more aggressively. Saw one guy take out Genichiro with an absurd amount of dodging, for example. Yet I always feel discouraged from trying it on anything but a few moves because of the tracking. 
        Can’t deflect a grab 
    fucking snake eyes grab is the biggest bullshit. I swear she spins around like a beyblade and only need 1 pixel to hit you and you are gonna get executed.
        Make sure to jump backwards, not dodge.. gamechanger once I started doing that with Snake Eyes.
            Yea I've killed her already. Amount of times, I got grabbed though. 
                I just let her die of poison 
                    Nice to see a fellow professional around here. It may have taken 15 minutes and 4-6 shuriken but I showed her who's boss.
                    I've cheesed stuff in other souls games. Determined to beat everybody without obvious cheese. 
                Same. Was stuck for several hours on that bastard. Finally figured out to play super aggressively and everything worked out.
        I haven't been able to try it yet but I read somewhere that you can actually deflect the pull back of her grab making this a lot easier. Will have to try that in NG+. 
            I think aslong as it's not their hand grabbing you, you can parry some grabs with a perfect parry. Atleast the grabs that involves impalement. For all I know you can parry hands to but I have yet to try that 
        I thought I had jumping it down, basically you jump over it and then head bop her. It would keep you above the hit box and keep you nice and close to keep wailing on her.

Unfortunately, the timing was just too tight and I would sometimes teleport into it if I jumped too late.

But, I'm not really mad about it. Jump away works basically everytime. Then I just speared her right back into my face and started slashing.
        I find it weird the grab is the move everyone is complaining about. For me. I couldn't wait for her to do her grab because it was the easiest to avoid and go in for two hits.
    Same lol. 
    >!snake eyes reporting in!<
    It’s this. It’s not the hit boxes themselves but the tracking. The hit-boxes are exceptionally tight. The tracking is the part that gets you.


    No joke but if you're in that situation, jump on their heads. I have found that jumping on a opponents head has put me into safety more times than not. On top of that, it can lower their posture a lot if they are lunging and thrusting, it counts like a counter. 
    the tracking works against the enemies, you are supposed to deflect and the tracking makes sure they keep hitting you and you can keep deflecting. 
    This!!! It’s basically “fuck your dodge!”
    It took me an hour to beat the first real mini boss because I kept dodging non-stop.
    try swapping deflect with dodge in the keybinds - as a DS guy this changed everything for me
    The Shinobi combo where they follow up with that lock-on kick comes to mind. The Pose he takes tells me "Block", but for some reason the Symbol makes me want to Circle-step out of there.

I really, really need to start my Subimaru combo right there when he takes the pose so I don't get my soul kicked out of my body lmao
    Dodge grab attacks, jump/kick sweeps, Dodge towards thrusts (mikiri counter), deflect the rest
    I had to mentally train myself to stop dashing with the shadow swordsman because his kick has tracking. 
    The tracking is fine on everything except the grabs, because even when you react appropriately and dodge they’ll still rotate to get you and suck you in with the huge bullshit hitbox.
Grabs are actually the the least tracking attacks, most can be evaded with a single side dodge. But some do have extra bullshit hitbox, like the rifle snakeeye girl
    Or the frost chain ogre. His hands are like magnets or some shit. He's like the first boss, barely.  


Related note, I just beat him and backed up my save and both saves are fucked. I think I just quit the game. Spent like 15 hours grinding gear and maxing skills and FUCK.
        Why are you messing with the saves? 
            Well, I read that PC version is somehow corrupting saves, so I wanted to prevent that.

Copied entire folder and pasted, game loads and I'm back to square one.

Tried contents from copied folder, same.

So. I'm probably gonna rethink how I spend my time. That was a lot of stress.
                There's a script that you can use to backup the game. I use it every time I rest at an idol or beat a boss. 
I think that's purely psychological.

You're more likely to believe that someone cut you with a blade, even when it only grazes you slightly. But if you dodge someone who tries to grab you, and they only gently caress your ass, you'll call BS.

Good example is the red eye ogre in the beginning. He tries to grab you with both hands, but if he only touches you with the back of one of his hands, you kind of teleport in there. If he did the same movement with two swords, you'd think that you definitely just got stabbed.



I'm pretty sure the hitboxes/iframes actually differ depending on whether you block, dodge, or jump. There are attacks where you can visually dodge them and still get hit, but if you jump the attack can visually clip through you and yet not hit. 
    Yea, the Corrupted Monk's upward slash would hit me alot if I was too close even if I blocked
Seriously.  Grabs are ridiculous.  I keep ash ready for them,  doesn't work on everything though.  But man..... hate grabs
    If you've unlocked the umbrella you can use that to block grabs. But yeah, some of those hitboxes are ridiculous. 
         Didn't think it would block grabs, good to know thanks. 
I once got killed by seven spear stabbing the air about 30 cm to the right of me.

I probably dodged too late (or should've just mikiri'd instead), but it was still slightly annoying.
Looking at you, ogre. Piece of shit. Was so satisfying to beat though
I just met the shotgun miniboss and it feels like dodging the hook attack is impossible
    I know, feels super random. Jumping worked best for me. Also, use poison blades. 
But you can get those moments while fighting lady butterfly
Jesus Christ the rest of that fight was absolutely perfect EXCEPT for the jump grab roll bullshit
I had to run backwards to dodge that
Totally. I’d be standing by his left hip or ankle and GRAB! Never been so mad. 
The gif is already on loop. What do you mean?

    It's just a video for me. 
        Put it on loop.
Ye but he is doing an old school walkthrough of sekiro atm on youtube, in the style of his old from the dark series
    his dark souls 2 walkthrough/lore summary was great. dunno if he good that for ds1, I followed him when the game first came out but then not so much.
        Yeah I felt like shortly after 2i just never saw him anymore
            It's YouTube, not a fashion show... it shows you what you want to see dude.

His Sekiro play though is the best out there hands down.
        Agreed the one for ds2 is the best imo but I probably think that because I'm a heretic who thinks thats the best souls gamr
Hes mainly on twitch nowadays
[deleted]
    Oh cool.  Glad he's able to put family first.  I have to work 60hours a week almost,  I barely game anymore but enjoy family time or sleep.  
ENB's Bloodborne walkthrough was amazing. He was full of knowledge, not just item locations and fight mechanics, but the lore and story, he made the game better for me in a way. Think he had worked on the official guide, like the hardcopy. 

&#x200B;

I watch cowboy now though. 
Of course! Nothing beats ENB's souls playthroughs 
He started making YouTube content again just this past week for Sekiro. Similar style as his From The Dark series, but not to the same level at the moment since he's working on finding the lore still. As mentioned by u/Highflyer108, Marcus is on Twitch now.
    Yeah I have no twitch time.  I barely even game but I'd rather game then watch
If you just watch a video or two of him they will start popping up again. It's more to do with YouTube's algorithm than anything. Like I like to watch a lot of Rust content so my recommended usually has the new rust videos when I go on but I didn't watch any for a few days and they just stopped showing up until I started watching again.
I haven't watched vaatis channel in a while so his recent video didn't show up for me when they always used to show up when I watched him more regularly.
    Oh.  My YouTube is a wreck.  I have toddlers.... it has no idea if that's how that works
Marcus is great if you want a deep dive into the lore and if you really want to savor the game and level design, but I found that can be a detriment if you just want a quick 100% walkthrough.

That said, I love Marcus and his enthusiasm for FromSoft games is infectious.
Eh, it's rare when it happens, but it's no less frustrating since it takes a bit to wind it up, and having it just glitch through for no damage, getting hit by the enemy is just salt in the wound.

But the game is still great regardless, though I do personally keep a stress ball nearby at all times.
Its quite rare when that happens, I'd 100% suggest getting this game. It doesn't even feel like a game to me, it otherworldly. The universe they built this in is so deep and so well fleshed out I feel more like I'm having a religious experience.
If you rage quit easily (no shame in that) then it probably isn’t the game for you. The only way you can really complete the game is to train your brain to see every death as “I learned something about that enemy” otherwise you simply will not have fun.
    I have a question about the xp loss upon death. Say I get to a hard part and  I die very many times. Does than mean I'll potentially lose the ability to reach max level? 
        Nah you can grind for levels at an easy spot. Once you get a skill you don’t lose it. Just grind somewhere and spend levels as you get them
Incredible game I wouldn't avoid it because of that
Honestly if that kind of thing makes you rage, then yeah, you might be better off not getting into it.  It's a good game, but if I didn't have the attachment I have to the Soulborne games, I probably would have just given up on this shit a long time ago.  There are quite a lot of bullshit moments, especially grab attacks are broken as fuck across the board, and the dodge windows are ridiculously small, way smaller than in their other games.  
For me it's the absurd tracking on a lot of attacks that makes some fights feel cheap/cheesy.  Which was put there by the devs to force you to deflect (and as a nice f.u. to DS vets).    
  

On the bright side, if you've not already gotten into the DS mentality of dodging everything you might feel right at home. A large majority of attacks are deflectable, even when you might not think they are (IE the big brute lookin guys with the large hammer/mace).
Yeah getting an aerial takedown on a sweeping enemy is pure gold. 
Definitely outclassed by a jump and headstomp, but it's so damned stylish

    I agree but sometimes they're crafty with the up slash. 
I'm comparing it to dark souls which has horrible hitboxes by comparison.
    which one tho? third game was quite okay, i didnt see SO huge bullshit hits which i see in sekiro. 100+ hrs
Can confirm none of the combat arts have iframes. Some have hyper armour but there was no hit marker here to indicate that. 
I agree, it's really awesome. Just the animation alone and the fluidity is super impressive. I watched it like twenty times. 
Mikiri is superb, yeah :)
The thrust seems like it’s kind of “auto aimed” like if you roll to the side the spear or sword follows you. I ended up getting tired of it and just perfecting the circle move where I stomp on their weapon. Totally worth. So satisfying too.

I can never do it so I just jump away and definitely didn't get the skill upgrade lol.
    You have to press B/Circle and not in any direction - I take my thumb off the stick when I see kanji. Don't do it as soon as you see the kanji, but like half a second after. One. two. Count it out, and on two press B. Eventually you'll do it on reflex. 

Goomba stomps on sweeps work the same, but you have to jump jump - one. two. three. with two and three being jumps. Grabs I jump away from because side stepping is less forgiving, but side step counter slash is how you *should* deal with those.
        This needs to be a thread. Best advice for the counters and each time I've heard all time. 

You actually stated it as rhythm. Agreed on jump away. 
            I'm not great at this game yet, but I played a lot of Souls and Monster Hunter. Most of the time people react too fast when they're doing poorly rather than too slow. These games have beats to them, and the attacks have a rhythm. It helps me to practice on a boss first with sloppy blocking, and then counting out those hits and finding the spaces. These bosses have patterns, and I find the way they string them together really intricate and beautiful for game design. I'm usually too impressed to get frustrated, and I know when I figure it out I'll be that much better. This game is sooo fucking good at teaching you, and swordfighting is such a violent, satisfying ballet.
        In my experience you can press forward too and it still works, because pressing B does the same thing as pressing forward B
I mean he's pretty clearly out of the way by the time the sparks show up so I can see why it would seem unfair.   
But it doesn't really have anything to do with bad hitboxes, this is clearly an intentional design choice forcing you to use the correct counter/timing. He maybe still could have dodged that sideways with correct timing but the dodge started way before the actual attack so it doesn't count.    

If it wasn't designed like this you could just dodge spam everything and the entire combat system would break down, so it's a compromise having slightly less realistic hitboxes on perilous attacks in exchange for a more fun system of counters. 
    Sparks showing up 2 frames later than this hit occuring doesn't mean the hit wasn't registered on the two frames in which the sword is inside the players back knee. Why there is a delay to them I don't know, perhaps it waits on all hits to the character to show the hit sparks.
Either way it can't seem unfair when 1) he got hit 2) he failed to use the right ability against a thrust attack.

The fact he took the trouble to check it in slow motion (and missed it clips his knee?), take time to edit and upload a clip and blame hitboxes instead of just recognizing he didn't mikiri counter or deflect the thrust is what I take from his post.
        I can only give a general reply, but games don't usually do everything on every update. Hit detection is probably high priority here, but maybe the consequences happen on the next update to allow a late deflect response. Similar to how many platformers let you still jump for a frame or so, when you already completely ran off the edge.
Trouble not in the sword goes thru knee, trouble that animation of damage starts only after 2 frames.  

It sucks :)
that sounds like great advice
    Anything to try and help man. :)
    Be *very* aggressive. Generally you want to open fights with shuriken+dash or a sprint attack and keep attacking until you’re deflected, you’ll notice because the spark from the blades will be a different color and the sound will be louder, then deflect until an opening to attack again. Thrusts can be deflected (deflected meaning parried, just holding L1 to block is not the same as deflecting) but generally you want to use one of your skills to counter it, sweeps need to be jumped over, and grabs you can technically dodge away from but I just sprint away because the hit boxes on grabs are overtuned. 

For boss fights you need to control the fight. In Souls you wait for the boss to finish its chain and get some hits in, but letting the boss control the pacing of the fight in Sekiro will get you killed. Being in the bosses face forcing them to deflect allows you to manipulate their move sets the same way that proper spacing does in Souls and BB, so it’s generally your best bet. The dodge works like it does in Nioh where it’s a tool to get out of enemy range not something to iframe through attacks, so break those old habits early. 
        >but letting the boss control the pacing of the fight in Sekiro will get you killed

Actually this is a cheese strat that work for basically every enemies, it's slower than just killing through poise but you can bait out every attack the same attack over and over 
        Man I’m trying to break the habits, but damn it’s hard. 
Noted, I hadn't thought of this, thank you
You have to finish basically the whole mushin skill tree, then you’ll get empowered mortal draw, it’s the bottom right one, idk why but I wasn’t able to unlock the middle right one
Thanks! I already have it. This game must be sick! Thanks for commenter
I've noticed several times that so many frames of the animatiin follow you, discouraging early dodges and deflects. This is true of projectiles as well. They will follow you until they are closer and then continue on a predefined path. If you can remain calm this is no issue, but if you panic and make a move too early, it is just as bad or worse than not making a move at all.
Thank you very much.
Thanks👍
The hitreg in that game is terrible. Hit boxes are nearly as bad.
Wow lol.NOICE!
His name is Johnny Sekiro.
I found that out too. All the bosses have something that you can use to make the fight a little easier. 

For the Bull, you can jump over most of his charges and slash at him in mid air.

Lady butterfly you can knock out of the air with the shuriken.

Corrupted Monk you can use Divine Confetti to increase damage. 
    Corrupted Monk you can also use snap seeds on. They absolutely fuck her up.
        [deleted]
            Here's something I'm not sure if others found for that encounter: If you grapple as fast as possible to the furthest, highest branch when entering the fight, if you jump over her immediately there's a small window to deathblow her first phase. Immediately grapple back up, deathblow her second phase because she always goes into the illusion thing. Its 100% consistent if you're fast enough, and makes it so you only ever have to fight her third phase.
                I tried to do this so many times I ended up spending more time trying to make the fight easier than I would have just fighting her normally.
            Yeah just get in close, use it, stun and a good chunk of damage. Divine confetti works well too.
    Yea when I started to realize this it reminded me of megaman lol getting different arm attachments in order use their weakness against them.
        I think that's where the replay value will come from in this game. The order you do things will change the experince.
    For the bull, I was runnin’ around him like a bull in a china shop.
    Or you can skip phase 2 by doing an air deathblow.
    What about Genichiro? I’ve been stuck for 4 days
        Third phase, in the air when he uses lightening. Jump and slice it. It hits him back and takes about 1/4 to 1/5 of his health.

First and second phase, always circle around counter clockwise, and dodge to the right.  Mikuri counter to quickly so the first phase. During the second phase he tends to do sweeping attacks more so just jump on his head when you see him extend his blade to the side before he becomes a beyblade.

Most of all?

Make your own playstyle. The game is made to where you can craft what's easiest for you. Use what fangs you have wolf and look at your skills you've learned along the way.
            I finally fucking beat him. I’ve been stuck on it for so long when I beat him I almost threw up
    poo tosser can be speared with double rt/r2 to pull the centipede out for massive damage during second phase
    to be honest the bull isnt that hard if you have patience. You can literally run in circles around the arena and sneak in a hit or parry here or there. really if you have the patience you can run around, hit him in the back, run away adn keep doing it until he dies.

the key with this game is most of the time sprinting and jumping are more effective at dodging. you only really want to hit the dodge button if your going to counter or do a quick sidestep. if your trying to backstep with dodge most of the time your gonna get hit anyway because you dont move far/fast enough. and sometimes since the hitboxes are great you can leap over the attack anyway.  


nearly every time i die its because i virtually never use dodge and i need to for mikiri counter suddenly and miss a grand opportunity, or hit dodge by accident intending to leap away.
    For the bulls you can just stay behind, close to the back legs and he cant hit you. Just dodge the charge attack when he starts doing it and stay on his ass wacking him for easy cheese
    Skakskdxjkskskdskskekskaoaaslsl omg you can hit her with shuriken? I equipped it on my 11th attempt but when I got inside I just said "yeah that's not going to work anyway" and continued getting murdered.
I found out you can actually block this grab, you just got to wait until the hook part comes up behind you and as she pull it back, deflect it.  Holy shit did this make a difference.
    So it's a weapon attack and not a grapple, makes sense you can deflect it.
        yeh, I see that it's definitely just a weapon attack now, since most unblockable grabs in this game are through hands or legs (Lady Butterfly).
    HMMMMMM. See, the hat blocks that hook part with sparks, so I never thought about deflecting it. I just assumed all grabs were unblockable and undeflectable.

But if that grab is deflectable, are others?

HMMMMM
        That's what I'm thinking, I'm guessing no because it's a semi grab and slash because it's not their hands that are grabbing you which are 100% unblockable.
I just panic jumped backwards and it worked
I found that just jumping backwards avoids it 99% of the time. 
Very solid advice. I didn't have issues jumping away, because sidestepping timing was not working out for me consistently. The hat would trivialize the mini bosses - attacking and deflecting their attacks isn't difficult by the time you fight them imo.
Sabimaru also works wonders against any of the snake eyes bosses. They're super weak against poison apparently.
    They set on fire really easily too. I guess it's the gunpowder.

All the Gun Fort-type gunmen burn in one hit, while the snake-eyes duo take 2 flame hits to burn without oil.
I thought it was a swipe, so jumped on her. That allways works for me.
    She can pull you out of the air
For the grab I eventually found that dodging into her to the right always worked and created time to pop in a few attacks.
What is "metal hat"? 
    Prosthetic tool called Iron Fortress. Sold by an NPC near the Ashina Castle Old Grave warp (which is an area at the bottom of the castle, around the rear) 
If you footstomp him you interupt the move so treat it like a sweep and your good
If you lure snake eyes into the poison pit, the fight takes care of itself. 
Snake Eyes get completely trivialized by double ichimonji, she doesnt even try to grab if you just deflect -> ichimonji double -> deflect etc.
I actually didn't have trouble with Snake Eyes hitbox.  The problem I had was the area you fight her in.  She's backed up against a wall, and if you counter her grab with jump, you can't follow up with the second jump attack.  Instead, you perform a wall jump, making you jump way above her and getting out of sync with the fight.  She was usually in the middle of another combo or performing the grab attack again by the time I landed, usually insta-killing me.

And she's completely surrounded by walls.  It doesn't matter if you draw her out into the small open part in the middle, because she quickly gets pushed back up against a wall.
Metal hat blocks all grabs i think
Or you can just jump away.
The hat seems to be designed with that entire area in mind. I turtle up and scuttle across the bridges at the Gun Fort to avoid all the sniper shots.
For snake eyes, just jump back and jump back in. Easy as pie.
I just deflected the grab
[removed]
    -Use a stealth candy


-Grapple to her location


-Backstab her


-Run the fuck away


-Grapple to the Buddha statue's hand that's near the bonfire, at the end of the room


-Wait for her ass to be fully poisoned



-Finish her off when she has 1 HP

        [removed]
        I did this without the stealth candy. Not too bad, just clear out the other 4 or 5 guys in the area. Her gun has a few seconds delay between attacks so if you can predict when to juke you can swerve between her shots and time the death blows on the others. Then just hide up on a hill and poke your head out every so often to keep her shooting while standing in the poison. 
            Wait, what poison are we talking about? I didn't see any poison around the gunfort approach?
                Nah, that's a different Snake Eyes (probs her sister). There's one more in Ashina Depths, near Poison Pool idol. 
                For the one you’re talking about, there is a small cliff to the left when you first start that battle. If you stand on top of the cliff and get her to chase you then you jump off the cliff, she will follow you off and upon landing she opens herself up to 1 or 2 attacks. Walk back up to the top of the cliff and repeat 
    On the island in front of her is a lean-to structure with stairs/ramp on one side. Lure her up there and jump down towards the Buddha. Turn around and she'll be going ham on the air above your head. I used ichimonji to hit above me and just whittled down both her DBs. Pure fuckin cheese
    You can stealth without candy and basically attack her constantly and deflect her attack and Dodge her grab late. My mistake the first couple of times was because I dodged her grab early and she just turns and grabs.
    In case you need a guide for the other snake eyes in sunken Valley, I wrote a detailed guide[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sekiro/comments/b6siq2/how_to_easily_kill_snake_eyes_shirafuji/). 
    Another way is to backstab the gunner that is high on the rocks and take control of him through puppeteer. Stand behind him as he rains fire on snake eyes and be ready to backstab again when you lose control, rinse and repeat till snake eyes is low enough for you to give a death blow. 
    And it you want to cheese the first one, grapple to her, run past to the left, jump up and hug the wall, run out on the bridge, dodge the bullets and run right back, wait while hugging the wall until Snake-eyes de-aggro you. boom sneak-stab the cunt and enjoy the kill-screen after only having to deal with half her Hp!
    She (and the other snake eyes where there are NO poison pools) are cake with the poison sword prosthetic. Especially the upgraded one.
    I fought snake eyes in the hidden pools area and just got him into the poison and watch poison drain health, then went in for the one hit deathblow and ran away and repeated.
    No need to cheese. Two words: Double Ichimonji
    Get her on a ledge and you just stand a little below...worked for me!
    As well as the other guys explanation, Snake Eyes is vulnerable Ichimonji. Two attacks and an ichimonji will stagger snake eyes and they’ll jump back, dash forward attack twice and do another and it’ll loop.

This is how I killed both snake eyes.
    Another tip, stealth her after killing the enemies, then use an oil and stunlock her with fire.
    I was able to cheese the Ashina Depths Snake Eyes by getting her onto the roof of the hut and dropping down the side, then just staying there and doing jump attacks.
Same let her suck on poison 
    That’s it...suck out all the poison. 
You just jump away for the grab and get in  their face for everything else. The one near the Gun Fort was fucking me up until I was super aggressive and deflected everything. That grab sucks hard, but I was able to get down jumping away - it's the only perilous attack they have. They're severely disadvantaged against your quick sword strikes and deflection. The one in the Depths just sucks because they want to fight between that slope and wall.
I just ran around until she did a charge shot rushed in got like 2 hits and repeated til she was super low
the iron fortress prosthetic really helped for me!

&#x200B;
Which one?
I took no shame in cheesing that bitch because the game gives us almost no opportunity for cheese.
I'll be honest that fight is really fucking cool when you actually get it right.  The grab is almost always the move but jumping backwards and running in for a hit works just as well.  And actually getting those fights perfectly is pretty sweet.
Right? It's not a case of timing or spacing - I just get teleported into her grab and shot to death. 
But FromSoft also provides the polar opposite of what you're describing. It's the reason we're all in this thread.
    Yes, you're right, I just needed to vent my emotions that day. In my experience about 90% of the time hitbox detection is perfect, but that 10% can ruin your day especially in tense situations when you're on your last couple of HPs and near beating an enemy. FromSoft games are very fair with almost every death being due to lack of skill/attention, that's why dying to bad camera or collision/hitbox detection is infuriating. FromSoft games are the only ones that I ever rage-quitted in my life lol
What's weird is that this wasn't an issue in Demon's souls. Weapons were almost too well modeled if memory serves, and you pretty much had to get a thrust weapon for navigating the stonefang tunnels, or your weapon would ricochet off the walls.
Nvm u can cheese that one
    It's still surprisingly difficult. I summed the first ogre destroying me up to just me being a beginner.

The second proved me wrong.
The reason they added so much tracking is to force you to use deflect more. The intention is that you use dodge, jump and deflect in the appropiate situations and not rely on one defense for everything.

Its designed like rock paper scissors.
    I swear this game is almost harder for DS veterans because of the muscle memory you need to unlearn. 🤣
        Yeah but once you learn it, it's incredibly satisfying going toe to toe with a boss or miniboss, deflecting, countering, and punishing without stopping until the deathblow.
            Block while jumping ability=godly
                I must get this!
                I feel like such a badass when I block mid-air
                    It’s even better when you deflect mid air, very satisfying. 
                        That's more or less what I meant! When I get a parry mid-air is what I should have said! Couldn't agree more though, my friend!
                I tried blocking in mid air against physical attacks, and I was unable to actually use it effectively. I was doing so badly that I thought the mid air block was only for projectiles. 

Why would you jump and then block against physical attacks anyways?
                    wondering the same. wasnt even useful for gyoubu
                    When hit and running you can ninja jump tf out of there and block on your way out to protect your booty
                    The best spot is against demon of hatred when he jumps in the air.

Jump when hes about to land, if you are still too near, the shockwave will hit you so you block to deflect the airblast. If you are far enough, you can grapple back in.

Ita also good against genichiro with his jump stab mixup. If you predict a sweep and jump but he slashes instead, you cam still block to save yourself.

Lastly against projectiles when you jump towards musket and arrows.
            Genichiro was so satisfying to fight, everything clicked like a boss or two before but it was this fight where it became a strategic fight with the multiple deflects combos and parry's. God damn best boss fight so far.
                oh you are gonna love the end game
                I wouldn't hesitate to say that Genichiro is up there with Ornstein/Smough or Lady Maria for how much I love fighting them. Amazing boss fight, and though he's hard as hell he really is fair and you can predict his moves/manipulate him at least to an extent. 

&#x200B;

This is what videogames should be. 
                This fight felt like the most fair fight. Lol. So good.
                Phase 2 was much easier imo^
            My first post on this sub was me saying the game isn’t for me and I wanted a refund but couldn’t get one. I was stuck at the very first general but now I’m addicted to Samurai death matches. Beat the lance guy on the horse on my second try. Once you get into it everything around you disappears and when it goes right it’s a feeling no other game can give. I haven’t played another game since I started Sekiro and I never played any other soulsbourne. 
                > the lance guy on the horse

HIS NAME IS GYOUBU MASATAKA ONIWA!
                    How could I forget. Sorry I’m still just a puppy. 
                        There’s a YouTube video on how to cheese her....I caved and and watched because it was looking pretty bleak, it’s funny how broken it is 
                        Do you remember what he says when he enters the battlefield? :P
                    AND THE CASTLE GATES WILL REMAIN CLOSED!
                    AS I BREATHE, YOU WILL NOT PASS THE CASTLE GATES!
                    Such a great introduction to the games first big boss.
                    Man that VA didn’t have to go so hard, he did that for us 
                THAT... [points at this comment] That right there is why these games are so good. At first, you want to break something, it's so unfair. The regular enemies swarm you and stun lock you to death, you can't block or dodge like you want to, deflect "isn't working..." you grow to hate it, it's so frustrating.

But then you learn.

You start to clue into enemy patterns, reading the opportune moments to retaliate, you learn the area and how to sneak past or stealth kill, you get abilities to augment your arsenal and toughen up your character to last longer... suddenly, these "impossible" encounters become routine displays of shinobi badassery. That unarmed monk that smashed you before gets Ichimonji: Double smashed in the face, you vault over, deal a deathblow, use his blood for mist cover, and you're grappling back into the trees before the others have even noticed... you get better. And for all that practice, you start to feel better about your gameplay and you savor those victories. Winning isn't just a matter of course, it's a badge of honor, and you earned it.

This is why, when people holler about an "easy" mode for these games, I have to laugh. If you truly think the soulsborne games need an easy mode, you aren't ready to play them. 
                    > If you truly think the soulsborne games need an easy mode, you aren't ready to play them.

My sentiment exactly. They're designed to be precise, challenging systems and they are exactly what they're supposed to be. 
                    “Easy Mode” is default on your first play through, that’s all you get folks. The only way it gets easier is if you figure it out. 
                After you find Kuro at the beginning of the game there's a miniboss right through the gate (where ashina reservoir idol is later in the game). This guy killed me probably 20+ times before I stopped trying to dodge and hit him and instead started reacting to his moves and deflecting. Once I decided to do that he went down instantly. However it wasn't until Gyoubu that I really felt like I was "getting" it. Many people go for Butterfly as their first boss, but I don't think she is supposed to be. Gyoubu is designed perfectly to teach you how to play at that point. He has powerful attacks that can kill you in 1-2 hits but they are all very clearly telegraphed, don't have any weird irregular timing and are easily punishable if deflected. This made me kill him on the first attempt and I finally got the feeling I was doing things right.   
If I had gone for lady Butterfly first things might have been different. 
                    I did Butterfly first. It changed the game for me. Until then I had MASSIVE trouble with the game. But that fight taught me how important knowing what defense ability to use, specifically to not be afraid of blocking. Also that fight was awesome. I felt real dumb cause I didn’t know the difference between mini-boss and real boss until then. I’ve played all Soulsbourne games and I walked in that room and was like “oh right.. bosses have cutscenes.” 

I refused to leave until I killed her, so the next boss I found was super easy. The game is still hard to me, but I fucking love it. It’s one of my absolute favorite games of all time now. Every time I’m like “I’m a master of this” I walk into something new. 

Pro tip: Save Divine Confetti and don’t use it on the optional guys, until you unlock the merchant that sells an infinite amount. 
                        Keep hearing this and she will fall today.
                        I died to her hellas probably 20+ times because I was still too much in dark souls mode. My kill attempt I did everything perfect dont think I even got hit once and interrupted every leap with a shuriken. My GF was watching me and was like "woah, that was badass" and had some second hand excitement for me since she watched me eat shit over and over to her. 
                        Where is the merchant that sells infinite amount? I cannot even come close to competing with Headless and everywhere I've read has told me Divine Confetti is required to beat him. (Only boss I've attempted and gave up on, even LadyButterfly I kept at after fifty or more deaths) 
                    I dont understand how butterfly could be the first boss for someone. Wouldn't you have to at least fight the drunkard first?
                        Real boss, drunkard is a mini boss
                    Butterfly isn’t meant as first boss LOL, she’s waaay too difficult but I forced myself through anyway
                        I found her pretty easy once I realized the game was very serious about the dodge counter, if you dodge past her and attack she does not counter that and it does health damage, making her  much more manageable. 
                        She’s actually really slow with huge openings. But hey. Different strikes for different folks. 
            Just fought Genichiro. Basically the only way to fight him....if you play defensively, he will royally fuck you. repeatedly.
                For him, and the Snake Eyes sisters, you can win by attacking until they try to strike back, deflect, then attacking again. FORCE them to do moves you know are coming and can deflect with ease. When you control what they do, you control the battle. For additional breaking power, chomp an Ako's Sugar (red candy) before that. They might do something unexpected or go for a perilous attack, so just react to that, readjust, and resume. You'll find that once you master deflection, a lot of fights become much easier.
            I really gotta say, for as much crap as she gets, Lady Butterfly is like the *perfect* boss for this stuff. Attacking rapidly and then deflecting like three times after feels so goddamn epic lol.
                I think Genichiro is a better example actually. Butterfly has some god awful reaction times (hyper quick, obscenely wide hitboxes, far too much vitality). Honestly, I don't think she's a good fight at all, especially for how early you're able to face her, she's just a commonly talked about boss because of how many players get stonewalled on her (and a lot of those only beat her through cheese and then try to say what a great boss she is!).

She gave me more trouble than the final boss on my first playthrough, and while some of that is due to better learning the systems and improving at the game, I still maintain that she's just not a very well made encounter.
            Yeah last night I was up in lady butterfly’s face like “bitch ima mother fucking shinobi, fuck with meeeeee!!!!!” Then I died.
            Dude. When you get to like 1/4 health after resurrect and you get that high-posture enemy's bar to start turning orange and that switch turns on to start blitzing them is so satisfying. The way the tide turns in mini-boss fights is different from the other fromsoft games. It's not simply chipping away at health or exploiting mid-fight AI/waiting for an opening like the other games, it's actually feeling like you have to get an enemy on their heels. Because of the way the combat is, a lot of fights feel like you make it out alive by the skin of your teeth. 
        It absolutely does deliberately and intentionally punish trying to play it like Dark Souls, which has been hilarious while trying to learn the game.
        I always play any souls game only using some weapon with both hands. Learned to never use block or parry(i suck at parrying in souls games) because they was not as reliable as just rolling away. I dont need to say sekiro is being harder to me than when I tried darksouls for the first time but i'll get there.
            I’m keen to go back to DS and do a dex build with no shield. 
                The best kind of build for any souls game, this and quality build. Quality with red iron twin blade in ds2 was insane
        It really is. I still want to roll INTO every fucking swing. So, everyone I know is ravaged by dragon rot. 
            Same. I caught on with the perfect blocking, but those enemies with high posture you're supposed to wear down by dodging and countering, I get wrecked trying to time like DS. 
        I got bloodborne and couldn’t get past the first few stages. It was just too difficult for me and I decided I’d play it later. I lost the game and I did sigh in relief. Now my fingers are twitching to buy this game so bad. I’ve been reading how this is harder than the DS and BB games too. Pretty sure I might impulse buy this later this week. 
            I'm in the same boat as you in bloodborne but have gotten a decent way through this game.

Bloodborne just felt too slow for me, so if that was the reason for you than get this game cause it fixes that.
        Yeah exactly. My instinct is to roll and dodge, not block so much. I had to retrain my brain to adjust and it took hours. Now if I go back to play Souls or Bloodborne, I’m fucked. 
        This. This is totally my experience!
        You are entirely, 100% correct. And I love it! I love that it's so similar but so unique at the same time, bringing the same design mentality of Dark souls with a whole new combat system. 

&#x200B;

I am loving this game a LOT more than I thought I would. 
        Definitely.  I feel like they did sime stuff JUST to fuck with the vets: Like B/O being a forward lunge instead of a backstep.
        Absolutely agree, played every Souls game religiously and this one gave me a run for my money this first week, but now that I’ve finally learnt the combat it’s so much more fun. Thanks, Lady Butterfly! 
        Can confirm. This games beating my ass and I can’t break out of old habits. 
        Until you get to a later boss and the game forces you to abandon everything you learn and fight it DS/BB style. Fun boss, good lore, but it seemed like a slap in the face.
        I went into the game not treating it like a new game rather than a Souls game, so it was actually super easy for me to come to grips with the combat. Game’s still tough as nails though.
        Just rebind block to B lol
    The problem is that they then add some unblockable moves with the same tracking so its not immediately obvious how to avoid the attack (Ogre and Demon of Hatred)
    But I like rock, paper, scissors, dodge. (jokes)

Although, you do have to admit the tracking can get a bit redic in some situations, to the point it even makes the enemy animations look strange. (not a big deal though, since soulsborne has always had little things like clipping, totally worth it)
        Yeah it happens mostly for grabs.

I think this might be intentional because almost every grab attack in the Soulsbourne games has had wierd hitboxes. Maybe its because they want the dodge window to be tight and sacrifice the animation for a tighter hitbox. IDK but it seems unlikely that the are capable of making good hitboxes but fail to do it on literally every grab attack.

I mean Dancers terrible telegrab was never patched out or anything ....

        The only viable response to thrusts is the mikiri counter.
            Can't even jump over them it's bs but really drives the point home.
                No it drives the point up your ass.
            Deflect works, too. But Mikiri does more poise damage.
        dodge into thrust attacks not sideways 
        Mikiri Counter and deflect (but mostly Mikiri) are pretty much the only reliable ways to not take damage from a thrust. Unless you can get out of range entirely before he shish-kebabs you.
        Mikri dodge. Once you get it you can practice it on the training dummy guy. Dodge into thrust attacks and you step on their weapon. It's one of the first ones in 2nd skill tree. If your talking about the guy with the big ass lance or w.e that hangs out in the building you initially find kuro in, he hits pretty fuckin hard.
        >shaft of his spear 

*lenny face* 

You don’t have Mikiri Counter? 
        [This would explain it](https://giphy.com/gifs/shia-labeouf-12NUbkX6p4xOO4)
        The fucking red eyed giant.........................

So much salt.
        >when I try to dodge instead of deflecting

>doing wrong stuff on reflexes

>enemies shouldn't hit me

>enemies shouldn't deal full damage

[You must know how that sounds like, right?](https://pics.me.me/git-gud-28126051.png). 

You clearly know how to fix your problems, you're just complaining it doesn't work the way you want it to. The way Souls used to. Adapt


    It sounds like a good decision, but the tracking really psyches me out. I've learned since the early hours that the deflection play is not always the solution, and you have to play a bit more aggressively. Saw one guy take out Genichiro with an absurd amount of dodging, for example. Yet I always feel discouraged from trying it on anything but a few moves because of the tracking. 
    Can’t deflect a grab 
fucking snake eyes grab is the biggest bullshit. I swear she spins around like a beyblade and only need 1 pixel to hit you and you are gonna get executed.
    Make sure to jump backwards, not dodge.. gamechanger once I started doing that with Snake Eyes.
        Yea I've killed her already. Amount of times, I got grabbed though. 
            I just let her die of poison 
                Nice to see a fellow professional around here. It may have taken 15 minutes and 4-6 shuriken but I showed her who's boss.
                I've cheesed stuff in other souls games. Determined to beat everybody without obvious cheese. 
            Same. Was stuck for several hours on that bastard. Finally figured out to play super aggressively and everything worked out.
    I haven't been able to try it yet but I read somewhere that you can actually deflect the pull back of her grab making this a lot easier. Will have to try that in NG+. 
        I think aslong as it's not their hand grabbing you, you can parry some grabs with a perfect parry. Atleast the grabs that involves impalement. For all I know you can parry hands to but I have yet to try that 
    I thought I had jumping it down, basically you jump over it and then head bop her. It would keep you above the hit box and keep you nice and close to keep wailing on her.

Unfortunately, the timing was just too tight and I would sometimes teleport into it if I jumped too late.

But, I'm not really mad about it. Jump away works basically everytime. Then I just speared her right back into my face and started slashing.
    I find it weird the grab is the move everyone is complaining about. For me. I couldn't wait for her to do her grab because it was the easiest to avoid and go in for two hits.
Same lol. 
>!snake eyes reporting in!<
It’s this. It’s not the hit boxes themselves but the tracking. The hit-boxes are exceptionally tight. The tracking is the part that gets you.


No joke but if you're in that situation, jump on their heads. I have found that jumping on a opponents head has put me into safety more times than not. On top of that, it can lower their posture a lot if they are lunging and thrusting, it counts like a counter. 
the tracking works against the enemies, you are supposed to deflect and the tracking makes sure they keep hitting you and you can keep deflecting. 
This!!! It’s basically “fuck your dodge!”
It took me an hour to beat the first real mini boss because I kept dodging non-stop.
try swapping deflect with dodge in the keybinds - as a DS guy this changed everything for me
The Shinobi combo where they follow up with that lock-on kick comes to mind. The Pose he takes tells me "Block", but for some reason the Symbol makes me want to Circle-step out of there.

I really, really need to start my Subimaru combo right there when he takes the pose so I don't get my soul kicked out of my body lmao
Dodge grab attacks, jump/kick sweeps, Dodge towards thrusts (mikiri counter), deflect the rest
I had to mentally train myself to stop dashing with the shadow swordsman because his kick has tracking. 
The tracking is fine on everything except the grabs, because even when you react appropriately and dodge they’ll still rotate to get you and suck you in with the huge bullshit hitbox.
Or the frost chain ogre. His hands are like magnets or some shit. He's like the first boss, barely.  


Related note, I just beat him and backed up my save and both saves are fucked. I think I just quit the game. Spent like 15 hours grinding gear and maxing skills and FUCK.
    Why are you messing with the saves? 
        Well, I read that PC version is somehow corrupting saves, so I wanted to prevent that.

Copied entire folder and pasted, game loads and I'm back to square one.

Tried contents from copied folder, same.

So. I'm probably gonna rethink how I spend my time. That was a lot of stress.
            There's a script that you can use to backup the game. I use it every time I rest at an idol or beat a boss. 
Yea, the Corrupted Monk's upward slash would hit me alot if I was too close even if I blocked
If you've unlocked the umbrella you can use that to block grabs. But yeah, some of those hitboxes are ridiculous. 
     Didn't think it would block grabs, good to know thanks. 
I know, feels super random. Jumping worked best for me. Also, use poison blades. 
It's just a video for me. 
    Put it on loop.
his dark souls 2 walkthrough/lore summary was great. dunno if he good that for ds1, I followed him when the game first came out but then not so much.
    Yeah I felt like shortly after 2i just never saw him anymore
        It's YouTube, not a fashion show... it shows you what you want to see dude.

His Sekiro play though is the best out there hands down.
    Agreed the one for ds2 is the best imo but I probably think that because I'm a heretic who thinks thats the best souls gamr
Oh cool.  Glad he's able to put family first.  I have to work 60hours a week almost,  I barely game anymore but enjoy family time or sleep.  
Yeah I have no twitch time.  I barely even game but I'd rather game then watch
Oh.  My YouTube is a wreck.  I have toddlers.... it has no idea if that's how that works
I have a question about the xp loss upon death. Say I get to a hard part and  I die very many times. Does than mean I'll potentially lose the ability to reach max level? 
    Nah you can grind for levels at an easy spot. Once you get a skill you don’t lose it. Just grind somewhere and spend levels as you get them
I agree but sometimes they're crafty with the up slash. 
which one tho? third game was quite okay, i didnt see SO huge bullshit hits which i see in sekiro. 100+ hrs
You have to press B/Circle and not in any direction - I take my thumb off the stick when I see kanji. Don't do it as soon as you see the kanji, but like half a second after. One. two. Count it out, and on two press B. Eventually you'll do it on reflex. 

Goomba stomps on sweeps work the same, but you have to jump jump - one. two. three. with two and three being jumps. Grabs I jump away from because side stepping is less forgiving, but side step counter slash is how you *should* deal with those.
    This needs to be a thread. Best advice for the counters and each time I've heard all time. 

You actually stated it as rhythm. Agreed on jump away. 
        I'm not great at this game yet, but I played a lot of Souls and Monster Hunter. Most of the time people react too fast when they're doing poorly rather than too slow. These games have beats to them, and the attacks have a rhythm. It helps me to practice on a boss first with sloppy blocking, and then counting out those hits and finding the spaces. These bosses have patterns, and I find the way they string them together really intricate and beautiful for game design. I'm usually too impressed to get frustrated, and I know when I figure it out I'll be that much better. This game is sooo fucking good at teaching you, and swordfighting is such a violent, satisfying ballet.
    In my experience you can press forward too and it still works, because pressing B does the same thing as pressing forward B
Sparks showing up 2 frames later than this hit occuring doesn't mean the hit wasn't registered on the two frames in which the sword is inside the players back knee. Why there is a delay to them I don't know, perhaps it waits on all hits to the character to show the hit sparks.
Either way it can't seem unfair when 1) he got hit 2) he failed to use the right ability against a thrust attack.

The fact he took the trouble to check it in slow motion (and missed it clips his knee?), take time to edit and upload a clip and blame hitboxes instead of just recognizing he didn't mikiri counter or deflect the thrust is what I take from his post.
    I can only give a general reply, but games don't usually do everything on every update. Hit detection is probably high priority here, but maybe the consequences happen on the next update to allow a late deflect response. Similar to how many platformers let you still jump for a frame or so, when you already completely ran off the edge.
Anything to try and help man. :)
Be *very* aggressive. Generally you want to open fights with shuriken+dash or a sprint attack and keep attacking until you’re deflected, you’ll notice because the spark from the blades will be a different color and the sound will be louder, then deflect until an opening to attack again. Thrusts can be deflected (deflected meaning parried, just holding L1 to block is not the same as deflecting) but generally you want to use one of your skills to counter it, sweeps need to be jumped over, and grabs you can technically dodge away from but I just sprint away because the hit boxes on grabs are overtuned. 

For boss fights you need to control the fight. In Souls you wait for the boss to finish its chain and get some hits in, but letting the boss control the pacing of the fight in Sekiro will get you killed. Being in the bosses face forcing them to deflect allows you to manipulate their move sets the same way that proper spacing does in Souls and BB, so it’s generally your best bet. The dodge works like it does in Nioh where it’s a tool to get out of enemy range not something to iframe through attacks, so break those old habits early. 
    >but letting the boss control the pacing of the fight in Sekiro will get you killed

Actually this is a cheese strat that work for basically every enemies, it's slower than just killing through poise but you can bait out every attack the same attack over and over 
    Man I’m trying to break the habits, but damn it’s hard. 
Corrupted Monk you can also use snap seeds on. They absolutely fuck her up.
    [deleted]
        Here's something I'm not sure if others found for that encounter: If you grapple as fast as possible to the furthest, highest branch when entering the fight, if you jump over her immediately there's a small window to deathblow her first phase. Immediately grapple back up, deathblow her second phase because she always goes into the illusion thing. Its 100% consistent if you're fast enough, and makes it so you only ever have to fight her third phase.
            I tried to do this so many times I ended up spending more time trying to make the fight easier than I would have just fighting her normally.
        Yeah just get in close, use it, stun and a good chunk of damage. Divine confetti works well too.
Yea when I started to realize this it reminded me of megaman lol getting different arm attachments in order use their weakness against them.
    I think that's where the replay value will come from in this game. The order you do things will change the experince.
For the bull, I was runnin’ around him like a bull in a china shop.
Or you can skip phase 2 by doing an air deathblow.
What about Genichiro? I’ve been stuck for 4 days
    Third phase, in the air when he uses lightening. Jump and slice it. It hits him back and takes about 1/4 to 1/5 of his health.

First and second phase, always circle around counter clockwise, and dodge to the right.  Mikuri counter to quickly so the first phase. During the second phase he tends to do sweeping attacks more so just jump on his head when you see him extend his blade to the side before he becomes a beyblade.

Most of all?

Make your own playstyle. The game is made to where you can craft what's easiest for you. Use what fangs you have wolf and look at your skills you've learned along the way.
        I finally fucking beat him. I’ve been stuck on it for so long when I beat him I almost threw up
poo tosser can be speared with double rt/r2 to pull the centipede out for massive damage during second phase
to be honest the bull isnt that hard if you have patience. You can literally run in circles around the arena and sneak in a hit or parry here or there. really if you have the patience you can run around, hit him in the back, run away adn keep doing it until he dies.

the key with this game is most of the time sprinting and jumping are more effective at dodging. you only really want to hit the dodge button if your going to counter or do a quick sidestep. if your trying to backstep with dodge most of the time your gonna get hit anyway because you dont move far/fast enough. and sometimes since the hitboxes are great you can leap over the attack anyway.  


nearly every time i die its because i virtually never use dodge and i need to for mikiri counter suddenly and miss a grand opportunity, or hit dodge by accident intending to leap away.
For the bulls you can just stay behind, close to the back legs and he cant hit you. Just dodge the charge attack when he starts doing it and stay on his ass wacking him for easy cheese
Skakskdxjkskskdskskekskaoaaslsl omg you can hit her with shuriken? I equipped it on my 11th attempt but when I got inside I just said "yeah that's not going to work anyway" and continued getting murdered.
So it's a weapon attack and not a grapple, makes sense you can deflect it.
    yeh, I see that it's definitely just a weapon attack now, since most unblockable grabs in this game are through hands or legs (Lady Butterfly).
HMMMMMM. See, the hat blocks that hook part with sparks, so I never thought about deflecting it. I just assumed all grabs were unblockable and undeflectable.

But if that grab is deflectable, are others?

HMMMMM
    That's what I'm thinking, I'm guessing no because it's a semi grab and slash because it's not their hands that are grabbing you which are 100% unblockable.
They set on fire really easily too. I guess it's the gunpowder.

All the Gun Fort-type gunmen burn in one hit, while the snake-eyes duo take 2 flame hits to burn without oil.
She can pull you out of the air
Prosthetic tool called Iron Fortress. Sold by an NPC near the Ashina Castle Old Grave warp (which is an area at the bottom of the castle, around the rear) 
-Use a stealth candy


-Grapple to her location


-Backstab her


-Run the fuck away


-Grapple to the Buddha statue's hand that's near the bonfire, at the end of the room


-Wait for her ass to be fully poisoned



-Finish her off when she has 1 HP

    [removed]
    I did this without the stealth candy. Not too bad, just clear out the other 4 or 5 guys in the area. Her gun has a few seconds delay between attacks so if you can predict when to juke you can swerve between her shots and time the death blows on the others. Then just hide up on a hill and poke your head out every so often to keep her shooting while standing in the poison. 
        Wait, what poison are we talking about? I didn't see any poison around the gunfort approach?
            Nah, that's a different Snake Eyes (probs her sister). There's one more in Ashina Depths, near Poison Pool idol. 
            For the one you’re talking about, there is a small cliff to the left when you first start that battle. If you stand on top of the cliff and get her to chase you then you jump off the cliff, she will follow you off and upon landing she opens herself up to 1 or 2 attacks. Walk back up to the top of the cliff and repeat 
On the island in front of her is a lean-to structure with stairs/ramp on one side. Lure her up there and jump down towards the Buddha. Turn around and she'll be going ham on the air above your head. I used ichimonji to hit above me and just whittled down both her DBs. Pure fuckin cheese
You can stealth without candy and basically attack her constantly and deflect her attack and Dodge her grab late. My mistake the first couple of times was because I dodged her grab early and she just turns and grabs.
In case you need a guide for the other snake eyes in sunken Valley, I wrote a detailed guide[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sekiro/comments/b6siq2/how_to_easily_kill_snake_eyes_shirafuji/). 
Another way is to backstab the gunner that is high on the rocks and take control of him through puppeteer. Stand behind him as he rains fire on snake eyes and be ready to backstab again when you lose control, rinse and repeat till snake eyes is low enough for you to give a death blow. 
And it you want to cheese the first one, grapple to her, run past to the left, jump up and hug the wall, run out on the bridge, dodge the bullets and run right back, wait while hugging the wall until Snake-eyes de-aggro you. boom sneak-stab the cunt and enjoy the kill-screen after only having to deal with half her Hp!
She (and the other snake eyes where there are NO poison pools) are cake with the poison sword prosthetic. Especially the upgraded one.
I fought snake eyes in the hidden pools area and just got him into the poison and watch poison drain health, then went in for the one hit deathblow and ran away and repeated.
No need to cheese. Two words: Double Ichimonji
Get her on a ledge and you just stand a little below...worked for me!
As well as the other guys explanation, Snake Eyes is vulnerable Ichimonji. Two attacks and an ichimonji will stagger snake eyes and they’ll jump back, dash forward attack twice and do another and it’ll loop.

This is how I killed both snake eyes.
Another tip, stealth her after killing the enemies, then use an oil and stunlock her with fire.
I was able to cheese the Ashina Depths Snake Eyes by getting her onto the roof of the hut and dropping down the side, then just staying there and doing jump attacks.
That’s it...suck out all the poison. 
Yes, you're right, I just needed to vent my emotions that day. In my experience about 90% of the time hitbox detection is perfect, but that 10% can ruin your day especially in tense situations when you're on your last couple of HPs and near beating an enemy. FromSoft games are very fair with almost every death being due to lack of skill/attention, that's why dying to bad camera or collision/hitbox detection is infuriating. FromSoft games are the only ones that I ever rage-quitted in my life lol
It's still surprisingly difficult. I summed the first ogre destroying me up to just me being a beginner.

The second proved me wrong.
I swear this game is almost harder for DS veterans because of the muscle memory you need to unlearn. 🤣
    Yeah but once you learn it, it's incredibly satisfying going toe to toe with a boss or miniboss, deflecting, countering, and punishing without stopping until the deathblow.
        Block while jumping ability=godly
            I must get this!
            I feel like such a badass when I block mid-air
                It’s even better when you deflect mid air, very satisfying. 
                    That's more or less what I meant! When I get a parry mid-air is what I should have said! Couldn't agree more though, my friend!
            I tried blocking in mid air against physical attacks, and I was unable to actually use it effectively. I was doing so badly that I thought the mid air block was only for projectiles. 

Why would you jump and then block against physical attacks anyways?
                wondering the same. wasnt even useful for gyoubu
                When hit and running you can ninja jump tf out of there and block on your way out to protect your booty
                The best spot is against demon of hatred when he jumps in the air.

Jump when hes about to land, if you are still too near, the shockwave will hit you so you block to deflect the airblast. If you are far enough, you can grapple back in.

Ita also good against genichiro with his jump stab mixup. If you predict a sweep and jump but he slashes instead, you cam still block to save yourself.

Lastly against projectiles when you jump towards musket and arrows.
        Genichiro was so satisfying to fight, everything clicked like a boss or two before but it was this fight where it became a strategic fight with the multiple deflects combos and parry's. God damn best boss fight so far.
            oh you are gonna love the end game
            I wouldn't hesitate to say that Genichiro is up there with Ornstein/Smough or Lady Maria for how much I love fighting them. Amazing boss fight, and though he's hard as hell he really is fair and you can predict his moves/manipulate him at least to an extent. 

&#x200B;

This is what videogames should be. 
            This fight felt like the most fair fight. Lol. So good.
            Phase 2 was much easier imo^
        My first post on this sub was me saying the game isn’t for me and I wanted a refund but couldn’t get one. I was stuck at the very first general but now I’m addicted to Samurai death matches. Beat the lance guy on the horse on my second try. Once you get into it everything around you disappears and when it goes right it’s a feeling no other game can give. I haven’t played another game since I started Sekiro and I never played any other soulsbourne.

HIS NAME IS GYOUBU MASATAKA ONIWA!
                How could I forget. Sorry I’m still just a puppy. 
                    There’s a YouTube video on how to cheese her....I caved and and watched because it was looking pretty bleak, it’s funny how broken it is 
                    Do you remember what he says when he enters the battlefield? :P
                AND THE CASTLE GATES WILL REMAIN CLOSED!
                AS I BREATHE, YOU WILL NOT PASS THE CASTLE GATES!
                Such a great introduction to the games first big boss.
                Man that VA didn’t have to go so hard, he did that for us 
            THAT... [points at this comment] That right there is why these games are so good. At first, you want to break something, it's so unfair. The regular enemies swarm you and stun lock you to death, you can't block or dodge like you want to, deflect "isn't working..." you grow to hate it, it's so frustrating.

But then you learn.

You start to clue into enemy patterns, reading the opportune moments to retaliate, you learn the area and how to sneak past or stealth kill, you get abilities to augment your arsenal and toughen up your character to last longer... suddenly, these "impossible" encounters become routine displays of shinobi badassery. That unarmed monk that smashed you before gets Ichimonji: Double smashed in the face, you vault over, deal a deathblow, use his blood for mist cover, and you're grappling back into the trees before the others have even noticed... you get better. And for all that practice, you start to feel better about your gameplay and you savor those victories. Winning isn't just a matter of course, it's a badge of honor, and you earned it.

This is why, when people holler about an "easy" mode for these games, I have to laugh. If you truly think the soulsborne games need an easy mode, you aren't ready to play them. 
                > If you truly think the soulsborne games need an easy mode, you aren't ready to play them.

My sentiment exactly. They're designed to be precise, challenging systems and they are exactly what they're supposed to be. 
                “Easy Mode” is default on your first play through, that’s all you get folks. The only way it gets easier is if you figure it out. 
            After you find Kuro at the beginning of the game there's a miniboss right through the gate (where ashina reservoir idol is later in the game). This guy killed me probably 20+ times before I stopped trying to dodge and hit him and instead started reacting to his moves and deflecting. Once I decided to do that he went down instantly. However it wasn't until Gyoubu that I really felt like I was "getting" it. Many people go for Butterfly as their first boss, but I don't think she is supposed to be. Gyoubu is designed perfectly to teach you how to play at that point. He has powerful attacks that can kill you in 1-2 hits but they are all very clearly telegraphed, don't have any weird irregular timing and are easily punishable if deflected. This made me kill him on the first attempt and I finally got the feeling I was doing things right.   
If I had gone for lady Butterfly first things might have been different. 
                I did Butterfly first. It changed the game for me. Until then I had MASSIVE trouble with the game. But that fight taught me how important knowing what defense ability to use, specifically to not be afraid of blocking. Also that fight was awesome. I felt real dumb cause I didn’t know the difference between mini-boss and real boss until then. I’ve played all Soulsbourne games and I walked in that room and was like “oh right.. bosses have cutscenes.” 

I refused to leave until I killed her, so the next boss I found was super easy. The game is still hard to me, but I fucking love it. It’s one of my absolute favorite games of all time now. Every time I’m like “I’m a master of this” I walk into something new. 

Pro tip: Save Divine Confetti and don’t use it on the optional guys, until you unlock the merchant that sells an infinite amount. 
                    Keep hearing this and she will fall today.
                    I died to her hellas probably 20+ times because I was still too much in dark souls mode. My kill attempt I did everything perfect dont think I even got hit once and interrupted every leap with a shuriken. My GF was watching me and was like "woah, that was badass" and had some second hand excitement for me since she watched me eat shit over and over to her. 
                    Where is the merchant that sells infinite amount? I cannot even come close to competing with Headless and everywhere I've read has told me Divine Confetti is required to beat him. (Only boss I've attempted and gave up on, even LadyButterfly I kept at after fifty or more deaths) 
                I dont understand how butterfly could be the first boss for someone. Wouldn't you have to at least fight the drunkard first?
                    Real boss, drunkard is a mini boss
                Butterfly isn’t meant as first boss LOL, she’s waaay too difficult but I forced myself through anyway
                    I found her pretty easy once I realized the game was very serious about the dodge counter, if you dodge past her and attack she does not counter that and it does health damage, making her  much more manageable. 
                    She’s actually really slow with huge openings. But hey. Different strikes for different folks. 
        Just fought Genichiro. Basically the only way to fight him....if you play defensively, he will royally fuck you. repeatedly.
            For him, and the Snake Eyes sisters, you can win by attacking until they try to strike back, deflect, then attacking again. FORCE them to do moves you know are coming and can deflect with ease. When you control what they do, you control the battle. For additional breaking power, chomp an Ako's Sugar (red candy) before that. They might do something unexpected or go for a perilous attack, so just react to that, readjust, and resume. You'll find that once you master deflection, a lot of fights become much easier.
        I really gotta say, for as much crap as she gets, Lady Butterfly is like the *perfect* boss for this stuff. Attacking rapidly and then deflecting like three times after feels so goddamn epic lol.
            I think Genichiro is a better example actually. Butterfly has some god awful reaction times (hyper quick, obscenely wide hitboxes, far too much vitality). Honestly, I don't think she's a good fight at all, especially for how early you're able to face her, she's just a commonly talked about boss because of how many players get stonewalled on her (and a lot of those only beat her through cheese and then try to say what a great boss she is!).

She gave me more trouble than the final boss on my first playthrough, and while some of that is due to better learning the systems and improving at the game, I still maintain that she's just not a very well made encounter.
        Yeah last night I was up in lady butterfly’s face like “bitch ima mother fucking shinobi, fuck with meeeeee!!!!!” Then I died.
        Dude. When you get to like 1/4 health after resurrect and you get that high-posture enemy's bar to start turning orange and that switch turns on to start blitzing them is so satisfying. The way the tide turns in mini-boss fights is different from the other fromsoft games. It's not simply chipping away at health or exploiting mid-fight AI/waiting for an opening like the other games, it's actually feeling like you have to get an enemy on their heels. Because of the way the combat is, a lot of fights feel like you make it out alive by the skin of your teeth. 
    It absolutely does deliberately and intentionally punish trying to play it like Dark Souls, which has been hilarious while trying to learn the game.
    I always play any souls game only using some weapon with both hands. Learned to never use block or parry(i suck at parrying in souls games) because they was not as reliable as just rolling away. I dont need to say sekiro is being harder to me than when I tried darksouls for the first time but i'll get there.
        I’m keen to go back to DS and do a dex build with no shield. 
            The best kind of build for any souls game, this and quality build. Quality with red iron twin blade in ds2 was insane
    It really is. I still want to roll INTO every fucking swing. So, everyone I know is ravaged by dragon rot. 
        Same. I caught on with the perfect blocking, but those enemies with high posture you're supposed to wear down by dodging and countering, I get wrecked trying to time like DS. 
    I got bloodborne and couldn’t get past the first few stages. It was just too difficult for me and I decided I’d play it later. I lost the game and I did sigh in relief. Now my fingers are twitching to buy this game so bad. I’ve been reading how this is harder than the DS and BB games too. Pretty sure I might impulse buy this later this week. 
        I'm in the same boat as you in bloodborne but have gotten a decent way through this game.

Bloodborne just felt too slow for me, so if that was the reason for you than get this game cause it fixes that.
    Yeah exactly. My instinct is to roll and dodge, not block so much. I had to retrain my brain to adjust and it took hours. Now if I go back to play Souls or Bloodborne, I’m fucked. 
    This. This is totally my experience!
    You are entirely, 100% correct. And I love it! I love that it's so similar but so unique at the same time, bringing the same design mentality of Dark souls with a whole new combat system. 

&#x200B;

I am loving this game a LOT more than I thought I would. 
    Definitely.  I feel like they did sime stuff JUST to fuck with the vets: Like B/O being a forward lunge instead of a backstep.
    Absolutely agree, played every Souls game religiously and this one gave me a run for my money this first week, but now that I’ve finally learnt the combat it’s so much more fun. Thanks, Lady Butterfly! 
    Can confirm. This games beating my ass and I can’t break out of old habits. 
    Until you get to a later boss and the game forces you to abandon everything you learn and fight it DS/BB style. Fun boss, good lore, but it seemed like a slap in the face.
    I went into the game not treating it like a new game rather than a Souls game, so it was actually super easy for me to come to grips with the combat. Game’s still tough as nails though.
    Just rebind block to B lol
The problem is that they then add some unblockable moves with the same tracking so its not immediately obvious how to avoid the attack (Ogre and Demon of Hatred)
But I like rock, paper, scissors, dodge. (jokes)

Although, you do have to admit the tracking can get a bit redic in some situations, to the point it even makes the enemy animations look strange. (not a big deal though, since soulsborne has always had little things like clipping, totally worth it)
    Yeah it happens mostly for grabs.

I think this might be intentional because almost every grab attack in the Soulsbourne games has had wierd hitboxes. Maybe its because they want the dodge window to be tight and sacrifice the animation for a tighter hitbox. IDK but it seems unlikely that the are capable of making good hitboxes but fail to do it on literally every grab attack.

I mean Dancers terrible telegrab was never patched out or anything ....

    The only viable response to thrusts is the mikiri counter.
        Can't even jump over them it's bs but really drives the point home.
            No it drives the point up your ass.
        Deflect works, too. But Mikiri does more poise damage.
    dodge into thrust attacks not sideways 
    Mikiri Counter and deflect (but mostly Mikiri) are pretty much the only reliable ways to not take damage from a thrust. Unless you can get out of range entirely before he shish-kebabs you.
    Mikri dodge. Once you get it you can practice it on the training dummy guy. Dodge into thrust attacks and you step on their weapon. It's one of the first ones in 2nd skill tree. If your talking about the guy with the big ass lance or w.e that hangs out in the building you initially find kuro in, he hits pretty fuckin hard.
    >shaft of his spear 

*lenny face* 

You don’t have Mikiri Counter? 
    [This would explain it](https://giphy.com/gifs/shia-labeouf-12NUbkX6p4xOO4)
    The fucking red eyed giant.........................

So much salt.
    >when I try to dodge instead of deflecting

>doing wrong stuff on reflexes

>enemies shouldn't hit me

>enemies shouldn't deal full damage

[You must know how that sounds like, right?](https://pics.me.me/git-gud-28126051.png). 

You clearly know how to fix your problems, you're just complaining it doesn't work the way you want it to. The way Souls used to. Adapt


It sounds like a good decision, but the tracking really psyches me out. I've learned since the early hours that the deflection play is not always the solution, and you have to play a bit more aggressively. Saw one guy take out Genichiro with an absurd amount of dodging, for example. Yet I always feel discouraged from trying it on anything but a few moves because of the tracking. 
Can’t deflect a grab 
Make sure to jump backwards, not dodge.. gamechanger once I started doing that with Snake Eyes.
    Yea I've killed her already. Amount of times, I got grabbed though. 
        I just let her die of poison 
            Nice to see a fellow professional around here. It may have taken 15 minutes and 4-6 shuriken but I showed her who's boss.
            I've cheesed stuff in other souls games. Determined to beat everybody without obvious cheese. 
        Same. Was stuck for several hours on that bastard. Finally figured out to play super aggressively and everything worked out.
I haven't been able to try it yet but I read somewhere that you can actually deflect the pull back of her grab making this a lot easier. Will have to try that in NG+. 
    I think aslong as it's not their hand grabbing you, you can parry some grabs with a perfect parry. Atleast the grabs that involves impalement. For all I know you can parry hands to but I have yet to try that 
I thought I had jumping it down, basically you jump over it and then head bop her. It would keep you above the hit box and keep you nice and close to keep wailing on her.

Unfortunately, the timing was just too tight and I would sometimes teleport into it if I jumped too late.

But, I'm not really mad about it. Jump away works basically everytime. Then I just speared her right back into my face and started slashing.
I find it weird the grab is the move everyone is complaining about. For me. I couldn't wait for her to do her grab because it was the easiest to avoid and go in for two hits.
Why are you messing with the saves? 
    Well, I read that PC version is somehow corrupting saves, so I wanted to prevent that.

Copied entire folder and pasted, game loads and I'm back to square one.

Tried contents from copied folder, same.

So. I'm probably gonna rethink how I spend my time. That was a lot of stress.
        There's a script that you can use to backup the game. I use it every time I rest at an idol or beat a boss. 
 Didn't think it would block grabs, good to know thanks. 
Put it on loop.
Yeah I felt like shortly after 2i just never saw him anymore
    It's YouTube, not a fashion show... it shows you what you want to see dude.

His Sekiro play though is the best out there hands down.
Agreed the one for ds2 is the best imo but I probably think that because I'm a heretic who thinks thats the best souls gamr
Nah you can grind for levels at an easy spot. Once you get a skill you don’t lose it. Just grind somewhere and spend levels as you get them
This needs to be a thread. Best advice for the counters and each time I've heard all time. 

You actually stated it as rhythm. Agreed on jump away. 
    I'm not great at this game yet, but I played a lot of Souls and Monster Hunter. Most of the time people react too fast when they're doing poorly rather than too slow. These games have beats to them, and the attacks have a rhythm. It helps me to practice on a boss first with sloppy blocking, and then counting out those hits and finding the spaces. These bosses have patterns, and I find the way they string them together really intricate and beautiful for game design. I'm usually too impressed to get frustrated, and I know when I figure it out I'll be that much better. This game is sooo fucking good at teaching you, and swordfighting is such a violent, satisfying ballet.
In my experience you can press forward too and it still works, because pressing B does the same thing as pressing forward B
I can only give a general reply, but games don't usually do everything on every update. Hit detection is probably high priority here, but maybe the consequences happen on the next update to allow a late deflect response. Similar to how many platformers let you still jump for a frame or so, when you already completely ran off the edge.
>but letting the boss control the pacing of the fight in Sekiro will get you killed

Actually this is a cheese strat that work for basically every enemies, it's slower than just killing through poise but you can bait out every attack the same attack over and over 
Man I’m trying to break the habits, but damn it’s hard. 
[deleted]
    Here's something I'm not sure if others found for that encounter: If you grapple as fast as possible to the furthest, highest branch when entering the fight, if you jump over her immediately there's a small window to deathblow her first phase. Immediately grapple back up, deathblow her second phase because she always goes into the illusion thing. Its 100% consistent if you're fast enough, and makes it so you only ever have to fight her third phase.
        I tried to do this so many times I ended up spending more time trying to make the fight easier than I would have just fighting her normally.
    Yeah just get in close, use it, stun and a good chunk of damage. Divine confetti works well too.
I think that's where the replay value will come from in this game. The order you do things will change the experince.
Third phase, in the air when he uses lightening. Jump and slice it. It hits him back and takes about 1/4 to 1/5 of his health.

First and second phase, always circle around counter clockwise, and dodge to the right.  Mikuri counter to quickly so the first phase. During the second phase he tends to do sweeping attacks more so just jump on his head when you see him extend his blade to the side before he becomes a beyblade.

Most of all?

Make your own playstyle. The game is made to where you can craft what's easiest for you. Use what fangs you have wolf and look at your skills you've learned along the way.
    I finally fucking beat him. I’ve been stuck on it for so long when I beat him I almost threw up
yeh, I see that it's definitely just a weapon attack now, since most unblockable grabs in this game are through hands or legs (Lady Butterfly).
That's what I'm thinking, I'm guessing no because it's a semi grab and slash because it's not their hands that are grabbing you which are 100% unblockable.
[removed]
I did this without the stealth candy. Not too bad, just clear out the other 4 or 5 guys in the area. Her gun has a few seconds delay between attacks so if you can predict when to juke you can swerve between her shots and time the death blows on the others. Then just hide up on a hill and poke your head out every so often to keep her shooting while standing in the poison. 
    Wait, what poison are we talking about? I didn't see any poison around the gunfort approach?
        Nah, that's a different Snake Eyes (probs her sister). There's one more in Ashina Depths, near Poison Pool idol. 
        For the one you’re talking about, there is a small cliff to the left when you first start that battle. If you stand on top of the cliff and get her to chase you then you jump off the cliff, she will follow you off and upon landing she opens herself up to 1 or 2 attacks. Walk back up to the top of the cliff and repeat 
Yeah but once you learn it, it's incredibly satisfying going toe to toe with a boss or miniboss, deflecting, countering, and punishing without stopping until the deathblow.
    Block while jumping ability=godly
        I must get this!
        I feel like such a badass when I block mid-air
            It’s even better when you deflect mid air, very satisfying. 
                That's more or less what I meant! When I get a parry mid-air is what I should have said! Couldn't agree more though, my friend!
        I tried blocking in mid air against physical attacks, and I was unable to actually use it effectively. I was doing so badly that I thought the mid air block was only for projectiles. 

Why would you jump and then block against physical attacks anyways?
            wondering the same. wasnt even useful for gyoubu
            When hit and running you can ninja jump tf out of there and block on your way out to protect your booty
            The best spot is against demon of hatred when he jumps in the air.

Jump when hes about to land, if you are still too near, the shockwave will hit you so you block to deflect the airblast. If you are far enough, you can grapple back in.

Ita also good against genichiro with his jump stab mixup. If you predict a sweep and jump but he slashes instead, you cam still block to save yourself.

Lastly against projectiles when you jump towards musket and arrows.
    Genichiro was so satisfying to fight, everything clicked like a boss or two before but it was this fight where it became a strategic fight with the multiple deflects combos and parry's. God damn best boss fight so far.

    Just fought Genichiro. Basically the only way to fight him....if you play defensively, he will royally fuck you. repeatedly.
        For him, and the Snake Eyes sisters, you can win by attacking until they try to strike back, deflect, then attacking again. FORCE them to do moves you know are coming and can deflect with ease. When you control what they do, you control the battle. For additional breaking power, chomp an Ako's Sugar (red candy) before that. They might do something unexpected or go for a perilous attack, so just react to that, readjust, and resume. You'll find that once you master deflection, a lot of fights become much easier.
    I really gotta say, for as much crap as she gets, Lady Butterfly is like the *perfect* boss for this stuff. Attacking rapidly and then deflecting like three times after feels so goddamn epic lol.
        I think Genichiro is a better example actually. Butterfly has some god awful reaction times (hyper quick, obscenely wide hitboxes, far too much vitality). Honestly, I don't think she's a good fight at all, especially for how early you're able to face her, she's just a commonly talked about boss because of how many players get stonewalled on her (and a lot of those only beat her through cheese and then try to say what a great boss she is!).

She gave me more trouble than the final boss on my first playthrough, and while some of that is due to better learning the systems and improving at the game, I still maintain that she's just not a very well made encounter.
    Yeah last night I was up in lady butterfly’s face like “bitch ima mother fucking shinobi, fuck with meeeeee!!!!!” Then I died.
    Dude. When you get to like 1/4 health after resurrect and you get that high-posture enemy's bar to start turning orange and that switch turns on to start blitzing them is so satisfying. The way the tide turns in mini-boss fights is different from the other fromsoft games. It's not simply chipping away at health or exploiting mid-fight AI/waiting for an opening like the other games, it's actually feeling like you have to get an enemy on their heels. Because of the way the combat is, a lot of fights feel like you make it out alive by the skin of your teeth. 
It absolutely does deliberately and intentionally punish trying to play it like Dark Souls, which has been hilarious while trying to learn the game.
I always play any souls game only using some weapon with both hands. Learned to never use block or parry(i suck at parrying in souls games) because they was not as reliable as just rolling away. I dont need to say sekiro is being harder to me than when I tried darksouls for the first time but i'll get there.
    I’m keen to go back to DS and do a dex build with no shield. 
        The best kind of build for any souls game, this and quality build. Quality with red iron twin blade in ds2 was insane
It really is. I still want to roll INTO every fucking swing. So, everyone I know is ravaged by dragon rot. 
    Same. I caught on with the perfect blocking, but those enemies with high posture you're supposed to wear down by dodging and countering, I get wrecked trying to time like DS. 
I got bloodborne and couldn’t get past the first few stages. It was just too difficult for me and I decided I’d play it later. I lost the game and I did sigh in relief. Now my fingers are twitching to buy this game so bad. I’ve been reading how this is harder than the DS and BB games too. Pretty sure I might impulse buy this later this week. 
    I'm in the same boat as you in bloodborne but have gotten a decent way through this game.

Bloodborne just felt too slow for me, so if that was the reason for you than get this game cause it fixes that.
Yeah exactly. My instinct is to roll and dodge, not block so much. I had to retrain my brain to adjust and it took hours. Now if I go back to play Souls or Bloodborne, I’m fucked. 
This. This is totally my experience!
You are entirely, 100% correct. And I love it! I love that it's so similar but so unique at the same time, bringing the same design mentality of Dark souls with a whole new combat system. 

&#x200B;

I am loving this game a LOT more than I thought I would. 
Definitely.  I feel like they did sime stuff JUST to fuck with the vets: Like B/O being a forward lunge instead of a backstep.
Absolutely agree, played every Souls game religiously and this one gave me a run for my money this first week, but now that I’ve finally learnt the combat it’s so much more fun. Thanks, Lady Butterfly! 
Can confirm. This games beating my ass and I can’t break out of old habits. 
Until you get to a later boss and the game forces you to abandon everything you learn and fight it DS/BB style. Fun boss, good lore, but it seemed like a slap in the face.
I went into the game not treating it like a new game rather than a Souls game, so it was actually super easy for me to come to grips with the combat. Game’s still tough as nails though.
Just rebind block to B lol
Yeah it happens mostly for grabs.

I think this might be intentional because almost every grab attack in the Soulsbourne games has had wierd hitboxes. Maybe its because they want the dodge window to be tight and sacrifice the animation for a tighter hitbox. IDK but it seems unlikely that the are capable of making good hitboxes but fail to do it on literally every grab attack.

I mean Dancers terrible telegrab was never patched out or anything ....
The only viable response to thrusts is the mikiri counter.
    Can't even jump over them it's bs but really drives the point home.
        No it drives the point up your ass.
    Deflect works, too. But Mikiri does more poise damage.
dodge into thrust attacks not sideways 
Mikiri Counter and deflect (but mostly Mikiri) are pretty much the only reliable ways to not take damage from a thrust. Unless you can get out of range entirely before he shish-kebabs you.
Mikri dodge. Once you get it you can practice it on the training dummy guy. Dodge into thrust attacks and you step on their weapon. It's one of the first ones in 2nd skill tree. If your talking about the guy with the big ass lance or w.e that hangs out in the building you initially find kuro in, he hits pretty fuckin hard.
>shaft of his spear 

*lenny face* 

You don’t have Mikiri Counter? 
[This would explain it](https://giphy.com/gifs/shia-labeouf-12NUbkX6p4xOO4)
The fucking red eyed giant.........................

So much salt.
>when I try to dodge instead of deflecting

>doing wrong stuff on reflexes

>enemies shouldn't hit me

>enemies shouldn't deal full damage

[You must know how that sounds like, right?](https://pics.me.me/git-gud-28126051.png). 

You clearly know how to fix your problems, you're just complaining it doesn't work the way you want it to. The way Souls used to. Adapt


Yea I've killed her already. Amount of times, I got grabbed though. 
    I just let her die of poison 
        Nice to see a fellow professional around here. It may have taken 15 minutes and 4-6 shuriken but I showed her who's boss.
        I've cheesed stuff in other souls games. Determined to beat everybody without obvious cheese. 
    Same. Was stuck for several hours on that bastard. Finally figured out to play super aggressively and everything worked out.
I think aslong as it's not their hand grabbing you, you can parry some grabs with a perfect parry. Atleast the grabs that involves impalement. For all I know you can parry hands to but I have yet to try that 
Well, I read that PC version is somehow corrupting saves, so I wanted to prevent that.

Copied entire folder and pasted, game loads and I'm back to square one.

Tried contents from copied folder, same.

So. I'm probably gonna rethink how I spend my time. That was a lot of stress.
    There's a script that you can use to backup the game. I use it every time I rest at an idol or beat a boss. 
It's YouTube, not a fashion show... it shows you what you want to see dude.

His Sekiro play though is the best out there hands down.
I'm not great at this game yet, but I played a lot of Souls and Monster Hunter. Most of the time people react too fast when they're doing poorly rather than too slow. These games have beats to them, and the attacks have a rhythm. It helps me to practice on a boss first with sloppy blocking, and then counting out those hits and finding the spaces. These bosses have patterns, and I find the way they string them together really intricate and beautiful for game design. I'm usually too impressed to get frustrated, and I know when I figure it out I'll be that much better. This game is sooo fucking good at teaching you, and swordfighting is such a violent, satisfying ballet.
Here's something I'm not sure if others found for that encounter: If you grapple as fast as possible to the furthest, highest branch when entering the fight, if you jump over her immediately there's a small window to deathblow her first phase. Immediately grapple back up, deathblow her second phase because she always goes into the illusion thing. Its 100% consistent if you're fast enough, and makes it so you only ever have to fight her third phase.
    I tried to do this so many times I ended up spending more time trying to make the fight easier than I would have just fighting her normally.
Yeah just get in close, use it, stun and a good chunk of damage. Divine confetti works well too.
I finally fucking beat him. I’ve been stuck on it for so long when I beat him I almost threw up
Wait, what poison are we talking about? I didn't see any poison around the gunfort approach?
    Nah, that's a different Snake Eyes (probs her sister). There's one more in Ashina Depths, near Poison Pool idol. 
    For the one you’re talking about, there is a small cliff to the left when you first start that battle. If you stand on top of the cliff and get her to chase you then you jump off the cliff, she will follow you off and upon landing she opens herself up to 1 or 2 attacks. Walk back up to the top of the cliff and repeat 
Block while jumping ability=godly
    I must get this!
    I feel like such a badass when I block mid-air
        It’s even better when you deflect mid air, very satisfying. 
            That's more or less what I meant! When I get a parry mid-air is what I should have said! Couldn't agree more though, my friend!
    I tried blocking in mid air against physical attacks, and I was unable to actually use it effectively. I was doing so badly that I thought the mid air block was only for projectiles. 

Why would you jump and then block against physical attacks anyways?
        wondering the same. wasnt even useful for gyoubu
        When hit and running you can ninja jump tf out of there and block on your way out to protect your booty
        The best spot is against demon of hatred when he jumps in the air.

Jump when hes about to land, if you are still too near, the shockwave will hit you so you block to deflect the airblast. If you are far enough, you can grapple back in.

Ita also good against genichiro with his jump stab mixup. If you predict a sweep and jump but he slashes instead, you cam still block to save yourself.

Lastly against projectiles when you jump towards musket and arrows.
Genichiro was so satisfying to fight, everything clicked like a boss or two before but it was this fight where it became a strategic fight with the multiple deflects combos and parry's. God damn best boss fight so far.
    oh you are gonna love the end game
    I wouldn't hesitate to say that Genichiro is up there with Ornstein/Smough or Lady Maria for how much I love fighting them. Amazing boss fight, and though he's hard as hell he really is fair and you can predict his moves/manipulate him at least to an extent. 

&#x200B;

This is what videogames should be. 
    This fight felt like the most fair fight. Lol. So good.
    Phase 2 was much easier imo^
My first post on this sub was me saying the game isn’t for me and I wanted a refund but couldn’t get one. I was stuck at the very first general but now I’m addicted to Samurai death matches. Beat the lance guy on the horse on my second try. Once you get into it everything around you disappears and when it goes right it’s a feeling no other game can give. I haven’t played another game since I started Sekiro and I never played any other soulsbourne. 
    > the lance guy on the horse

HIS NAME IS GYOUBU MASATAKA ONIWA!
        How could I forget. Sorry I’m still just a puppy. 
            There’s a YouTube video on how to cheese her....I caved and and watched because it was looking pretty bleak, it’s funny how broken it is 
            Do you remember what he says when he enters the battlefield? :P
        AND THE CASTLE GATES WILL REMAIN CLOSED!
        AS I BREATHE, YOU WILL NOT PASS THE CASTLE GATES!
        Such a great introduction to the games first big boss.
        Man that VA didn’t have to go so hard, he did that for us 
    THAT... [points at this comment] That right there is why these games are so good. At first, you want to break something, it's so unfair. The regular enemies swarm you and stun lock you to death, you can't block or dodge like you want to, deflect "isn't working..." you grow to hate it, it's so frustrating.

But then you learn.

You start to clue into enemy patterns, reading the opportune moments to retaliate, you learn the area and how to sneak past or stealth kill, you get abilities to augment your arsenal and toughen up your character to last longer... suddenly, these "impossible" encounters become routine displays of shinobi badassery. That unarmed monk that smashed you before gets Ichimonji: Double smashed in the face, you vault over, deal a deathblow, use his blood for mist cover, and you're grappling back into the trees before the others have even noticed... you get better. And for all that practice, you start to feel better about your gameplay and you savor those victories. Winning isn't just a matter of course, it's a badge of honor, and you earned it.

This is why, when people holler about an "easy" mode for these games, I have to laugh. If you truly think the soulsborne games need an easy mode, you aren't ready to play them. 
        > If you truly think the soulsborne games need an easy mode, you aren't ready to play them.

My sentiment exactly. They're designed to be precise, challenging systems and they are exactly what they're supposed to be. 
        “Easy Mode” is default on your first play through, that’s all you get folks. The only way it gets easier is if you figure it out. 
    After you find Kuro at the beginning of the game there's a miniboss right through the gate (where ashina reservoir idol is later in the game). This guy killed me probably 20+ times before I stopped trying to dodge and hit him and instead started reacting to his moves and deflecting. Once I decided to do that he went down instantly. However it wasn't until Gyoubu that I really felt like I was "getting" it. Many people go for Butterfly as their first boss, but I don't think she is supposed to be. Gyoubu is designed perfectly to teach you how to play at that point. He has powerful attacks that can kill you in 1-2 hits but they are all very clearly telegraphed, don't have any weird irregular timing and are easily punishable if deflected. This made me kill him on the first attempt and I finally got the feeling I was doing things right.   
If I had gone for lady Butterfly first things might have been different. 
        I did Butterfly first. It changed the game for me. Until then I had MASSIVE trouble with the game. But that fight taught me how important knowing what defense ability to use, specifically to not be afraid of blocking. Also that fight was awesome. I felt real dumb cause I didn’t know the difference between mini-boss and real boss until then. I’ve played all Soulsbourne games and I walked in that room and was like “oh right.. bosses have cutscenes.” 

I refused to leave until I killed her, so the next boss I found was super easy. The game is still hard to me, but I fucking love it. It’s one of my absolute favorite games of all time now. Every time I’m like “I’m a master of this” I walk into something new. 

Pro tip: Save Divine Confetti and don’t use it on the optional guys, until you unlock the merchant that sells an infinite amount. 
            Keep hearing this and she will fall today.
            I died to her hellas probably 20+ times because I was still too much in dark souls mode. My kill attempt I did everything perfect dont think I even got hit once and interrupted every leap with a shuriken. My GF was watching me and was like "woah, that was badass" and had some second hand excitement for me since she watched me eat shit over and over to her. 
            Where is the merchant that sells infinite amount? I cannot even come close to competing with Headless and everywhere I've read has told me Divine Confetti is required to beat him. (Only boss I've attempted and gave up on, even LadyButterfly I kept at after fifty or more deaths) 
        I dont understand how butterfly could be the first boss for someone. Wouldn't you have to at least fight the drunkard first?
            Real boss, drunkard is a mini boss
        Butterfly isn’t meant as first boss LOL, she’s waaay too difficult but I forced myself through anyway
            I found her pretty easy once I realized the game was very serious about the dodge counter, if you dodge past her and attack she does not counter that and it does health damage, making her  much more manageable. 
            She’s actually really slow with huge openings. But hey. Different strikes for different folks.

AND THE CASTLE GATES WILL REMAIN CLOSED!
AS I BREATHE, YOU WILL NOT PASS THE CASTLE GATES!
Such a great introduction to the games first big boss.
Man that VA didn’t have to go so hard, he did that for us 
> If you truly think the soulsborne games need an easy mode, you aren't ready to play them.

My sentiment exactly. They're designed to be precise, challenging systems and they are exactly what they're supposed to be. 
“Easy Mode” is default on your first play through, that’s all you get folks. The only way it gets easier is if you figure it out. 
I did Butterfly first. It changed the game for me. Until then I had MASSIVE trouble with the game. But that fight taught me how important knowing what defense ability to use, specifically to not be afraid of blocking. Also that fight was awesome. I felt real dumb cause I didn’t know the difference between mini-boss and real boss until then. I’ve played all Soulsbourne games and I walked in that room and was like “oh right.. bosses have cutscenes.” 

I refused to leave until I killed her, so the next boss I found was super easy. The game is still hard to me, but I fucking love it. It’s one of my absolute favorite games of all time now. Every time I’m like “I’m a master of this” I walk into something new. 

Pro tip: Save Divine Confetti and don’t use it on the optional guys, until you unlock the merchant that sells an infinite amount. 
    Keep hearing this and she will fall today.
    I died to her hellas probably 20+ times because I was still too much in dark souls mode. My kill attempt I did everything perfect dont think I even got hit once and interrupted every leap with a shuriken. My GF was watching me and was like "woah, that was badass" and had some second hand excitement for me since she watched me eat shit over and over to her. 
    Where is the merchant that sells infinite amount? I cannot even come close to competing with Headless and everywhere I've read has told me Divine Confetti is required to beat him. (Only boss I've attempted and gave up on, even LadyButterfly I kept at after fifty or more deaths) 
I dont understand how butterfly could be the first boss for someone. Wouldn't you have to at least fight the drunkard first?
    Real boss, drunkard is a mini boss
Butterfly isn’t meant as first boss LOL, she’s waaay too difficult but I forced myself through anyway
    I found her pretty easy once I realized the game was very serious about the dodge counter, if you dodge past her and attack she does not counter that and it does health damage, making her  much more manageable. 
    She’s actually really slow with huge openings. But hey. Different strikes for different folks. 
That's more or less what I meant! When I get a parry mid-air is what I should have said! Couldn't agree more though, my friend!
