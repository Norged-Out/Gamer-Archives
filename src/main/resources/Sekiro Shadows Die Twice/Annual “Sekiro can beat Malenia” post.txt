[[Annual “Sekiro can beat Malenia” post]]





Tbh Wolf probably smells like shit too
    He swam in fountainhead palace I bet it smells so good there
        Smells like confetti, fish and headless there
            So no head?
        He also swam in the dungeons below Ashina Castle and trudged thru Ashina Depths. But the whole main quest line was about collecting the materials to create an incense that would allow Wolf to reach the Divine Dragon, which probably made him smell heavenly.
            Ahhh 👉😎👉
            Agreed and now the real discussion can start. Which game protagonist is the stinkiest is a question that has baffled many for years. Personally, I’m of the opinion that our friendly hunter of Yharnam has an arm the smells like pigshit.
                Ain't no way Bloodborne isn't the smelliest, the entire city is blood, wet dogs, tentacles, and abortions

Edit: Also gunpowder and the British
                I haven’t played bloodborne but the screenshots make it look like one massive toxic swamp. I’m sure the hunter is absolutely disgusting. Then again, Lake of Rot and Caelid in general definitely smells like trenchfoot.
        I bet it smells like funky bulkhead. The whole place smells like under piers and bulkhead during low tide.
        I wouldn't bet on that
    He certainly does after the Guardian Ape bossfight.
It would be so fun to actually fight Malenia as wolf and just L1 spam waterfowl
    Or knock her out of the air with a shuriken like Lady Butterfly when she jumps up to start waterfowl lol
        Or anti air deathblowing her.
    The **clang clang clang'ing** of such an event would reach dangerous levels of frequency and possibly rupture the eardrums of many innocent victims. And it would be beautiful.
        Me when all the small monkeys attack at the same time
    I think if we brought Malenia into Sekiro, her weapon would be imbued with scarlet rot and we'd get status effect buildup even when parrying.
    There’s a Sekiro playstyle mod for Elden Ring already.

Everyone thinks Wolf is tough shit, failing to forget the 50 times Isshin greases your ass before you squeak out one W against him.
    Isshin greases your ass 50 times because *you* can’t beat Isshin.  Canonically, Sekiro kills Isshin in one go.  Because gameplay aside, he wouldn’t get a second attempt.
        isnt the whole game about sekiro being immortal?
            Not when Isshin is wielding the black mortal blade, while is highly implied to be very effective against immortals if the nasty cut Genichiro gave Kuro right before you showed up is any indication
                Yea that’s correct, isshin is wielding something that can kil him
                    Damn I affirm someone’s opinion and I get upvotes. This website easy
                ah, though he was talking about respawing at sculptors idol
                ~~only the red mortal blade can sever immortality,~~ genichiro sacrifices his flesh to summon prime isshin from the underworld using the black mortal blade because he knows that he's the only one that can beat wolf and "save" ashina.

edit: I was wrong, it seems the main difference between the two is the red mortal blade kills anyone who draws it, and the black one doesn't do this, instead you can sacrifice someone and open a gate to the underworld to summon anyone.
                    And how would he beat an immortal without any way to kill him?

Black mortal blade nearly killed Kuro, and his immortality is god tier compared to sekiro's, so much so, that he doesnt even bleed. 

So yeah, black mortal blade can most likely sever immortality
                        It also is the only feasible way Tomoe and Takeru could’ve died. So it must be able to sever immortality
                        In the shura ending when owl comes back he’s actually holding 2 items, the black mortal blade and genichiros head, indicating that he beat genichiro within an inch of his life and severed his immortality with the black mortal blade.
                Licks Cheeto dust off fingers, snorts hard enough to suck snot into diaphragm, scratches ass, exhales hard

> Not when Isshin is wielding the black mortal blade, while is highly implied to be very effective against immortals if the nasty cut Genichiro gave Kuro right before you showed up is any indication
                    Excuse you, I’m a gamer of culture. I was licking sea salt and vinegar dust off my fingers.
                        Fair
            Sekiro can revive in battle but when he dies again i think it's implied ludologically that he dies fr (or at least that that run isn't 'cannon')

basically, what actually happens in sekiro is all the times where you didn't die clipped together, in a way
                I feel it’s a mix.  I don’t think he dies for real if you die twice, the guy’s using the true gift, not an imitation.

However, I do think the Sculptor’s Idols are just a game mechanic, and that throughout the game, he never gets a game over.

In the final battle, he doesn’t even die once.  The Mortal Blade would put him down, period. No second chances.  The only reason it doesn’t is because it would ruin the game for a lot of people.
                    I'm not entirely sure I agree that the mortal blade would kill him, and I think I stand by my assertion that we can think of the game canonically just being the  runs where he doesn't die spliced together.

On the mortal blade, sure if Sekiro were to kill himself with his one then he would die, but correct me if I'm wrong, is there anything that explicitly says that the blade mortal blade would kill immortals if it were to be used that way? My understanding of what it did was that it revived the dead, and for that reason it was to do with mortality and got the name, it is Sekiro's mortal blade that severs the connection between mortals and immortals (in that I don't think Sekiro kills the Divine Dragon, just incapacitates it, because it is immortal by nature)
                        Killing immortals is explicitly what it does.  It’s* why there are things in the game you can’t kill without it.

It’s why Kuro says it can kill immortals.

It’s why Kuro bleeds when he’s stabbed with it.  Kuro doesn’t bleed under normal circumstances.
                            It doesn't kill immortals technically, it severs the connection of undying to immortality, Kuro is a person and therefore a mortal but he is connected to the Divine Dragon, so functionally immortal. The Divine Dragon itself cannot be killed though. The game actually makes this distinction as the Hanbei for instance isn't "Hanbei the immortal", he's "Hanbei the undying", which is what the mortal blade item description says, it is "capable of killing the undying" and not "the immortal". (I think this is an even more deliberate choice when considering that the blade is called the \*mortal\* blade and the choice of word used isn't "immortal" , it's a completely different one. "undying"; especially when we consider that "undying" is an odd term in that it doesn't mean "cannot" die but something that "does not" die.) 

On the black mortal blade though, the black scroll only actually says it has the ability to "open a gate to the underworld", it never explicitly states that it can kill undying, like the crimson mortal blade can. Though it's curious that it can make Kuro bleed in the cutscene before Isshin, I think it's a jump to go from "it can make him bleed" to "it can kill immortals".
                                “Kuro: Wolf, that sword on your back, is it...

Sekiro: It is the Mortal Blade.

Kuro: The sword that can kill those who cannot die...

Sekiro: Yes. It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.”

Alternately, 

“Kuro: The sword that can kill those who cannot die... I didn't expect you to find it so quickly.

Sekiro: Yes. It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.”

“IMMORTALITY SEVERED”

The Red Mortal Blade and the Black Mortal Blade both do the same thing, which is why Genichiro found it in the first place to bleed Kuro, and why Isshin uses it to fight you in both endings.  Because killing you would be pointless if you just came back, still as a Shura.
                                They wouldn’t be called mortal blades if they couldn’t sever immortality. Black blade is called Open Gate and has an additional ability to open a gate to the underworld. Red blade is called Gracious Gift of Tears and has an additional ability to extract tears from the Sakura dragon.
                                    where does it say that every mortal blade severs immortality? what i got from it was that the mortal blades interact with mortality in different ways, in that the crimson mortal blade restores it in severing immortality and making someone mortal again and the black mortal black restores it in bringing people back to life. from what we know i think this is a stronger view
                                Is there YouTubers who nerd out to the lore this deep similarly to guys like Smoughtown for Elden Ring? I can only ever find short rundowns or plot summaries
                                    not to my knowledge unfortunately :(
usually the lore is only spoken about either in critiques of the game or those plot summaries; reddit seems to be the only place to care
                                this man really wrote an essay about how undying is different to being immortal, props to this guy.
                                    i can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic but i’ll take the compliment 😊
                        Nah, if kills are canon then we wouldnt fight genichiro everytime we wanna fight isshin
                    I actually have a headcanon that Sekiro canonically dies twice in the entire game. Once in Hirata and the second? I was thinking about how, if we knew when the other death was, we might be able to state the canon ending and vice versa. I'm sure other people have had this thought and maybe it was even figured out. Sadly I don't really keep up-to-date on this kinda stuff so...
                        Drawing the mortal blade is a canon death.
                            Forgot about that with how long it's been. Which is hilarious considering how often you return to that room to get the third ending option
                after his power is drained via dying too much it kills and damages the people around him wich means thst we have probably been fighting way easier versions of the bosses we were fighting that is if the amount of tines we have died is canon
                    I don't necessarily think so as the dragonrot seems to act like a disease which kills individuals, it doesn't necessarily take power from the world around it generally, it takes from individuals. There aren't any bosses who seem to be afflicted with it, so I don't agree
            Isshin has a mortal blade.
    Theres no shame in losing one battle, but you must take revenge by any means nesecary.
        Thank you father
    Yes that’s because Isshin is built entirely different and most certainly could also beat Malenia
    It doesn’t matter how many times you die if you win and have a weapon to murder immortal foes 👉🧠👈
    U forget isshin would absolutely mess Malenia up. Hes a fucking beast, whats yo point ?
    That just means there's someone else that can wipe Melania
    No death except for cutscene deaths are canon in SEKIRO
    Isshin is slow, predictable and open to your strikes if you can use anything more than very lazy rmb. It was 0 times, actually. Waaaaaaaay easier than way to him.
Ain’t even. Got. Legs.
    "He even got that dragon rot that makes him double immortal for some reason. He don't even need it."  
"Don't EVEN need it."
        How does it feeeeeel Malenia?
            "To be a bitch"
    She doesn't have eyes either
    Can't even double dutch😤
“Annual”?  That’s uh… conservative.
    “Annual” as in; “I’m making these whenever I want to start an argument
    Annually if 1 hour= 1 year
Ain't even got legs!
How's it feeeel Malenia?
You forgot shes a ginger. So insta terror buildup
>Second form is hot

Y’all need to raise your standards so you can tell the difference between “naked” and “hot”.  Her privates have fully rotted away.  Look at yourself.
    Hot is subjective, as is the need for orifices. 

^(wait wat)
    My brother there are formless monstrosities beyond mortal ken that I’d give a crack at. All I’m reading from you is you have no ambition
Wolf's second form is Shura, which is also hot (literally) and scary
    Touché
If we play as Wolf then obviously we can beat anyone in  ER, similarly we can faceroll any sekiro boss as Tarnished, what's the point? 

From the lore pov malenia shits on sekiro verse, completely different levels
    Im not sure, with taking lore into consideration and not having wolf as the mc im really not sure how you win against immortality. Could she like cut a really big rock out of the ground and put it on top of him? I think that would trap him which should probably count as a win.
        Sekiro couldn't even regenerate a severed arm. His immortality clearly has major limitations. He's not fighting after getting atomized by a sword swing strong enough to match Radahn's gravity magic that he uses to amp his attacks.
            This is my personal headcanon, but the reason he didn’t regen the arm was only because he didn’t die. 

Divine dragon is also missing an arm. I too think that was because it wasn’t a mortal wound and healed naturally.
                Why doesn't he get his arm back with subsequent deaths?
                    Healed naturally.

I think the immortality returns a user to their most recent healthy state.
            for some reason was hard for me to remember him loosing his arm, your right.
            You're forgetting that Sekiro can literally fall hundreds of feet and be fine and is capable of parrying the divine dragon. He is a full blown demigod in his own right. Malenia ain't atomizing Jack shit 😂
                Falling hundreds of feet isn't even worth noting, not to mention that it's completely untrue. Fall damage exists, and you can die if you fall off a cliff.

Sekiro does not canonically party the Divine Dragon; that's just an oversight/gameplay mechanic. You cannot beat it at all with parrying; you have to use lightning reversal. On tne other hand, he *was* canonically fully incapable of doing any damage to some generic metal armor.

Malenia was a match for Radahn, who's literally so powerful that he can freeze entire constellations of stars in place with his gravity magic. She is absolutely atomizing him with a single swing. Her scarlet rot also affects things on the metaphysical level, such as rotting shards of the Elden Ring which is a collection of concepts used to control the laws of reality. It would completely erase Sekiro.
                    Bro just said parrying the wind gust of the divine dragon is just gameplay mechanics but only being able to stagger armored warrior is absolutely canon… cherry-picking much?
                        I'm going off of how the fights go. They're gimmick bosses with only one way to do them. Hence, that way is what's canon. If they intended for Sekiro to actually be strong enough to parry DD, they would have scoffed at the idea of armored warrior being a problem.
                            Canonically sekiro could stagger and push him off once, we never actually see what happens if he just keeps hitting him.

Sekiro could literally block the snake as well.
                                Continuously hitting him does zero damage. His HP doesn't go down at all; it's specifically programmed for him to do zero damage.

Parrying the snake also does nothing to it, and iirc, you still take some damage from it regardless.

People really need to chill with this Sekiro hype. Lore-wise, he's literally the weakest fromsoft protagonist. The verse has virtually zero feats. D'S protagonist can seal a reality-damaging demon, DS protagonists fuel a star that keeps time itself functioning, BB protagonist kills eldritch gods that create entire dimensions, ER protagonist kills a conceptual god that creates a dimension and controls the very laws of reality with the Elden Ring. 

Sorry, but no one in Sekiro even comes close. People need to chill with the wank.
                                    Yes that’s a gameplay mechanic… do you really believe sekiro wouldn’t eventually hurt him if he just kept chipping away?

Whether it does anything to the snake is irrelevant, the fact that sekiro could block that kind of force easily puts him at the top.

Lore and gameplay don’t match up at all, shit the the gods of bloodborne that can create universes or whatever and the most they can do is hit you…

If you go by pure gameplay mechanics (feats we can actually see) then sekiro is easily at the top.
                                    What conceptual god did the ER protagonist kill? Elden beast was basically a proxy, not the actual greater will.
                                    Im pretty sure it's stated that the divine dragon drove away the buddha and the great serpert god who we killed and parryed, expert for the buddha but you know why.
                    Parrying the dragon is not at all an oversight when they make one of the snake encounter be undeflectable no matter what. 

If they don’t want you deflecting something, they can make it happen. Sekiro can deflect the dragon.
                        No, they don't bother to do disable it because there's no reason to. Parrying it does literally nothing; the k my wsh to defeat jt is lightning reversal.

Again, Sekiro was completely incapable of even denying metal armor. If he was canonically capable of matching the divine dragon's strength, then he would have zero issue with some generic armor.
                            It increases its posture. By this same logic he shouldn’t be able to match demon of hatred or guardian ape

The metal armor doesn’t even matter in this fight because Malenia doesn’t have armor in any vital places.
                                It doesn't do any *real* posture damage. The only way to break its posture is through lightning reversal. This has been tested.

He isn't strong enough to break basic metal. That's the point. He's not harming someone with a body far tougher than some random metal from medieval Europe.
                                    Malenia can be hurt by a literal rock
                    This is gonna be fun 😂 

>Falling hundreds of feet isn't even worth noting, not to mention that it's completely untrue. Fall damage exists, and you can die if you fall off a cliff.

THAT'S a gameplay mechanic buddy. If you land on hard ground you literally will not have a scratch, you only take damage when going out of bounds. 

>Sekiro does not canonically party the Divine Dragon; that's just an oversight/gameplay mechanic. You cannot beat it at all with parrying; you have to use lightning reversal. On the other hand, he was canonically fully incapable of doing any damage to some generic metal armor.

You are missing the point completely, what a surprise! I'm talking about his physical capabilities. He is capable of trading blows with a being the size of several buildings, that's a fact. 

>Malenia was a match for Radahn, who's literally so powerful that he can freeze entire constellations of stars in place with his gravity magic.

As a huge Radahn fanboy, this is just so false. We literally see the "star" Radahn was holding fall and it's just a single meteor. She also wasn't really a match for him considering that she only even survived because of the scarlet aeonia bloom and Finlay being a badass. She couldn't beat him based on skill though. 

Sekiro could literally just kill himself right after she uses Scarlet Rot and then resurrect afterwards and be fine. Lore wise his resurrections appear to be limitless if he has stuff to draw life from so he could do it as many times as he needs to. There is also in-universe medicine that heals the scarlet rot.

There's also absolutely zero evidence she can do that super bloom whenever she likes. That first one was so powerful because it was the first. If she did that every time she bloomed, Elphael would all be another Caelid and we could not have defeated her. 

>It would completely erase Sekiro.

You mean like it completely erased Malenia's and Radahn's armies? Dude gtfoh that's not even how the rot works, you're talking out your ass.
                        > She couldn't beat him based on skill though.

She did fight him to a standstill purely with her skills. She blooms to end the stalemate.

>Battle of Aeonia. Radahn and Malenia locked in stalemate. Then, the scarlet rot blooms.
                            OK yeah, that's fair. I was going off the image of her on her knees but I swear From has made it intentionally contradictory. I wonder how the Japanese put it actually that would settle all debates! Might have to look for a smoughtown vid real quick lol.
                                She wasn't on her knees though. And from what I've seen, most JP fans don't care about the Radahn vs Malenia debates since the lore made it clear that the battle ended in a stalemate.
                                    Ah, that's not what I meant. I'm referring to how things can sometimes not translate very well from Japanese to English and Smoughtown has a friend who is fluent in Japanese and has discovered some really interesting details in the original version.
                        No, you do take fall damage from great heights. It's not "out of bounds"; it's a fall from a cliff that kills you. Some solid copium right there. Also, once again, surviving falls is negligible fodder in terms of feats.

No he's not. If he were some generic armor wouldn't be an issue for him. End of story. Parrying the divine dragon canonically does not happen; it's not intended by the developers and doesn't press posture at all. Sekiro only does lightning reversals for the fight.

Radahn holds back everything in the sky. That was a Fallingstar, aka a meteor, which astrologer NPCs and item descriptions repeatedly distinguish from actual stars which form constellations and can be seen in space which meteors can't. Not to mention that the actual stars have a plethora of other characteristics incompatible with simple meteors.

Malenia is repeatedly stated to have fought him to a stalemate before she used scarlet rot to end the fight. We also see her move to fight him directly right before the fight in the trailer. Preserving Boluses are only there for gameplay, hence why the item descriptions has zero lore and why no one ever mentions them or tries to use them to cure rot. The rot is treated in canon as incurable.

Once again, Sekiro's immortality is very limited. He can't even do something as basic as regenerating limbs. Also, killing himself to get rid of status ailments is completely OOC.

She does the bloom all the time in her Goddess of Rot form. When has a soulsborne game ever had such a level of destruction in gameplay? That's literally impossible for them to do on a technical level. Of course they aren't going to have her destroy a massive portion of the map repeatedly in combat; don't be absurd.

Radahn is explictly only still there because his great rune combined with his willpower have just slowed down the rot. His army was never hit directly by the rot, only by very distant collateral damage. Her rot has completely afflicted her own great tune and has damaged Radahn's. Those are *fact*.
                            Spitting absolute facts right here 🔥
                            Spitting straight facts right there. Too bad your comment is gonna get buried lol.
                        Finlay is star level confirmed

(I will admit scarlet rot may be Malenia’s only win condition, but Sekiro has two ways to deal with it. Resurrection to heal, and MAYBE divine grass, but that one is a reach. But then again, in lore rot is halted by fire and Sekiro loves fire)
                            We all need at least one Finlay tier friend 😭 I like to imagine her stopping Radahn's blade an inch from Malenia's head, dropping a badass one-liner and dipping before Radahn can say snack lol. Such a cool character. 

>MAYBE divine grass

Good point actually. I didn't even think about that. 

>Sekiro loves fire

Fuck yeah, he does. Gotta wonder if the Lazulite flames would hurt Malenia and/or stop scarlet rot.
                Guy who can fall and deflect a big sword when scarlet aeonia:
                    Guy with flamethrower built into his arm when scarlet Aeonia:
            Immortality and the ability to literally regrow limbs are two completely different abilities you do realize that right
                If he can't even regrow limbs, that means he's not coming back to action from those kinds of injuries, let alone the bigger ones Malenia can cause him.
                    Yet without an immortal blade she still wouldn’t be able to kill him at worst all she could do is dismember him, I would give her more benefit of the doubt if she was somehow able to have knowledge about the immortal blade but she doesn’t, she would have to use wolf’s own immortal blade to kill him but she wouldn’t instinctively just do that or know to do that so yeah the worst she could really do is just immobilize him  unless she was able to figure out what his blade is/does
                        Dismembering him would put him out of the fight (which is a W), and the advantage she has in raw strength is enough for her to at least vaporize him, which his immortality definitely wouldn't bring him back from if it can't even regenerate limbs after death.

His immortality just isn't a factor against beings that do more than just regular blunt damage or stabbing. It doesn't help if his opponent goes for dismemberment or is strong enough to completely destroy his body.
        It doesn't seem like he regenerates, so she can probably just cut him into pieces and keep them apart. He might still be alive, but he ain't doing much.
            He’ll be resurrecting constantly. DRAGONROT FOR ALL!!
            Your right, she can just cut of his limbs then.
        He couldn't even harm a knight in plate armor with his toothpick sword.
            Yeah but does malenia have full body armor? Argument won, my logic is flawless/j
                Especially in second phase
        Wolf has no regeneration ability so Malenia could cut his limbs off or just use the rot on him which would make Wolf lose his mind like Radahn but unlike Radahn who has a great rune that "burns to resist the encroachment of the scarlet rot", Wolf has no great rune or something like that so I think the rot will just melt/evaporate his flesh completely.
            Rot wouldn't even be needed. He ain't getting past her base form. Just like Maliketh fighting as beast clergyman would annihilate all of sekiro.
                Her base form… really…
                    She fought Radahn to a standstill with her skills alone (the bloom happens after they were locked in a stalemate and she gets KO'd by her own OP attack). She is revered for her undefeated prowess and gained wings of "unparalleled strength". She hits harder than a [tank](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/v25297/i_did_some_math_on_malenias_waterfowl_dance/), is [pretty fast](https://imgur.com/nVOyIfO), and is the best swordsman in Lands Between so yeah, I don't see how Sekiro can beat Malenia (lorewise).

And that’s the low ball estimate.
                            And Malenia matched a [sword blow](https://imgur.com/2W3LeKy) from Radahn who is bigger than her by a LOT and is known for his mighty strength which also means Malenia can easily deflect Sekiro's attacks.
                                Yeah. So can Isshin.
                                    Cool.
                        I wouldn’t try to math it out precisely how strong she is, the intention most likely isn’t there, they’re most likely just going with “she’s fast” rather than “she’s so strong that she’s this fast” or whatnot. 
>her own underfeated prowess 

Same with isshin, he’s a sword saint after all and wolf beat him

>is pretty fast

So’s wolf
                            Isshin is strong and Wolf is fast, yeah, but they don't come close to Malenia in terms of power. Malenia is one of the strongest characters in Elden Ring, she fought Radahn (mightiest demigod) to a standstill only with her skills and she herself is the avatar of Rot, a deadly curse that is incurable. I don't see how Isshin or Sekiro could beat Malenia. They can't even beat Mohg or Morgott.
                                > but they don't come close to Malenia in terms of power.

I do agree that Malenia is most likely physically stronger, so you do have me there... my stance is that Wolf is faster and more skilled. Combined with his shinobi tools he should prevail, of course this is just my opinion.

> I don't see how Isshin or Sekiro could beat Malenia. They can't even beat Mohg or Morgott.

I mean both Isshin and Sekiro are more than likely more skilled than her, which can go a long way, if you've seen MHA then think of Stain vs Deku and Co. They should at ***least*** have relevant strength against her, enough to deflect. If not then they should be fine dodging.
                                    Why do you think they're more skilled than her? Malenia is a demigod, she has lived probably more than 5000 years and has canonically never known defeat (until she met Tarnished). She's definitely more skilled than both.
    Glock Saint when I pull up with stars of ruin:
    She’d have to be stronger than divine dragon and faster than Isshin to even threaten him in lore, and as she appears in game and cutscenes, she only matched Isshin’s speed, not to mention In-lore Dragonrot just randomly affects people, so if killed, there’s a chance Sekiro just gives her Dragonrot in addition to her already rotting away body. And that’s only IF she could kill him
        Malenia hits harder and is [faster than](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/ypwux9/sword_saint_isshin_ashina_sekiro_vs_malenia_blade/ivmzjib/) Isshin, and Malenia in her Goddess of Rot form obliterates the Divine Dragon.
            Ok, forgot her sword was longer, but she doesn’t output more energy than Divine dragon. 

Also should mention, Sekiro can literally use a better version of waterfowl dance that has more slashes
                Ok I agree with you

Sekiro/Divine Dragon/whatever solos Elden Ring universe
    didn't like the divine dragon drove away the buddha and the great serpent who we killed and are stated to be a god?
    Lore pov doesn't matter because the writers can do whatever the hell they want. If Miyazaki wants Wolf or anyone to be stronger, he or anyone will be.
I don’t get the boners for Malenia. Half her face is rotted away and her genitals are infested and probably smell worse than an open dumpster in the sunlight. Is it just because she doesn’t have clothes on? Are the standards so low?
    It’s because they all got their ass kicked by a disabled girl with the anatomy of a Barbie doll and have developed Stockholm syndrome from how long they’ve been stuck on the fight
    She's tall, ginger and naked. That's all they fucking need 😂
I think you forgot mikiri counter for wolf
    Danggit!
“Probably smells horrible”

I never thought about that.  She’s literally rotting to death.  Blegh
Am still goin in
Buckler shield proves Wolf would own that fight.
wolf is immortal, one of the very few advantage he has against her. he only need this one ngl
    Afaik wolf can only respawn once canonically
        When kuro met wolf again after geni, he asked how many times has wolf died for him 10s or more than that. So no, you are wrong
        Well no because that would literally defeat the point of it being Canon that canonically the only thing that can kill people like wolf is a sword that only exists in his universe
Don’t forget mid-air death blow, Sekiro HARD hard counters
If Wolf was the one fighting her she would actually be a good boss fight
Considering I’ve seen people on Elden ring beat her by parrying her I’d say Sekrio is certainly capable of defeating her.
Not to mention she's knocked outa the air with one shuriken
dragon rot?
I feel like the whole Haligtree would stand perfectly still for a moment when Malenia performs a Waterfowl Dance to it's completion and Wolf parries every last swing.
I want a sekiro 2 SO BAD
Ngl I'd love to see the sheer terror on Malenias face after wolf perfect counters waterfowl dance.
    I think you can't parry waterflow dance.
        Considering the stuff I've seen wolf parry, seems 100% in the tool kit.
Melania “all these dip shits keep coming to fight me even after I kill some of them over 200 times.
Wolf “I get it dip shits keep getting me killed to the same dude 200 times” 
Both “Fuck this let’s get out of here” 
And they lived happily ever after
    Miquella and Kuro became BFFs too
How's it feel Malenia?

To be a bitchhhhh
*clears throat*

 Aerial death blow.

*steps away from mic*
Is this meme or are you serious?
    Yes
Y'all are forgetting Sekiro's true ace in the hole: Anti-Air Deathblow. Malenia doesn't stand a chance because the second she goes airborne she gets a sword through her.
“How’s it feeeeeel Seath? To be a bitch”
I know this is a shitpost but for someone that wants a single reason. Sekiro is basically unkillable, Malenia is not. Its all in the determination, like every souls like. 

And if you don't use magic in elden ring Sekiro is 100% the strongest meele fighter out of all the fromsoftware souls likes.
    Sekiro can deflect magic anyways
Everyone is hard countered by wolf. As long as they attack he can parry them. He can even just mist raven if it’s a grab
    HE CAN UMBRELLA GRABS
Lore wise, Malenia would wipe the floor with Wolf, unless he could respawn.

Gameplay wise, Malenia almost feels like she was designed to be a Sekiro boss.
    But Sekiro in lore respawns
        I know, that's why I said "unless". There are instances where he can no longer respawn, like after the game's endings (except for shura).

Respawn is a free win card anyway. I am saying that if Malenia and Wolf were to have an honest showdown, Wolf wouldn't stand a chance.
            When has wolf ever fight honestly though ;D
                What's the point of powerscaling and comparing them if we don't only account for skill and we only go off of "wolf can infinitely respawn, therefore wins"
                    He can’t infinitely respawn, just until there’s nobody left to steal life force from… ^(so we just have kill everyone else first)
I’m for wolf winning, due to the fact that he can catch lightning and is pretty strong in his own right i think he can win via out speeding or out skilling
Wouldn't lore wise malenia smash wolf since she is an empyrean and thus is strong enough to essesntially become a literal god? I might be wrong tho
    That’s just a title. Sekiro went against the god of the divine realm and beat him for the Gracious Gift of Tears but that doesn’t mean he can slay a God in any verse.
        Ah, but that god could throw literal shockwaves with a building sized weapon. Can Malenia do that? 👉🧠👈
            Yup, was leaning towards Sekiro having the capability to defeat her. 

My point being that Godhood doesn’t make you safe from our funny shinobi.
Is Maliketh Black Blade a reskin of a mortal blade?
    Technically yes.
Prove me wrong but… Pretty sure Sekiro actually can’t parry or mikiri counter stink. I’ve never seen anyone parry the headless ape’s shit throw or fart cloud. And Malenia is basically a walking fart cloud.
    He can umbrella it
Let me Solo Her > Sekiro
    Who do you think trained him smh
Smash
true
Sekiro cant do any damage to some avereged armored dude. He would get bodied by Rick Soldier of God
    That’s Sekiro like halfway through the game, not at his peak, at best it’s an outlier considering that Sekiro fights other superhumanly strong humans and monsters and canonically clashes with them.

Isshin for example can split armored men in half.
        I accept this answer.
            Thank you!
        OH YEAH. We can scale him to Isshin’s strength!
        He also can’t easily stagger bandits with wooden shields. That’s near the end of the game.

I wouldn’t assume that gameplay mechanics translate into actual capabilities unless its plot related
            >that’s near the end of the game

It’s weird I know, but most consistently he’s been shown to have superhuman strength.
>gameplay mechanics Translate into actual abilities unless it’s plot related

It is plot related, he canonically deflects all of his foes, it’s his fighting style. Also, there’s a lot of intention behind some gameplay mechanics
                His fighting style also involves acrobatics and dodges. Thus you cannot assume that he can canonically deflect all attacks
                    No, the lore literally says that he prefers to deflect
                        “Prefers” doesn’t mean being able to deflect everything
                            It does mean though that it’s a preferred tactic, also, you can deflect the enemies in gameplay, which has a lot of intention behind it
                                Does the same apply to the bloodborne hunter? Dodging is the main method of avoiding damage, so similarly there is a lot of intention. He has dodging i-frames that let him take no damage from AOEs.

Do you actually think he is canonically undamaged when dodging in the middle of big fire attacks?
                                    >Dodging is the main method of avoiding damage, so similarly there is a lot of intention.

No, in Sekiro's case there's lore behind it, plus the fact that the deflections are a full fledged animation that interacts with the enemy. Look at the guardian ape fight for instance [there's a clear reaction between both animations](https://youtu.be/_EB2wZVNlH0?t=158). It's also just a move that makes sense, deflecting like that makes sense, but invincibility like that? Nah, I don’t think so.
    Malenia doesn’t wear armor, and those dudes can be hurt by regular iron katanas anyways
"Is not a girl"

What child created this?
    Me
Not a girl is a plus tho
It’s ok, just call for LetMeSoloHer
Wolf would clap eveyr single eldensoulsborne boss no contest, it's not even close. I cannot think of a single one he'd lose to.
She would humble wolf
    Downvoted for speaking the truth. I also see these clowns saying Isshin would beat Maliketh lmao when he'd pretty much break every single bone in his body. Immortality wouldn't matter when you have no bones left.
        Wait. Who’s saying Isshin could beat Maliketh???
            Quiet a lot in this sub. Their argument is that Maliketh doesn't have mortal blade so Isshin wins.
                … MALIKETH IS A WALKING MORTAL BLADE

(While the specifics of Destined death are up for debate, I still think it functions like the mortal blade would)
        Fr wolfs posture would break so fast against her onslaught attack along with having no way to g dapple anything
            If you’re constantly parrying your posture won’t break
                You forget she gains health every block so blocking is just gonna heal her and she attacks relentlessly
                    Parrying her does not give health back though
                        With a Shield yes but with a sword she will gain health
                            Ok but health doesn’t really matter in sekiro, the way this battle would work is if the mechanics were: Malenia in sekiro or sekiro v Malenia in Elden ring
                                So it depends on the game world we fighting in

Wolf tops in his world 

Malenia tops in her world
                                    Staggering is still a thing in Elden ring so no
                                    Yeah Malenia ported into sekiro hard clapped by wolf, wolf in Elden Ring probably end as a stalemate
                            You literally can parry her with a sword
                        It would take forever though
Your forgot that : Is a wolf and not a bitch
Bro can't even beat Mohg or Morgott and you expect him to beat Malenia? 💀
    He could totally beat Morgott. Mohg would probably kill him once with NIHIL but he can resurrect so who cares.
        He can beat them only in fanfictions
            Fatal respiratory infection go: *cough*
                Can Sekiro beat Radahn, Godfrey, or Maliketh?
                    Godfrey, yes. Sekiro’s whole fighting style (paired with umbrella only) counters everything Godfrey has. It basically be super Saiyan chained ogre with no fire weakness. 

Maliketh, harder to say for one reason. In game, only the blasphemous claw can parry destined death, but there’s one spell that can redirect the ranged attacks. Also, the purple umbrella can deflect the mortal draw, which looks to be equivalent to destined death. So if you allow anything else to deflect destined death, Sekiro wins for sure, if not, it’s a gamble, but Sekiro still has a ton of counters. He can deflect non-destined death attacks and dodge many of the other attacks maliketh has, and finally, the Malcontent can stall Maliketh long enough for some good hits. There’s also the Mist raven that can be used to avoid destined death. 

Radahn, this one is very hard. If you consider Radahn using electromagnetic lightning, *MAYBE* Sekiro can redirect it, but without that, Sekiro can still deflect anything that isn’t that and could possibly deflect the shockwave pull, as he can deflect the Demon of Hatred’s shockwave. The Radahn meteor, you can argue he can’t deflect it, but mist raven. (Keep in mind this is Rotted Radahn, not Prime Radahn). It also should be noted you can jump the electromagnetic lightning in ER, so Sekiro should be good. Malcontent could even turn Leonard against Radahn.
                        Sekiro can't dodge Chadfrey's grab attack though. :P

There's no way Sekiro can beat Maliketh in any scenario. You're forgetting that Maliketh is fast enough to dodge literally every attack from Sekiro and he is literally death itself. Maliketh slaughters Sekiro and it's not even close.

Radahn absolutely wipes him too. He doesn't even need to turn into a meteor to destroy him. Radahn is terribly huge, controls gravity, and uses two greatswords. He swings them and Sekiro is dead. Idk man youre really underestimating the power levels of the demigods. The only demigod Sekiro can beat is Godrick.
                            Umbrella deflects grabs. 

Maliketh is just as fast as Demon of Hatred

Sekiro can deflect divine dragon. Radahn’s swords are no problem
                                Bro 💀
Yea, try to counter a waterfowl with the sekiro deflect mechanic. Sure. Also smells horrible should be a plus tbh, what if you're into smelly ladies
    I mean you can deflect one mind, waterfowl isn’t very different
        Her hp bar will be full and posture regen will be super fast again
            She doesn’t gain hp when you parry any of her other attacks so waterfowl shouldn’t be an exception
                You can't parry in sekiro, only deflect
                    ^(It’s the same thing)
        Sure. With an umbrella
            [no](https://youtu.be/uGIRgaKY58A?si=9ImxEyyUy_ovZ_vc)
                Let me guess. You linked me a video of someone deflecting it with frame perfect timing despite noone being able to replicate this consistently ever
                    It’s not that hard to deflect it, i wouldn’t say it’s consistent but i’ve done it and a bunch of other people on youtube did too, the point i was trying to make is that it’s possible anyway, i wasn’t claiming that you could beat malenia hitless or anything like that
+ Sekiro actually know how to dodge.
Wolf wins...after 30+ attempts.
Taking parry as a catch-all is the same as acting like rolling iframes exist in-universe. It definitely isn’t the case
    When you can parry a building sized sword, anything less than that might as well be a catch all
        Similarly, you can roll in the middle of giant explosions of death magic in elden ring. 

In both cases, it probably isn’t canon
            Rolling in most of the explosions of Elden ring still gets you caught in the radius. (Unless you mean rolling out of them.)

The difference being that the deflects directly affect your opponents. Why would Sekiro’s deflects not be canon when his whole fighting style revolves around it and it’s pretty much the only way he’s won various fights.
                Nope u can i-frame many explosions including maliketh’s stabbing rock pulse attack.
                    I was thinking of ones like Placidusax’s nuke or Malenia’s aeonia
                        Sure, but my comment still stands. You can iframe some explosions in elden ring. Does that make it canon?
                            Uh. Idk. You can roll some explosions but not others. So yes?
                                See personally i would say no, because iframes make no sense in canon. 

Hence why i also think similar gameplay mechanics in sekiro are not canon

But if you believe this is canon, then i can see why you feel that sekiro can canonically deflect basically every attack
The real question is: would she get health back when you deflect? Wolf would go down so quick if he could only dodge.
    She doesn’t heal on parries, so no.
        I’ll give this one to the Wolf then.
I think the post is a joke but I'll throw my 2 cents in. Malenia would beat Sekiro mid-high diff. Her healing and rot powers are too strong.
    Cant heal on deflects ;p
        I don't think Sekiro deflecting counts as Elden Ring parrying though. They are pretty different.
            Not really.

There’s a sword parry in Elden ring after all
                No like when you parry in Elden Ring you knock their arm away. The attack doesn't connect. In Sekiro when you deflect the attack still connects but no damage is dealt.

Look at it this way, in Elden Ring when you parry enemy gets stance broken and you can do a critical strike. In Sekiro deflecting builds their posture bar until it's full then they break and you can do a critical strike. That's why parry and deflect are different.
                    With a deflect, the attack is still pushed away, you just don’t throw off the enemy until posture is broken. 

I think charmless is the best way to show that, like blocking in Elden ring, you can still take chip damage, but when deflecting you take none.
                        Well no the attack isn't pushed away. Well at least in most cases I've seen it's not. I won't argue about deflection anymore because it won't anywhere. 

Malenia still beats Sekiro
The battle of the monoplegic
Monthly\*

as opposed to weekly "Sekiro ruined gaming"
    What yearly and daily then?
She would be an amazing boss in sekiro...she was re purposed from cut sekiro content clearly
It's like how isshin will be easy in souls and malenia will be easy in sekiro
Frankly I believe the Wolf can beat any fromsoft boss because of his parries. And if it's a magic using boss he can just quickly close the distance and annihilate them.
    He can parry magic too
        Doesn't he take some chip dmg?
            Not with a confetti buff!
                Oh damn. I did not know that. That makes him even more op then
                    He's also got a selection of umbrellas to counter magic.
Annual?? More like daily or at least weekly
"Probably"
how does anyone find her form scary? there's nothing scary about her, she's just annoying overall
    She’s scary because she’s nude
        Lol that's funny
He swam in fountainhead palace I bet it smells so good there
    Smells like confetti, fish and headless there
        So no head?
    He also swam in the dungeons below Ashina Castle and trudged thru Ashina Depths. But the whole main quest line was about collecting the materials to create an incense that would allow Wolf to reach the Divine Dragon, which probably made him smell heavenly.
        Ahhh 👉😎👉
        Agreed and now the real discussion can start. Which game protagonist is the stinkiest is a question that has baffled many for years. Personally, I’m of the opinion that our friendly hunter of Yharnam has an arm the smells like pigshit.
            Ain't no way Bloodborne isn't the smelliest, the entire city is blood, wet dogs, tentacles, and abortions

Edit: Also gunpowder and the British
            I haven’t played bloodborne but the screenshots make it look like one massive toxic swamp. I’m sure the hunter is absolutely disgusting. Then again, Lake of Rot and Caelid in general definitely smells like trenchfoot.
    I bet it smells like funky bulkhead. The whole place smells like under piers and bulkhead during low tide.
    I wouldn't bet on that
He certainly does after the Guardian Ape bossfight.
Or knock her out of the air with a shuriken like Lady Butterfly when she jumps up to start waterfowl lol
    Or anti air deathblowing her.
The **clang clang clang'ing** of such an event would reach dangerous levels of frequency and possibly rupture the eardrums of many innocent victims. And it would be beautiful.
    Me when all the small monkeys attack at the same time
I think if we brought Malenia into Sekiro, her weapon would be imbued with scarlet rot and we'd get status effect buildup even when parrying.
There’s a Sekiro playstyle mod for Elden Ring already.

Isshin greases your ass 50 times because *you* can’t beat Isshin.  Canonically, Sekiro kills Isshin in one go.  Because gameplay aside, he wouldn’t get a second attempt.
    isnt the whole game about sekiro being immortal?
        Not when Isshin is wielding the black mortal blade, while is highly implied to be very effective against immortals if the nasty cut Genichiro gave Kuro right before you showed up is any indication
            Yea that’s correct, isshin is wielding something that can kil him
                Damn I affirm someone’s opinion and I get upvotes. This website easy
            ah, though he was talking about respawing at sculptors idol
            ~~only the red mortal blade can sever immortality,~~ genichiro sacrifices his flesh to summon prime isshin from the underworld using the black mortal blade because he knows that he's the only one that can beat wolf and "save" ashina.

edit: I was wrong, it seems the main difference between the two is the red mortal blade kills anyone who draws it, and the black one doesn't do this, instead you can sacrifice someone and open a gate to the underworld to summon anyone.
                And how would he beat an immortal without any way to kill him?

Black mortal blade nearly killed Kuro, and his immortality is god tier compared to sekiro's, so much so, that he doesnt even bleed. 

So yeah, black mortal blade can most likely sever immortality
                    It also is the only feasible way Tomoe and Takeru could’ve died. So it must be able to sever immortality
                    In the shura ending when owl comes back he’s actually holding 2 items, the black mortal blade and genichiros head, indicating that he beat genichiro within an inch of his life and severed his immortality with the black mortal blade.

> Not when Isshin is wielding the black mortal blade, while is highly implied to be very effective against immortals if the nasty cut Genichiro gave Kuro right before you showed up is any indication
                Excuse you, I’m a gamer of culture. I was licking sea salt and vinegar dust off my fingers.
                    Fair
        Sekiro can revive in battle but when he dies again i think it's implied ludologically that he dies fr (or at least that that run isn't 'cannon')

basically, what actually happens in sekiro is all the times where you didn't die clipped together, in a way
            I feel it’s a mix.  I don’t think he dies for real if you die twice, the guy’s using the true gift, not an imitation.

However, I do think the Sculptor’s Idols are just a game mechanic, and that throughout the game, he never gets a game over.

In the final battle, he doesn’t even die once.  The Mortal Blade would put him down, period. No second chances.  The only reason it doesn’t is because it would ruin the game for a lot of people.
                I'm not entirely sure I agree that the mortal blade would kill him, and I think I stand by my assertion that we can think of the game canonically just being the  runs where he doesn't die spliced together.

On the mortal blade, sure if Sekiro were to kill himself with his one then he would die, but correct me if I'm wrong, is there anything that explicitly says that the blade mortal blade would kill immortals if it were to be used that way? My understanding of what it did was that it revived the dead, and for that reason it was to do with mortality and got the name, it is Sekiro's mortal blade that severs the connection between mortals and immortals (in that I don't think Sekiro kills the Divine Dragon, just incapacitates it, because it is immortal by nature)
                    Killing immortals is explicitly what it does.  It’s* why there are things in the game you can’t kill without it.

It’s why Kuro says it can kill immortals.

It’s why Kuro bleeds when he’s stabbed with it.  Kuro doesn’t bleed under normal circumstances.
                        It doesn't kill immortals technically, it severs the connection of undying to immortality, Kuro is a person and therefore a mortal but he is connected to the Divine Dragon, so functionally immortal. The Divine Dragon itself cannot be killed though. The game actually makes this distinction as the Hanbei for instance isn't "Hanbei the immortal", he's "Hanbei the undying", which is what the mortal blade item description says, it is "capable of killing the undying" and not "the immortal". (I think this is an even more deliberate choice when considering that the blade is called the \*mortal\* blade and the choice of word used isn't "immortal" , it's a completely different one. "undying"; especially when we consider that "undying" is an odd term in that it doesn't mean "cannot" die but something that "does not" die.) 

On the black mortal blade though, the black scroll only actually says it has the ability to "open a gate to the underworld", it never explicitly states that it can kill undying, like the crimson mortal blade can. Though it's curious that it can make Kuro bleed in the cutscene before Isshin, I think it's a jump to go from "it can make him bleed" to "it can kill immortals".
                            “Kuro: Wolf, that sword on your back, is it...

Sekiro: It is the Mortal Blade.

Kuro: The sword that can kill those who cannot die...

Sekiro: Yes. It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.”

Alternately, 

“Kuro: The sword that can kill those who cannot die... I didn't expect you to find it so quickly.

Sekiro: Yes. It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.”

“IMMORTALITY SEVERED”

The Red Mortal Blade and the Black Mortal Blade both do the same thing, which is why Genichiro found it in the first place to bleed Kuro, and why Isshin uses it to fight you in both endings.  Because killing you would be pointless if you just came back, still as a Shura.
                            They wouldn’t be called mortal blades if they couldn’t sever immortality. Black blade is called Open Gate and has an additional ability to open a gate to the underworld. Red blade is called Gracious Gift of Tears and has an additional ability to extract tears from the Sakura dragon.
                                where does it say that every mortal blade severs immortality? what i got from it was that the mortal blades interact with mortality in different ways, in that the crimson mortal blade restores it in severing immortality and making someone mortal again and the black mortal black restores it in bringing people back to life. from what we know i think this is a stronger view
                            Is there YouTubers who nerd out to the lore this deep similarly to guys like Smoughtown for Elden Ring? I can only ever find short rundowns or plot summaries
                                not to my knowledge unfortunately :(
usually the lore is only spoken about either in critiques of the game or those plot summaries; reddit seems to be the only place to care
                            this man really wrote an essay about how undying is different to being immortal, props to this guy.
                                i can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic but i’ll take the compliment 😊
                    Nah, if kills are canon then we wouldnt fight genichiro everytime we wanna fight isshin
                I actually have a headcanon that Sekiro canonically dies twice in the entire game. Once in Hirata and the second? I was thinking about how, if we knew when the other death was, we might be able to state the canon ending and vice versa. I'm sure other people have had this thought and maybe it was even figured out. Sadly I don't really keep up-to-date on this kinda stuff so...
                    Drawing the mortal blade is a canon death.
                        Forgot about that with how long it's been. Which is hilarious considering how often you return to that room to get the third ending option
            after his power is drained via dying too much it kills and damages the people around him wich means thst we have probably been fighting way easier versions of the bosses we were fighting that is if the amount of tines we have died is canon
                I don't necessarily think so as the dragonrot seems to act like a disease which kills individuals, it doesn't necessarily take power from the world around it generally, it takes from individuals. There aren't any bosses who seem to be afflicted with it, so I don't agree
        Isshin has a mortal blade.
Theres no shame in losing one battle, but you must take revenge by any means nesecary.
    Thank you father
Yes that’s because Isshin is built entirely different and most certainly could also beat Malenia
It doesn’t matter how many times you die if you win and have a weapon to murder immortal foes 👉🧠👈
U forget isshin would absolutely mess Malenia up. Hes a fucking beast, whats yo point ?
That just means there's someone else that can wipe Melania
No death except for cutscene deaths are canon in SEKIRO
Isshin is slow, predictable and open to your strikes if you can use anything more than very lazy rmb. It was 0 times, actually. Waaaaaaaay easier than way to him.
"He even got that dragon rot that makes him double immortal for some reason. He don't even need it."  
"Don't EVEN need it."
    How does it feeeeeel Malenia?
        "To be a bitch"
She doesn't have eyes either
Can't even double dutch😤
“Annual” as in; “I’m making these whenever I want to start an argument
Annually if 1 hour= 1 year
Hot is subjective, as is the need for orifices. 

^(wait wat)
My brother there are formless monstrosities beyond mortal ken that I’d give a crack at. All I’m reading from you is you have no ambition
Touché
Im not sure, with taking lore into consideration and not having wolf as the mc im really not sure how you win against immortality. Could she like cut a really big rock out of the ground and put it on top of him? I think that would trap him which should probably count as a win.
    Sekiro couldn't even regenerate a severed arm. His immortality clearly has major limitations. He's not fighting after getting atomized by a sword swing strong enough to match Radahn's gravity magic that he uses to amp his attacks.
        This is my personal headcanon, but the reason he didn’t regen the arm was only because he didn’t die. 

Divine dragon is also missing an arm. I too think that was because it wasn’t a mortal wound and healed naturally.
            Why doesn't he get his arm back with subsequent deaths?
                Healed naturally.

I think the immortality returns a user to their most recent healthy state.
        for some reason was hard for me to remember him loosing his arm, your right.
        You're forgetting that Sekiro can literally fall hundreds of feet and be fine and is capable of parrying the divine dragon. He is a full blown demigod in his own right. Malenia ain't atomizing Jack shit 😂
            Falling hundreds of feet isn't even worth noting, not to mention that it's completely untrue. Fall damage exists, and you can die if you fall off a cliff.

Sekiro does not canonically party the Divine Dragon; that's just an oversight/gameplay mechanic. You cannot beat it at all with parrying; you have to use lightning reversal. On tne other hand, he *was* canonically fully incapable of doing any damage to some generic metal armor.

Malenia was a match for Radahn, who's literally so powerful that he can freeze entire constellations of stars in place with his gravity magic. She is absolutely atomizing him with a single swing. Her scarlet rot also affects things on the metaphysical level, such as rotting shards of the Elden Ring which is a collection of concepts used to control the laws of reality. It would completely erase Sekiro.
                Bro just said parrying the wind gust of the divine dragon is just gameplay mechanics but only being able to stagger armored warrior is absolutely canon… cherry-picking much?
                    I'm going off of how the fights go. They're gimmick bosses with only one way to do them. Hence, that way is what's canon. If they intended for Sekiro to actually be strong enough to parry DD, they would have scoffed at the idea of armored warrior being a problem.
                        Canonically sekiro could stagger and push him off once, we never actually see what happens if he just keeps hitting him.

Sekiro could literally block the snake as well.
                            Continuously hitting him does zero damage. His HP doesn't go down at all; it's specifically programmed for him to do zero damage.

Parrying the snake also does nothing to it, and iirc, you still take some damage from it regardless.

People really need to chill with this Sekiro hype. Lore-wise, he's literally the weakest fromsoft protagonist. The verse has virtually zero feats. D'S protagonist can seal a reality-damaging demon, DS protagonists fuel a star that keeps time itself functioning, BB protagonist kills eldritch gods that create entire dimensions, ER protagonist kills a conceptual god that creates a dimension and controls the very laws of reality with the Elden Ring. 

Sorry, but no one in Sekiro even comes close. People need to chill with the wank.
                                Yes that’s a gameplay mechanic… do you really believe sekiro wouldn’t eventually hurt him if he just kept chipping away?

Whether it does anything to the snake is irrelevant, the fact that sekiro could block that kind of force easily puts him at the top.

Lore and gameplay don’t match up at all, shit the the gods of bloodborne that can create universes or whatever and the most they can do is hit you…

If you go by pure gameplay mechanics (feats we can actually see) then sekiro is easily at the top.
                                What conceptual god did the ER protagonist kill? Elden beast was basically a proxy, not the actual greater will.
                                Im pretty sure it's stated that the divine dragon drove away the buddha and the great serpert god who we killed and parryed, expert for the buddha but you know why.
                Parrying the dragon is not at all an oversight when they make one of the snake encounter be undeflectable no matter what. 

If they don’t want you deflecting something, they can make it happen. Sekiro can deflect the dragon.
                    No, they don't bother to do disable it because there's no reason to. Parrying it does literally nothing; the k my wsh to defeat jt is lightning reversal.

Again, Sekiro was completely incapable of even denying metal armor. If he was canonically capable of matching the divine dragon's strength, then he would have zero issue with some generic armor.
                        It increases its posture. By this same logic he shouldn’t be able to match demon of hatred or guardian ape

The metal armor doesn’t even matter in this fight because Malenia doesn’t have armor in any vital places.
                            It doesn't do any *real* posture damage. The only way to break its posture is through lightning reversal. This has been tested.

He isn't strong enough to break basic metal. That's the point. He's not harming someone with a body far tougher than some random metal from medieval Europe.
                                Malenia can be hurt by a literal rock
                This is gonna be fun 😂 

>Falling hundreds of feet isn't even worth noting, not to mention that it's completely untrue. Fall damage exists, and you can die if you fall off a cliff.

THAT'S a gameplay mechanic buddy. If you land on hard ground you literally will not have a scratch, you only take damage when going out of bounds. 

>Sekiro does not canonically party the Divine Dragon; that's just an oversight/gameplay mechanic. You cannot beat it at all with parrying; you have to use lightning reversal. On the other hand, he was canonically fully incapable of doing any damage to some generic metal armor.

You are missing the point completely, what a surprise! I'm talking about his physical capabilities. He is capable of trading blows with a being the size of several buildings, that's a fact. 

>Malenia was a match for Radahn, who's literally so powerful that he can freeze entire constellations of stars in place with his gravity magic.

As a huge Radahn fanboy, this is just so false. We literally see the "star" Radahn was holding fall and it's just a single meteor. She also wasn't really a match for him considering that she only even survived because of the scarlet aeonia bloom and Finlay being a badass. She couldn't beat him based on skill though. 

Sekiro could literally just kill himself right after she uses Scarlet Rot and then resurrect afterwards and be fine. Lore wise his resurrections appear to be limitless if he has stuff to draw life from so he could do it as many times as he needs to. There is also in-universe medicine that heals the scarlet rot.

There's also absolutely zero evidence she can do that super bloom whenever she likes. That first one was so powerful because it was the first. If she did that every time she bloomed, Elphael would all be another Caelid and we could not have defeated her. 

>It would completely erase Sekiro.

You mean like it completely erased Malenia's and Radahn's armies? Dude gtfoh that's not even how the rot works, you're talking out your ass.
                    > She couldn't beat him based on skill though.

She did fight him to a standstill purely with her skills. She blooms to end the stalemate.

>Battle of Aeonia. Radahn and Malenia locked in stalemate. Then, the scarlet rot blooms.
                        OK yeah, that's fair. I was going off the image of her on her knees but I swear From has made it intentionally contradictory. I wonder how the Japanese put it actually that would settle all debates! Might have to look for a smoughtown vid real quick lol.
                            She wasn't on her knees though. And from what I've seen, most JP fans don't care about the Radahn vs Malenia debates since the lore made it clear that the battle ended in a stalemate.
                                Ah, that's not what I meant. I'm referring to how things can sometimes not translate very well from Japanese to English and Smoughtown has a friend who is fluent in Japanese and has discovered some really interesting details in the original version.
                    No, you do take fall damage from great heights. It's not "out of bounds"; it's a fall from a cliff that kills you. Some solid copium right there. Also, once again, surviving falls is negligible fodder in terms of feats.

No he's not. If he were some generic armor wouldn't be an issue for him. End of story. Parrying the divine dragon canonically does not happen; it's not intended by the developers and doesn't press posture at all. Sekiro only does lightning reversals for the fight.

Radahn holds back everything in the sky. That was a Fallingstar, aka a meteor, which astrologer NPCs and item descriptions repeatedly distinguish from actual stars which form constellations and can be seen in space which meteors can't. Not to mention that the actual stars have a plethora of other characteristics incompatible with simple meteors.

Malenia is repeatedly stated to have fought him to a stalemate before she used scarlet rot to end the fight. We also see her move to fight him directly right before the fight in the trailer. Preserving Boluses are only there for gameplay, hence why the item descriptions has zero lore and why no one ever mentions them or tries to use them to cure rot. The rot is treated in canon as incurable.

Once again, Sekiro's immortality is very limited. He can't even do something as basic as regenerating limbs. Also, killing himself to get rid of status ailments is completely OOC.

She does the bloom all the time in her Goddess of Rot form. When has a soulsborne game ever had such a level of destruction in gameplay? That's literally impossible for them to do on a technical level. Of course they aren't going to have her destroy a massive portion of the map repeatedly in combat; don't be absurd.

Radahn is explictly only still there because his great rune combined with his willpower have just slowed down the rot. His army was never hit directly by the rot, only by very distant collateral damage. Her rot has completely afflicted her own great tune and has damaged Radahn's. Those are *fact*.
                        Spitting absolute facts right here 🔥
                        Spitting straight facts right there. Too bad your comment is gonna get buried lol.
                    Finlay is star level confirmed

(I will admit scarlet rot may be Malenia’s only win condition, but Sekiro has two ways to deal with it. Resurrection to heal, and MAYBE divine grass, but that one is a reach. But then again, in lore rot is halted by fire and Sekiro loves fire)
                        We all need at least one Finlay tier friend 😭 I like to imagine her stopping Radahn's blade an inch from Malenia's head, dropping a badass one-liner and dipping before Radahn can say snack lol. Such a cool character. 

>MAYBE divine grass

Good point actually. I didn't even think about that. 

>Sekiro loves fire

Fuck yeah, he does. Gotta wonder if the Lazulite flames would hurt Malenia and/or stop scarlet rot.
            Guy who can fall and deflect a big sword when scarlet aeonia:
                Guy with flamethrower built into his arm when scarlet Aeonia:
        Immortality and the ability to literally regrow limbs are two completely different abilities you do realize that right
            If he can't even regrow limbs, that means he's not coming back to action from those kinds of injuries, let alone the bigger ones Malenia can cause him.
                Yet without an immortal blade she still wouldn’t be able to kill him at worst all she could do is dismember him, I would give her more benefit of the doubt if she was somehow able to have knowledge about the immortal blade but she doesn’t, she would have to use wolf’s own immortal blade to kill him but she wouldn’t instinctively just do that or know to do that so yeah the worst she could really do is just immobilize him  unless she was able to figure out what his blade is/does
                    Dismembering him would put him out of the fight (which is a W), and the advantage she has in raw strength is enough for her to at least vaporize him, which his immortality definitely wouldn't bring him back from if it can't even regenerate limbs after death.

His immortality just isn't a factor against beings that do more than just regular blunt damage or stabbing. It doesn't help if his opponent goes for dismemberment or is strong enough to completely destroy his body.
    It doesn't seem like he regenerates, so she can probably just cut him into pieces and keep them apart. He might still be alive, but he ain't doing much.
        He’ll be resurrecting constantly. DRAGONROT FOR ALL!!
        Your right, she can just cut of his limbs then.
    He couldn't even harm a knight in plate armor with his toothpick sword.
        Yeah but does malenia have full body armor? Argument won, my logic is flawless/j
            Especially in second phase
    Wolf has no regeneration ability so Malenia could cut his limbs off or just use the rot on him which would make Wolf lose his mind like Radahn but unlike Radahn who has a great rune that "burns to resist the encroachment of the scarlet rot", Wolf has no great rune or something like that so I think the rot will just melt/evaporate his flesh completely.
        Rot wouldn't even be needed. He ain't getting past her base form. Just like Maliketh fighting as beast clergyman would annihilate all of sekiro.
            Her base form… really…
                She fought Radahn to a standstill with her skills alone (the bloom happens after they were locked in a stalemate and she gets KO'd by her own OP attack). She is revered for her undefeated prowess and gained wings of "unparalleled strength". She hits harder than a [tank](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/v25297/i_did_some_math_on_malenias_waterfowl_dance/), is [pretty fast](https://imgur.com/nVOyIfO), and is the best swordsman in Lands Between so yeah, I don't see how Sekiro can beat Malenia (lorewise).
                    [Sekiro deflects attacks that hit harder than a tank](https://reddit.com/r/Sekiro/s/0hgnNqkuGo)

And that’s the low ball estimate.
                        And Malenia matched a [sword blow](https://imgur.com/2W3LeKy) from Radahn who is bigger than her by a LOT and is known for his mighty strength which also means Malenia can easily deflect Sekiro's attacks.
                            Yeah. So can Isshin.
                                Cool.
                    I wouldn’t try to math it out precisely how strong she is, the intention most likely isn’t there, they’re most likely just going with “she’s fast” rather than “she’s so strong that she’s this fast” or whatnot. 
>her own underfeated prowess 

Same with isshin, he’s a sword saint after all and wolf beat him

>is pretty fast

So’s wolf
                        Isshin is strong and Wolf is fast, yeah, but they don't come close to Malenia in terms of power. Malenia is one of the strongest characters in Elden Ring, she fought Radahn (mightiest demigod) to a standstill only with her skills and she herself is the avatar of Rot, a deadly curse that is incurable. I don't see how Isshin or Sekiro could beat Malenia. They can't even beat Mohg or Morgott.
                            > but they don't come close to Malenia in terms of power.

I do agree that Malenia is most likely physically stronger, so you do have me there... my stance is that Wolf is faster and more skilled. Combined with his shinobi tools he should prevail, of course this is just my opinion.

> I don't see how Isshin or Sekiro could beat Malenia. They can't even beat Mohg or Morgott.

I mean both Isshin and Sekiro are more than likely more skilled than her, which can go a long way, if you've seen MHA then think of Stain vs Deku and Co. They should at ***least*** have relevant strength against her, enough to deflect. If not then they should be fine dodging.
                                Why do you think they're more skilled than her? Malenia is a demigod, she has lived probably more than 5000 years and has canonically never known defeat (until she met Tarnished). She's definitely more skilled than both.
Glock Saint when I pull up with stars of ruin:
She’d have to be stronger than divine dragon and faster than Isshin to even threaten him in lore, and as she appears in game and cutscenes, she only matched Isshin’s speed, not to mention In-lore Dragonrot just randomly affects people, so if killed, there’s a chance Sekiro just gives her Dragonrot in addition to her already rotting away body. And that’s only IF she could kill him
    Malenia hits harder and is [faster than](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/ypwux9/sword_saint_isshin_ashina_sekiro_vs_malenia_blade/ivmzjib/) Isshin, and Malenia in her Goddess of Rot form obliterates the Divine Dragon.
        Ok, forgot her sword was longer, but she doesn’t output more energy than Divine dragon. 

Also should mention, Sekiro can literally use a better version of waterfowl dance that has more slashes
            Ok I agree with you

Sekiro/Divine Dragon/whatever solos Elden Ring universe
didn't like the divine dragon drove away the buddha and the great serpent who we killed and are stated to be a god?
Lore pov doesn't matter because the writers can do whatever the hell they want. If Miyazaki wants Wolf or anyone to be stronger, he or anyone will be.
It’s because they all got their ass kicked by a disabled girl with the anatomy of a Barbie doll and have developed Stockholm syndrome from how long they’ve been stuck on the fight
She's tall, ginger and naked. That's all they fucking need 😂
Danggit!
Afaik wolf can only respawn once canonically
    When kuro met wolf again after geni, he asked how many times has wolf died for him 10s or more than that. So no, you are wrong
    Well no because that would literally defeat the point of it being Canon that canonically the only thing that can kill people like wolf is a sword that only exists in his universe
I think you can't parry waterflow dance.
    Considering the stuff I've seen wolf parry, seems 100% in the tool kit.
Miquella and Kuro became BFFs too
Yes
Sekiro can deflect magic anyways
HE CAN UMBRELLA GRABS
But Sekiro in lore respawns
    I know, that's why I said "unless". There are instances where he can no longer respawn, like after the game's endings (except for shura).

Respawn is a free win card anyway. I am saying that if Malenia and Wolf were to have an honest showdown, Wolf wouldn't stand a chance.
        When has wolf ever fight honestly though ;D
            What's the point of powerscaling and comparing them if we don't only account for skill and we only go off of "wolf can infinitely respawn, therefore wins"
                He can’t infinitely respawn, just until there’s nobody left to steal life force from… ^(so we just have kill everyone else first)
That’s just a title. Sekiro went against the god of the divine realm and beat him for the Gracious Gift of Tears but that doesn’t mean he can slay a God in any verse.
    Ah, but that god could throw literal shockwaves with a building sized weapon. Can Malenia do that? 👉🧠👈
        Yup, was leaning towards Sekiro having the capability to defeat her. 

My point being that Godhood doesn’t make you safe from our funny shinobi.
Technically yes.
He can umbrella it
Who do you think trained him smh
That’s Sekiro like halfway through the game, not at his peak, at best it’s an outlier considering that Sekiro fights other superhumanly strong humans and monsters and canonically clashes with them.

Isshin for example can split armored men in half.
    I accept this answer.
        Thank you!
    OH YEAH. We can scale him to Isshin’s strength!
    He also can’t easily stagger bandits with wooden shields. That’s near the end of the game.

I wouldn’t assume that gameplay mechanics translate into actual capabilities unless its plot related
        >that’s near the end of the game

It’s weird I know, but most consistently he’s been shown to have superhuman strength.
>gameplay mechanics Translate into actual abilities unless it’s plot related

It is plot related, he canonically deflects all of his foes, it’s his fighting style. Also, there’s a lot of intention behind some gameplay mechanics
            His fighting style also involves acrobatics and dodges. Thus you cannot assume that he can canonically deflect all attacks
                No, the lore literally says that he prefers to deflect
                    “Prefers” doesn’t mean being able to deflect everything
                        It does mean though that it’s a preferred tactic, also, you can deflect the enemies in gameplay, which has a lot of intention behind it
                            Does the same apply to the bloodborne hunter? Dodging is the main method of avoiding damage, so similarly there is a lot of intention. He has dodging i-frames that let him take no damage from AOEs.

Do you actually think he is canonically undamaged when dodging in the middle of big fire attacks?
                                >Dodging is the main method of avoiding damage, so similarly there is a lot of intention.

No, in Sekiro's case there's lore behind it, plus the fact that the deflections are a full fledged animation that interacts with the enemy. Look at the guardian ape fight for instance [there's a clear reaction between both animations](https://youtu.be/_EB2wZVNlH0?t=158). It's also just a move that makes sense, deflecting like that makes sense, but invincibility like that? Nah, I don’t think so.
Malenia doesn’t wear armor, and those dudes can be hurt by regular iron katanas anyways
Me
Downvoted for speaking the truth. I also see these clowns saying Isshin would beat Maliketh lmao when he'd pretty much break every single bone in his body. Immortality wouldn't matter when you have no bones left.
    Wait. Who’s saying Isshin could beat Maliketh???
        Quiet a lot in this sub. Their argument is that Maliketh doesn't have mortal blade so Isshin wins.
            … MALIKETH IS A WALKING MORTAL BLADE

(While the specifics of Destined death are up for debate, I still think it functions like the mortal blade would)
    Fr wolfs posture would break so fast against her onslaught attack along with having no way to g dapple anything
        If you’re constantly parrying your posture won’t break
            You forget she gains health every block so blocking is just gonna heal her and she attacks relentlessly
                Parrying her does not give health back though
                    With a Shield yes but with a sword she will gain health
                        Ok but health doesn’t really matter in sekiro, the way this battle would work is if the mechanics were: Malenia in sekiro or sekiro v Malenia in Elden ring
                            So it depends on the game world we fighting in

Wolf tops in his world 

Malenia tops in her world
                                Staggering is still a thing in Elden ring so no
                                Yeah Malenia ported into sekiro hard clapped by wolf, wolf in Elden Ring probably end as a stalemate
                        You literally can parry her with a sword
                    It would take forever though
He could totally beat Morgott. Mohg would probably kill him once with NIHIL but he can resurrect so who cares.
    He can beat them only in fanfictions
        Fatal respiratory infection go: *cough*
            Can Sekiro beat Radahn, Godfrey, or Maliketh?
                Godfrey, yes. Sekiro’s whole fighting style (paired with umbrella only) counters everything Godfrey has. It basically be super Saiyan chained ogre with no fire weakness. 

Maliketh, harder to say for one reason. In game, only the blasphemous claw can parry destined death, but there’s one spell that can redirect the ranged attacks. Also, the purple umbrella can deflect the mortal draw, which looks to be equivalent to destined death. So if you allow anything else to deflect destined death, Sekiro wins for sure, if not, it’s a gamble, but Sekiro still has a ton of counters. He can deflect non-destined death attacks and dodge many of the other attacks maliketh has, and finally, the Malcontent can stall Maliketh long enough for some good hits. There’s also the Mist raven that can be used to avoid destined death. 

Radahn, this one is very hard. If you consider Radahn using electromagnetic lightning, *MAYBE* Sekiro can redirect it, but without that, Sekiro can still deflect anything that isn’t that and could possibly deflect the shockwave pull, as he can deflect the Demon of Hatred’s shockwave. The Radahn meteor, you can argue he can’t deflect it, but mist raven. (Keep in mind this is Rotted Radahn, not Prime Radahn). It also should be noted you can jump the electromagnetic lightning in ER, so Sekiro should be good. Malcontent could even turn Leonard against Radahn.
                    Sekiro can't dodge Chadfrey's grab attack though. :P

There's no way Sekiro can beat Maliketh in any scenario. You're forgetting that Maliketh is fast enough to dodge literally every attack from Sekiro and he is literally death itself. Maliketh slaughters Sekiro and it's not even close.

Radahn absolutely wipes him too. He doesn't even need to turn into a meteor to destroy him. Radahn is terribly huge, controls gravity, and uses two greatswords. He swings them and Sekiro is dead. Idk man youre really underestimating the power levels of the demigods. The only demigod Sekiro can beat is Godrick.
                        Umbrella deflects grabs. 

Maliketh is just as fast as Demon of Hatred

Sekiro can deflect divine dragon. Radahn’s swords are no problem
                            Bro 💀
I mean you can deflect one mind, waterfowl isn’t very different
    Her hp bar will be full and posture regen will be super fast again
        She doesn’t gain hp when you parry any of her other attacks so waterfowl shouldn’t be an exception
            You can't parry in sekiro, only deflect
                ^(It’s the same thing)
    Sure. With an umbrella
        [no](https://youtu.be/uGIRgaKY58A?si=9ImxEyyUy_ovZ_vc)
            Let me guess. You linked me a video of someone deflecting it with frame perfect timing despite noone being able to replicate this consistently ever
                It’s not that hard to deflect it, i wouldn’t say it’s consistent but i’ve done it and a bunch of other people on youtube did too, the point i was trying to make is that it’s possible anyway, i wasn’t claiming that you could beat malenia hitless or anything like that
When you can parry a building sized sword, anything less than that might as well be a catch all
    Similarly, you can roll in the middle of giant explosions of death magic in elden ring. 

In both cases, it probably isn’t canon
        Rolling in most of the explosions of Elden ring still gets you caught in the radius. (Unless you mean rolling out of them.)

The difference being that the deflects directly affect your opponents. Why would Sekiro’s deflects not be canon when his whole fighting style revolves around it and it’s pretty much the only way he’s won various fights.
            Nope u can i-frame many explosions including maliketh’s stabbing rock pulse attack.
                I was thinking of ones like Placidusax’s nuke or Malenia’s aeonia
                    Sure, but my comment still stands. You can iframe some explosions in elden ring. Does that make it canon?
                        Uh. Idk. You can roll some explosions but not others. So yes?
                            See personally i would say no, because iframes make no sense in canon. 

Hence why i also think similar gameplay mechanics in sekiro are not canon

But if you believe this is canon, then i can see why you feel that sekiro can canonically deflect basically every attack
She doesn’t heal on parries, so no.
    I’ll give this one to the Wolf then.
Cant heal on deflects ;p
    I don't think Sekiro deflecting counts as Elden Ring parrying though. They are pretty different.
        Not really.

There’s a sword parry in Elden ring after all
            No like when you parry in Elden Ring you knock their arm away. The attack doesn't connect. In Sekiro when you deflect the attack still connects but no damage is dealt.

Look at it this way, in Elden Ring when you parry enemy gets stance broken and you can do a critical strike. In Sekiro deflecting builds their posture bar until it's full then they break and you can do a critical strike. That's why parry and deflect are different.
                With a deflect, the attack is still pushed away, you just don’t throw off the enemy until posture is broken. 

I think charmless is the best way to show that, like blocking in Elden ring, you can still take chip damage, but when deflecting you take none.
                    Well no the attack isn't pushed away. Well at least in most cases I've seen it's not. I won't argue about deflection anymore because it won't anywhere. 

Malenia still beats Sekiro
What yearly and daily then?
He can parry magic too
    Doesn't he take some chip dmg?
        Not with a confetti buff!
            Oh damn. I did not know that. That makes him even more op then
                He's also got a selection of umbrellas to counter magic.
She’s scary because she’s nude
    Lol that's funny
Smells like confetti, fish and headless there
    So no head?
He also swam in the dungeons below Ashina Castle and trudged thru Ashina Depths. But the whole main quest line was about collecting the materials to create an incense that would allow Wolf to reach the Divine Dragon, which probably made him smell heavenly.
    Ahhh 👉😎👉
    Agreed and now the real discussion can start. Which game protagonist is the stinkiest is a question that has baffled many for years. Personally, I’m of the opinion that our friendly hunter of Yharnam has an arm the smells like pigshit.
        Ain't no way Bloodborne isn't the smelliest, the entire city is blood, wet dogs, tentacles, and abortions

Edit: Also gunpowder and the British
        I haven’t played bloodborne but the screenshots make it look like one massive toxic swamp. I’m sure the hunter is absolutely disgusting. Then again, Lake of Rot and Caelid in general definitely smells like trenchfoot.
I bet it smells like funky bulkhead. The whole place smells like under piers and bulkhead during low tide.
I wouldn't bet on that
Or anti air deathblowing her.

isnt the whole game about sekiro being immortal?
    Not when Isshin is wielding the black mortal blade, while is highly implied to be very effective against immortals if the nasty cut Genichiro gave Kuro right before you showed up is any indication
        Yea that’s correct, isshin is wielding something that can kil him
            Damn I affirm someone’s opinion and I get upvotes. This website easy
        ah, though he was talking about respawing at sculptors idol
        ~~only the red mortal blade can sever immortality,~~ genichiro sacrifices his flesh to summon prime isshin from the underworld using the black mortal blade because he knows that he's the only one that can beat wolf and "save" ashina.

edit: I was wrong, it seems the main difference between the two is the red mortal blade kills anyone who draws it, and the black one doesn't do this, instead you can sacrifice someone and open a gate to the underworld to summon anyone.
            And how would he beat an immortal without any way to kill him?

Black mortal blade nearly killed Kuro, and his immortality is god tier compared to sekiro's, so much so, that he doesnt even bleed. 

So yeah, black mortal blade can most likely sever immortality
                It also is the only feasible way Tomoe and Takeru could’ve died. So it must be able to sever immortality
                In the shura ending when owl comes back he’s actually holding 2 items, the black mortal blade and genichiros head, indicating that he beat genichiro within an inch of his life and severed his immortality with the black mortal blade.

            Excuse you, I’m a gamer of culture. I was licking sea salt and vinegar dust off my fingers.
                Fair
    Sekiro can revive in battle but when he dies again i think it's implied ludologically that he dies fr (or at least that that run isn't 'cannon')

basically, what actually happens in sekiro is all the times where you didn't die clipped together, in a way
        I feel it’s a mix.  I don’t think he dies for real if you die twice, the guy’s using the true gift, not an imitation.

However, I do think the Sculptor’s Idols are just a game mechanic, and that throughout the game, he never gets a game over.

In the final battle, he doesn’t even die once.  The Mortal Blade would put him down, period. No second chances.  The only reason it doesn’t is because it would ruin the game for a lot of people.
            I'm not entirely sure I agree that the mortal blade would kill him, and I think I stand by my assertion that we can think of the game canonically just being the  runs where he doesn't die spliced together.

On the mortal blade, sure if Sekiro were to kill himself with his one then he would die, but correct me if I'm wrong, is there anything that explicitly says that the blade mortal blade would kill immortals if it were to be used that way? My understanding of what it did was that it revived the dead, and for that reason it was to do with mortality and got the name, it is Sekiro's mortal blade that severs the connection between mortals and immortals (in that I don't think Sekiro kills the Divine Dragon, just incapacitates it, because it is immortal by nature)
                Killing immortals is explicitly what it does.  It’s* why there are things in the game you can’t kill without it.

It’s why Kuro says it can kill immortals.

It’s why Kuro bleeds when he’s stabbed with it.  Kuro doesn’t bleed under normal circumstances.
                    It doesn't kill immortals technically, it severs the connection of undying to immortality, Kuro is a person and therefore a mortal but he is connected to the Divine Dragon, so functionally immortal. The Divine Dragon itself cannot be killed though. The game actually makes this distinction as the Hanbei for instance isn't "Hanbei the immortal", he's "Hanbei the undying", which is what the mortal blade item description says, it is "capable of killing the undying" and not "the immortal". (I think this is an even more deliberate choice when considering that the blade is called the \*mortal\* blade and the choice of word used isn't "immortal" , it's a completely different one. "undying"; especially when we consider that "undying" is an odd term in that it doesn't mean "cannot" die but something that "does not" die.) 

On the black mortal blade though, the black scroll only actually says it has the ability to "open a gate to the underworld", it never explicitly states that it can kill undying, like the crimson mortal blade can. Though it's curious that it can make Kuro bleed in the cutscene before Isshin, I think it's a jump to go from "it can make him bleed" to "it can kill immortals".
                        “Kuro: Wolf, that sword on your back, is it...

Sekiro: It is the Mortal Blade.

Kuro: The sword that can kill those who cannot die...

Sekiro: Yes. It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.”

Alternately, 

“Kuro: The sword that can kill those who cannot die... I didn't expect you to find it so quickly.

Sekiro: Yes. It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.”

“IMMORTALITY SEVERED”

The Red Mortal Blade and the Black Mortal Blade both do the same thing, which is why Genichiro found it in the first place to bleed Kuro, and why Isshin uses it to fight you in both endings.  Because killing you would be pointless if you just came back, still as a Shura.
                        They wouldn’t be called mortal blades if they couldn’t sever immortality. Black blade is called Open Gate and has an additional ability to open a gate to the underworld. Red blade is called Gracious Gift of Tears and has an additional ability to extract tears from the Sakura dragon.
                            where does it say that every mortal blade severs immortality? what i got from it was that the mortal blades interact with mortality in different ways, in that the crimson mortal blade restores it in severing immortality and making someone mortal again and the black mortal black restores it in bringing people back to life. from what we know i think this is a stronger view
                        Is there YouTubers who nerd out to the lore this deep similarly to guys like Smoughtown for Elden Ring? I can only ever find short rundowns or plot summaries
                            not to my knowledge unfortunately :(
usually the lore is only spoken about either in critiques of the game or those plot summaries; reddit seems to be the only place to care
                        this man really wrote an essay about how undying is different to being immortal, props to this guy.
                            i can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic but i’ll take the compliment 😊
                Nah, if kills are canon then we wouldnt fight genichiro everytime we wanna fight isshin
            I actually have a headcanon that Sekiro canonically dies twice in the entire game. Once in Hirata and the second? I was thinking about how, if we knew when the other death was, we might be able to state the canon ending and vice versa. I'm sure other people have had this thought and maybe it was even figured out. Sadly I don't really keep up-to-date on this kinda stuff so...
                Drawing the mortal blade is a canon death.
                    Forgot about that with how long it's been. Which is hilarious considering how often you return to that room to get the third ending option
        after his power is drained via dying too much it kills and damages the people around him wich means thst we have probably been fighting way easier versions of the bosses we were fighting that is if the amount of tines we have died is canon
            I don't necessarily think so as the dragonrot seems to act like a disease which kills individuals, it doesn't necessarily take power from the world around it generally, it takes from individuals. There aren't any bosses who seem to be afflicted with it, so I don't agree
    Isshin has a mortal blade.
Thank you father
How does it feeeeeel Malenia?
    "To be a bitch"
Sekiro couldn't even regenerate a severed arm. His immortality clearly has major limitations. He's not fighting after getting atomized by a sword swing strong enough to match Radahn's gravity magic that he uses to amp his attacks.
    This is my personal headcanon, but the reason he didn’t regen the arm was only because he didn’t die. 

Divine dragon is also missing an arm. I too think that was because it wasn’t a mortal wound and healed naturally.
        Why doesn't he get his arm back with subsequent deaths?
            Healed naturally.

I think the immortality returns a user to their most recent healthy state.
    for some reason was hard for me to remember him loosing his arm, your right.
    You're forgetting that Sekiro can literally fall hundreds of feet and be fine and is capable of parrying the divine dragon. He is a full blown demigod in his own right. Malenia ain't atomizing Jack shit 😂
        Falling hundreds of feet isn't even worth noting, not to mention that it's completely untrue. Fall damage exists, and you can die if you fall off a cliff.

Sekiro does not canonically party the Divine Dragon; that's just an oversight/gameplay mechanic. You cannot beat it at all with parrying; you have to use lightning reversal. On tne other hand, he *was* canonically fully incapable of doing any damage to some generic metal armor.

Malenia was a match for Radahn, who's literally so powerful that he can freeze entire constellations of stars in place with his gravity magic. She is absolutely atomizing him with a single swing. Her scarlet rot also affects things on the metaphysical level, such as rotting shards of the Elden Ring which is a collection of concepts used to control the laws of reality. It would completely erase Sekiro.
            Bro just said parrying the wind gust of the divine dragon is just gameplay mechanics but only being able to stagger armored warrior is absolutely canon… cherry-picking much?
                I'm going off of how the fights go. They're gimmick bosses with only one way to do them. Hence, that way is what's canon. If they intended for Sekiro to actually be strong enough to parry DD, they would have scoffed at the idea of armored warrior being a problem.
                    Canonically sekiro could stagger and push him off once, we never actually see what happens if he just keeps hitting him.

Sekiro could literally block the snake as well.
                        Continuously hitting him does zero damage. His HP doesn't go down at all; it's specifically programmed for him to do zero damage.

Parrying the snake also does nothing to it, and iirc, you still take some damage from it regardless.

People really need to chill with this Sekiro hype. Lore-wise, he's literally the weakest fromsoft protagonist. The verse has virtually zero feats. D'S protagonist can seal a reality-damaging demon, DS protagonists fuel a star that keeps time itself functioning, BB protagonist kills eldritch gods that create entire dimensions, ER protagonist kills a conceptual god that creates a dimension and controls the very laws of reality with the Elden Ring. 

Sorry, but no one in Sekiro even comes close. People need to chill with the wank.
                            Yes that’s a gameplay mechanic… do you really believe sekiro wouldn’t eventually hurt him if he just kept chipping away?

Whether it does anything to the snake is irrelevant, the fact that sekiro could block that kind of force easily puts him at the top.

Lore and gameplay don’t match up at all, shit the the gods of bloodborne that can create universes or whatever and the most they can do is hit you…

If you go by pure gameplay mechanics (feats we can actually see) then sekiro is easily at the top.
                            What conceptual god did the ER protagonist kill? Elden beast was basically a proxy, not the actual greater will.
                            Im pretty sure it's stated that the divine dragon drove away the buddha and the great serpert god who we killed and parryed, expert for the buddha but you know why.
            Parrying the dragon is not at all an oversight when they make one of the snake encounter be undeflectable no matter what. 

If they don’t want you deflecting something, they can make it happen. Sekiro can deflect the dragon.
                No, they don't bother to do disable it because there's no reason to. Parrying it does literally nothing; the k my wsh to defeat jt is lightning reversal.

Again, Sekiro was completely incapable of even denying metal armor. If he was canonically capable of matching the divine dragon's strength, then he would have zero issue with some generic armor.
                    It increases its posture. By this same logic he shouldn’t be able to match demon of hatred or guardian ape

The metal armor doesn’t even matter in this fight because Malenia doesn’t have armor in any vital places.
                        It doesn't do any *real* posture damage. The only way to break its posture is through lightning reversal. This has been tested.

He isn't strong enough to break basic metal. That's the point. He's not harming someone with a body far tougher than some random metal from medieval Europe.
                            Malenia can be hurt by a literal rock
            This is gonna be fun 😂 

>Falling hundreds of feet isn't even worth noting, not to mention that it's completely untrue. Fall damage exists, and you can die if you fall off a cliff.

THAT'S a gameplay mechanic buddy. If you land on hard ground you literally will not have a scratch, you only take damage when going out of bounds. 

>Sekiro does not canonically party the Divine Dragon; that's just an oversight/gameplay mechanic. You cannot beat it at all with parrying; you have to use lightning reversal. On the other hand, he was canonically fully incapable of doing any damage to some generic metal armor.

You are missing the point completely, what a surprise! I'm talking about his physical capabilities. He is capable of trading blows with a being the size of several buildings, that's a fact. 

>Malenia was a match for Radahn, who's literally so powerful that he can freeze entire constellations of stars in place with his gravity magic.

As a huge Radahn fanboy, this is just so false. We literally see the "star" Radahn was holding fall and it's just a single meteor. She also wasn't really a match for him considering that she only even survived because of the scarlet aeonia bloom and Finlay being a badass. She couldn't beat him based on skill though. 

Sekiro could literally just kill himself right after she uses Scarlet Rot and then resurrect afterwards and be fine. Lore wise his resurrections appear to be limitless if he has stuff to draw life from so he could do it as many times as he needs to. There is also in-universe medicine that heals the scarlet rot.

There's also absolutely zero evidence she can do that super bloom whenever she likes. That first one was so powerful because it was the first. If she did that every time she bloomed, Elphael would all be another Caelid and we could not have defeated her. 

>It would completely erase Sekiro.

You mean like it completely erased Malenia's and Radahn's armies? Dude gtfoh that's not even how the rot works, you're talking out your ass.
                > She couldn't beat him based on skill though.

She did fight him to a standstill purely with her skills. She blooms to end the stalemate.

>Battle of Aeonia. Radahn and Malenia locked in stalemate. Then, the scarlet rot blooms.
                    OK yeah, that's fair. I was going off the image of her on her knees but I swear From has made it intentionally contradictory. I wonder how the Japanese put it actually that would settle all debates! Might have to look for a smoughtown vid real quick lol.
                        She wasn't on her knees though. And from what I've seen, most JP fans don't care about the Radahn vs Malenia debates since the lore made it clear that the battle ended in a stalemate.
                            Ah, that's not what I meant. I'm referring to how things can sometimes not translate very well from Japanese to English and Smoughtown has a friend who is fluent in Japanese and has discovered some really interesting details in the original version.
                No, you do take fall damage from great heights. It's not "out of bounds"; it's a fall from a cliff that kills you. Some solid copium right there. Also, once again, surviving falls is negligible fodder in terms of feats.

No he's not. If he were some generic armor wouldn't be an issue for him. End of story. Parrying the divine dragon canonically does not happen; it's not intended by the developers and doesn't press posture at all. Sekiro only does lightning reversals for the fight.

Radahn holds back everything in the sky. That was a Fallingstar, aka a meteor, which astrologer NPCs and item descriptions repeatedly distinguish from actual stars which form constellations and can be seen in space which meteors can't. Not to mention that the actual stars have a plethora of other characteristics incompatible with simple meteors.

Malenia is repeatedly stated to have fought him to a stalemate before she used scarlet rot to end the fight. We also see her move to fight him directly right before the fight in the trailer. Preserving Boluses are only there for gameplay, hence why the item descriptions has zero lore and why no one ever mentions them or tries to use them to cure rot. The rot is treated in canon as incurable.

Once again, Sekiro's immortality is very limited. He can't even do something as basic as regenerating limbs. Also, killing himself to get rid of status ailments is completely OOC.

She does the bloom all the time in her Goddess of Rot form. When has a soulsborne game ever had such a level of destruction in gameplay? That's literally impossible for them to do on a technical level. Of course they aren't going to have her destroy a massive portion of the map repeatedly in combat; don't be absurd.

Radahn is explictly only still there because his great rune combined with his willpower have just slowed down the rot. His army was never hit directly by the rot, only by very distant collateral damage. Her rot has completely afflicted her own great tune and has damaged Radahn's. Those are *fact*.
                    Spitting absolute facts right here 🔥
                    Spitting straight facts right there. Too bad your comment is gonna get buried lol.
                Finlay is star level confirmed

(I will admit scarlet rot may be Malenia’s only win condition, but Sekiro has two ways to deal with it. Resurrection to heal, and MAYBE divine grass, but that one is a reach. But then again, in lore rot is halted by fire and Sekiro loves fire)
                    We all need at least one Finlay tier friend 😭 I like to imagine her stopping Radahn's blade an inch from Malenia's head, dropping a badass one-liner and dipping before Radahn can say snack lol. Such a cool character. 

>MAYBE divine grass

Good point actually. I didn't even think about that. 

>Sekiro loves fire

Fuck yeah, he does. Gotta wonder if the Lazulite flames would hurt Malenia and/or stop scarlet rot.
        Guy who can fall and deflect a big sword when scarlet aeonia:
            Guy with flamethrower built into his arm when scarlet Aeonia:
    Immortality and the ability to literally regrow limbs are two completely different abilities you do realize that right
        If he can't even regrow limbs, that means he's not coming back to action from those kinds of injuries, let alone the bigger ones Malenia can cause him.
            Yet without an immortal blade she still wouldn’t be able to kill him at worst all she could do is dismember him, I would give her more benefit of the doubt if she was somehow able to have knowledge about the immortal blade but she doesn’t, she would have to use wolf’s own immortal blade to kill him but she wouldn’t instinctively just do that or know to do that so yeah the worst she could really do is just immobilize him  unless she was able to figure out what his blade is/does
                Dismembering him would put him out of the fight (which is a W), and the advantage she has in raw strength is enough for her to at least vaporize him, which his immortality definitely wouldn't bring him back from if it can't even regenerate limbs after death.

His immortality just isn't a factor against beings that do more than just regular blunt damage or stabbing. It doesn't help if his opponent goes for dismemberment or is strong enough to completely destroy his body.
It doesn't seem like he regenerates, so she can probably just cut him into pieces and keep them apart. He might still be alive, but he ain't doing much.
    He’ll be resurrecting constantly. DRAGONROT FOR ALL!!
    Your right, she can just cut of his limbs then.
He couldn't even harm a knight in plate armor with his toothpick sword.
    Yeah but does malenia have full body armor? Argument won, my logic is flawless/j
        Especially in second phase
Wolf has no regeneration ability so Malenia could cut his limbs off or just use the rot on him which would make Wolf lose his mind like Radahn but unlike Radahn who has a great rune that "burns to resist the encroachment of the scarlet rot", Wolf has no great rune or something like that so I think the rot will just melt/evaporate his flesh completely.
    Rot wouldn't even be needed. He ain't getting past her base form. Just like Maliketh fighting as beast clergyman would annihilate all of sekiro.
        Her base form… really…
            She fought Radahn to a standstill with her skills alone (the bloom happens after they were locked in a stalemate and she gets KO'd by her own OP attack). She is revered for her undefeated prowess and gained wings of "unparalleled strength". She hits harder than a [tank](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/v25297/i_did_some_math_on_malenias_waterfowl_dance/), is [pretty fast](https://imgur.com/nVOyIfO), and is the best swordsman in Lands Between so yeah, I don't see how Sekiro can beat Malenia (lorewise).
                [Sekiro deflects attacks that hit harder than a tank](https://reddit.com/r/Sekiro/s/0hgnNqkuGo)

And that’s the low ball estimate.
                    And Malenia matched a [sword blow](https://imgur.com/2W3LeKy) from Radahn who is bigger than her by a LOT and is known for his mighty strength which also means Malenia can easily deflect Sekiro's attacks.
                        Yeah. So can Isshin.
                            Cool.
                I wouldn’t try to math it out precisely how strong she is, the intention most likely isn’t there, they’re most likely just going with “she’s fast” rather than “she’s so strong that she’s this fast” or whatnot. 
>her own underfeated prowess 

Same with isshin, he’s a sword saint after all and wolf beat him

>is pretty fast

So’s wolf
                    Isshin is strong and Wolf is fast, yeah, but they don't come close to Malenia in terms of power. Malenia is one of the strongest characters in Elden Ring, she fought Radahn (mightiest demigod) to a standstill only with her skills and she herself is the avatar of Rot, a deadly curse that is incurable. I don't see how Isshin or Sekiro could beat Malenia. They can't even beat Mohg or Morgott.
                        > but they don't come close to Malenia in terms of power.

I do agree that Malenia is most likely physically stronger, so you do have me there... my stance is that Wolf is faster and more skilled. Combined with his shinobi tools he should prevail, of course this is just my opinion.

> I don't see how Isshin or Sekiro could beat Malenia. They can't even beat Mohg or Morgott.

I mean both Isshin and Sekiro are more than likely more skilled than her, which can go a long way, if you've seen MHA then think of Stain vs Deku and Co. They should at ***least*** have relevant strength against her, enough to deflect. If not then they should be fine dodging.
                            Why do you think they're more skilled than her? Malenia is a demigod, she has lived probably more than 5000 years and has canonically never known defeat (until she met Tarnished). She's definitely more skilled than both.
Malenia hits harder and is [faster than](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/ypwux9/sword_saint_isshin_ashina_sekiro_vs_malenia_blade/ivmzjib/) Isshin, and Malenia in her Goddess of Rot form obliterates the Divine Dragon.
    Ok, forgot her sword was longer, but she doesn’t output more energy than Divine dragon. 

Also should mention, Sekiro can literally use a better version of waterfowl dance that has more slashes
        Ok I agree with you

Sekiro/Divine Dragon/whatever solos Elden Ring universe
When kuro met wolf again after geni, he asked how many times has wolf died for him 10s or more than that. So no, you are wrong
Well no because that would literally defeat the point of it being Canon that canonically the only thing that can kill people like wolf is a sword that only exists in his universe
Considering the stuff I've seen wolf parry, seems 100% in the tool kit.
I know, that's why I said "unless". There are instances where he can no longer respawn, like after the game's endings (except for shura).

Respawn is a free win card anyway. I am saying that if Malenia and Wolf were to have an honest showdown, Wolf wouldn't stand a chance.
    When has wolf ever fight honestly though ;D
        What's the point of powerscaling and comparing them if we don't only account for skill and we only go off of "wolf can infinitely respawn, therefore wins"
            He can’t infinitely respawn, just until there’s nobody left to steal life force from… ^(so we just have kill everyone else first)
Ah, but that god could throw literal shockwaves with a building sized weapon. Can Malenia do that? 👉🧠👈
    Yup, was leaning towards Sekiro having the capability to defeat her. 

My point being that Godhood doesn’t make you safe from our funny shinobi.
I accept this answer.
    Thank you!
OH YEAH. We can scale him to Isshin’s strength!
He also can’t easily stagger bandits with wooden shields. That’s near the end of the game.

I wouldn’t assume that gameplay mechanics translate into actual capabilities unless its plot related
    >that’s near the end of the game

It’s weird I know, but most consistently he’s been shown to have superhuman strength.
>gameplay mechanics Translate into actual abilities unless it’s plot related

It is plot related, he canonically deflects all of his foes, it’s his fighting style. Also, there’s a lot of intention behind some gameplay mechanics
        His fighting style also involves acrobatics and dodges. Thus you cannot assume that he can canonically deflect all attacks
            No, the lore literally says that he prefers to deflect
                “Prefers” doesn’t mean being able to deflect everything
                    It does mean though that it’s a preferred tactic, also, you can deflect the enemies in gameplay, which has a lot of intention behind it
                        Does the same apply to the bloodborne hunter? Dodging is the main method of avoiding damage, so similarly there is a lot of intention. He has dodging i-frames that let him take no damage from AOEs.

Do you actually think he is canonically undamaged when dodging in the middle of big fire attacks?
                            >Dodging is the main method of avoiding damage, so similarly there is a lot of intention.

No, in Sekiro's case there's lore behind it, plus the fact that the deflections are a full fledged animation that interacts with the enemy. Look at the guardian ape fight for instance [there's a clear reaction between both animations](https://youtu.be/_EB2wZVNlH0?t=158). It's also just a move that makes sense, deflecting like that makes sense, but invincibility like that? Nah, I don’t think so.
Wait. Who’s saying Isshin could beat Maliketh???
    Quiet a lot in this sub. Their argument is that Maliketh doesn't have mortal blade so Isshin wins.
        … MALIKETH IS A WALKING MORTAL BLADE

(While the specifics of Destined death are up for debate, I still think it functions like the mortal blade would)
Fr wolfs posture would break so fast against her onslaught attack along with having no way to g dapple anything
    If you’re constantly parrying your posture won’t break
        You forget she gains health every block so blocking is just gonna heal her and she attacks relentlessly
            Parrying her does not give health back though
                With a Shield yes but with a sword she will gain health
                    Ok but health doesn’t really matter in sekiro, the way this battle would work is if the mechanics were: Malenia in sekiro or sekiro v Malenia in Elden ring
                        So it depends on the game world we fighting in

Wolf tops in his world 

Malenia tops in her world
                            Staggering is still a thing in Elden ring so no
                            Yeah Malenia ported into sekiro hard clapped by wolf, wolf in Elden Ring probably end as a stalemate
                    You literally can parry her with a sword
                It would take forever though
He can beat them only in fanfictions
    Fatal respiratory infection go: *cough*
        Can Sekiro beat Radahn, Godfrey, or Maliketh?
            Godfrey, yes. Sekiro’s whole fighting style (paired with umbrella only) counters everything Godfrey has. It basically be super Saiyan chained ogre with no fire weakness. 

Maliketh, harder to say for one reason. In game, only the blasphemous claw can parry destined death, but there’s one spell that can redirect the ranged attacks. Also, the purple umbrella can deflect the mortal draw, which looks to be equivalent to destined death. So if you allow anything else to deflect destined death, Sekiro wins for sure, if not, it’s a gamble, but Sekiro still has a ton of counters. He can deflect non-destined death attacks and dodge many of the other attacks maliketh has, and finally, the Malcontent can stall Maliketh long enough for some good hits. There’s also the Mist raven that can be used to avoid destined death. 

Radahn, this one is very hard. If you consider Radahn using electromagnetic lightning, *MAYBE* Sekiro can redirect it, but without that, Sekiro can still deflect anything that isn’t that and could possibly deflect the shockwave pull, as he can deflect the Demon of Hatred’s shockwave. The Radahn meteor, you can argue he can’t deflect it, but mist raven. (Keep in mind this is Rotted Radahn, not Prime Radahn). It also should be noted you can jump the electromagnetic lightning in ER, so Sekiro should be good. Malcontent could even turn Leonard against Radahn.
                Sekiro can't dodge Chadfrey's grab attack though. :P

There's no way Sekiro can beat Maliketh in any scenario. You're forgetting that Maliketh is fast enough to dodge literally every attack from Sekiro and he is literally death itself. Maliketh slaughters Sekiro and it's not even close.

Radahn absolutely wipes him too. He doesn't even need to turn into a meteor to destroy him. Radahn is terribly huge, controls gravity, and uses two greatswords. He swings them and Sekiro is dead. Idk man youre really underestimating the power levels of the demigods. The only demigod Sekiro can beat is Godrick.
                    Umbrella deflects grabs. 

Maliketh is just as fast as Demon of Hatred

Sekiro can deflect divine dragon. Radahn’s swords are no problem
                        Bro 💀
Her hp bar will be full and posture regen will be super fast again
    She doesn’t gain hp when you parry any of her other attacks so waterfowl shouldn’t be an exception
        You can't parry in sekiro, only deflect
            ^(It’s the same thing)
Sure. With an umbrella
    [no](https://youtu.be/uGIRgaKY58A?si=9ImxEyyUy_ovZ_vc)
        Let me guess. You linked me a video of someone deflecting it with frame perfect timing despite noone being able to replicate this consistently ever
            It’s not that hard to deflect it, i wouldn’t say it’s consistent but i’ve done it and a bunch of other people on youtube did too, the point i was trying to make is that it’s possible anyway, i wasn’t claiming that you could beat malenia hitless or anything like that
Similarly, you can roll in the middle of giant explosions of death magic in elden ring. 

In both cases, it probably isn’t canon
    Rolling in most of the explosions of Elden ring still gets you caught in the radius. (Unless you mean rolling out of them.)

The difference being that the deflects directly affect your opponents. Why would Sekiro’s deflects not be canon when his whole fighting style revolves around it and it’s pretty much the only way he’s won various fights.
        Nope u can i-frame many explosions including maliketh’s stabbing rock pulse attack.
            I was thinking of ones like Placidusax’s nuke or Malenia’s aeonia
                Sure, but my comment still stands. You can iframe some explosions in elden ring. Does that make it canon?
                    Uh. Idk. You can roll some explosions but not others. So yes?
                        See personally i would say no, because iframes make no sense in canon. 

Hence why i also think similar gameplay mechanics in sekiro are not canon

But if you believe this is canon, then i can see why you feel that sekiro can canonically deflect basically every attack
I’ll give this one to the Wolf then.
I don't think Sekiro deflecting counts as Elden Ring parrying though. They are pretty different.
    Not really.

There’s a sword parry in Elden ring after all
        No like when you parry in Elden Ring you knock their arm away. The attack doesn't connect. In Sekiro when you deflect the attack still connects but no damage is dealt.

Look at it this way, in Elden Ring when you parry enemy gets stance broken and you can do a critical strike. In Sekiro deflecting builds their posture bar until it's full then they break and you can do a critical strike. That's why parry and deflect are different.
            With a deflect, the attack is still pushed away, you just don’t throw off the enemy until posture is broken. 

I think charmless is the best way to show that, like blocking in Elden ring, you can still take chip damage, but when deflecting you take none.
                Well no the attack isn't pushed away. Well at least in most cases I've seen it's not. I won't argue about deflection anymore because it won't anywhere. 

Malenia still beats Sekiro
Doesn't he take some chip dmg?
    Not with a confetti buff!
        Oh damn. I did not know that. That makes him even more op then
            He's also got a selection of umbrellas to counter magic.
Lol that's funny
So no head?
Ahhh 👉😎👉
Agreed and now the real discussion can start. Which game protagonist is the stinkiest is a question that has baffled many for years. Personally, I’m of the opinion that our friendly hunter of Yharnam has an arm the smells like pigshit.
    Ain't no way Bloodborne isn't the smelliest, the entire city is blood, wet dogs, tentacles, and abortions

Edit: Also gunpowder and the British
    I haven’t played bloodborne but the screenshots make it look like one massive toxic swamp. I’m sure the hunter is absolutely disgusting. Then again, Lake of Rot and Caelid in general definitely smells like trenchfoot.
Not when Isshin is wielding the black mortal blade, while is highly implied to be very effective against immortals if the nasty cut Genichiro gave Kuro right before you showed up is any indication
    Yea that’s correct, isshin is wielding something that can kil him
        Damn I affirm someone’s opinion and I get upvotes. This website easy
    ah, though he was talking about respawing at sculptors idol
    ~~only the red mortal blade can sever immortality,~~ genichiro sacrifices his flesh to summon prime isshin from the underworld using the black mortal blade because he knows that he's the only one that can beat wolf and "save" ashina.

edit: I was wrong, it seems the main difference between the two is the red mortal blade kills anyone who draws it, and the black one doesn't do this, instead you can sacrifice someone and open a gate to the underworld to summon anyone.
        And how would he beat an immortal without any way to kill him?

Black mortal blade nearly killed Kuro, and his immortality is god tier compared to sekiro's, so much so, that he doesnt even bleed. 

So yeah, black mortal blade can most likely sever immortality
            It also is the only feasible way Tomoe and Takeru could’ve died. So it must be able to sever immortality
            In the shura ending when owl comes back he’s actually holding 2 items, the black mortal blade and genichiros head, indicating that he beat genichiro within an inch of his life and severed his immortality with the black mortal blade.
    Licks Cheeto dust off fingers, snorts hard enough to suck snot into diaphragm, scratches ass, exhales hard

> Not when Isshin is wielding the black mortal blade, while is highly implied to be very effective against immortals if the nasty cut Genichiro gave Kuro right before you showed up is any indication
        Excuse you, I’m a gamer of culture. I was licking sea salt and vinegar dust off my fingers.
            Fair
Sekiro can revive in battle but when he dies again i think it's implied ludologically that he dies fr (or at least that that run isn't 'cannon')

basically, what actually happens in sekiro is all the times where you didn't die clipped together, in a way
    I feel it’s a mix.  I don’t think he dies for real if you die twice, the guy’s using the true gift, not an imitation.

However, I do think the Sculptor’s Idols are just a game mechanic, and that throughout the game, he never gets a game over.

In the final battle, he doesn’t even die once.  The Mortal Blade would put him down, period. No second chances.  The only reason it doesn’t is because it would ruin the game for a lot of people.
        I'm not entirely sure I agree that the mortal blade would kill him, and I think I stand by my assertion that we can think of the game canonically just being the  runs where he doesn't die spliced together.

On the mortal blade, sure if Sekiro were to kill himself with his one then he would die, but correct me if I'm wrong, is there anything that explicitly says that the blade mortal blade would kill immortals if it were to be used that way? My understanding of what it did was that it revived the dead, and for that reason it was to do with mortality and got the name, it is Sekiro's mortal blade that severs the connection between mortals and immortals (in that I don't think Sekiro kills the Divine Dragon, just incapacitates it, because it is immortal by nature)
            Killing immortals is explicitly what it does.  It’s* why there are things in the game you can’t kill without it.

It’s why Kuro says it can kill immortals.

It’s why Kuro bleeds when he’s stabbed with it.  Kuro doesn’t bleed under normal circumstances.
                It doesn't kill immortals technically, it severs the connection of undying to immortality, Kuro is a person and therefore a mortal but he is connected to the Divine Dragon, so functionally immortal. The Divine Dragon itself cannot be killed though. The game actually makes this distinction as the Hanbei for instance isn't "Hanbei the immortal", he's "Hanbei the undying", which is what the mortal blade item description says, it is "capable of killing the undying" and not "the immortal". (I think this is an even more deliberate choice when considering that the blade is called the \*mortal\* blade and the choice of word used isn't "immortal" , it's a completely different one. "undying"; especially when we consider that "undying" is an odd term in that it doesn't mean "cannot" die but something that "does not" die.) 

On the black mortal blade though, the black scroll only actually says it has the ability to "open a gate to the underworld", it never explicitly states that it can kill undying, like the crimson mortal blade can. Though it's curious that it can make Kuro bleed in the cutscene before Isshin, I think it's a jump to go from "it can make him bleed" to "it can kill immortals".
                    “Kuro: Wolf, that sword on your back, is it...

Sekiro: It is the Mortal Blade.

Kuro: The sword that can kill those who cannot die...

Sekiro: Yes. It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.”

Alternately, 

“Kuro: The sword that can kill those who cannot die... I didn't expect you to find it so quickly.

Sekiro: Yes. It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.”

“IMMORTALITY SEVERED”

The Red Mortal Blade and the Black Mortal Blade both do the same thing, which is why Genichiro found it in the first place to bleed Kuro, and why Isshin uses it to fight you in both endings.  Because killing you would be pointless if you just came back, still as a Shura.
                    They wouldn’t be called mortal blades if they couldn’t sever immortality. Black blade is called Open Gate and has an additional ability to open a gate to the underworld. Red blade is called Gracious Gift of Tears and has an additional ability to extract tears from the Sakura dragon.
                        where does it say that every mortal blade severs immortality? what i got from it was that the mortal blades interact with mortality in different ways, in that the crimson mortal blade restores it in severing immortality and making someone mortal again and the black mortal black restores it in bringing people back to life. from what we know i think this is a stronger view
                    Is there YouTubers who nerd out to the lore this deep similarly to guys like Smoughtown for Elden Ring? I can only ever find short rundowns or plot summaries
                        not to my knowledge unfortunately :(
usually the lore is only spoken about either in critiques of the game or those plot summaries; reddit seems to be the only place to care
                    this man really wrote an essay about how undying is different to being immortal, props to this guy.
                        i can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic but i’ll take the compliment 😊
            Nah, if kills are canon then we wouldnt fight genichiro everytime we wanna fight isshin
        I actually have a headcanon that Sekiro canonically dies twice in the entire game. Once in Hirata and the second? I was thinking about how, if we knew when the other death was, we might be able to state the canon ending and vice versa. I'm sure other people have had this thought and maybe it was even figured out. Sadly I don't really keep up-to-date on this kinda stuff so...
            Drawing the mortal blade is a canon death.
                Forgot about that with how long it's been. Which is hilarious considering how often you return to that room to get the third ending option
    after his power is drained via dying too much it kills and damages the people around him wich means thst we have probably been fighting way easier versions of the bosses we were fighting that is if the amount of tines we have died is canon
        I don't necessarily think so as the dragonrot seems to act like a disease which kills individuals, it doesn't necessarily take power from the world around it generally, it takes from individuals. There aren't any bosses who seem to be afflicted with it, so I don't agree
Isshin has a mortal blade.
"To be a bitch"
This is my personal headcanon, but the reason he didn’t regen the arm was only because he didn’t die. 

Divine dragon is also missing an arm. I too think that was because it wasn’t a mortal wound and healed naturally.
    Why doesn't he get his arm back with subsequent deaths?
        Healed naturally.

I think the immortality returns a user to their most recent healthy state.
for some reason was hard for me to remember him loosing his arm, your right.
You're forgetting that Sekiro can literally fall hundreds of feet and be fine and is capable of parrying the divine dragon. He is a full blown demigod in his own right. Malenia ain't atomizing Jack shit 😂
    Falling hundreds of feet isn't even worth noting, not to mention that it's completely untrue. Fall damage exists, and you can die if you fall off a cliff.

Sekiro does not canonically party the Divine Dragon; that's just an oversight/gameplay mechanic. You cannot beat it at all with parrying; you have to use lightning reversal. On tne other hand, he *was* canonically fully incapable of doing any damage to some generic metal armor.

Malenia was a match for Radahn, who's literally so powerful that he can freeze entire constellations of stars in place with his gravity magic. She is absolutely atomizing him with a single swing. Her scarlet rot also affects things on the metaphysical level, such as rotting shards of the Elden Ring which is a collection of concepts used to control the laws of reality. It would completely erase Sekiro.
        Bro just said parrying the wind gust of the divine dragon is just gameplay mechanics but only being able to stagger armored warrior is absolutely canon… cherry-picking much?
            I'm going off of how the fights go. They're gimmick bosses with only one way to do them. Hence, that way is what's canon. If they intended for Sekiro to actually be strong enough to parry DD, they would have scoffed at the idea of armored warrior being a problem.
                Canonically sekiro could stagger and push him off once, we never actually see what happens if he just keeps hitting him.

Sekiro could literally block the snake as well.
                    Continuously hitting him does zero damage. His HP doesn't go down at all; it's specifically programmed for him to do zero damage.

Parrying the snake also does nothing to it, and iirc, you still take some damage from it regardless.

People really need to chill with this Sekiro hype. Lore-wise, he's literally the weakest fromsoft protagonist. The verse has virtually zero feats. D'S protagonist can seal a reality-damaging demon, DS protagonists fuel a star that keeps time itself functioning, BB protagonist kills eldritch gods that create entire dimensions, ER protagonist kills a conceptual god that creates a dimension and controls the very laws of reality with the Elden Ring. 

Sorry, but no one in Sekiro even comes close. People need to chill with the wank.
                        Yes that’s a gameplay mechanic… do you really believe sekiro wouldn’t eventually hurt him if he just kept chipping away?

Whether it does anything to the snake is irrelevant, the fact that sekiro could block that kind of force easily puts him at the top.

Lore and gameplay don’t match up at all, shit the the gods of bloodborne that can create universes or whatever and the most they can do is hit you…

If you go by pure gameplay mechanics (feats we can actually see) then sekiro is easily at the top.
                        What conceptual god did the ER protagonist kill? Elden beast was basically a proxy, not the actual greater will.
                        Im pretty sure it's stated that the divine dragon drove away the buddha and the great serpert god who we killed and parryed, expert for the buddha but you know why.
        Parrying the dragon is not at all an oversight when they make one of the snake encounter be undeflectable no matter what. 

If they don’t want you deflecting something, they can make it happen. Sekiro can deflect the dragon.
            No, they don't bother to do disable it because there's no reason to. Parrying it does literally nothing; the k my wsh to defeat jt is lightning reversal.

Again, Sekiro was completely incapable of even denying metal armor. If he was canonically capable of matching the divine dragon's strength, then he would have zero issue with some generic armor.
                It increases its posture. By this same logic he shouldn’t be able to match demon of hatred or guardian ape

The metal armor doesn’t even matter in this fight because Malenia doesn’t have armor in any vital places.
                    It doesn't do any *real* posture damage. The only way to break its posture is through lightning reversal. This has been tested.

He isn't strong enough to break basic metal. That's the point. He's not harming someone with a body far tougher than some random metal from medieval Europe.
                        Malenia can be hurt by a literal rock
        This is gonna be fun 😂 

>Falling hundreds of feet isn't even worth noting, not to mention that it's completely untrue. Fall damage exists, and you can die if you fall off a cliff.

THAT'S a gameplay mechanic buddy. If you land on hard ground you literally will not have a scratch, you only take damage when going out of bounds. 

>Sekiro does not canonically party the Divine Dragon; that's just an oversight/gameplay mechanic. You cannot beat it at all with parrying; you have to use lightning reversal. On the other hand, he was canonically fully incapable of doing any damage to some generic metal armor.

You are missing the point completely, what a surprise! I'm talking about his physical capabilities. He is capable of trading blows with a being the size of several buildings, that's a fact. 

>Malenia was a match for Radahn, who's literally so powerful that he can freeze entire constellations of stars in place with his gravity magic.

As a huge Radahn fanboy, this is just so false. We literally see the "star" Radahn was holding fall and it's just a single meteor. She also wasn't really a match for him considering that she only even survived because of the scarlet aeonia bloom and Finlay being a badass. She couldn't beat him based on skill though. 

Sekiro could literally just kill himself right after she uses Scarlet Rot and then resurrect afterwards and be fine. Lore wise his resurrections appear to be limitless if he has stuff to draw life from so he could do it as many times as he needs to. There is also in-universe medicine that heals the scarlet rot.

There's also absolutely zero evidence she can do that super bloom whenever she likes. That first one was so powerful because it was the first. If she did that every time she bloomed, Elphael would all be another Caelid and we could not have defeated her. 

>It would completely erase Sekiro.

You mean like it completely erased Malenia's and Radahn's armies? Dude gtfoh that's not even how the rot works, you're talking out your ass.
            > She couldn't beat him based on skill though.

She did fight him to a standstill purely with her skills. She blooms to end the stalemate.

>Battle of Aeonia. Radahn and Malenia locked in stalemate. Then, the scarlet rot blooms.
                OK yeah, that's fair. I was going off the image of her on her knees but I swear From has made it intentionally contradictory. I wonder how the Japanese put it actually that would settle all debates! Might have to look for a smoughtown vid real quick lol.
                    She wasn't on her knees though. And from what I've seen, most JP fans don't care about the Radahn vs Malenia debates since the lore made it clear that the battle ended in a stalemate.
                        Ah, that's not what I meant. I'm referring to how things can sometimes not translate very well from Japanese to English and Smoughtown has a friend who is fluent in Japanese and has discovered some really interesting details in the original version.
            No, you do take fall damage from great heights. It's not "out of bounds"; it's a fall from a cliff that kills you. Some solid copium right there. Also, once again, surviving falls is negligible fodder in terms of feats.

No he's not. If he were some generic armor wouldn't be an issue for him. End of story. Parrying the divine dragon canonically does not happen; it's not intended by the developers and doesn't press posture at all. Sekiro only does lightning reversals for the fight.

Radahn holds back everything in the sky. That was a Fallingstar, aka a meteor, which astrologer NPCs and item descriptions repeatedly distinguish from actual stars which form constellations and can be seen in space which meteors can't. Not to mention that the actual stars have a plethora of other characteristics incompatible with simple meteors.

Malenia is repeatedly stated to have fought him to a stalemate before she used scarlet rot to end the fight. We also see her move to fight him directly right before the fight in the trailer. Preserving Boluses are only there for gameplay, hence why the item descriptions has zero lore and why no one ever mentions them or tries to use them to cure rot. The rot is treated in canon as incurable.

Once again, Sekiro's immortality is very limited. He can't even do something as basic as regenerating limbs. Also, killing himself to get rid of status ailments is completely OOC.

She does the bloom all the time in her Goddess of Rot form. When has a soulsborne game ever had such a level of destruction in gameplay? That's literally impossible for them to do on a technical level. Of course they aren't going to have her destroy a massive portion of the map repeatedly in combat; don't be absurd.

Radahn is explictly only still there because his great rune combined with his willpower have just slowed down the rot. His army was never hit directly by the rot, only by very distant collateral damage. Her rot has completely afflicted her own great tune and has damaged Radahn's. Those are *fact*.
                Spitting absolute facts right here 🔥
                Spitting straight facts right there. Too bad your comment is gonna get buried lol.
            Finlay is star level confirmed

(I will admit scarlet rot may be Malenia’s only win condition, but Sekiro has two ways to deal with it. Resurrection to heal, and MAYBE divine grass, but that one is a reach. But then again, in lore rot is halted by fire and Sekiro loves fire)
                We all need at least one Finlay tier friend 😭 I like to imagine her stopping Radahn's blade an inch from Malenia's head, dropping a badass one-liner and dipping before Radahn can say snack lol. Such a cool character. 

>MAYBE divine grass

Good point actually. I didn't even think about that. 

>Sekiro loves fire

Fuck yeah, he does. Gotta wonder if the Lazulite flames would hurt Malenia and/or stop scarlet rot.
    Guy who can fall and deflect a big sword when scarlet aeonia:
        Guy with flamethrower built into his arm when scarlet Aeonia:
Immortality and the ability to literally regrow limbs are two completely different abilities you do realize that right
    If he can't even regrow limbs, that means he's not coming back to action from those kinds of injuries, let alone the bigger ones Malenia can cause him.
        Yet without an immortal blade she still wouldn’t be able to kill him at worst all she could do is dismember him, I would give her more benefit of the doubt if she was somehow able to have knowledge about the immortal blade but she doesn’t, she would have to use wolf’s own immortal blade to kill him but she wouldn’t instinctively just do that or know to do that so yeah the worst she could really do is just immobilize him  unless she was able to figure out what his blade is/does
            Dismembering him would put him out of the fight (which is a W), and the advantage she has in raw strength is enough for her to at least vaporize him, which his immortality definitely wouldn't bring him back from if it can't even regenerate limbs after death.

His immortality just isn't a factor against beings that do more than just regular blunt damage or stabbing. It doesn't help if his opponent goes for dismemberment or is strong enough to completely destroy his body.
He’ll be resurrecting constantly. DRAGONROT FOR ALL!!
Your right, she can just cut of his limbs then.
Yeah but does malenia have full body armor? Argument won, my logic is flawless/j
    Especially in second phase
Rot wouldn't even be needed. He ain't getting past her base form. Just like Maliketh fighting as beast clergyman would annihilate all of sekiro.
    Her base form… really…
        She fought Radahn to a standstill with her skills alone (the bloom happens after they were locked in a stalemate and she gets KO'd by her own OP attack). She is revered for her undefeated prowess and gained wings of "unparalleled strength". She hits harder than a [tank](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/v25297/i_did_some_math_on_malenias_waterfowl_dance/), is [pretty fast](https://imgur.com/nVOyIfO), and is the best swordsman in Lands Between so yeah, I don't see how Sekiro can beat Malenia (lorewise).
            [Sekiro deflects attacks that hit harder than a tank](https://reddit.com/r/Sekiro/s/0hgnNqkuGo)

And that’s the low ball estimate.
                And Malenia matched a [sword blow](https://imgur.com/2W3LeKy) from Radahn who is bigger than her by a LOT and is known for his mighty strength which also means Malenia can easily deflect Sekiro's attacks.
                    Yeah. So can Isshin.
                        Cool.
            I wouldn’t try to math it out precisely how strong she is, the intention most likely isn’t there, they’re most likely just going with “she’s fast” rather than “she’s so strong that she’s this fast” or whatnot. 
>her own underfeated prowess 

Same with isshin, he’s a sword saint after all and wolf beat him

>is pretty fast

So’s wolf
                Isshin is strong and Wolf is fast, yeah, but they don't come close to Malenia in terms of power. Malenia is one of the strongest characters in Elden Ring, she fought Radahn (mightiest demigod) to a standstill only with her skills and she herself is the avatar of Rot, a deadly curse that is incurable. I don't see how Isshin or Sekiro could beat Malenia. They can't even beat Mohg or Morgott.
                    > but they don't come close to Malenia in terms of power.

I do agree that Malenia is most likely physically stronger, so you do have me there... my stance is that Wolf is faster and more skilled. Combined with his shinobi tools he should prevail, of course this is just my opinion.

> I don't see how Isshin or Sekiro could beat Malenia. They can't even beat Mohg or Morgott.

I mean both Isshin and Sekiro are more than likely more skilled than her, which can go a long way, if you've seen MHA then think of Stain vs Deku and Co. They should at ***least*** have relevant strength against her, enough to deflect. If not then they should be fine dodging.
                        Why do you think they're more skilled than her? Malenia is a demigod, she has lived probably more than 5000 years and has canonically never known defeat (until she met Tarnished). She's definitely more skilled than both.
Ok, forgot her sword was longer, but she doesn’t output more energy than Divine dragon. 

Also should mention, Sekiro can literally use a better version of waterfowl dance that has more slashes
    Ok I agree with you

Sekiro/Divine Dragon/whatever solos Elden Ring universe
When has wolf ever fight honestly though ;D
    What's the point of powerscaling and comparing them if we don't only account for skill and we only go off of "wolf can infinitely respawn, therefore wins"
        He can’t infinitely respawn, just until there’s nobody left to steal life force from… ^(so we just have kill everyone else first)
Yup, was leaning towards Sekiro having the capability to defeat her. 

My point being that Godhood doesn’t make you safe from our funny shinobi.
Thank you!
>that’s near the end of the game

It’s weird I know, but most consistently he’s been shown to have superhuman strength.
>gameplay mechanics Translate into actual abilities unless it’s plot related

It is plot related, he canonically deflects all of his foes, it’s his fighting style. Also, there’s a lot of intention behind some gameplay mechanics
    His fighting style also involves acrobatics and dodges. Thus you cannot assume that he can canonically deflect all attacks
        No, the lore literally says that he prefers to deflect
            “Prefers” doesn’t mean being able to deflect everything
                It does mean though that it’s a preferred tactic, also, you can deflect the enemies in gameplay, which has a lot of intention behind it
                    Does the same apply to the bloodborne hunter? Dodging is the main method of avoiding damage, so similarly there is a lot of intention. He has dodging i-frames that let him take no damage from AOEs.

Do you actually think he is canonically undamaged when dodging in the middle of big fire attacks?
                        >Dodging is the main method of avoiding damage, so similarly there is a lot of intention.

No, in Sekiro's case there's lore behind it, plus the fact that the deflections are a full fledged animation that interacts with the enemy. Look at the guardian ape fight for instance [there's a clear reaction between both animations](https://youtu.be/_EB2wZVNlH0?t=158). It's also just a move that makes sense, deflecting like that makes sense, but invincibility like that? Nah, I don’t think so.
Quiet a lot in this sub. Their argument is that Maliketh doesn't have mortal blade so Isshin wins.
    … MALIKETH IS A WALKING MORTAL BLADE

(While the specifics of Destined death are up for debate, I still think it functions like the mortal blade would)
If you’re constantly parrying your posture won’t break
    You forget she gains health every block so blocking is just gonna heal her and she attacks relentlessly
        Parrying her does not give health back though
            With a Shield yes but with a sword she will gain health
                Ok but health doesn’t really matter in sekiro, the way this battle would work is if the mechanics were: Malenia in sekiro or sekiro v Malenia in Elden ring
                    So it depends on the game world we fighting in

Wolf tops in his world 

Malenia tops in her world
                        Staggering is still a thing in Elden ring so no
                        Yeah Malenia ported into sekiro hard clapped by wolf, wolf in Elden Ring probably end as a stalemate
                You literally can parry her with a sword
            It would take forever though
Fatal respiratory infection go: *cough*
    Can Sekiro beat Radahn, Godfrey, or Maliketh?
        Godfrey, yes. Sekiro’s whole fighting style (paired with umbrella only) counters everything Godfrey has. It basically be super Saiyan chained ogre with no fire weakness. 

Maliketh, harder to say for one reason. In game, only the blasphemous claw can parry destined death, but there’s one spell that can redirect the ranged attacks. Also, the purple umbrella can deflect the mortal draw, which looks to be equivalent to destined death. So if you allow anything else to deflect destined death, Sekiro wins for sure, if not, it’s a gamble, but Sekiro still has a ton of counters. He can deflect non-destined death attacks and dodge many of the other attacks maliketh has, and finally, the Malcontent can stall Maliketh long enough for some good hits. There’s also the Mist raven that can be used to avoid destined death. 

Radahn, this one is very hard. If you consider Radahn using electromagnetic lightning, *MAYBE* Sekiro can redirect it, but without that, Sekiro can still deflect anything that isn’t that and could possibly deflect the shockwave pull, as he can deflect the Demon of Hatred’s shockwave. The Radahn meteor, you can argue he can’t deflect it, but mist raven. (Keep in mind this is Rotted Radahn, not Prime Radahn). It also should be noted you can jump the electromagnetic lightning in ER, so Sekiro should be good. Malcontent could even turn Leonard against Radahn.
            Sekiro can't dodge Chadfrey's grab attack though. :P

There's no way Sekiro can beat Maliketh in any scenario. You're forgetting that Maliketh is fast enough to dodge literally every attack from Sekiro and he is literally death itself. Maliketh slaughters Sekiro and it's not even close.

Radahn absolutely wipes him too. He doesn't even need to turn into a meteor to destroy him. Radahn is terribly huge, controls gravity, and uses two greatswords. He swings them and Sekiro is dead. Idk man youre really underestimating the power levels of the demigods. The only demigod Sekiro can beat is Godrick.
                Umbrella deflects grabs. 

Maliketh is just as fast as Demon of Hatred

Sekiro can deflect divine dragon. Radahn’s swords are no problem
                    Bro 💀
She doesn’t gain hp when you parry any of her other attacks so waterfowl shouldn’t be an exception
    You can't parry in sekiro, only deflect
        ^(It’s the same thing)
[no](https://youtu.be/uGIRgaKY58A?si=9ImxEyyUy_ovZ_vc)
    Let me guess. You linked me a video of someone deflecting it with frame perfect timing despite noone being able to replicate this consistently ever
        It’s not that hard to deflect it, i wouldn’t say it’s consistent but i’ve done it and a bunch of other people on youtube did too, the point i was trying to make is that it’s possible anyway, i wasn’t claiming that you could beat malenia hitless or anything like that
Rolling in most of the explosions of Elden ring still gets you caught in the radius. (Unless you mean rolling out of them.)

The difference being that the deflects directly affect your opponents. Why would Sekiro’s deflects not be canon when his whole fighting style revolves around it and it’s pretty much the only way he’s won various fights.
    Nope u can i-frame many explosions including maliketh’s stabbing rock pulse attack.
        I was thinking of ones like Placidusax’s nuke or Malenia’s aeonia
            Sure, but my comment still stands. You can iframe some explosions in elden ring. Does that make it canon?
                Uh. Idk. You can roll some explosions but not others. So yes?
                    See personally i would say no, because iframes make no sense in canon. 

Hence why i also think similar gameplay mechanics in sekiro are not canon

But if you believe this is canon, then i can see why you feel that sekiro can canonically deflect basically every attack
Not really.

There’s a sword parry in Elden ring after all
    No like when you parry in Elden Ring you knock their arm away. The attack doesn't connect. In Sekiro when you deflect the attack still connects but no damage is dealt.

Look at it this way, in Elden Ring when you parry enemy gets stance broken and you can do a critical strike. In Sekiro deflecting builds their posture bar until it's full then they break and you can do a critical strike. That's why parry and deflect are different.
        With a deflect, the attack is still pushed away, you just don’t throw off the enemy until posture is broken. 

I think charmless is the best way to show that, like blocking in Elden ring, you can still take chip damage, but when deflecting you take none.
            Well no the attack isn't pushed away. Well at least in most cases I've seen it's not. I won't argue about deflection anymore because it won't anywhere. 

Malenia still beats Sekiro
Not with a confetti buff!
    Oh damn. I did not know that. That makes him even more op then
        He's also got a selection of umbrellas to counter magic.
Ain't no way Bloodborne isn't the smelliest, the entire city is blood, wet dogs, tentacles, and abortions

Edit: Also gunpowder and the British
I haven’t played bloodborne but the screenshots make it look like one massive toxic swamp. I’m sure the hunter is absolutely disgusting. Then again, Lake of Rot and Caelid in general definitely smells like trenchfoot.
Yea that’s correct, isshin is wielding something that can kil him
    Damn I affirm someone’s opinion and I get upvotes. This website easy
ah, though he was talking about respawing at sculptors idol
~~only the red mortal blade can sever immortality,~~ genichiro sacrifices his flesh to summon prime isshin from the underworld using the black mortal blade because he knows that he's the only one that can beat wolf and "save" ashina.

edit: I was wrong, it seems the main difference between the two is the red mortal blade kills anyone who draws it, and the black one doesn't do this, instead you can sacrifice someone and open a gate to the underworld to summon anyone.
    And how would he beat an immortal without any way to kill him?

Black mortal blade nearly killed Kuro, and his immortality is god tier compared to sekiro's, so much so, that he doesnt even bleed. 

So yeah, black mortal blade can most likely sever immortality
        It also is the only feasible way Tomoe and Takeru could’ve died. So it must be able to sever immortality
        In the shura ending when owl comes back he’s actually holding 2 items, the black mortal blade and genichiros head, indicating that he beat genichiro within an inch of his life and severed his immortality with the black mortal blade.
Licks Cheeto dust off fingers, snorts hard enough to suck snot into diaphragm, scratches ass, exhales hard

> Not when Isshin is wielding the black mortal blade, while is highly implied to be very effective against immortals if the nasty cut Genichiro gave Kuro right before you showed up is any indication
    Excuse you, I’m a gamer of culture. I was licking sea salt and vinegar dust off my fingers.
        Fair
I feel it’s a mix.  I don’t think he dies for real if you die twice, the guy’s using the true gift, not an imitation.

However, I do think the Sculptor’s Idols are just a game mechanic, and that throughout the game, he never gets a game over.

In the final battle, he doesn’t even die once.  The Mortal Blade would put him down, period. No second chances.  The only reason it doesn’t is because it would ruin the game for a lot of people.
    I'm not entirely sure I agree that the mortal blade would kill him, and I think I stand by my assertion that we can think of the game canonically just being the  runs where he doesn't die spliced together.

On the mortal blade, sure if Sekiro were to kill himself with his one then he would die, but correct me if I'm wrong, is there anything that explicitly says that the blade mortal blade would kill immortals if it were to be used that way? My understanding of what it did was that it revived the dead, and for that reason it was to do with mortality and got the name, it is Sekiro's mortal blade that severs the connection between mortals and immortals (in that I don't think Sekiro kills the Divine Dragon, just incapacitates it, because it is immortal by nature)
        Killing immortals is explicitly what it does.  It’s* why there are things in the game you can’t kill without it.

It’s why Kuro says it can kill immortals.

It’s why Kuro bleeds when he’s stabbed with it.  Kuro doesn’t bleed under normal circumstances.
            It doesn't kill immortals technically, it severs the connection of undying to immortality, Kuro is a person and therefore a mortal but he is connected to the Divine Dragon, so functionally immortal. The Divine Dragon itself cannot be killed though. The game actually makes this distinction as the Hanbei for instance isn't "Hanbei the immortal", he's "Hanbei the undying", which is what the mortal blade item description says, it is "capable of killing the undying" and not "the immortal". (I think this is an even more deliberate choice when considering that the blade is called the \*mortal\* blade and the choice of word used isn't "immortal" , it's a completely different one. "undying"; especially when we consider that "undying" is an odd term in that it doesn't mean "cannot" die but something that "does not" die.) 

On the black mortal blade though, the black scroll only actually says it has the ability to "open a gate to the underworld", it never explicitly states that it can kill undying, like the crimson mortal blade can. Though it's curious that it can make Kuro bleed in the cutscene before Isshin, I think it's a jump to go from "it can make him bleed" to "it can kill immortals".
                “Kuro: Wolf, that sword on your back, is it...

Sekiro: It is the Mortal Blade.

Kuro: The sword that can kill those who cannot die...

Sekiro: Yes. It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.”

Alternately, 

“Kuro: The sword that can kill those who cannot die... I didn't expect you to find it so quickly.

Sekiro: Yes. It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.”

“IMMORTALITY SEVERED”

The Red Mortal Blade and the Black Mortal Blade both do the same thing, which is why Genichiro found it in the first place to bleed Kuro, and why Isshin uses it to fight you in both endings.  Because killing you would be pointless if you just came back, still as a Shura.
                They wouldn’t be called mortal blades if they couldn’t sever immortality. Black blade is called Open Gate and has an additional ability to open a gate to the underworld. Red blade is called Gracious Gift of Tears and has an additional ability to extract tears from the Sakura dragon.
                    where does it say that every mortal blade severs immortality? what i got from it was that the mortal blades interact with mortality in different ways, in that the crimson mortal blade restores it in severing immortality and making someone mortal again and the black mortal black restores it in bringing people back to life. from what we know i think this is a stronger view
                Is there YouTubers who nerd out to the lore this deep similarly to guys like Smoughtown for Elden Ring? I can only ever find short rundowns or plot summaries
                    not to my knowledge unfortunately :(
usually the lore is only spoken about either in critiques of the game or those plot summaries; reddit seems to be the only place to care
                this man really wrote an essay about how undying is different to being immortal, props to this guy.
                    i can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic but i’ll take the compliment 😊
        Nah, if kills are canon then we wouldnt fight genichiro everytime we wanna fight isshin
    I actually have a headcanon that Sekiro canonically dies twice in the entire game. Once in Hirata and the second? I was thinking about how, if we knew when the other death was, we might be able to state the canon ending and vice versa. I'm sure other people have had this thought and maybe it was even figured out. Sadly I don't really keep up-to-date on this kinda stuff so...
        Drawing the mortal blade is a canon death.
            Forgot about that with how long it's been. Which is hilarious considering how often you return to that room to get the third ending option
after his power is drained via dying too much it kills and damages the people around him wich means thst we have probably been fighting way easier versions of the bosses we were fighting that is if the amount of tines we have died is canon
    I don't necessarily think so as the dragonrot seems to act like a disease which kills individuals, it doesn't necessarily take power from the world around it generally, it takes from individuals. There aren't any bosses who seem to be afflicted with it, so I don't agree
Why doesn't he get his arm back with subsequent deaths?
    Healed naturally.

I think the immortality returns a user to their most recent healthy state.
Falling hundreds of feet isn't even worth noting, not to mention that it's completely untrue. Fall damage exists, and you can die if you fall off a cliff.

Sekiro does not canonically party the Divine Dragon; that's just an oversight/gameplay mechanic. You cannot beat it at all with parrying; you have to use lightning reversal. On tne other hand, he *was* canonically fully incapable of doing any damage to some generic metal armor.

Malenia was a match for Radahn, who's literally so powerful that he can freeze entire constellations of stars in place with his gravity magic. She is absolutely atomizing him with a single swing. Her scarlet rot also affects things on the metaphysical level, such as rotting shards of the Elden Ring which is a collection of concepts used to control the laws of reality. It would completely erase Sekiro.
    Bro just said parrying the wind gust of the divine dragon is just gameplay mechanics but only being able to stagger armored warrior is absolutely canon… cherry-picking much?
        I'm going off of how the fights go. They're gimmick bosses with only one way to do them. Hence, that way is what's canon. If they intended for Sekiro to actually be strong enough to parry DD, they would have scoffed at the idea of armored warrior being a problem.
            Canonically sekiro could stagger and push him off once, we never actually see what happens if he just keeps hitting him.

Sekiro could literally block the snake as well.
                Continuously hitting him does zero damage. His HP doesn't go down at all; it's specifically programmed for him to do zero damage.

Parrying the snake also does nothing to it, and iirc, you still take some damage from it regardless.

People really need to chill with this Sekiro hype. Lore-wise, he's literally the weakest fromsoft protagonist. The verse has virtually zero feats. D'S protagonist can seal a reality-damaging demon, DS protagonists fuel a star that keeps time itself functioning, BB protagonist kills eldritch gods that create entire dimensions, ER protagonist kills a conceptual god that creates a dimension and controls the very laws of reality with the Elden Ring. 

Sorry, but no one in Sekiro even comes close. People need to chill with the wank.
                    Yes that’s a gameplay mechanic… do you really believe sekiro wouldn’t eventually hurt him if he just kept chipping away?

Whether it does anything to the snake is irrelevant, the fact that sekiro could block that kind of force easily puts him at the top.

Lore and gameplay don’t match up at all, shit the the gods of bloodborne that can create universes or whatever and the most they can do is hit you…

If you go by pure gameplay mechanics (feats we can actually see) then sekiro is easily at the top.
                    What conceptual god did the ER protagonist kill? Elden beast was basically a proxy, not the actual greater will.
                    Im pretty sure it's stated that the divine dragon drove away the buddha and the great serpert god who we killed and parryed, expert for the buddha but you know why.
    Parrying the dragon is not at all an oversight when they make one of the snake encounter be undeflectable no matter what. 

If they don’t want you deflecting something, they can make it happen. Sekiro can deflect the dragon.
        No, they don't bother to do disable it because there's no reason to. Parrying it does literally nothing; the k my wsh to defeat jt is lightning reversal.

Again, Sekiro was completely incapable of even denying metal armor. If he was canonically capable of matching the divine dragon's strength, then he would have zero issue with some generic armor.
            It increases its posture. By this same logic he shouldn’t be able to match demon of hatred or guardian ape

The metal armor doesn’t even matter in this fight because Malenia doesn’t have armor in any vital places.
                It doesn't do any *real* posture damage. The only way to break its posture is through lightning reversal. This has been tested.

He isn't strong enough to break basic metal. That's the point. He's not harming someone with a body far tougher than some random metal from medieval Europe.
                    Malenia can be hurt by a literal rock
    This is gonna be fun 😂 

>Falling hundreds of feet isn't even worth noting, not to mention that it's completely untrue. Fall damage exists, and you can die if you fall off a cliff.

THAT'S a gameplay mechanic buddy. If you land on hard ground you literally will not have a scratch, you only take damage when going out of bounds. 

>Sekiro does not canonically party the Divine Dragon; that's just an oversight/gameplay mechanic. You cannot beat it at all with parrying; you have to use lightning reversal. On the other hand, he was canonically fully incapable of doing any damage to some generic metal armor.

You are missing the point completely, what a surprise! I'm talking about his physical capabilities. He is capable of trading blows with a being the size of several buildings, that's a fact. 

>Malenia was a match for Radahn, who's literally so powerful that he can freeze entire constellations of stars in place with his gravity magic.

As a huge Radahn fanboy, this is just so false. We literally see the "star" Radahn was holding fall and it's just a single meteor. She also wasn't really a match for him considering that she only even survived because of the scarlet aeonia bloom and Finlay being a badass. She couldn't beat him based on skill though. 

Sekiro could literally just kill himself right after she uses Scarlet Rot and then resurrect afterwards and be fine. Lore wise his resurrections appear to be limitless if he has stuff to draw life from so he could do it as many times as he needs to. There is also in-universe medicine that heals the scarlet rot.

There's also absolutely zero evidence she can do that super bloom whenever she likes. That first one was so powerful because it was the first. If she did that every time she bloomed, Elphael would all be another Caelid and we could not have defeated her. 

>It would completely erase Sekiro.

You mean like it completely erased Malenia's and Radahn's armies? Dude gtfoh that's not even how the rot works, you're talking out your ass.
        > She couldn't beat him based on skill though.

She did fight him to a standstill purely with her skills. She blooms to end the stalemate.

>Battle of Aeonia. Radahn and Malenia locked in stalemate. Then, the scarlet rot blooms.
            OK yeah, that's fair. I was going off the image of her on her knees but I swear From has made it intentionally contradictory. I wonder how the Japanese put it actually that would settle all debates! Might have to look for a smoughtown vid real quick lol.
                She wasn't on her knees though. And from what I've seen, most JP fans don't care about the Radahn vs Malenia debates since the lore made it clear that the battle ended in a stalemate.
                    Ah, that's not what I meant. I'm referring to how things can sometimes not translate very well from Japanese to English and Smoughtown has a friend who is fluent in Japanese and has discovered some really interesting details in the original version.
        No, you do take fall damage from great heights. It's not "out of bounds"; it's a fall from a cliff that kills you. Some solid copium right there. Also, once again, surviving falls is negligible fodder in terms of feats.

No he's not. If he were some generic armor wouldn't be an issue for him. End of story. Parrying the divine dragon canonically does not happen; it's not intended by the developers and doesn't press posture at all. Sekiro only does lightning reversals for the fight.

Radahn holds back everything in the sky. That was a Fallingstar, aka a meteor, which astrologer NPCs and item descriptions repeatedly distinguish from actual stars which form constellations and can be seen in space which meteors can't. Not to mention that the actual stars have a plethora of other characteristics incompatible with simple meteors.

Malenia is repeatedly stated to have fought him to a stalemate before she used scarlet rot to end the fight. We also see her move to fight him directly right before the fight in the trailer. Preserving Boluses are only there for gameplay, hence why the item descriptions has zero lore and why no one ever mentions them or tries to use them to cure rot. The rot is treated in canon as incurable.

Once again, Sekiro's immortality is very limited. He can't even do something as basic as regenerating limbs. Also, killing himself to get rid of status ailments is completely OOC.

She does the bloom all the time in her Goddess of Rot form. When has a soulsborne game ever had such a level of destruction in gameplay? That's literally impossible for them to do on a technical level. Of course they aren't going to have her destroy a massive portion of the map repeatedly in combat; don't be absurd.

Radahn is explictly only still there because his great rune combined with his willpower have just slowed down the rot. His army was never hit directly by the rot, only by very distant collateral damage. Her rot has completely afflicted her own great tune and has damaged Radahn's. Those are *fact*.
            Spitting absolute facts right here 🔥
            Spitting straight facts right there. Too bad your comment is gonna get buried lol.
        Finlay is star level confirmed

(I will admit scarlet rot may be Malenia’s only win condition, but Sekiro has two ways to deal with it. Resurrection to heal, and MAYBE divine grass, but that one is a reach. But then again, in lore rot is halted by fire and Sekiro loves fire)
            We all need at least one Finlay tier friend 😭 I like to imagine her stopping Radahn's blade an inch from Malenia's head, dropping a badass one-liner and dipping before Radahn can say snack lol. Such a cool character. 

>MAYBE divine grass

Good point actually. I didn't even think about that. 

>Sekiro loves fire

Fuck yeah, he does. Gotta wonder if the Lazulite flames would hurt Malenia and/or stop scarlet rot.
Guy who can fall and deflect a big sword when scarlet aeonia:
    Guy with flamethrower built into his arm when scarlet Aeonia:
If he can't even regrow limbs, that means he's not coming back to action from those kinds of injuries, let alone the bigger ones Malenia can cause him.
    Yet without an immortal blade she still wouldn’t be able to kill him at worst all she could do is dismember him, I would give her more benefit of the doubt if she was somehow able to have knowledge about the immortal blade but she doesn’t, she would have to use wolf’s own immortal blade to kill him but she wouldn’t instinctively just do that or know to do that so yeah the worst she could really do is just immobilize him  unless she was able to figure out what his blade is/does
        Dismembering him would put him out of the fight (which is a W), and the advantage she has in raw strength is enough for her to at least vaporize him, which his immortality definitely wouldn't bring him back from if it can't even regenerate limbs after death.

His immortality just isn't a factor against beings that do more than just regular blunt damage or stabbing. It doesn't help if his opponent goes for dismemberment or is strong enough to completely destroy his body.
Especially in second phase
Her base form… really…
    She fought Radahn to a standstill with her skills alone (the bloom happens after they were locked in a stalemate and she gets KO'd by her own OP attack). She is revered for her undefeated prowess and gained wings of "unparalleled strength". She hits harder than a [tank](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/v25297/i_did_some_math_on_malenias_waterfowl_dance/), is [pretty fast](https://imgur.com/nVOyIfO), and is the best swordsman in Lands Between so yeah, I don't see how Sekiro can beat Malenia (lorewise).
        [Sekiro deflects attacks that hit harder than a tank](https://reddit.com/r/Sekiro/s/0hgnNqkuGo)

And that’s the low ball estimate.
            And Malenia matched a [sword blow](https://imgur.com/2W3LeKy) from Radahn who is bigger than her by a LOT and is known for his mighty strength which also means Malenia can easily deflect Sekiro's attacks.
                Yeah. So can Isshin.
                    Cool.
        I wouldn’t try to math it out precisely how strong she is, the intention most likely isn’t there, they’re most likely just going with “she’s fast” rather than “she’s so strong that she’s this fast” or whatnot. 
>her own underfeated prowess 

Same with isshin, he’s a sword saint after all and wolf beat him

>is pretty fast

So’s wolf
            Isshin is strong and Wolf is fast, yeah, but they don't come close to Malenia in terms of power. Malenia is one of the strongest characters in Elden Ring, she fought Radahn (mightiest demigod) to a standstill only with her skills and she herself is the avatar of Rot, a deadly curse that is incurable. I don't see how Isshin or Sekiro could beat Malenia. They can't even beat Mohg or Morgott.
                > but they don't come close to Malenia in terms of power.

I do agree that Malenia is most likely physically stronger, so you do have me there... my stance is that Wolf is faster and more skilled. Combined with his shinobi tools he should prevail, of course this is just my opinion.

> I don't see how Isshin or Sekiro could beat Malenia. They can't even beat Mohg or Morgott.

I mean both Isshin and Sekiro are more than likely more skilled than her, which can go a long way, if you've seen MHA then think of Stain vs Deku and Co. They should at ***least*** have relevant strength against her, enough to deflect. If not then they should be fine dodging.
                    Why do you think they're more skilled than her? Malenia is a demigod, she has lived probably more than 5000 years and has canonically never known defeat (until she met Tarnished). She's definitely more skilled than both.
Ok I agree with you

Sekiro/Divine Dragon/whatever solos Elden Ring universe
What's the point of powerscaling and comparing them if we don't only account for skill and we only go off of "wolf can infinitely respawn, therefore wins"
    He can’t infinitely respawn, just until there’s nobody left to steal life force from… ^(so we just have kill everyone else first)
His fighting style also involves acrobatics and dodges. Thus you cannot assume that he can canonically deflect all attacks
    No, the lore literally says that he prefers to deflect
        “Prefers” doesn’t mean being able to deflect everything
            It does mean though that it’s a preferred tactic, also, you can deflect the enemies in gameplay, which has a lot of intention behind it
                Does the same apply to the bloodborne hunter? Dodging is the main method of avoiding damage, so similarly there is a lot of intention. He has dodging i-frames that let him take no damage from AOEs.

Do you actually think he is canonically undamaged when dodging in the middle of big fire attacks?
                    >Dodging is the main method of avoiding damage, so similarly there is a lot of intention.

No, in Sekiro's case there's lore behind it, plus the fact that the deflections are a full fledged animation that interacts with the enemy. Look at the guardian ape fight for instance [there's a clear reaction between both animations](https://youtu.be/_EB2wZVNlH0?t=158). It's also just a move that makes sense, deflecting like that makes sense, but invincibility like that? Nah, I don’t think so.
… MALIKETH IS A WALKING MORTAL BLADE

(While the specifics of Destined death are up for debate, I still think it functions like the mortal blade would)
You forget she gains health every block so blocking is just gonna heal her and she attacks relentlessly
    Parrying her does not give health back though
        With a Shield yes but with a sword she will gain health
            Ok but health doesn’t really matter in sekiro, the way this battle would work is if the mechanics were: Malenia in sekiro or sekiro v Malenia in Elden ring
                So it depends on the game world we fighting in

Wolf tops in his world 

Malenia tops in her world
                    Staggering is still a thing in Elden ring so no
                    Yeah Malenia ported into sekiro hard clapped by wolf, wolf in Elden Ring probably end as a stalemate
            You literally can parry her with a sword
        It would take forever though
Can Sekiro beat Radahn, Godfrey, or Maliketh?
    Godfrey, yes. Sekiro’s whole fighting style (paired with umbrella only) counters everything Godfrey has. It basically be super Saiyan chained ogre with no fire weakness. 

Maliketh, harder to say for one reason. In game, only the blasphemous claw can parry destined death, but there’s one spell that can redirect the ranged attacks. Also, the purple umbrella can deflect the mortal draw, which looks to be equivalent to destined death. So if you allow anything else to deflect destined death, Sekiro wins for sure, if not, it’s a gamble, but Sekiro still has a ton of counters. He can deflect non-destined death attacks and dodge many of the other attacks maliketh has, and finally, the Malcontent can stall Maliketh long enough for some good hits. There’s also the Mist raven that can be used to avoid destined death. 

Radahn, this one is very hard. If you consider Radahn using electromagnetic lightning, *MAYBE* Sekiro can redirect it, but without that, Sekiro can still deflect anything that isn’t that and could possibly deflect the shockwave pull, as he can deflect the Demon of Hatred’s shockwave. The Radahn meteor, you can argue he can’t deflect it, but mist raven. (Keep in mind this is Rotted Radahn, not Prime Radahn). It also should be noted you can jump the electromagnetic lightning in ER, so Sekiro should be good. Malcontent could even turn Leonard against Radahn.
        Sekiro can't dodge Chadfrey's grab attack though. :P

There's no way Sekiro can beat Maliketh in any scenario. You're forgetting that Maliketh is fast enough to dodge literally every attack from Sekiro and he is literally death itself. Maliketh slaughters Sekiro and it's not even close.

Radahn absolutely wipes him too. He doesn't even need to turn into a meteor to destroy him. Radahn is terribly huge, controls gravity, and uses two greatswords. He swings them and Sekiro is dead. Idk man youre really underestimating the power levels of the demigods. The only demigod Sekiro can beat is Godrick.
            Umbrella deflects grabs. 

Maliketh is just as fast as Demon of Hatred

Sekiro can deflect divine dragon. Radahn’s swords are no problem
                Bro 💀
You can't parry in sekiro, only deflect
    ^(It’s the same thing)
Let me guess. You linked me a video of someone deflecting it with frame perfect timing despite noone being able to replicate this consistently ever
    It’s not that hard to deflect it, i wouldn’t say it’s consistent but i’ve done it and a bunch of other people on youtube did too, the point i was trying to make is that it’s possible anyway, i wasn’t claiming that you could beat malenia hitless or anything like that
Nope u can i-frame many explosions including maliketh’s stabbing rock pulse attack.
    I was thinking of ones like Placidusax’s nuke or Malenia’s aeonia
        Sure, but my comment still stands. You can iframe some explosions in elden ring. Does that make it canon?
            Uh. Idk. You can roll some explosions but not others. So yes?
                See personally i would say no, because iframes make no sense in canon. 

Hence why i also think similar gameplay mechanics in sekiro are not canon

But if you believe this is canon, then i can see why you feel that sekiro can canonically deflect basically every attack
No like when you parry in Elden Ring you knock their arm away. The attack doesn't connect. In Sekiro when you deflect the attack still connects but no damage is dealt.

Look at it this way, in Elden Ring when you parry enemy gets stance broken and you can do a critical strike. In Sekiro deflecting builds their posture bar until it's full then they break and you can do a critical strike. That's why parry and deflect are different.
    With a deflect, the attack is still pushed away, you just don’t throw off the enemy until posture is broken. 

I think charmless is the best way to show that, like blocking in Elden ring, you can still take chip damage, but when deflecting you take none.
        Well no the attack isn't pushed away. Well at least in most cases I've seen it's not. I won't argue about deflection anymore because it won't anywhere. 

Malenia still beats Sekiro
Oh damn. I did not know that. That makes him even more op then
    He's also got a selection of umbrellas to counter magic.
Damn I affirm someone’s opinion and I get upvotes. This website easy
And how would he beat an immortal without any way to kill him?

Black mortal blade nearly killed Kuro, and his immortality is god tier compared to sekiro's, so much so, that he doesnt even bleed. 

So yeah, black mortal blade can most likely sever immortality
    It also is the only feasible way Tomoe and Takeru could’ve died. So it must be able to sever immortality
    In the shura ending when owl comes back he’s actually holding 2 items, the black mortal blade and genichiros head, indicating that he beat genichiro within an inch of his life and severed his immortality with the black mortal blade.
Excuse you, I’m a gamer of culture. I was licking sea salt and vinegar dust off my fingers.
    Fair
I'm not entirely sure I agree that the mortal blade would kill him, and I think I stand by my assertion that we can think of the game canonically just being the  runs where he doesn't die spliced together.

On the mortal blade, sure if Sekiro were to kill himself with his one then he would die, but correct me if I'm wrong, is there anything that explicitly says that the blade mortal blade would kill immortals if it were to be used that way? My understanding of what it did was that it revived the dead, and for that reason it was to do with mortality and got the name, it is Sekiro's mortal blade that severs the connection between mortals and immortals (in that I don't think Sekiro kills the Divine Dragon, just incapacitates it, because it is immortal by nature)
    Killing immortals is explicitly what it does.  It’s* why there are things in the game you can’t kill without it.

It’s why Kuro says it can kill immortals.

It’s why Kuro bleeds when he’s stabbed with it.  Kuro doesn’t bleed under normal circumstances.
        It doesn't kill immortals technically, it severs the connection of undying to immortality, Kuro is a person and therefore a mortal but he is connected to the Divine Dragon, so functionally immortal. The Divine Dragon itself cannot be killed though. The game actually makes this distinction as the Hanbei for instance isn't "Hanbei the immortal", he's "Hanbei the undying", which is what the mortal blade item description says, it is "capable of killing the undying" and not "the immortal". (I think this is an even more deliberate choice when considering that the blade is called the \*mortal\* blade and the choice of word used isn't "immortal" , it's a completely different one. "undying"; especially when we consider that "undying" is an odd term in that it doesn't mean "cannot" die but something that "does not" die.) 

On the black mortal blade though, the black scroll only actually says it has the ability to "open a gate to the underworld", it never explicitly states that it can kill undying, like the crimson mortal blade can. Though it's curious that it can make Kuro bleed in the cutscene before Isshin, I think it's a jump to go from "it can make him bleed" to "it can kill immortals".
            “Kuro: Wolf, that sword on your back, is it...

Sekiro: It is the Mortal Blade.

Kuro: The sword that can kill those who cannot die...

Sekiro: Yes. It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.”

Alternately, 

“Kuro: The sword that can kill those who cannot die... I didn't expect you to find it so quickly.

Sekiro: Yes. It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.”

“IMMORTALITY SEVERED”

The Red Mortal Blade and the Black Mortal Blade both do the same thing, which is why Genichiro found it in the first place to bleed Kuro, and why Isshin uses it to fight you in both endings.  Because killing you would be pointless if you just came back, still as a Shura.
            They wouldn’t be called mortal blades if they couldn’t sever immortality. Black blade is called Open Gate and has an additional ability to open a gate to the underworld. Red blade is called Gracious Gift of Tears and has an additional ability to extract tears from the Sakura dragon.
                where does it say that every mortal blade severs immortality? what i got from it was that the mortal blades interact with mortality in different ways, in that the crimson mortal blade restores it in severing immortality and making someone mortal again and the black mortal black restores it in bringing people back to life. from what we know i think this is a stronger view
            Is there YouTubers who nerd out to the lore this deep similarly to guys like Smoughtown for Elden Ring? I can only ever find short rundowns or plot summaries
                not to my knowledge unfortunately :(
usually the lore is only spoken about either in critiques of the game or those plot summaries; reddit seems to be the only place to care
            this man really wrote an essay about how undying is different to being immortal, props to this guy.
                i can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic but i’ll take the compliment 😊
    Nah, if kills are canon then we wouldnt fight genichiro everytime we wanna fight isshin
I actually have a headcanon that Sekiro canonically dies twice in the entire game. Once in Hirata and the second? I was thinking about how, if we knew when the other death was, we might be able to state the canon ending and vice versa. I'm sure other people have had this thought and maybe it was even figured out. Sadly I don't really keep up-to-date on this kinda stuff so...
    Drawing the mortal blade is a canon death.
        Forgot about that with how long it's been. Which is hilarious considering how often you return to that room to get the third ending option
I don't necessarily think so as the dragonrot seems to act like a disease which kills individuals, it doesn't necessarily take power from the world around it generally, it takes from individuals. There aren't any bosses who seem to be afflicted with it, so I don't agree
Healed naturally.

I think the immortality returns a user to their most recent healthy state.
Bro just said parrying the wind gust of the divine dragon is just gameplay mechanics but only being able to stagger armored warrior is absolutely canon… cherry-picking much?
    I'm going off of how the fights go. They're gimmick bosses with only one way to do them. Hence, that way is what's canon. If they intended for Sekiro to actually be strong enough to parry DD, they would have scoffed at the idea of armored warrior being a problem.
        Canonically sekiro could stagger and push him off once, we never actually see what happens if he just keeps hitting him.

Sekiro could literally block the snake as well.
            Continuously hitting him does zero damage. His HP doesn't go down at all; it's specifically programmed for him to do zero damage.

Parrying the snake also does nothing to it, and iirc, you still take some damage from it regardless.

People really need to chill with this Sekiro hype. Lore-wise, he's literally the weakest fromsoft protagonist. The verse has virtually zero feats. D'S protagonist can seal a reality-damaging demon, DS protagonists fuel a star that keeps time itself functioning, BB protagonist kills eldritch gods that create entire dimensions, ER protagonist kills a conceptual god that creates a dimension and controls the very laws of reality with the Elden Ring. 

Sorry, but no one in Sekiro even comes close. People need to chill with the wank.
                Yes that’s a gameplay mechanic… do you really believe sekiro wouldn’t eventually hurt him if he just kept chipping away?

Whether it does anything to the snake is irrelevant, the fact that sekiro could block that kind of force easily puts him at the top.

Lore and gameplay don’t match up at all, shit the the gods of bloodborne that can create universes or whatever and the most they can do is hit you…

If you go by pure gameplay mechanics (feats we can actually see) then sekiro is easily at the top.
                What conceptual god did the ER protagonist kill? Elden beast was basically a proxy, not the actual greater will.
                Im pretty sure it's stated that the divine dragon drove away the buddha and the great serpert god who we killed and parryed, expert for the buddha but you know why.
Parrying the dragon is not at all an oversight when they make one of the snake encounter be undeflectable no matter what. 

If they don’t want you deflecting something, they can make it happen. Sekiro can deflect the dragon.
    No, they don't bother to do disable it because there's no reason to. Parrying it does literally nothing; the k my wsh to defeat jt is lightning reversal.

Again, Sekiro was completely incapable of even denying metal armor. If he was canonically capable of matching the divine dragon's strength, then he would have zero issue with some generic armor.
        It increases its posture. By this same logic he shouldn’t be able to match demon of hatred or guardian ape

The metal armor doesn’t even matter in this fight because Malenia doesn’t have armor in any vital places.
            It doesn't do any *real* posture damage. The only way to break its posture is through lightning reversal. This has been tested.

He isn't strong enough to break basic metal. That's the point. He's not harming someone with a body far tougher than some random metal from medieval Europe.
                Malenia can be hurt by a literal rock
This is gonna be fun 😂 

>Falling hundreds of feet isn't even worth noting, not to mention that it's completely untrue. Fall damage exists, and you can die if you fall off a cliff.

THAT'S a gameplay mechanic buddy. If you land on hard ground you literally will not have a scratch, you only take damage when going out of bounds. 

>Sekiro does not canonically party the Divine Dragon; that's just an oversight/gameplay mechanic. You cannot beat it at all with parrying; you have to use lightning reversal. On the other hand, he was canonically fully incapable of doing any damage to some generic metal armor.

You are missing the point completely, what a surprise! I'm talking about his physical capabilities. He is capable of trading blows with a being the size of several buildings, that's a fact. 

>Malenia was a match for Radahn, who's literally so powerful that he can freeze entire constellations of stars in place with his gravity magic.

As a huge Radahn fanboy, this is just so false. We literally see the "star" Radahn was holding fall and it's just a single meteor. She also wasn't really a match for him considering that she only even survived because of the scarlet aeonia bloom and Finlay being a badass. She couldn't beat him based on skill though. 

Sekiro could literally just kill himself right after she uses Scarlet Rot and then resurrect afterwards and be fine. Lore wise his resurrections appear to be limitless if he has stuff to draw life from so he could do it as many times as he needs to. There is also in-universe medicine that heals the scarlet rot.

There's also absolutely zero evidence she can do that super bloom whenever she likes. That first one was so powerful because it was the first. If she did that every time she bloomed, Elphael would all be another Caelid and we could not have defeated her. 

>It would completely erase Sekiro.

You mean like it completely erased Malenia's and Radahn's armies? Dude gtfoh that's not even how the rot works, you're talking out your ass.
    > She couldn't beat him based on skill though.

She did fight him to a standstill purely with her skills. She blooms to end the stalemate.

>Battle of Aeonia. Radahn and Malenia locked in stalemate. Then, the scarlet rot blooms.
        OK yeah, that's fair. I was going off the image of her on her knees but I swear From has made it intentionally contradictory. I wonder how the Japanese put it actually that would settle all debates! Might have to look for a smoughtown vid real quick lol.
            She wasn't on her knees though. And from what I've seen, most JP fans don't care about the Radahn vs Malenia debates since the lore made it clear that the battle ended in a stalemate.
                Ah, that's not what I meant. I'm referring to how things can sometimes not translate very well from Japanese to English and Smoughtown has a friend who is fluent in Japanese and has discovered some really interesting details in the original version.
    No, you do take fall damage from great heights. It's not "out of bounds"; it's a fall from a cliff that kills you. Some solid copium right there. Also, once again, surviving falls is negligible fodder in terms of feats.

No he's not. If he were some generic armor wouldn't be an issue for him. End of story. Parrying the divine dragon canonically does not happen; it's not intended by the developers and doesn't press posture at all. Sekiro only does lightning reversals for the fight.

Radahn holds back everything in the sky. That was a Fallingstar, aka a meteor, which astrologer NPCs and item descriptions repeatedly distinguish from actual stars which form constellations and can be seen in space which meteors can't. Not to mention that the actual stars have a plethora of other characteristics incompatible with simple meteors.

Malenia is repeatedly stated to have fought him to a stalemate before she used scarlet rot to end the fight. We also see her move to fight him directly right before the fight in the trailer. Preserving Boluses are only there for gameplay, hence why the item descriptions has zero lore and why no one ever mentions them or tries to use them to cure rot. The rot is treated in canon as incurable.

Once again, Sekiro's immortality is very limited. He can't even do something as basic as regenerating limbs. Also, killing himself to get rid of status ailments is completely OOC.

She does the bloom all the time in her Goddess of Rot form. When has a soulsborne game ever had such a level of destruction in gameplay? That's literally impossible for them to do on a technical level. Of course they aren't going to have her destroy a massive portion of the map repeatedly in combat; don't be absurd.

Radahn is explictly only still there because his great rune combined with his willpower have just slowed down the rot. His army was never hit directly by the rot, only by very distant collateral damage. Her rot has completely afflicted her own great tune and has damaged Radahn's. Those are *fact*.
        Spitting absolute facts right here 🔥
        Spitting straight facts right there. Too bad your comment is gonna get buried lol.
    Finlay is star level confirmed

(I will admit scarlet rot may be Malenia’s only win condition, but Sekiro has two ways to deal with it. Resurrection to heal, and MAYBE divine grass, but that one is a reach. But then again, in lore rot is halted by fire and Sekiro loves fire)
        We all need at least one Finlay tier friend 😭 I like to imagine her stopping Radahn's blade an inch from Malenia's head, dropping a badass one-liner and dipping before Radahn can say snack lol. Such a cool character. 

>MAYBE divine grass

Good point actually. I didn't even think about that. 

>Sekiro loves fire

Fuck yeah, he does. Gotta wonder if the Lazulite flames would hurt Malenia and/or stop scarlet rot.
Guy with flamethrower built into his arm when scarlet Aeonia:
Yet without an immortal blade she still wouldn’t be able to kill him at worst all she could do is dismember him, I would give her more benefit of the doubt if she was somehow able to have knowledge about the immortal blade but she doesn’t, she would have to use wolf’s own immortal blade to kill him but she wouldn’t instinctively just do that or know to do that so yeah the worst she could really do is just immobilize him  unless she was able to figure out what his blade is/does
    Dismembering him would put him out of the fight (which is a W), and the advantage she has in raw strength is enough for her to at least vaporize him, which his immortality definitely wouldn't bring him back from if it can't even regenerate limbs after death.

His immortality just isn't a factor against beings that do more than just regular blunt damage or stabbing. It doesn't help if his opponent goes for dismemberment or is strong enough to completely destroy his body.
She fought Radahn to a standstill with her skills alone (the bloom happens after they were locked in a stalemate and she gets KO'd by her own OP attack). She is revered for her undefeated prowess and gained wings of "unparalleled strength". She hits harder than a [tank](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/v25297/i_did_some_math_on_malenias_waterfowl_dance/), is [pretty fast](https://imgur.com/nVOyIfO), and is the best swordsman in Lands Between so yeah, I don't see how Sekiro can beat Malenia (lorewise).
    [Sekiro deflects attacks that hit harder than a tank](https://reddit.com/r/Sekiro/s/0hgnNqkuGo)

And that’s the low ball estimate.
        And Malenia matched a [sword blow](https://imgur.com/2W3LeKy) from Radahn who is bigger than her by a LOT and is known for his mighty strength which also means Malenia can easily deflect Sekiro's attacks.
            Yeah. So can Isshin.
                Cool.
    I wouldn’t try to math it out precisely how strong she is, the intention most likely isn’t there, they’re most likely just going with “she’s fast” rather than “she’s so strong that she’s this fast” or whatnot. 
>her own underfeated prowess 

Same with isshin, he’s a sword saint after all and wolf beat him

>is pretty fast

So’s wolf
        Isshin is strong and Wolf is fast, yeah, but they don't come close to Malenia in terms of power. Malenia is one of the strongest characters in Elden Ring, she fought Radahn (mightiest demigod) to a standstill only with her skills and she herself is the avatar of Rot, a deadly curse that is incurable. I don't see how Isshin or Sekiro could beat Malenia. They can't even beat Mohg or Morgott.
            > but they don't come close to Malenia in terms of power.

I do agree that Malenia is most likely physically stronger, so you do have me there... my stance is that Wolf is faster and more skilled. Combined with his shinobi tools he should prevail, of course this is just my opinion.

> I don't see how Isshin or Sekiro could beat Malenia. They can't even beat Mohg or Morgott.

I mean both Isshin and Sekiro are more than likely more skilled than her, which can go a long way, if you've seen MHA then think of Stain vs Deku and Co. They should at ***least*** have relevant strength against her, enough to deflect. If not then they should be fine dodging.
                Why do you think they're more skilled than her? Malenia is a demigod, she has lived probably more than 5000 years and has canonically never known defeat (until she met Tarnished). She's definitely more skilled than both.
He can’t infinitely respawn, just until there’s nobody left to steal life force from… ^(so we just have kill everyone else first)
No, the lore literally says that he prefers to deflect
    “Prefers” doesn’t mean being able to deflect everything
        It does mean though that it’s a preferred tactic, also, you can deflect the enemies in gameplay, which has a lot of intention behind it
            Does the same apply to the bloodborne hunter? Dodging is the main method of avoiding damage, so similarly there is a lot of intention. He has dodging i-frames that let him take no damage from AOEs.

Do you actually think he is canonically undamaged when dodging in the middle of big fire attacks?
                >Dodging is the main method of avoiding damage, so similarly there is a lot of intention.

No, in Sekiro's case there's lore behind it, plus the fact that the deflections are a full fledged animation that interacts with the enemy. Look at the guardian ape fight for instance [there's a clear reaction between both animations](https://youtu.be/_EB2wZVNlH0?t=158). It's also just a move that makes sense, deflecting like that makes sense, but invincibility like that? Nah, I don’t think so.
Parrying her does not give health back though
    With a Shield yes but with a sword she will gain health
        Ok but health doesn’t really matter in sekiro, the way this battle would work is if the mechanics were: Malenia in sekiro or sekiro v Malenia in Elden ring
            So it depends on the game world we fighting in

Wolf tops in his world 

Malenia tops in her world
                Staggering is still a thing in Elden ring so no
                Yeah Malenia ported into sekiro hard clapped by wolf, wolf in Elden Ring probably end as a stalemate
        You literally can parry her with a sword
    It would take forever though
Godfrey, yes. Sekiro’s whole fighting style (paired with umbrella only) counters everything Godfrey has. It basically be super Saiyan chained ogre with no fire weakness. 

Maliketh, harder to say for one reason. In game, only the blasphemous claw can parry destined death, but there’s one spell that can redirect the ranged attacks. Also, the purple umbrella can deflect the mortal draw, which looks to be equivalent to destined death. So if you allow anything else to deflect destined death, Sekiro wins for sure, if not, it’s a gamble, but Sekiro still has a ton of counters. He can deflect non-destined death attacks and dodge many of the other attacks maliketh has, and finally, the Malcontent can stall Maliketh long enough for some good hits. There’s also the Mist raven that can be used to avoid destined death. 

Radahn, this one is very hard. If you consider Radahn using electromagnetic lightning, *MAYBE* Sekiro can redirect it, but without that, Sekiro can still deflect anything that isn’t that and could possibly deflect the shockwave pull, as he can deflect the Demon of Hatred’s shockwave. The Radahn meteor, you can argue he can’t deflect it, but mist raven. (Keep in mind this is Rotted Radahn, not Prime Radahn). It also should be noted you can jump the electromagnetic lightning in ER, so Sekiro should be good. Malcontent could even turn Leonard against Radahn.
    Sekiro can't dodge Chadfrey's grab attack though. :P

There's no way Sekiro can beat Maliketh in any scenario. You're forgetting that Maliketh is fast enough to dodge literally every attack from Sekiro and he is literally death itself. Maliketh slaughters Sekiro and it's not even close.

Radahn absolutely wipes him too. He doesn't even need to turn into a meteor to destroy him. Radahn is terribly huge, controls gravity, and uses two greatswords. He swings them and Sekiro is dead. Idk man youre really underestimating the power levels of the demigods. The only demigod Sekiro can beat is Godrick.
        Umbrella deflects grabs. 

Maliketh is just as fast as Demon of Hatred

Sekiro can deflect divine dragon. Radahn’s swords are no problem
            Bro 💀
^(It’s the same thing)
It’s not that hard to deflect it, i wouldn’t say it’s consistent but i’ve done it and a bunch of other people on youtube did too, the point i was trying to make is that it’s possible anyway, i wasn’t claiming that you could beat malenia hitless or anything like that
I was thinking of ones like Placidusax’s nuke or Malenia’s aeonia
    Sure, but my comment still stands. You can iframe some explosions in elden ring. Does that make it canon?
        Uh. Idk. You can roll some explosions but not others. So yes?
            See personally i would say no, because iframes make no sense in canon. 

Hence why i also think similar gameplay mechanics in sekiro are not canon

But if you believe this is canon, then i can see why you feel that sekiro can canonically deflect basically every attack
With a deflect, the attack is still pushed away, you just don’t throw off the enemy until posture is broken. 

I think charmless is the best way to show that, like blocking in Elden ring, you can still take chip damage, but when deflecting you take none.
    Well no the attack isn't pushed away. Well at least in most cases I've seen it's not. I won't argue about deflection anymore because it won't anywhere. 

Malenia still beats Sekiro
He's also got a selection of umbrellas to counter magic.
It also is the only feasible way Tomoe and Takeru could’ve died. So it must be able to sever immortality
In the shura ending when owl comes back he’s actually holding 2 items, the black mortal blade and genichiros head, indicating that he beat genichiro within an inch of his life and severed his immortality with the black mortal blade.
Fair
Killing immortals is explicitly what it does.  It’s* why there are things in the game you can’t kill without it.

It’s why Kuro says it can kill immortals.

It’s why Kuro bleeds when he’s stabbed with it.  Kuro doesn’t bleed under normal circumstances.
    It doesn't kill immortals technically, it severs the connection of undying to immortality, Kuro is a person and therefore a mortal but he is connected to the Divine Dragon, so functionally immortal. The Divine Dragon itself cannot be killed though. The game actually makes this distinction as the Hanbei for instance isn't "Hanbei the immortal", he's "Hanbei the undying", which is what the mortal blade item description says, it is "capable of killing the undying" and not "the immortal". (I think this is an even more deliberate choice when considering that the blade is called the \*mortal\* blade and the choice of word used isn't "immortal" , it's a completely different one. "undying"; especially when we consider that "undying" is an odd term in that it doesn't mean "cannot" die but something that "does not" die.) 

On the black mortal blade though, the black scroll only actually says it has the ability to "open a gate to the underworld", it never explicitly states that it can kill undying, like the crimson mortal blade can. Though it's curious that it can make Kuro bleed in the cutscene before Isshin, I think it's a jump to go from "it can make him bleed" to "it can kill immortals".
        “Kuro: Wolf, that sword on your back, is it...

Sekiro: It is the Mortal Blade.

Kuro: The sword that can kill those who cannot die...

Sekiro: Yes. It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.”

Alternately, 

“Kuro: The sword that can kill those who cannot die... I didn't expect you to find it so quickly.

Sekiro: Yes. It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.”

“IMMORTALITY SEVERED”

The Red Mortal Blade and the Black Mortal Blade both do the same thing, which is why Genichiro found it in the first place to bleed Kuro, and why Isshin uses it to fight you in both endings.  Because killing you would be pointless if you just came back, still as a Shura.
        They wouldn’t be called mortal blades if they couldn’t sever immortality. Black blade is called Open Gate and has an additional ability to open a gate to the underworld. Red blade is called Gracious Gift of Tears and has an additional ability to extract tears from the Sakura dragon.
            where does it say that every mortal blade severs immortality? what i got from it was that the mortal blades interact with mortality in different ways, in that the crimson mortal blade restores it in severing immortality and making someone mortal again and the black mortal black restores it in bringing people back to life. from what we know i think this is a stronger view
        Is there YouTubers who nerd out to the lore this deep similarly to guys like Smoughtown for Elden Ring? I can only ever find short rundowns or plot summaries
            not to my knowledge unfortunately :(
usually the lore is only spoken about either in critiques of the game or those plot summaries; reddit seems to be the only place to care
        this man really wrote an essay about how undying is different to being immortal, props to this guy.
            i can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic but i’ll take the compliment 😊
Nah, if kills are canon then we wouldnt fight genichiro everytime we wanna fight isshin
Drawing the mortal blade is a canon death.
    Forgot about that with how long it's been. Which is hilarious considering how often you return to that room to get the third ending option
I'm going off of how the fights go. They're gimmick bosses with only one way to do them. Hence, that way is what's canon. If they intended for Sekiro to actually be strong enough to parry DD, they would have scoffed at the idea of armored warrior being a problem.
    Canonically sekiro could stagger and push him off once, we never actually see what happens if he just keeps hitting him.

Sekiro could literally block the snake as well.
        Continuously hitting him does zero damage. His HP doesn't go down at all; it's specifically programmed for him to do zero damage.

Parrying the snake also does nothing to it, and iirc, you still take some damage from it regardless.

People really need to chill with this Sekiro hype. Lore-wise, he's literally the weakest fromsoft protagonist. The verse has virtually zero feats. D'S protagonist can seal a reality-damaging demon, DS protagonists fuel a star that keeps time itself functioning, BB protagonist kills eldritch gods that create entire dimensions, ER protagonist kills a conceptual god that creates a dimension and controls the very laws of reality with the Elden Ring. 

Sorry, but no one in Sekiro even comes close. People need to chill with the wank.
            Yes that’s a gameplay mechanic… do you really believe sekiro wouldn’t eventually hurt him if he just kept chipping away?

Whether it does anything to the snake is irrelevant, the fact that sekiro could block that kind of force easily puts him at the top.

Lore and gameplay don’t match up at all, shit the the gods of bloodborne that can create universes or whatever and the most they can do is hit you…

If you go by pure gameplay mechanics (feats we can actually see) then sekiro is easily at the top.
            What conceptual god did the ER protagonist kill? Elden beast was basically a proxy, not the actual greater will.
            Im pretty sure it's stated that the divine dragon drove away the buddha and the great serpert god who we killed and parryed, expert for the buddha but you know why.
No, they don't bother to do disable it because there's no reason to. Parrying it does literally nothing; the k my wsh to defeat jt is lightning reversal.

Again, Sekiro was completely incapable of even denying metal armor. If he was canonically capable of matching the divine dragon's strength, then he would have zero issue with some generic armor.
    It increases its posture. By this same logic he shouldn’t be able to match demon of hatred or guardian ape

The metal armor doesn’t even matter in this fight because Malenia doesn’t have armor in any vital places.
        It doesn't do any *real* posture damage. The only way to break its posture is through lightning reversal. This has been tested.

He isn't strong enough to break basic metal. That's the point. He's not harming someone with a body far tougher than some random metal from medieval Europe.
            Malenia can be hurt by a literal rock
> She couldn't beat him based on skill though.

She did fight him to a standstill purely with her skills. She blooms to end the stalemate.

>Battle of Aeonia. Radahn and Malenia locked in stalemate. Then, the scarlet rot blooms.
    OK yeah, that's fair. I was going off the image of her on her knees but I swear From has made it intentionally contradictory. I wonder how the Japanese put it actually that would settle all debates! Might have to look for a smoughtown vid real quick lol.
        She wasn't on her knees though. And from what I've seen, most JP fans don't care about the Radahn vs Malenia debates since the lore made it clear that the battle ended in a stalemate.
            Ah, that's not what I meant. I'm referring to how things can sometimes not translate very well from Japanese to English and Smoughtown has a friend who is fluent in Japanese and has discovered some really interesting details in the original version.

        i can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic but i’ll take the compliment 😊
Forgot about that with how long it's been. Which is hilarious considering how often you return to that room to get the third ending option
Canonically sekiro could stagger and push him off once, we never actually see what happens if he just keeps hitting him.

Sekiro could literally block the snake as well.
    Continuously hitting him does zero damage. His HP doesn't go down at all; it's specifically programmed for him to do zero damage.

Parrying the snake also does nothing to it, and iirc, you still take some damage from it regardless.

People really need to chill with this Sekiro hype. Lore-wise, he's literally the weakest fromsoft protagonist. The verse has virtually zero feats. D'S protagonist can seal a reality-damaging demon, DS protagonists fuel a star that keeps time itself functioning, BB protagonist kills eldritch gods that create entire dimensions, ER protagonist kills a conceptual god that creates a dimension and controls the very laws of reality with the Elden Ring. 

Sorry, but no one in Sekiro even comes close. People need to chill with the wank.
        Yes that’s a gameplay mechanic… do you really believe sekiro wouldn’t eventually hurt him if he just kept chipping away?

Whether it does anything to the snake is irrelevant, the fact that sekiro could block that kind of force easily puts him at the top.

Lore and gameplay don’t match up at all, shit the the gods of bloodborne that can create universes or whatever and the most they can do is hit you…

If you go by pure gameplay mechanics (feats we can actually see) then sekiro is easily at the top.
        What conceptual god did the ER protagonist kill? Elden beast was basically a proxy, not the actual greater will.
        Im pretty sure it's stated that the divine dragon drove away the buddha and the great serpert god who we killed and parryed, expert for the buddha but you know why.
It increases its posture. By this same logic he shouldn’t be able to match demon of hatred or guardian ape

The metal armor doesn’t even matter in this fight because Malenia doesn’t have armor in any vital places.
    It doesn't do any *real* posture damage. The only way to break its posture is through lightning reversal. This has been tested.

He isn't strong enough to break basic metal. That's the point. He's not harming someone with a body far tougher than some random metal from medieval Europe.
        Malenia can be hurt by a literal rock
OK yeah, that's fair. I was going off the image of her on her knees but I swear From has made it intentionally contradictory. I wonder how the Japanese put it actually that would settle all debates! Might have to look for a smoughtown vid real quick lol.
    She wasn't on her knees though. And from what I've seen, most JP fans don't care about the Radahn vs Malenia debates since the lore made it clear that the battle ended in a stalemate.
        Ah, that's not what I meant. I'm referring to how things can sometimes not translate very well from Japanese to English and Smoughtown has a friend who is fluent in Japanese and has discovered some really interesting details in the original version.
Spitting absolute facts right here 🔥
Spitting straight facts right there. Too bad your comment is gonna get buried lol.
We all need at least one Finlay tier friend 😭 I like to imagine her stopping Radahn's blade an inch from Malenia's head, dropping a badass one-liner and dipping before Radahn can say snack lol. Such a cool character. 

>MAYBE divine grass

Good point actually. I didn't even think about that. 

>Sekiro loves fire

Fuck yeah, he does. Gotta wonder if the Lazulite flames would hurt Malenia and/or stop scarlet rot.
And Malenia matched a [sword blow](https://imgur.com/2W3LeKy) from Radahn who is bigger than her by a LOT and is known for his mighty strength which also means Malenia can easily deflect Sekiro's attacks.
    Yeah. So can Isshin.
        Cool.
Isshin is strong and Wolf is fast, yeah, but they don't come close to Malenia in terms of power. Malenia is one of the strongest characters in Elden Ring, she fought Radahn (mightiest demigod) to a standstill only with her skills and she herself is the avatar of Rot, a deadly curse that is incurable. I don't see how Isshin or Sekiro could beat Malenia. They can't even beat Mohg or Morgott.
    > but they don't come close to Malenia in terms of power.

I do agree that Malenia is most likely physically stronger, so you do have me there... my stance is that Wolf is faster and more skilled. Combined with his shinobi tools he should prevail, of course this is just my opinion.

> I don't see how Isshin or Sekiro could beat Malenia. They can't even beat Mohg or Morgott.

I mean both Isshin and Sekiro are more than likely more skilled than her, which can go a long way, if you've seen MHA then think of Stain vs Deku and Co. They should at ***least*** have relevant strength against her, enough to deflect. If not then they should be fine dodging.
        Why do you think they're more skilled than her? Malenia is a demigod, she has lived probably more than 5000 years and has canonically never known defeat (until she met Tarnished). She's definitely more skilled than both.
It does mean though that it’s a preferred tactic, also, you can deflect the enemies in gameplay, which has a lot of intention behind it
    Does the same apply to the bloodborne hunter? Dodging is the main method of avoiding damage, so similarly there is a lot of intention. He has dodging i-frames that let him take no damage from AOEs.

Do you actually think he is canonically undamaged when dodging in the middle of big fire attacks?
        >Dodging is the main method of avoiding damage, so similarly there is a lot of intention.

No, in Sekiro's case there's lore behind it, plus the fact that the deflections are a full fledged animation that interacts with the enemy. Look at the guardian ape fight for instance [there's a clear reaction between both animations](https://youtu.be/_EB2wZVNlH0?t=158). It's also just a move that makes sense, deflecting like that makes sense, but invincibility like that? Nah, I don’t think so.
Ok but health doesn’t really matter in sekiro, the way this battle would work is if the mechanics were: Malenia in sekiro or sekiro v Malenia in Elden ring
    So it depends on the game world we fighting in

Wolf tops in his world 

Malenia tops in her world
        Staggering is still a thing in Elden ring so no
        Yeah Malenia ported into sekiro hard clapped by wolf, wolf in Elden Ring probably end as a stalemate
You literally can parry her with a sword
Umbrella deflects grabs. 

Maliketh is just as fast as Demon of Hatred

Sekiro can deflect divine dragon. Radahn’s swords are no problem
    Bro 💀
Uh. Idk. You can roll some explosions but not others. So yes?
    See personally i would say no, because iframes make no sense in canon. 

Hence why i also think similar gameplay mechanics in sekiro are not canon

But if you believe this is canon, then i can see why you feel that sekiro can canonically deflect basically every attack
“Kuro: Wolf, that sword on your back, is it...

Sekiro: It is the Mortal Blade.

Kuro: The sword that can kill those who cannot die...

Sekiro: Yes. It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.”

Alternately, 

“Kuro: The sword that can kill those who cannot die... I didn't expect you to find it so quickly.

Sekiro: Yes. It was given to me by the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters at Senpou Temple.”

“IMMORTALITY SEVERED”

The Red Mortal Blade and the Black Mortal Blade both do the same thing, which is why Genichiro found it in the first place to bleed Kuro, and why Isshin uses it to fight you in both endings.  Because killing you would be pointless if you just came back, still as a Shura.
They wouldn’t be called mortal blades if they couldn’t sever immortality. Black blade is called Open Gate and has an additional ability to open a gate to the underworld. Red blade is called Gracious Gift of Tears and has an additional ability to extract tears from the Sakura dragon.
    where does it say that every mortal blade severs immortality? what i got from it was that the mortal blades interact with mortality in different ways, in that the crimson mortal blade restores it in severing immortality and making someone mortal again and the black mortal black restores it in bringing people back to life. from what we know i think this is a stronger view
Is there YouTubers who nerd out to the lore this deep similarly to guys like Smoughtown for Elden Ring? I can only ever find short rundowns or plot summaries
    not to my knowledge unfortunately :(
usually the lore is only spoken about either in critiques of the game or those plot summaries; reddit seems to be the only place to care
this man really wrote an essay about how undying is different to being immortal, props to this guy.
