[[LilAggy and ONBAL are probably the best content providers for Sekiro.]]





LilAggy is the only speedrunner I enjoy watching. He is actually entertaining while still doing all the glitchy insanity that is speedrunning.
    LilAggy is ridiculous. "Sekiro but every enemy is DoH" is when I knew he was absolutely BONKERS. I love the lengths he'll go to provide entertainment, and hearing Gyobu in spanish always kills me.
        The Eveything is DoH run is required  content for Sekiro mod runs
        ME LLAMOOOOO

GYOUBU MASATAKA ONIWAAAA
        Is Spanish only on pc?
            I have the option on xbox
                Really ?, that‚Äôs so weird on PS4 it‚Äôs only French english and Japanese. They do have Spanish subtitles though
    Yep,plus i am always surprised when i randomly check the time counter. XD
        !hours is a completely factual
    My favorite video of him is buying Sekiro on a new account and beating all bosses in under 2 hours so he can refund it again on Steam. The entire stream was hilarious and fun to watch lmao.
        Catching that stream live was the best.
    Nemz38 is also very fun to watch.
        Was also going to recommend

    Fighting Cowboy got me through my very first Souls game. Great content.
    hes one of the influences I had to start pvp in Dark Souls II which became a 700 hour addiction
    He got me through my first sekiro playthrough. I always will thank him for that
    Git gudding*
correction, it's ONGBAL.
LilAggy needs more recognition
Sekiro Guru has left the chat
    Sekiro GORU helped me with the Shichimen warrior(mid air db). He is pretty awesome too.
        What we *will do* is apply Divine Confetti
            ‚ÄúNow what we will doooo‚Ä¶‚Äù so great.
    SEKIROGORUUUU FTW!
    The boss tournament arc was top teir content.
Ongbal is the God of Sekiro
ONGBAL really showed just how creative one could get with the shinobi prosthetic. Truly is the one-armed Wolf incarnate.
u/Atijohn is too
You forgot about me. üòé
Not to forget blindfolded players
    Lilaggy did this too, and I have no clue how he (and everybody else) did it, bc I can kind of understand doing the boss and mini boss fights using muscle memory and audio cues, but him traversing the world while blind folded blew my mind
        Aggy will be commentating mitchriz‚Äôs blindfolded Sekiro run for GDQ on January 15th, 2022.
Ongbalü§ù
You're using the template wrong :(
    True
aggy also beat the game without the swords
Bro he beat Isshin ***BLINDFOLDED***
    He also beat the whole game blindfolded.
Dope artwork
    Shame the actual boss fight itself is pathetic.
        The onion speech during it is 10/10 though
dash to a southeast angle from him.that‚Äôs how i got im
WATCH 

THE SEKIRO EXPERIENCE 

BY ZERO LENNY BEST VID IN YEARS MATE
I enjoy watching Iron Pineapple as well.
LilAggy finished Sekiro using drums as his controller.
Everyone: LilAggy does great Sekiro content 

Me: He‚Äôs like really cute lol
He beat it again on the dance pad wearing a sexy maid costume for Halloween (he lost a chat bet lol). The full VOD is on his YouTube aggy VOD channel he recently started.
