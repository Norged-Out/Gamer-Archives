[[I gave up playing Sekiro...]]





That game almost broke me. I remember being stuck on the first real boss skill check for 6 hours straight and losing. I sat there I work full time plus OT alot at the time so my free time was rare. I felt like i wasted a whole day, I thought maybe im getting to old and my reflexes are slowing down. I took a break ate some dinner just feeling somber throwing a day away. After dinner I was like screw it I already wasted my night and i gave it a couple more goes and got it on my third try and for what ever reason the game does click after that. I did get suck a few times but Sekiro is weird cause the hardest part is the beginning and it gets easier especially if you do every option boss cause you level up so by my third play through it was actually easier than my first play through.
    I still have fond memories on how utterly jarring and blissful it was to get the first health upgrade. Just one upgrade and the game suddenly felt ten times easier to manage.
    Its like learning a musical instrument
        Sekiro is literally a rhythm game. Literally, with no exaggeration. Listen to someone fight any of the humanoid bosses without looking, and you'll hear it clear as day.
            As a musician I've never found Sekiro to be inherently difficult, it solely functions on rhythm and pattern recognition
                How about you(or another musically capable human) play it, and I'll watch, and we'll both have fun.
                This is why Dancer of the Boreal Valley is the big wall for some DS3 players. Most DS3 bosses have a 4/4 tempo, and Dancer is a relatively slow-paced 3/4. Gael feels like playing polyrhythms with his cape. 

>!Pontiff is just bullshit, but he’s parryable and you have like a billion summons in the area!<
                    Ds3 was easy af up until pontiff
        Idk I used to study classical trombone at a high level and Sekiro does not feel like learning/mastering an instrument.
            It's a metaphor
            As a “high level” musician myself, I think it’s more than fair to say learning any skill has a lot in common with each other, and there’s plenty of similarities between sekiro and instruments. I also think you can apply wisdom gained from any skill to another, like with sekiro, you have to get up and try again when you die. Maybe you could pick the trombone up again.
                Thanks for actually responding in good faith instead of insulting me and speculating about my motivations for mentioning I used to play trombone. 

The only similarity I see is that mastering Sekiro takes repetition and a willingness to check your ego. Music is artistic, Sekiro is purely mechanical. There is some creativity involved in combat style, but not like in other FromSoft franchises such as Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and Armored Core. This is just my perspective. 

That was actually very sweet to encourage someone to pick up an instrument again, but I stopped because I no longer found pleasure in it. Like seriously that’s sweet. I’d rather spend more time consuming creative media or hanging out with my friends and family. I also didn’t fit into the community on vibes level, except within Norman Bolter’s studio. Nothing to do with failing, I was 20 years old gigging around Boston regularly and had professional connections in Atlanta, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. Plus, long-term job security has always been a problem for orchestral musicians in the United States, especially in the wake of COVID-19.
            Dude this comment is so obviously just to show off that you play an instrument lol cmon now
    I'm having that experience with probably an easier game, Final Fantasy 7 Remake. I'm playing on Normal mode, so nothing fancy, but I just can't get the flow down sometimes. Then I'll walk away, sleep, come back the next day and ace it on the first try. Just a series of ragequits. Like you I have a full time job and very little free time to speak of, so maybe I'm just not putting in the hours to get good enough at these new action based games. Maybe i need to go back to playing Dream Daddy or something.
        I actually just recently played this and hell house almost killed the game for me but thats kinda my fault. It’s the first time the game really tests your knowledge of the battle mechanics and it wasn’t till my 4th loss that I realized it was a magic based fight.
            I think I scraped by that fight and won despite my idiocy regarding the mechanics.
                Same, definitely not the case on hard mode however
        That's how it works for me. I don't get better mid-session anymore. Need to go away, sleep, and come back better the next day. Maybe it's age, I don't know. Seems like I learned faster when I was young.
        I feel you. I played Hollow Knight recently and what most people say is “an easy bossfight, 2 hours tops even for the greenest of noobs” was 1 - 2 weeks of gaming for me. But it didn’t matter. I just turned the game on, tried to beat it until I felt that today was not the day I’ll get through. And that was fine. Eventually I got better (at that one boss, I still suck), beat it and it felt great. 10 minutes later, another one comes my way and makes me busy for another week 😄🤷🏻‍♀️ Currently I’m wondering whether I should try Elden Ring. I know I’ll suck at it too, but it might be fun.
    Genichiro has the best game character placement of all time. Whoever designed sekiro and put him there is a genius.
        Genichiro is probably my all time favorite boss, hes extremely hard when you havent learnt the combat system yet but when it finally clicks hes one of the easiest bosses in game. I would argue that if you cant defeat his 1st phase with relative ease you havent fully learned the combat yet
    I got stuck on the last boss in blood and wine in the Witcher 3, took a break, went back fresh first try. Sometimes it’s good to just take a break for a min
        Detlof? Or however you spell it. Yeah, he was a pain in the ass on death March. That stupid bat attack was some cheese
            Yea, horrible to go against but the bat attack was easy once I figured it out, basically run tf away, and right as they plume upwards dodge sideways. Works 100%
    The game made me just put it down in frustration, I hit Genichiro and I just couldn't do it.
At all.

I think I came back after 6  months, restarted the whole game and this time around I beat him after a few runs.
The Genichiro fight really made the game click for me and I powered through all the boss fights at that point, people talked about Guardian Ape being difficult but it was a one and done, same with the duo.
    The first time i experienced something similar was Mafia 1 during the Race. I just couldn't beat it for many tries. The next day i came from school and beat it first try. Crazy how the body learns something during sleep.
    I found this with bloodborne - father gascoigne had me beat. I couldn't get past him, especially in his third phase (still barely can). Once I did eventually beat him the whole game became so much easier.
    This happened to me with returnal
    You have to let go in order to git gud
    Getting up and stepping away from a game is the best way to beat it. Let the progress sink in to your subconscious and the next time you play you'll ace.
    It's the skill gate, shits always the hardest until something clicks and now youre on your way to god hood. This is a good chunk of Capcom games
    This for sure. The early bosses were soon much harder. I just beat owl and it was under 10 attempts. I spent hours kb some of the early bosses
Bro hesitated...
    Clearly. OP needs to stop hesitating.
        Probably got outglocked
        We all know, hesitation is defeat
    Isshin be like “hesitation is death” then pull out a glock
        Parry this you filthy casual
            The neat part is that you can, and are actually expected to, parry his bullets. You get a tutorial popup literally at the first group of enemies in Ashina Outskirts
        I was gonna make a joke about Glocks not letting you hesitate because they don't have an outer trigger safety, from my understanding, but it doesn't make sense cuz Glocks were designed for the shooter to be the safety and only prevent misfire from a fall or whatever......flashy thing this whole comment Agent K!!
Sekiro had me tweakin bro i dont blame you. Fun game though
    I think someone gave a pretty good summary on why it messes with your head: “*You need to parry and block as much as you possibly can, even when it 100% looks like it should be impossible to do so.*”

For example, a giant flaming bull literally the size of a house… you can parry it. You take some damage, yes, but you can parry it. Even if you have the illusion that katana’s are indestructible, Virgil of Devil May Cry would call bull on being able to parry that (no pun intended).
        yes don’t treat it like a souls game. it’s a rhythm game. as long as u aren’t rhythmically deaf u should be able to figure out the parry rhythm of every basic attack. for the ‘perilous’ attacks that ask u to either jump, run, or sidestep/mikiri (red death warning) those are pure reaction and pattern recognition checks which might be hard walls to pass for some though
            Lmfao if you say so, but I've turned the sound completely off one time cuz of my girl sleeping and my headset was dead, and I actually read the enemies body language better. If you just watch their chest and stomach, you'll know exactly when to parry ngl
            I have been thinking about coming back to the game after previous attempts at it. I think my Souls mindset has me thinking that exact statement of how can I parry a bulls charge or other attacks that aren't parry-able in other souls' games. Thank you, I'll keep this in mind and give in another shot and parry everything, haha.
        The parrying is fine for me. It's the needing to jump that fucks me up. It seems so simple but so much of my muscle memory is built around parrying and dodging. I eventually brute forced my way through it but it was a time for sure.
    I found it easier than a lot of other souls games tbh but I guess everyone is different

I feel like sekiro is a rhythm game
        Most souls games have parry windows of 12-20 frames but sekiro is 30 frames and generally much more forgiving with parries. Funny enough dodging does work in Sekiro but it's much riskier and more punishing, like parries in Dark Souls.
            I’ve brought this up tons of times.

Not only is it 30 active frame, but:        
- it has almost no start up frames.        
- it has no recovery frames at the end to punish.              
- it can lead immediately into a block so long as you don’t spam.

The Sekiro die hards won’t have any of it.        
There was a whole wave of people saying “Sekiro made me good at parrying finally!”         
When I would bring up those stats I would just get downvoted to hell. You may get good at parrying Sekiro, but partying in all the other souls games will remain far more difficult
                Yea, those worlds in the dark souls series are honestly really depressing...it would, indeed, be far more difficult to party in a place like that.
                that's actually interesting. I wouldn't argue that getting the timing of one attack's parry is harder in sekiro after reading that. 

But to be effective at parrying in sekiro for many bosses its not 1 parry --> stagger like dark souls. It's more like parrying groups of 5 attacks and mixing in different forms of dodging or running away in between to fully negate damage. 

So I can see why people push back, just not for the right reason, i think its the speed and need for back to back parries. I agree that it's harder in souls, but curious on your thoughts since I have played much more sekiro than early dark souls games
                    Love to hear someone on the internet whi can voice a different opinion without getting overly heated. 

But yeah, so I’ve played nearly every game from fromsoftware (not DS2 and only like 3 of the armored cores).           
So coming from that experience I just figuratively substituted my roll button for the parry button and had no troubles at all. There are plenty of bosses in the souls series that have moves which require multiple well timed dodges allowing for a brief punish at the end. Go and read that sentence again, but change the word dodges for parries and see how well it fits for Sekiro.         
I think anyone with good rolling instincts from other souls games probably adapted very easily to Sekiro by just parrying instead of rolling.         
The only difference was that the parry was actually just way safer than a roll to be honest, mostly for the reasons I already mentioned.      

I agree that, in general, bosses are for sure faster in Sekiro and have more consecutive attacks… however just like dark souls you learn a kind of universal rhythm to dodging (parrying in Sekiro) that applies to all bosses.        
- consecutive dodges (immediate back to back with no pause).        
- roll catches (slight pause in the next dodge, as the attack was designed to catch you).

It’s the same feel in Sekiro, just a slightly faster rhythm. You either press it back to back, or add a slight pause if the attack was meant to catch you.

Anywayyyy, that felt like a tangent lol. Sorry adhd has me going off all over the place sometimes. Hope that kinda addressed what you were asking though.

(Edit: typos… I’m on mobile)
                        delayed on my response but I appreciate that explanation. I very much enjoyed sekiro, ER, and AC6 and planned on actually playing through DS next

I got ass blasted in sekiro and did alright in ER. That perspective helps quite a bit in understanding why sekiro I felt the way it did playing through that first lol
                            Happy cake day!

            That’s the thing, Sekiro you can parry basically everything. Dark souls you have to dodge and sometimes still get lucky, so once you figure out the pattern Sekiro is way easier imo

        Those guys are meant for endgame. It is stupid where they're placed, It makes you think you can/should be able to beat them when you encounter them...

But yeah, wait until endgame when the amount of resources and money you have are no issue. You can even grind money indefinitely to buy infinite divine confetti if you want.

Those guys drop really good items for ng+, but are also entirely skippable... (I can't even remember if they drop prayer beads) definitely one of the weak points of the game, enemies that need consumables.
            None of them drop prayer beads.  The headless drop charms that work as infinite sugars, which you really don't need since you can just buy normal sugars.  There's one that there's no corresponding sugar for and increases your damage by alot, but it also takes away half your maximum health while using it.
                There is a corresponding sugar for the Yashariku buff.
        If you're talking about headless literally just skip him. Completely optional. Everything else is doable no items
        You know they're all optional right?
        The only bosses that you need divine confetti for are the Headless and Warrior Shichimen.  All of them are optional, and you can hold off on doing them until after you've unlocked being able to purchase unlimited divine confetti from merchants.  Just progress the story until you've killed the Corrupted Monk that guards Fountainhead Palace late in the game.
        Using a consumable is not cheese. The only one I would consider cheese in all of the games I've played was the God Arrow (or whatever) from Dragons Dogma that was basically a 1-hit kill on anything. Bad take.
            They said using a consumable OR cheese. Not that consumables are cheesing.
                I consume cheese
                Sometimes they are, too!

Like cheesing the capra demon with firebombs over the wall lmao.
        headless are ass I don't blame you they suck better to just leave them for endgame
        Which boss, Headless or Guardian ape? At one point in the game you can unlock the Divine conffeti and buy it from one merchant (i can't remember his location) :D 
I hated the Headless bosses, but near the end of the game you encounter two of them under the water, i was like wtfff, can you make this any more painful than it is🤣 but i beat them all, you can do it too!

    I quit around the 10 hour mark. Everyone says it eventually clicks, and it kind of did, like I wasn’t complete ass at it or anything, but goddamn it was still a difficult and punishing game to get through.

I beat all the other Souls games, but I just wasn’t really having fun with this one’s style of challenge/combat. I had Elden Ring in my backlog and was excited to get to it
    u/Gorgii98 ask and you shall recieve.
don't take the game as a souls game but more like a rhythm game
    As I once said to a friend, it’s not Dark Souls, but an entirely different beast. Bloodborne and Elden Ring may be different, but they still got the fingerprints all over them.

Sekiro has the issue in that it doesn’t play at all like you think you should play. Even if you aren’t familiar with the souls series, you would think that, as a ninja, stealth and agility would be your best friends. Turns out, while stealth is insanely useful, you still have to be incredibly careful because your character likes standing up when he really shouldn’t (and the game often forces you into open combat by level design or an enemy with the eyes of a hawk randomly spots you), and blocking and parrying are the best ways to fight enemies when every part of you is saying “there is no way you could party that.”
        >blocking and parrying are the best ways to fight enemies when every part of you is saying “there is no way you could party that,”

It is this, one hundred percent.

People seem to focus on dodging too much, but the reality is the game wants you to clash swords.
The Bull is the first real test of faith because your instincts are -screaming- to dodge but if you block and parry it, the fight suddenly makes a lot more sense.
            Damn and here I was just sprinting around the arena and chipping away at his health by getting behind or to the side of it until it died.
        This is probably why I hated it so much. 

I'm that guy who never used a shield in dark souls serie. 
I just roll and roll, very well. 

So my brain couldn't understand that this was a different game, and I kept my habits.
            And again, even if you’re unfamiliar with the souls series, every natural instinct screams at you to dodge instead of block.

Gyoubu can be handled without taking damage pretty easily, but nobody would ever think you could block a weapon/guy 2-3 times your size, *especially* one charging you down on horseback. Yet he’s one of the more plausible enemies you can block.
    As a Guitar Hero player I sigh seeing people scared to play on expert
        Pinky finger
        I would be a guitar hero player still if the game and controller weren’t impossible to find for a reasonable price.
            I have two modded ones with mechanical frets lol found both of them at a thrift store took out the original parts and put  arduino kit in there.
    Sekiro instantly becomes the easiest fromsoft game the second you stop playing it like its dark souls
        Yeah it's literally not hard. You just have to actually learn how to play it
        Truly. It's still the only Fromsoft game that I've gotten 100% completion on. Also, each NG+ gets easier and easier, which ime is contrary to the SoulsBorne games.
    I love souls games, but hate rhythm games, probably why I already gave it up. So pretty and amazing, but not my thing.
    Yes exactly!!
"In the world of difficult games, there exists a hypothetical line, which I like to call the Tropic of Fuckabout. It is defined as the point where high difficulty stops being a stimulating challenge and becomes merely fucking me about." - Zero Punctuation 2017 when reviewing The Surge
    Love ZP
        Rest in peace ZP, long live FR.
            *skrrrrrrrt*

What happened to ZP?!
                The company that owned ZP basically wanted to fire everyone that wasnt him. He said fuck you, left with them and now the whole crew runs a channel named "second wind"

Tldr Zero Punctuation is now Fully Ramblomatic
                    Ah, thats good to know. Is this new "Fully Ramblomatic" show the same sort of of format and style as ZP or is it something new entirely?
                        Its nearly identical, but black and red colored and a new theme song.
                    Yahtzee is a real one for that.
                Don't panic. He's not dead, he just doesn't work there anymore.
    I finished The Surge. 

I will never finish Sekiro.
        Fair enough but disregarding what title this quote was referring to, would you at least agree with it? Does a game just stop being challenging and just fucks you about instead
            Yes, of course. And why I will never finish Sekiro. Not fun.
                *Not fun for you
                    Um....duh?
And here I'm doing another playthrough and wondering if the game was always this easy.  The game is like almost all muscle memory.
    Sekiro has the hardest first playthrough of any From game and the easiest second playthrough.
        Best way to put it
        The major hurdle is figuring out that parrying is your best friend, even if you instinctively feel like you shouldn’t be able to do so with most things.

Other things include that you pretty much *need* to read item descriptions to beat some bosses, dragonrot, due to a slight mistranslation/misinformation, isn’t anywhere near as bad as you think it is (though I still will say having a punishment for dying in a game designed to kill you is honestly pushing it); and dodging isn’t anywhere near as good as you think it would be, but jumping can and will save you more than you would think.
            Can… can you parry the butterfly lady?…. I can not get past her
        Yeah after i beat ishhin i fight him as a past-time once in a while lol
        Second playthrough I didn’t even die until Guardian Ape
    This. Rhythm and muscle memory
    Yeah, Sekiro flows like water once you get it down. I can’t lie though, I was extremely frustrated with it at first because my friend had his TV off *game mode when I tried

*edit: a word
    If you're coming from Dark Souls, Sekiro is REALLY hard. Most Souls players have dodging second nature to them, but sekiro throws that out the window and punished you for dodging. It was my first one so parrying was the first thing I learned. Honestly Elden Ring was harder for me.
    Yeah, I've reached a point where I can do no death runs and I think in a year or two I might start trying no damage runs.  It really is just the best rhythm game of all time!  At this point I find it 1000 times easier than the other soul games.
    Beating Sekiro the first time is one of the toughest games of all time. Beating Sekiro in every subsequent playthrough is a casual afternoon.
    Took me 8 hours straight to beat genichiro first time. 2nd playthrough I didn’t die a single time. Really wild.
    I can go long stretches without playing, pick it up, and absolutely fucking dominate on bosses that I KNOW nearly broke me on my first playthrough. It really is the muscle memory.
Don't you love how you SUSPICIOUSLY miss every shot that counts in xcom? Or when you "accidentally" happen to walk and trigger 3 pods at the same time on that mission with only 5 turns left to evac? I love the difficulty but its hard to not accuse the system of blatant cheating.
    Its funnier if you know xcom actually cheats rolls in your favor, except in the hardest difficulty. So this is just straight up bad luck in both cases.
        Oh i know it does lol, I just don't like to think about it after I get squad wiped😅😅
    This is a different thing, as it is a bug with the wrong calculation or wrong display of hit chances and the second one is just bad game design, that the enemies are triggered in 3er packs instead of walking around the map. This discourages you from exploring the map, as you have the danger of triggering more enemies than you already have to fight.

And don't get me started on the turn limits in XCOM 2 and all that stuff, oh my god.

But well, i'm glad there are much better remakes around, like Xenonauts 1 & 2. I'd say Xenonauts 1 with the Community Edition is the best you can get, as the second one is still in Early Access and not finished yet.
Recently finally clicked and beat, probably the most rewarding game of any game I've ever played and it's all I want to play anymore
Well take a seat boy and let me tell you about Ninja Gaiden 2. A game from before time. There were these enemies who threw incendiary shurikens. They were dodgeable but unblockable. Kind of like your mom. So if you caught one it had a fuse of maybe a second and you got thrown up in the air. Very frustrating, of course. What enhanced the shittiness was that the gameplay was fast paced and focused on combos with your weapon. You needed to have a good flow, which was completely shat upon by these incendiary shurikens. But what really took the assholiness to the next level was that when one of these exploded and threw you up in the air only to splat down on the ground, there was a little cool down before you could move. And in this stupid cool down period you could get hit by another one, which gave you just a second to get away and then it exploded.

And then another one hit you

And you roll

Boom

And then another one hit you....
    Yeah, Sekiro is a walk in the park compared to that bullshit
    That brought back horrible memories of playing Ninja Gaiden 1, Fuck that game man.
        I beat Ninja Gaiden (NES). I could not beat Sekiro.
    Every Ninja Gaiden is like pure sweat from start to finish. Normal difficulty in NG1 will push your shit ALOT, and if you go Hard or higher you will be shitting bricks by the end of it. 

I played these games after dark souls and such, and holy shit, people think they play hard games just because they FromSoft games lol.

Ahh these FromSoft babies will never know
        Seriously. NES Ninja Gaidens were tough as hell, but doable. The mid-2000 NGs were pure bullshit. 

Still stuck on Sword Saint 🤦🏻‍♂️
    Oh god i forgot about those shurikins, plus even the thought of them was distracting when fighting those ninjas because you knew one could stick one in you at any time just like your mom
    You can block them when they are thrown directly at you, it’s just when they hit the ground or wall next to you and explode that they will guard crush you, then it’s a matter of stringing iframe moves together to avoid them. NGII on master ninja is the best action game ever made imo, at least when fighting human enemies (like IS ninjas!) or enemies that can be delimbed. The game is noticeably unfinished unfortunately so there are some rough patches with certain enemies and bosses, but when it’s at its best it’s unmatched by anything. I encourage everyone to play it, there’s literally nothing like it. I always get excited when people post about it outside the NG sub since it’s so niche lol 

I have IS ninjas in my post history in case anyone wants to see what the parent comment is talking about. They can be real bastards, but they’re also extremely fun. 

Sekiro is easy as pie in comparison to any ninja gaiden game for that matter. I do love sekiro tho, not saying that as if it’s a bad thing to be clear. 

(IS = incendiary shuriken)
    Are you guys talking about NES NG?? Yea those two games can rot in Hell
You have to have a great sense of timing I guess, and I know I don't have that. Won't even try it. If I wanted to feel like an uncoordinated failure, I'd play basketball with the kids down the street.
    Thank you! 🤣 this is the best, I genuinely lol’d. I gotta remember that line.
    It's not a soulsborne, but, like other people are saying, it's a rhythm game. If you got really good at Guitar Hero, you'll probably be good at Sekiro.
As frustrating as it was to learn, Sekiro was pretty therapeutic once I got the hang of it. It's how I relieved stress during finals week once.
Sekiro has the most fair difficulty of any fromsoft game. Dark Souls and ER and Bloodborne all have bullshit bosses. Sekiro doesn't have any of that garbage design. Every encounter is well telegraphed and has good visual/audio cues
    Except the bull. I hate that bull.
        The bull fight was bull shit (pun intended).
        I hated the bull too until I realized I could just parry his charge for the win every time
            As soon as I learned you could parry that, the bull was a cakewalk lol
        I have to fight him unlike any other battle lol. Im just sprinting in circles hoping to catch a spinning cut on his hiney before I take off again lol 
 Yea fuck that bull
    You’re joking right? I spent at least 15 weeks on the Mist Noble. The most broken boss Fromsoft has created hands-down. I mean you’re supposed to jump ON TOP of him and stab him from the rafters. Ridiculous design - 0/10.
        You're right. Mist Noble is way too difficult, even for Sekiro. He's the hardest boss in the game and it's not even close
        Miyazaki put him in just to fuck you in the ass
        Isshin kind of balances it out though, he's way too easy, he needed at least 2 more phases, and don't get me started on Demon of Hatred.
    It just caters to a different type of player. I have no rhythm so I find Sekiro insanely hard while I’ve beaten the rest of the dark souls/elden ring. It’s why I struggled through lies of P is partying is very difficult when you don’t have rhythm
        The real thing with Sekiro that I think a lot of people struggle with is that you can't just pad your stats like you can in the other games, it demands you meet it at the level you're at. A lot of people beat souls games by just grinding out stats and then steamrolling a boss while being overleveled- which, I'm not hating, it's a totally valid and fun playstyle, it's just not something you can really do in Sekiro. You can increase your HP by finding minibosses and stuff, but most players will be around the same level for most of the bosses.
        Unlike souls/elden ring you also just cant level up or gimmick build past the difficulty. It really showed that when my friends got stuck on either Genichiro or Owl
    Well it's the only fromsoft game I struggled with 😅 rest were easy
    Agree 100%. I tell my friends that Sekiro is the closest thing to a “perfect” game. I don’t mean fun for everyone, but that it sets rules, and follows them. Every death felt like it was my fault and motivated me to push through the hardest fights
    The last part of your comment is what I had to say to those who found Metroid Dread too difficult. Obviously, there isn't the same expectation of difficulty with this series, but I think many players aren't used to adapting the way they play to what the game expects and keep hitting the same wall until they give up in frustration.

It's often by playing hard and above that you come to understand the subtleties of the combat system, because you need every advantage you can to progress.

With that said, I wouldn't blame anyone for giving up in the case of Sekiro, especially if they have limitations.
    Yeah but in Dark Souls you can walk in overleveled and carve a boss up in like 10 hits. You also dodge a lot more and can avoid attacks due to invincibility while rolling.

Dark Souls becomes a cake walk if you make a pyromancer and throw flaming balls of death at enemies. There's like one boss in Dark Souls 3 that resists fire (Demon Prince) and that's a DLC boss. You can burn your way through the game with barely any risk to your character thanks largely to ranged attacks.

In Sekiro you need to get in and be aggressive. It's not easy coming from one game where you take your time, position yourself, calculate your attacks and then play one where speed and reaction are more important. You are also not invincible while dodging so you have one play style you have to get good at. It's also a strange mix of action and stealth so you spend much of your time sneaking about, learning how to quietly backstab your way through the game, only to go all out sword fighting when you get to the boss.

It's similar to Middlearth: Shadow of Mordor/War. But in those games you feel like a badass walking into a group of Uruk. In Sekiro, you feel overwhelmed if there are two or more enemies.
        One: the Sekiro dodge does have iframes. Not as many as DS, but saying it doesn't is factually incorrect. Maybe look up something before you say it

Two: Sekiro being a more aggressive game is exactly why it's got better combat and flow to the fights. In Sekiro, you the player gets to dictate the pace of the fight and can push the boss into a corner and into being defensive. This is impossible against DS and ER bosses. Those bosses will jump over you or do some stupid aoe move that literally forces you away. The bosses also are the ones setting the flow of the fight. You must be reactive in DS and ER. You must be proactive in Sekiro. It may not sound like much of a difference, but it actually is the very reason people say Sekiro has the perfect combat. And having stealth mechanics makes it so you can deal with the trash mobs and then go for the big guy. It brings a strategy to the game more than any DS or ER area can. Every trash mob can be one shot by stealth, and you can also use stealth to take away one hp bar of most mini bosses. Sometimes you might be able to stealth in DS or ER, but it always ends up being a narrow doorway technique situation. Lots of retreating and chipping away.

Three: overlevelling and using OP skills doesn't have anything to do with the design of bosses and encounters. It just means you can ignore any mechanics of the game. Sekiro doesn't let you do that because it wants you to play a certain way. If you don't like that play style, it's not the game for you.

Four: you are supposed to be the overpowered badass in the middle earth games. It makes sense that you can jump into a group of urukai and destroy all of them in a minute or less. Sekiro is not an overpowered character. He is badass, but the bosses he fights are much more powerful than him. He is the underdog and being caught unaware by several enemies is obviously going to go poorly for you. This is why stealth is so important
    The twin monkey bossfight certainly is the complete opposite of fair. But yeah most bosses are insanely well designed
        A mortal blade or two and the girlyfriend goes down.. not near the difficulty solo monk was imo.
            Corrupted monk? She was easy as balls. She has a determined rythm that you follow.
                No not corrupted monk you candlestick. Read context... Monk short for monkey. Use contextual clues next time
                    Oh yeah, sorry. I'm stupid.
        Wait till they're close together, stun them with fireworks, and then focus on the girlfriend who can be killed pretty quickly.  She really doesn't have much health.
        The twin monkey fight actually is a very unique gank boss for FS games.

Basically the AI of the brown Ape is 100% dependent on what the white Ape and you do.

In theory this makes it so that the two apes never overlap their attack patterns if you play it right. 

In practice you kinda have to know how the AI works to really achieve this. 

On a normal playthrough the fight is also very easy because they have very low stats.
    Fire demon is garbage.

Whole game you go parrying attacks but you have to fight it traditionally which just doesnt work
        You're supposed to use the umbrella with fire upgrade. 

Without umbrella, the headless are also ridiculously hard.
    i thought Demon of Hatred was more bs than even Malenia
        I thought so too. Until I found a way to beat him. You just have to play differently than before. I do still think it's unfair though. Much like Malenia, he uses mechanics from other games that aren't really prevalent in this one.
        Once you learn how to fight DoH, he's much more fair than Malenia's waterfowl garbage. DoH doesn't require absolute frame perfect dodging, just know what is coming and you can run or deflect
            Im sorry but Malenia does not require frame perfect dodging or anything close to it XD   
You can run to dodge the firs two and the third is a simple dodge into to avoid it fully.
    Elden Ring does easily have the worst enemy, level, and game design of the series hands down
    FromSoftware games don't have difficulty, they intentionally hamper players with absolutely horrendously designed control schemes and mechanics to make the game seem "difficult". They're not hard, just poorly designed.
        Sounds like you need to git gud
            Nah, I beat Dark Souls 1 and 2 with ease. In retrospect they just weren't fun. Sounds like you just need to grow up. 😉
                Git gud again
        You must be thinking of the dog shit controls in the Resident Evil series.  Control and mechanics in From Soft games are fine.  lol “poorly designed” - here’s your chum you silly troll.
            I don't think you understand what a troll is. You really think I'm just saying this stuff to say it? It was my genuine experience with those games. They were not fun to play and were not difficult.
                That’s fine if you truly didn’t enjoy the games, nothing wrong with that.  Saying they are poorly designed is clearly speaking out of your ass though.  The souls borne games have wracked up a ton of accolades for either game of the year, or ….. drum roll… GAME DESIGN.
        I can't say anything about other non-Sekiro FromSoftware games, but there wasn't anything wrong with Sekiro's controls and mechanics.
        Classic case of not getting gud
            Even though I beat them with ease? They're just not fun.
        Actual skill issue.
        They are smooth games on controllers, you are just bad.
            No, I beat them no problem, they just aren't good.
                Lying on the internet is fun
Sekiro isn't an action game. It's a rhythm game. 


Don't hesitate. Or you will be defeated
Sekiro is just a rhythm action game. Once you catch the rhythm it gets much easier.
Finished every from software game DLCs included and i gave up on sekiro...
The only From Soft game I've played and didn't beat. The combat is absolutely not my style and never clicked.
Love my Souls games, couldn't get into Sekiro.  It just didn't mesh with me.  Loved DeS, DkS 1/2/3, BB, ER, but yeah, just could not get into the groove in Sekiro.
Once it clicks, it is one of the greatest games of all time. It's still frustrating, though.
I just gave up on thymesia. It’s not that it’s harder it’s just arbitrarily hard. The elite enemies are damage sponges to the point of tedium.
Same here
Don't stop dude. It's a fantastic game that a genuinely fair and skill based game (outside the the double monkey fight and maybe the Demon of Hatred).

Where did you stop playing? I've platinumed the game and play it like once a year. Maybe I can give some tips.
    Have you done the mortal journey gauntlet? ;)
    >double monkey fight and maybe the Demon of Hatred

Fire crackers for the Guardian Apes and Suzakus Lotus Umbrella for DoH

Demon of Hatred fight is an all time favourite of mine, next to Owl (Father) and Isshin I think Sekiro has some of the best and most memorable bosses ever
    It's been multiple months, but I personally got stuck on some dude on a horse iirc.
        Yeah thats like one of the first major bosses. Gyoubu Oniwa Masataka (I believe is his name).


Most bosses have some tool that you can use to great effect. The firecracker tool will scare the horse and allow you hit him a bunch of time.


Have you played other From Soft games like Dark Souls or Bloodborne or even Elden Ring?

I ask because you can't really play Sekiro like those games. Sekiro is like a dance or a game of tug of war. You have to alternate on attacking to build up their posture (which will lead you to a death blow) and deflecting their attacks which will also build their posture.
            How could you forget "MY NAME IS GYOBU MASATAKA ONIWA!". A voice so loud it can blow out speakers
            I played Dark Souls for a bit. I got stuck at the Bell Gargoyles for like 8 hours and uninstalled tbh
Sekiro is not unfair at all, quite the opposite really. Compared to the other from software games it is probably the most fair, it’s just very mechanically demanding.
    Came here to say this
Sekiro' difficulty has the highest floor but lowest ceiling of any Fromsoft game.
That's me with Resident Evil 3 original. That Grave Digger fight inside of the tunnel was just awful
Twice I tried and quit. I could not get the counter-attack timing down. Must be too old.
    You press deflect as soon as the attack looks like it hits you, there's no timing per se
Try really practicing old bosses and identifying possible weaknesses for new bosses. The bosses here all have very identifiable rythms and move sets. Some runs I would just focus on dodging a certain move or blocking a particular string. You’ll get there!
Ohhh man dude you can’t give up on it! We were there ourselves but there comes a certain point after trying to beat the boss for the 50th time that it ‘clicks’ with you and you ‘get’ the control scheme. 

Now we’re not saying you don’t get how to play now but seriously something is going to click and you’ll be really really fluent in it after that point. Keep going!!
Sekiro is the most fair game I've ever played (when it comes to difficulty)
Try wo long 95% of people cant even get past the tutorial boss
I beat it and I’ll never play it again. One of the most frustrating gaming experiences I’ve ever had.
Sekiro made me realize that I fucking detest games with parrying mechanics.
Cuphead
I gave up Sekiro too lol
Soulslikes are crack for massochists. Don't worry about it. They're abnormal.
I stopped at the horse guy and never returned
Xcom 2 I don’t care what you people say.
It was hard, but I didn't feel like it was too hard.  I did eventually get a little bored with it.  It was so hard to care about the story.
I detest any fight designed to be won as a war of attrition. Aka “you’ve got to pick your spots and only attack once or twice before going defensive.” It’s not fun, and a LOT of games force this style of gameplay on you. I’m playing Jedi Survivor right now, and that’s pretty much how you have to fight any large enemy. Not only do they hit hard, they move faster than the smaller “agile” enemies.
Got the first proper boss in sekiro (the mounted asshole) and he didn't get staggered when I filled his meter. Determined the game was going to break the rules when convenient and gave up
Hate the fucking game. Made me hate games. Elden Ring brought me back though.
I played to the final boss but then decided I couldn't be bothered wasting 4 or more hours of my life trying to beat a 4 stage boss with no checkpoints
Sekiro IS unfair. Other fromsoft games let you choose to play and build the way you want to overcome the difficulty but not Sekiro. Here, 1 playstyle, no build and if it's outside of your skills you're screwd. Don't be ashamed to drop it, it can be not your fault. I even encourage cheating since the lore, story, soundtrack, environnent/atmosphere, VAs, is so good.
Final boss, Ishin the Sword Saint took me weeks. Even watching YouTube tips videos that fight was out of control.

Part of why I never finished Elden ring even getting 75% through is because I’m getting so burnt out on the insane skill checks of souls games. Too old for this ****
Hollow knight. Idgaf what anyone says
There's a secret third area between them called Not Fucking Worth It

Demon of Hatred is just not fun for me
Good for you.  Soulslikes are bad examples of how to make difficult games.
I fucking hate sekiro.
Theres a reason i stopped elden ring and havnt bothered with the dark souls games
Sekiro: Shadows Die a lot of fucking Times
I quit the game halfway and sold it. If I want to play a game of chance I’ll go to a casino.
I’ve completed every fromsoftware game except sekiro. It’s the hardest one by miles. 
Or at the very least the most frustrating.
Like all FromSoft games, Sekiro is just a "fail, repeat, learn"
Yup I also gave up on Sekrio. I've platinumed every other from game but I just can't with that one. I'm not a parry player.
I gave up at the last boss fight. Got excited that the story is going to be more in depth for a fromsoftware game but it wasn’t worth it to be honest.
I uninstalled, claiming a refund and never looked back. I play games to escape the harshness of reality. Game is not doing that for you, move on. No shame here.
    I hear that though. 


People have different priorities in the enjoyment of a video game.


Some seem to get off most on overcoming the greatest adversity. 


I don't generally like to stick on doing the same thing over and over and over until I am grandmaster of a specific mechanic.


I consider I most enjoy gaming for similar reasons to why a book lover may love reading an epic fantasy novel. To immerse myself in and get lost in new worlds. To explore and enjoy a journey. Add some fun gameplay and progression and I'm sold.


I dont love FromSoft games because of the difficulty. I love them because each one I've played shits all over most of the gaming industry in terms of quality gaming experiences to the bone. 


I don't have to be good at a game to recognise how good it is.
        I get that! And I’m glad you’re clear on what makes a game a game for you. Fromsoftware stuff is always on point!
Git Gud
    Truer words have never been spoken
The last of us grounded.
    Last of us 2 on grounded is even worse, and I swear it breaks the enemy ai, and not in your favor. Numerous times I'd be spotted through walls while staying still, or hiding in tall grass I'd get spotted by an enemy across the map, which completely defeated the purpose of it being there. Enemies also become aimbots and have insane accuracy with any weapon at any range.
I love all the dark souls like games, I personally found Sekiro the hardest by far.
You'd love **Ninja Gaiden** then.
Man has no rhythm
Sekiro is the best combat experience ever made imo
I hate rhythm games so as soon as the bosses started requiring me to play it is as such in order to not get almost instantly destroyed, I said fuck that shit.

Got to isshin, gave up and never intend on going back. FUCK that rhythm bullshit
    You got to the literal end of the game, and THEN the rhythmic feel became overwhelming?
        Well I was managing by almost brute forcing through the rhythmic aspects, spamming deflect and praying to come out ontop. I did not know how to nor did I really care to actually learn how to play to the rhythm. Hence why I struggled with enemies like ministry shinobi for the whole goddamn game. And not many of the endgame bosses have a pace close to isshin. I can deal with the pace of Corrupt monk. Genochiro is a skill check and was easy at that point (and was also not as fast as Isshin). 

Ashina elites and giraffes I got through by spamming deflect or magnet umbrella. 

I also was never able to figure out how to properly deflect lightning.

All those factors meant i could brute force and cheese through most things, but isshin was a goddamn wall. I nearly completely ragequit and dropped the game at Owl as it was.
            Sorry you didn’t enjoy it, I thought it was a phenomenal game.
    Brother man isshin is the final boss you were right there 😅
        Owl and Isshin were each harder than almost all the other bosses combined on their own for me. And I was getting burnt out and annoyed with all the other annoying and hard bullshit that when I got to Isshin I just kind of felt like "yeah... nah"

I made it through most of the game never fully figuring out how to deflect lightning, and never actually playing to rhythm. Just spamming deflect. I don't feel like going through the tedium of learning it now
Once you get how to play sekiro it stops being hard
Feel this way about all From Soft games tbh.

I been a gamer for like 30 years, Il play anything. I love games that challenge me usually. But From Soft games I just feel like too much trial and error and get bored so fast .... shame cos I like the art styles of them but had to accept after like 35 hours of DS 1 and 30 hours of DS 3 that Souslikes are not for me
Here's how I play through these games. I play them offline so I don't run into any invader trash people. I beat the final boss and the much harder optional boss. Then I uninstall the game, and it collects dust on the shelf. When people ask me if I've beaten elden ring or bloodborne or something, I can say yes. And I'm happy with that.
it's easy once you learn that it's a rhythm game probably the 2nd easiest soulslike I've played other than elden ring
It’s so funny because I think Sekiro is the easiest FromSoft game. Like it’s pretty much just a rhythm game
Sekiro is extremely fair. Despite my combined hundreds of hours spent in the souls games, Elden Ring, and Bloodborne, Sekiro is the only one I've felt I mastered.
Play Ninja Gaiden 2 for Xbox 360 (or the remastered “Black” version) and I promise you you’ll be absolutely begging for “hesitation is defeat” again. 

In Ninja Gaiden 2, “room after room after room of dozens of soldiers holding homing multi-missile launchers and bosses that explode and kill you without warning after you’ve already killed them” is defeat. 
When I finally beat Sekiro, I no joke got a tub of ice water and put my hands in it for minutes. I uninstalled the game immediately after. Great game but zero chance in hell I will do that to myself again. I think I broke the fucking parry button.
    Okay dude, Sekiro isnt THAT hard.
In my opinion, Sekiro is the worst fromsoft game purely because it has barely any variety for replay. Im sure some people will be tempted downvote purely because of that, but the game forces you into a single playstyle. It’s not an unfun playstyle, but it’s practically the same regardless of “build”.
    Sorry your opinion is wrong
        Yknow, that means a lot to me, Nate Higgers
Same. Been playing soulslike games since Demon’s in 2009. Its the only one thats stumped me.
There's a good challenge to fun ratio that can be hard to balance on many games. I like a challenge but if it's not fun then there's no point because that's the whole point of video games
6 hours put into the game and still have not completed the first level. Fuck soul-likes. Downvote me all you want.
    Press deflect as the attack hits you. Only attack when it's safe. Stick with it its worth it
It’s one of my favorite games of all time, I’m sad you gave up on it but hey it is what it is, here’s a pat on the back for trying 👋
I've solo'd dark souls 1, elden ring, I've 100%ed Hollow Knight, reached mid diamond in overwatch 1, beat Matt in Wii boxing, and won the Nabisco 500 on Oreo.com in 2004 and even I gave up on Sekiro for its difficulty.
Spoiler alert for those who haven't played it.

So did I. For over a year. During my 1st playthrough, I was beating my head against the wall for the entire game, and it never "clicked" for me. Somehow (or maybe because I can be as stubborn as a mule), I got to Sword Saint Isshin. However, after over 40 tries, I was only able to get to his last phase twice (with no healing, no resurrection, and at most two hits worth of health).
Fast forward a lot of time, and I started playing around with regular enemies, just going for deflections in the beginning area (just after you get your sword), and started progressing slowly.
Because of that, many bosses that I had previously struggled against fell at most in 3 attempts (Juzou the Drunkard, for instance), and bosses I had not attempted before somehow were defeated first try (Owl Father (yes, I still don't know how I got the timing down)).

Mind you, my first FS game was Bloodborne (and I went in blind, started and left the game 4 times before I really started getting it down), and I hit 2 main brick walls: Rom, the Vacuous Spider (stopped counting after 40 attempts, I estimate it took around 70), and Gherman (23 attempts). The rest, somehow, took 4 attempts or less.
its not that hard imo, but whats really unmotivating is the fact that you dont know what to do or where to go most times, so you have to pull out yt 80% of the time because your lost or you forgot something on the other side of the map that you were suppose to do, like bosses and items and stuff
I just finished my ng+7 charmless + bell run
I wouldn’t say sekiro is unfair in the slightest, just more frustrating than it is fun. I definitely knew it wasn’t worth the time investment for me personally and uninstalled after the first big enemy wasted me a couple times and I got tired of spending 5 minutes walking back from the checkpoint every time.
    Me with every Fromsoft game. I just don't bother anymore, I don't care enough about games to try to "git gud" anymore.
        I think the gameplay balance is just a bit worse than the other from soft games in terms of demanding a lot from the player mechanically right at the start when most souls games are easy for the first couple hours before really ramping up.
    What boss did you have to walk 5 minutes to get to? It isn’t Dark Souls 1, I honestly can’t think of a boss fight that takes more than around a minute to get back to, and most take like 30 seconds or less.

The first enemy that I can think of that gives a lot of people trouble is Chained Ogre, and that’s like 15 seconds away from the bonfire assuming you take the time to take out the two enemies in front of him.

Maybe you mean Gyoubu? Again if you just run to the boss fight it takes like a minute.

I’m not going to say that Sekiro is perfect but the run backs to bosses are all pretty short.
    u/Gorgii98 ask and you shall receive.
Me with Elden Ring. Eh I just don’t play anything described as a souls game or souls like. Just not for me.
Literally every Fromsoft game to me. I don’t find dying over and over from the start to be very engaging.
    That's fair, I don't find games that refuse to challenge or kill me to be very engaging.
    I don't mind dying a bunch in a game if the punishment for dying isn't that bad...

Like a boss can be tough if I start right back at the beginning of the battle but if I have to do the whole level over again...yeah fuck that
I played for like an hour and the. Realized I would have to spend 50-100 hours to learn when to press one button to dodge…. I uninstalled and never went back lol
I couldn’t get past the tutorial. So I went back to sucking at Rocket League.
Hot take: Wo Long‘s combat system is better than Sekiro‘s. With Sekiro, it’s basically that parrying is the main point of combat, parry attacks to fill the meter and then take a huge part of their health away. That’s why it feels more like a rythm game most of the time. Yes, you can choose to focus on attacking yourself, but the enemies can then usually parry, block or ignore your attacks anyway and your attacks don’t deal much damage anyway so it’s high risk, low reward. But in Wo Long, you can focus on both and depending on how good you are, both are rewarding. Parrying does fill up a meter aswell, but it’s not so busted that it’s not better than head on attacks and if you choose to focus on being extremely proficient in the offensive, then that is just as good as when you’re a master at parrying. Wo Long at least gives you actually more options on how to proceed in combat.
    Sounds like you dont understand sekiro if you think it also doesnt focus on both. Most bosses require you to keep the pressure up by both attacking and parrying or their posture bar goes down quickly. Sekiro also has so many combat options with the shinobi tools, consumables and combat arts like what are on about?.
        Arts and Tools are just „Martial Arts“ and combat items in Wo Long aswell, but they can be cheesed and i played Sekiro. A handful of opponents require you to put on the pressure yourself or use items to make it an easier fight, but for 90%, being a parry god is what gets you over a fight
Sekiro is probably the most fair of all the fromsoft games
    How?
You went hollow bruh
DS2 SotFS
I know, Sekiro is fantastic. And then, it actually has a hard and harder mode you can combine. Default is too easy.
nota and rainworld have pretty mutch the same situation
forget everything you know about soulslike and learn everything from scratch then the game will be easier than you previously thought.
scrub
Hesitation is defeat
I gave up playing Sekiro not because of difficulty but because I just didn’t like the synergy between the player characters movement and graphic model. It felt clunky compared to DS3 Bloodborne and Elden Ring, something about it felt off and I couldn’t deal with it.
    Man that’s so weird.  I have the exact opposite experience.  I feel like the inputs and animations in sekiro are tighter than any other from game.  I feel much more in control of my character.
    You probably had some horrendous input lag.
        Nah
I dont know if it was my pc/setup but the game felt laggy when parrying. Like i had the right timing but the character would take just a bit longer to parry and I would fail.

It just felt like an unfair mechanic to artificially make the game harder so I stopped pretty early on.

Wolong's parry machanic was super fun though
Of all the games, Sekiro never felt unfair.
Unfair = Skill issue
Sekiro is so good
I find Sekiro the most fair of the games.  It fails in variety cuz like 70% of the enemies are samurai.  But its the only one i can enter a boss fight and genuinely expect to do it hitless
Don’t let anyone tell you that you did wrong in this case. It’s a sadistic and unfair game in many ways. You can still beat it, you can master it, but at what cost really?
    What part of it is unfair? I mean specifically.
        I can’t pin point a certain part, the whole thing is unfair and pushes you towards either learning enemy animations or the way out. Player creativity is very limited ( I’m gonna get hate for this but it is what it is ) and seriously if you can’t think of 1 moment where you felt like it’s unfair this convo is over and pointless. Also I hated fighting all the headless bullshits. 
Never got to feel the satisfaction people talk about when beating the game also. Very average game.
            To each his own I guess. But I personally don’t find it unfair at all. I also don’t like the headless bosses, but I simply just skip them. Sekiro is definitely on my list of top 5 games I’ve ever played. I beat it 6 times and still counting.
            Its unfair cause it forces you to 'learn enemy animations'? (by which you mean actually know how an enemy attacks)
                It’s unfair because it sucks a$$. And it’s not fun. That’s it.
“Bro don’t stop playing it! It’s a golden gem! Keep pushing through it even if it’s not fun for you cause it’s amazing!” I swear, Soulsborne fans can’t accept when someone doesn’t like their favorite game
    a bit of encouragement to push through a tough challenge can lead to a meaningful and rewarding victory.  The self-esteem boost from overcoming defeat can be a reward in itself.
        Not everyone enjoys the insane difficulty man. With how limited the amount of time many people have to play games, they’d rather not sink a ton of time into trying to beat a single boss that just frustrates them until they’re finally about to beat it after 10+ hours of trying to beat it. That just isn’t everyone’s idea of fun
Doom eternal nightmare mode
I stopped playing when I encountered one of the bosses that is almost impossible to beat without divine confetti (or cheese, but I'm not playing the game to cheese). There's like 9 of that item in the entire game up to that point and each time you die to the boss, you lose it. Like how tf am I supposed to beat that boss?
    That is an optional boss, u can just go a different way (look it up if you really can't find it)
As did I. When I realized that I couldn't just level up my health, defense and damage and cheese it, and instead I had to git gud and learn rhythm and parrying, I knew I'd never beat the game
I've tried 3 times, and I can't do it. Souls like games just aren't for everyone.
Sekiro is the most satisfying game to master. Definitely FS' best work and my favorite game of the last 20 years.
It’s kinda funny cause apparently a lot of people consider it harder than other fromsoftware games but to me it’s def the easiest
Sekiro is easy idk what y’all are on about.
its actually the fairest souls like game from Fromsoftware.
I feel like it became laughably easy after genichiro
Trust after you beat it ng+ is probably gonna be a piece of cake
Sweet summer child...
Honestly skill issue bro. I actually think it's easier than the first Dark Souls....

The Demon of Hatred is a bitch though luckily he's optional.
Hesitation is defeat
Most people quit the game at some point then come back. Give it a second chance, promise it’ll grow on you.
lol
Losers
sekiro is extremely fair, am I the only one who thought it was easier than the Souls games? its basically a rhythm game at heart, once it clicks the game is a breeze.
Dude I thought sekiro was gone be impossible…

And here I am now getting closer to doing hitless runs of the harder bosses. It’s possible, it just takes patience
Skill issue
Skill issue
If it’s not a sports game, I almost exclusively play games on easy difficulty.
Hesitation is defeat
Sekiro is pretty hard but my god once you get it down. *chef kiss*
You just have to treat it like a rhythm game.
Souls veteran. I’ll admit I set the game aside. Twice. I need another run at it again. Sigh.
Missed out second favorite game of all time
Sekiro is hard but fair.
Noob.
Sekiro is weird, because there are some genuine bullshit parts to it. However, once you start to treat it more like a rhythm game and less like a soulsborne game the combat becomes a lot easier to master.


I love it, but I can easily see how it can be hit-or-miss for people.
Seven play throughs and all endings and Gauntlets finished with 2 missing trophy’s for sekiro 

Fun game
It's actually not unfair in my experience, just really hard. I gave up and came back about a year later and loved it.
Sekiro is a learning game, it’s only unfair if you can’t learn the mechanics. Once you understand it, it’ll flow like water.
Pro tip: hesitation is defeat
Sekiro is one of the fairest games I’ve played, to be honest.  It has a high skill ceiling, but every time I lost, I felt like it was a skill issue on my part, and never that the enemy had some outrageous undodgeable one shot.  And they rarely outnumbered you with enemies, they knew every enemy was a struggle so you aren’t very often fighting mobs
Sekiro is a rhythm game. It literally takes tens of hours to get a feel for it, but once you do, you’ll be hooked for life.

Even 4 years after 100% beating it I still occasionally get the itch for it and go back and play through the boss rush mode that they added.
Get güd
Sekiro was quite a ride for me

I come from dark souls and I was playing it as dark souls 

I still pushed through and finished it 

Some bosses took me days (yes, days) to defeat

Only boss I cheesed was 7 spears, and I'd do it again!

Screw that guy
But Sekiro is SO good once you get it down.
Skill issue
Just play it, it's all just a learning experience. The bosses are literally the funnest part over running around
Cod waw veteran difficulty? Too much grenade spam
Hesitation is defeat

Hesitation is defeat
Sekiro is awesome
Skill issue
TBH Sekiro is, IMO, the fairest game FromSoft ever made. Actually, I’d take it a step further and say it’s the *only completely fair* “Soulslike” game they’ve ever made. Just my opinion tho. And I’ll explain if asked
I love sekiro, it's my favorite rhythm game
It is difficult, but not unfair :).

But then again, hesitation is defeat
Sekiro is by far the easiest and best souls game
The nature of Sekiro means it can’t really be unfair in my opinion. It’s purely timing based and not much randomness exists.
By far the most fair difficulty of any game ever created. No joke, it’s the epitome of “Skill issue”
Genichiro waxed me for about 2 hours with no progress, so I gave up. It’s still on my list and I’m going to try, but I’ve got other shit to play.
Simple don't hesitate. I won't call it unfair, you just need to memorize alot of patterns.
I think the answer to this, like all fromsoft games, is “git gud”
Skill issue lmao
Literally just learn parry
Hesitation is defeat
just spam L1
Git gud
L1 L1 L1, lmao. It really is not that hard.
Its absolutely fair. Try Rain World :)
Sekiro is not unfair bruh
Sekiro isn't unfair tho
Git gud
I can see OP's hand trembling while fighting Genichiro and it still is.
Un modded battle cats is just hard af
Sekiro is first game i ever played 4 times in row. It's that good. Usualy i move on after first playthrough...
Sekiro is extremely fair. It’s the most straight forward fair game I’ve played. Literally just parry and strike.

Demon lord was a bit of BS though tbf
Naught unfair in Sekiro's difficulty. Play more + time = git gud
Sekiro just isn't like the other souls likes. The main thing about sekiro is the timing to parry the enemy attacks.
Blocking and parrying is around 80% of the game, the other 20% are running and attacking.
I can't blame you on giving up, it can really mess with your head.
But after you get the hang out of it, it is one of the most rewarding things i ever felt in an souls like game.
Imo it has one of the best fighting mechanics in it's genre.
Sekiro is extremely fair. The parry window is very forgiving, and screwing ot up even allows you to block instead. I'm sorry, but you just need to adapt better. I don't find Demon of Hatred very fair, but the rest of the game is.
I'm soon about to start when I can afford the game
am i the only one who finds sekiro to be the easiest out of the soulsborne games?

ps i find bloodborne to be the hardest
Let madam butterfly teach you the rhythm 🤣
Sekiro is not unfair at all. truly a skill based game
Probably op puts points in every stat messing the builds :))
Man just needs to git gud
Hesitation is defeat
.... I tried to beat it with no life and attack upgrades and both demon bell and Kuro charm debuffs.

I called thst mode, "the way of the suffering"
To experience the beauty of that game you need to be dedicated and skilled, OP didn't spend enough time in the Dojo.
soulslike games or "extremely difficult" games arent meant to be fair. some people enjoy them, some don't.
    They are fair games, minus occasional bs
        Usually barely even
    But they aren't unfair, just challenging. The player is given all the tools they need to get trough the game, all except skill. If 'getting good' is too big of a burden, souls games let you upgrade the character to make the game easier
It’s fun reading all the comments here about how rage inducing these game are, from fans of the genre, but they’ll still try to convince us they had fun.
Yeah it's the worst of all the fromsoft games as far as difficulty goes. Finally killed that monkey after like 40 attempts and he just gets back up
    You are just bad/gen. No offense but I found this game WAY easier than bloodborne, elden ring, etc.
Dude Hotline Miami took me a year to beat, cause I could only play for 1 hour at a time and then I would get extremely frustrated cause the game was so hard, now that I played the second game it took me a weekend to beat.
Me too
Same…. I was a day 1 player…. Couldn’t get past the knight on the bridge…. No matter how good I thought my dodging or parrying was the hit boxes always got me… gave up
Im trying to defeat lady Butterflie. I almost beat her...
It's all rhythm and memorization :) i found it hard on my first playthrough but after guardian ape everything clicked for me and i flew through the rest of the game until Isshin lol
Same… I could not get the parry timing down and if you can’t do that you really can’t play that game.
Only boss i didn't stand a chance was deamon of hatred ....fuck this guy
I ragequit 4 times on this game before beating it. Month long breaks. Learned a lot about the learning ability of giving up in moderation.
[deleted]
    u/Gorgii98 ask and you shall receive.
doesn’t really seem to be a popular opinion but i found cuphead to be the hardest game i’ve ever played.  took my dad and i months to beat on co-op.  there are no ways to bypass the difficulty, whereas something like elden ring allows you to cheese the game by over leveling, using a broken build, and using powerful summons
Halo laso makes me suicidal
expert ➡️ expert+ beat saber
I’m terrible at souls games but found sekiro easy.
I love all from soft games. Sekiro was hands down the hardest for me by a country mile
Most games are doable on the hardest difficulty. The only games i find impossible to play are like lunatic or maniac on fire emblem games. These games randomize enemy stats on every restart so in one scenario they can do x damage and in another they do x+1, etc. I’ll have to restart multiple times until I get the stats I need to have a shot at advancing. Land the perfect scenario and you can win. Get one random enemy who’s stats is an instant k’o and it’s another restart.
Sonic unleashed eggman land had me tweaking hard.
RLCraft mod pack especially the early game.
Pussy……………..
(Im taking a break from dark souls I can sympathize with this)
Rain World will do this to ya
Most Fromsoftware games benefit greatly if you learn to just walk away some time and come back to it later. I had the hardest time the first time I attempt to play Sekiro. A couple years later  I came back to it and breezed through most of the game.

Same with Demon's Souls. I feel like I slogged through my first playthrough but just recently started a fresh save and burned right through it.

I look at their games like a puzzle box and once you figure out the trick it trivializes most of the game. Still challenging at times though and loads of fun
FROMSOFTs best game for real
The Demon of Hatred earned that moniker.
cuphead
Wolfenstein II Mein Leben difficulty
Don't buy Lies of P then. Most people seem to agree it's the hardest souls like.
man sekiro is so tough
sword saint isshin remains the hardest boss fight i’ve ever got through.
ngl i literally counted my deaths on sekiro bosses from the first pull bc of how hard some of them are, and demon of hatred killed me 70+ times. i got it to 1hp like 3-4 times and would die to that charge forward attack BC THE HITBOX IS INSANE
I had to take a 6 month break from Sekiro because I thought I couldnt beat it, now Ive platinumed and its my favorite game ever
Majority of Hollow Knight is fine.

Absolute Radiance is just plain unfair and nothing short of it.
Playing Stalker right now and I’m loving the “dealing high damage but also receiving high damage” gunfights. No bullet sponges and the fire fights get intense.
Sekiro is ez after you figure out the mechanics. Give it another shot later
Sekiro is like the easiest From Soft game no lie
Armored Core VI
Halo 2 legendary moment (yes I know the actual story)
Same. I got up to the third boss, the samurai guy on top of the tower. 

I just couldn’t do it.
I made it to the very end boss and couldn't beat it after nights and nights of trying the same damn fight. My most frustrating game experience, to trip at the finish line, but its still a great game.
Weak  
But just so you can progress you could just use cheat engine.
Is the best fromsoft game from a gameplay standpoint but you are right a lot of times seems unfair, i love/hate the game some bosses and minibosses are way to hard, like in a really bad way and put melina to shame
Give Me the God of War
It's just a rhythm game bro you can do it.
I gave up after first map
I need to continue sekiro, I stopped playing because of that fucking giant ape, I want to die, and because I stopped, the last time I played the game I was playing it like I was a new player.
hotline miami is like this, but acually enjoyable and fun
See, I don’t see the point in extreme difficulty. I’m a devout medium man, I enjoy a challenge up until the point where it’s Souls-like levels, then all interest drops off. There’s a difference between feeling accomplished, then there’s pointless frustration
Literally me with cuphead
Lol 

*YuGiOh Forbidden Memories has entered the chat*
It gets easier once you figure out it's actually just a cleverly designed rhythm game. Think more like "muse dash" and it will all click.
Most rage games fit this title.

Also have you tried CRAAAAAAAAAZY Difficulty on Garden Warfare 2 in the ops?
I can beat that game front to back without dying once. You can get there too if you want, or not.
Sounds like a skill issue

Edit: that was a joke
Hell Divers 2 has been feeling this way at difficulty 8
Demon of Hatred is the most difficult boss I’ve ever beaten in 35 years of gaming. Took me over a week of evening sessions. Probably fought him over 100 times 😖 I still don’t feel that the game is cheap at all. I’m just not good enough lol
Skill issue
The right kind of difficulty is one where a human can pheasibly get good at something is a reasonable amount of time. People have busy lives and don't have time to practice that one technique in a game thaw was never required until now for hours on end. If something is so incredibly difficult that you have to either study it for hours to find how it works, or pry through the games files, it's bad design. 

The absolute worst is when you have to get lucky for something to work. I shouldn't have to explain this too much. 
Luck can work fine as a mechanic in some cases, where it can be only helpful if it occurs, and it's the required to progress. Alternatively, you could build your entire game around luck. Baldurs gate does this very well, with different outcomes depending on how you roll the dice. You do get the option to reload if you want to see other outcomes though. 

But if you don't do either of these things, and you just randomly have a bit of required luck, that's awful design.

Worst of the worst is when you have to pay real money for something.
Me fighting a boss in Elden Ring... WHEN THE FUCK IS IT GONNA BE MY TURN MF!?!?!?!?!
Only FromSoft game I haven’t beat. It was so damn good but fuck was it hard towards the end
I am feeling this way towards Resident Evil Zero space management. You only get 6 each 12 total between Rebecca and Billy. Would it have fucking killed them to allow you to have 8 spaces instead of 6? That or give key items for level progression a separate spot.
Noooo keep going! Breaks are good but keep going, it’s so good
The difficulty drops HARD once you've beaten the game before.

Or if you replay after alnost beating game.

It dont matter how many years later it is it stays easy now.
The games are hard yes but not impossible Sekiro especially gives you various tools to succeed you just have to find them
I did too, I didn’t think it was too difficult I just didn’t like the fighting mechanics and it felt like I was always going the wrong way
I’ll repeat this every time a difficult game conversation is brought up in this sub-

**Pac Man World- King Galaxian.** The amount of multitasking and hand eye coordination you need for this level is like nothing I’ve ever seen in any game since. I had to come back as a 21 year old man to beat it.
Sekiro has that switch later where it goes from the hardest game you'll ever play into being super easy and extremely satisfying. I almost gave up twice, and once it clicked, I platinumed it. I finished it about 15 times now, and I keep coming back to it because it's just so fun once it clicks.
Halo infinite on mythic... fuuuuck that shit.
Unpopular opinion : sekiro is not the easiest but the fairest fromsoft game. No hitboxing, no delayed rolling, just pure skill.
i can see why, but imo Sekiro is fair. I believe youll see that too if you got good (i believe in you!!!)

my personal pick is some of the Yakuza games on hard difficulty. the combat gets so clunky its hard to justify the difficulty of these games sometimes.
Kingdom Hearts II
This applies to Grimvalor as well. Spamming enemies is not difficult, it's tedious and unfair.
Elden Ring made me throw the controller because of the controller reaction time.
Give up Kuro's Charm and ring that little Demon bell, it'll make the game alot more fun.
Memes are so broken lol so the guy looking at the meter is the game difficulty reading its own measurement? And the message is you quit because its too hard, but not quite unfair?
Once I stopped playing as if it was Dark Souls it became much, much more manageable. Just embrace the parry system and you’re good to go
Lol you’re shit
Some people just dont have cognitive capabilities to succeed at playing hard games and thats fine, mostly comes down to lacking patience for learning. Sekiro is my favorite game of all time and it was a breeze to get through, games should be challenging thats what makes them fun and what gives us players the rush. Games for grown ups.
Yeah, I gave up, too. I got to a spot where there were a ton of dudes on a staircase, iirc some of them had... cannons?

That was the straw that broke the camels back for me.
    After gyoubu or before?
        It was back when the game came out, so I can't remember. What I do remember is that I beat a big knight on a horse and then went into a castle/fortress. I tooled around in there for a bit before I ran into trouble.
            I know you're gonna guess this but i would really recommend giving it another shot, it's genuinely imo just a perfect game. It's challenging but fair and not even that hard if you use the tools the game gives you, honestly if you were able to beat the horse man you can beat the game.
                I've thought about it since then because I enjoyed it when I didn't find it to be frustrating. There's a decent shot that I'll give it another try eventually
I think Sekiro is fair, the game mechanic is just hard to grasp but I can guarantee you if you somehow manage to understa d the timings the game becomes a fun challenge. I'm not to the level of beating the inner gen or inner isshin yet but I can breeze through the game even with a level that I would consider a bit above average
Monster House for the GameCube
Sekiro had me sitting up and then standing back down bc controllers are too expensive these days
tried elden ring, failed, came back to it months later and got horribly addicted

i fear i have fallen down the same path with sekiro as i just started it for the second time and now im horribly addicted
I still have fond memories on how utterly jarring and blissful it was to get the first health upgrade. Just one upgrade and the game suddenly felt ten times easier to manage.
Its like learning a musical instrument
    Sekiro is literally a rhythm game. Literally, with no exaggeration. Listen to someone fight any of the humanoid bosses without looking, and you'll hear it clear as day.
        As a musician I've never found Sekiro to be inherently difficult, it solely functions on rhythm and pattern recognition
            How about you(or another musically capable human) play it, and I'll watch, and we'll both have fun.
            This is why Dancer of the Boreal Valley is the big wall for some DS3 players. Most DS3 bosses have a 4/4 tempo, and Dancer is a relatively slow-paced 3/4. Gael feels like playing polyrhythms with his cape. 

>!Pontiff is just bullshit, but he’s parryable and you have like a billion summons in the area!<
                Ds3 was easy af up until pontiff
    Idk I used to study classical trombone at a high level and Sekiro does not feel like learning/mastering an instrument.
        It's a metaphor
        As a “high level” musician myself, I think it’s more than fair to say learning any skill has a lot in common with each other, and there’s plenty of similarities between sekiro and instruments. I also think you can apply wisdom gained from any skill to another, like with sekiro, you have to get up and try again when you die. Maybe you could pick the trombone up again.
            Thanks for actually responding in good faith instead of insulting me and speculating about my motivations for mentioning I used to play trombone. 

The only similarity I see is that mastering Sekiro takes repetition and a willingness to check your ego. Music is artistic, Sekiro is purely mechanical. There is some creativity involved in combat style, but not like in other FromSoft franchises such as Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and Armored Core. This is just my perspective. 

That was actually very sweet to encourage someone to pick up an instrument again, but I stopped because I no longer found pleasure in it. Like seriously that’s sweet. I’d rather spend more time consuming creative media or hanging out with my friends and family. I also didn’t fit into the community on vibes level, except within Norman Bolter’s studio. Nothing to do with failing, I was 20 years old gigging around Boston regularly and had professional connections in Atlanta, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. Plus, long-term job security has always been a problem for orchestral musicians in the United States, especially in the wake of COVID-19.
        Dude this comment is so obviously just to show off that you play an instrument lol cmon now
I'm having that experience with probably an easier game, Final Fantasy 7 Remake. I'm playing on Normal mode, so nothing fancy, but I just can't get the flow down sometimes. Then I'll walk away, sleep, come back the next day and ace it on the first try. Just a series of ragequits. Like you I have a full time job and very little free time to speak of, so maybe I'm just not putting in the hours to get good enough at these new action based games. Maybe i need to go back to playing Dream Daddy or something.
    I actually just recently played this and hell house almost killed the game for me but thats kinda my fault. It’s the first time the game really tests your knowledge of the battle mechanics and it wasn’t till my 4th loss that I realized it was a magic based fight.
        I think I scraped by that fight and won despite my idiocy regarding the mechanics.
            Same, definitely not the case on hard mode however
    That's how it works for me. I don't get better mid-session anymore. Need to go away, sleep, and come back better the next day. Maybe it's age, I don't know. Seems like I learned faster when I was young.
    I feel you. I played Hollow Knight recently and what most people say is “an easy bossfight, 2 hours tops even for the greenest of noobs” was 1 - 2 weeks of gaming for me. But it didn’t matter. I just turned the game on, tried to beat it until I felt that today was not the day I’ll get through. And that was fine. Eventually I got better (at that one boss, I still suck), beat it and it felt great. 10 minutes later, another one comes my way and makes me busy for another week 😄🤷🏻‍♀️ Currently I’m wondering whether I should try Elden Ring. I know I’ll suck at it too, but it might be fun.
Genichiro has the best game character placement of all time. Whoever designed sekiro and put him there is a genius.
    Genichiro is probably my all time favorite boss, hes extremely hard when you havent learnt the combat system yet but when it finally clicks hes one of the easiest bosses in game. I would argue that if you cant defeat his 1st phase with relative ease you havent fully learned the combat yet
I got stuck on the last boss in blood and wine in the Witcher 3, took a break, went back fresh first try. Sometimes it’s good to just take a break for a min
    Detlof? Or however you spell it. Yeah, he was a pain in the ass on death March. That stupid bat attack was some cheese
        Yea, horrible to go against but the bat attack was easy once I figured it out, basically run tf away, and right as they plume upwards dodge sideways. Works 100%
The game made me just put it down in frustration, I hit Genichiro and I just couldn't do it.
At all.

I think I came back after 6  months, restarted the whole game and this time around I beat him after a few runs.
The Genichiro fight really made the game click for me and I powered through all the boss fights at that point, people talked about Guardian Ape being difficult but it was a one and done, same with the duo.
The first time i experienced something similar was Mafia 1 during the Race. I just couldn't beat it for many tries. The next day i came from school and beat it first try. Crazy how the body learns something during sleep.
I found this with bloodborne - father gascoigne had me beat. I couldn't get past him, especially in his third phase (still barely can). Once I did eventually beat him the whole game became so much easier.
This happened to me with returnal
You have to let go in order to git gud
Getting up and stepping away from a game is the best way to beat it. Let the progress sink in to your subconscious and the next time you play you'll ace.
It's the skill gate, shits always the hardest until something clicks and now youre on your way to god hood. This is a good chunk of Capcom games
This for sure. The early bosses were soon much harder. I just beat owl and it was under 10 attempts. I spent hours kb some of the early bosses
Clearly. OP needs to stop hesitating.
    Probably got outglocked
    We all know, hesitation is defeat
Isshin be like “hesitation is death” then pull out a glock
    Parry this you filthy casual
        The neat part is that you can, and are actually expected to, parry his bullets. You get a tutorial popup literally at the first group of enemies in Ashina Outskirts
    I was gonna make a joke about Glocks not letting you hesitate because they don't have an outer trigger safety, from my understanding, but it doesn't make sense cuz Glocks were designed for the shooter to be the safety and only prevent misfire from a fall or whatever......flashy thing this whole comment Agent K!!
I think someone gave a pretty good summary on why it messes with your head: “*You need to parry and block as much as you possibly can, even when it 100% looks like it should be impossible to do so.*”

For example, a giant flaming bull literally the size of a house… you can parry it. You take some damage, yes, but you can parry it. Even if you have the illusion that katana’s are indestructible, Virgil of Devil May Cry would call bull on being able to parry that (no pun intended).
    yes don’t treat it like a souls game. it’s a rhythm game. as long as u aren’t rhythmically deaf u should be able to figure out the parry rhythm of every basic attack. for the ‘perilous’ attacks that ask u to either jump, run, or sidestep/mikiri (red death warning) those are pure reaction and pattern recognition checks which might be hard walls to pass for some though
        Lmfao if you say so, but I've turned the sound completely off one time cuz of my girl sleeping and my headset was dead, and I actually read the enemies body language better. If you just watch their chest and stomach, you'll know exactly when to parry ngl
        I have been thinking about coming back to the game after previous attempts at it. I think my Souls mindset has me thinking that exact statement of how can I parry a bulls charge or other attacks that aren't parry-able in other souls' games. Thank you, I'll keep this in mind and give in another shot and parry everything, haha.
    The parrying is fine for me. It's the needing to jump that fucks me up. It seems so simple but so much of my muscle memory is built around parrying and dodging. I eventually brute forced my way through it but it was a time for sure.
I found it easier than a lot of other souls games tbh but I guess everyone is different

I feel like sekiro is a rhythm game
    Most souls games have parry windows of 12-20 frames but sekiro is 30 frames and generally much more forgiving with parries. Funny enough dodging does work in Sekiro but it's much riskier and more punishing, like parries in Dark Souls.
        I’ve brought this up tons of times.

Not only is it 30 active frame, but:        
- it has almost no start up frames.        
- it has no recovery frames at the end to punish.              
- it can lead immediately into a block so long as you don’t spam.

The Sekiro die hards won’t have any of it.        
There was a whole wave of people saying “Sekiro made me good at parrying finally!”         
When I would bring up those stats I would just get downvoted to hell. You may get good at parrying Sekiro, but partying in all the other souls games will remain far more difficult
            Yea, those worlds in the dark souls series are honestly really depressing...it would, indeed, be far more difficult to party in a place like that.
            that's actually interesting. I wouldn't argue that getting the timing of one attack's parry is harder in sekiro after reading that. 

But to be effective at parrying in sekiro for many bosses its not 1 parry --> stagger like dark souls. It's more like parrying groups of 5 attacks and mixing in different forms of dodging or running away in between to fully negate damage. 

So I can see why people push back, just not for the right reason, i think its the speed and need for back to back parries. I agree that it's harder in souls, but curious on your thoughts since I have played much more sekiro than early dark souls games
                Love to hear someone on the internet whi can voice a different opinion without getting overly heated. 

But yeah, so I’ve played nearly every game from fromsoftware (not DS2 and only like 3 of the armored cores).           
So coming from that experience I just figuratively substituted my roll button for the parry button and had no troubles at all. There are plenty of bosses in the souls series that have moves which require multiple well timed dodges allowing for a brief punish at the end. Go and read that sentence again, but change the word dodges for parries and see how well it fits for Sekiro.         
I think anyone with good rolling instincts from other souls games probably adapted very easily to Sekiro by just parrying instead of rolling.         
The only difference was that the parry was actually just way safer than a roll to be honest, mostly for the reasons I already mentioned.      

I agree that, in general, bosses are for sure faster in Sekiro and have more consecutive attacks… however just like dark souls you learn a kind of universal rhythm to dodging (parrying in Sekiro) that applies to all bosses.        
- consecutive dodges (immediate back to back with no pause).        
- roll catches (slight pause in the next dodge, as the attack was designed to catch you).

It’s the same feel in Sekiro, just a slightly faster rhythm. You either press it back to back, or add a slight pause if the attack was meant to catch you.

Anywayyyy, that felt like a tangent lol. Sorry adhd has me going off all over the place sometimes. Hope that kinda addressed what you were asking though.

(Edit: typos… I’m on mobile)
                    delayed on my response but I appreciate that explanation. I very much enjoyed sekiro, ER, and AC6 and planned on actually playing through DS next

I got ass blasted in sekiro and did alright in ER. That perspective helps quite a bit in understanding why sekiro I felt the way it did playing through that first lol
                        Happy cake day!

        That’s the thing, Sekiro you can parry basically everything. Dark souls you have to dodge and sometimes still get lucky, so once you figure out the pattern Sekiro is way easier imo

    Those guys are meant for endgame. It is stupid where they're placed, It makes you think you can/should be able to beat them when you encounter them...

But yeah, wait until endgame when the amount of resources and money you have are no issue. You can even grind money indefinitely to buy infinite divine confetti if you want.

Those guys drop really good items for ng+, but are also entirely skippable... (I can't even remember if they drop prayer beads) definitely one of the weak points of the game, enemies that need consumables.
        None of them drop prayer beads.  The headless drop charms that work as infinite sugars, which you really don't need since you can just buy normal sugars.  There's one that there's no corresponding sugar for and increases your damage by alot, but it also takes away half your maximum health while using it.
            There is a corresponding sugar for the Yashariku buff.
    If you're talking about headless literally just skip him. Completely optional. Everything else is doable no items
    You know they're all optional right?
    The only bosses that you need divine confetti for are the Headless and Warrior Shichimen.  All of them are optional, and you can hold off on doing them until after you've unlocked being able to purchase unlimited divine confetti from merchants.  Just progress the story until you've killed the Corrupted Monk that guards Fountainhead Palace late in the game.
    Using a consumable is not cheese. The only one I would consider cheese in all of the games I've played was the God Arrow (or whatever) from Dragons Dogma that was basically a 1-hit kill on anything. Bad take.
        They said using a consumable OR cheese. Not that consumables are cheesing.
            I consume cheese
            Sometimes they are, too!

Like cheesing the capra demon with firebombs over the wall lmao.
    headless are ass I don't blame you they suck better to just leave them for endgame
    Which boss, Headless or Guardian ape? At one point in the game you can unlock the Divine conffeti and buy it from one merchant (i can't remember his location) :D 
I hated the Headless bosses, but near the end of the game you encounter two of them under the water, i was like wtfff, can you make this any more painful than it is🤣 but i beat them all, you can do it too!

I quit around the 10 hour mark. Everyone says it eventually clicks, and it kind of did, like I wasn’t complete ass at it or anything, but goddamn it was still a difficult and punishing game to get through.

I beat all the other Souls games, but I just wasn’t really having fun with this one’s style of challenge/combat. I had Elden Ring in my backlog and was excited to get to it
u/Gorgii98 ask and you shall recieve.
As I once said to a friend, it’s not Dark Souls, but an entirely different beast. Bloodborne and Elden Ring may be different, but they still got the fingerprints all over them.

Sekiro has the issue in that it doesn’t play at all like you think you should play. Even if you aren’t familiar with the souls series, you would think that, as a ninja, stealth and agility would be your best friends. Turns out, while stealth is insanely useful, you still have to be incredibly careful because your character likes standing up when he really shouldn’t (and the game often forces you into open combat by level design or an enemy with the eyes of a hawk randomly spots you), and blocking and parrying are the best ways to fight enemies when every part of you is saying “there is no way you could party that.”
    >blocking and parrying are the best ways to fight enemies when every part of you is saying “there is no way you could party that,”

It is this, one hundred percent.

People seem to focus on dodging too much, but the reality is the game wants you to clash swords.
The Bull is the first real test of faith because your instincts are -screaming- to dodge but if you block and parry it, the fight suddenly makes a lot more sense.
        Damn and here I was just sprinting around the arena and chipping away at his health by getting behind or to the side of it until it died.
    This is probably why I hated it so much. 

I'm that guy who never used a shield in dark souls serie. 
I just roll and roll, very well. 

So my brain couldn't understand that this was a different game, and I kept my habits.
        And again, even if you’re unfamiliar with the souls series, every natural instinct screams at you to dodge instead of block.

Gyoubu can be handled without taking damage pretty easily, but nobody would ever think you could block a weapon/guy 2-3 times your size, *especially* one charging you down on horseback. Yet he’s one of the more plausible enemies you can block.
As a Guitar Hero player I sigh seeing people scared to play on expert
    Pinky finger
    I would be a guitar hero player still if the game and controller weren’t impossible to find for a reasonable price.
        I have two modded ones with mechanical frets lol found both of them at a thrift store took out the original parts and put  arduino kit in there.
Sekiro instantly becomes the easiest fromsoft game the second you stop playing it like its dark souls
    Yeah it's literally not hard. You just have to actually learn how to play it
    Truly. It's still the only Fromsoft game that I've gotten 100% completion on. Also, each NG+ gets easier and easier, which ime is contrary to the SoulsBorne games.
I love souls games, but hate rhythm games, probably why I already gave it up. So pretty and amazing, but not my thing.
Yes exactly!!
Love ZP
    Rest in peace ZP, long live FR.
        *skrrrrrrrt*

What happened to ZP?!
            The company that owned ZP basically wanted to fire everyone that wasnt him. He said fuck you, left with them and now the whole crew runs a channel named "second wind"

Tldr Zero Punctuation is now Fully Ramblomatic
                Ah, thats good to know. Is this new "Fully Ramblomatic" show the same sort of of format and style as ZP or is it something new entirely?
                    Its nearly identical, but black and red colored and a new theme song.
                Yahtzee is a real one for that.
            Don't panic. He's not dead, he just doesn't work there anymore.
I finished The Surge. 

I will never finish Sekiro.
    Fair enough but disregarding what title this quote was referring to, would you at least agree with it? Does a game just stop being challenging and just fucks you about instead
        Yes, of course. And why I will never finish Sekiro. Not fun.
            *Not fun for you
                Um....duh?
Sekiro has the hardest first playthrough of any From game and the easiest second playthrough.
    Best way to put it
    The major hurdle is figuring out that parrying is your best friend, even if you instinctively feel like you shouldn’t be able to do so with most things.

Other things include that you pretty much *need* to read item descriptions to beat some bosses, dragonrot, due to a slight mistranslation/misinformation, isn’t anywhere near as bad as you think it is (though I still will say having a punishment for dying in a game designed to kill you is honestly pushing it); and dodging isn’t anywhere near as good as you think it would be, but jumping can and will save you more than you would think.
        Can… can you parry the butterfly lady?…. I can not get past her
    Yeah after i beat ishhin i fight him as a past-time once in a while lol
    Second playthrough I didn’t even die until Guardian Ape
This. Rhythm and muscle memory
Yeah, Sekiro flows like water once you get it down. I can’t lie though, I was extremely frustrated with it at first because my friend had his TV off *game mode when I tried

*edit: a word
If you're coming from Dark Souls, Sekiro is REALLY hard. Most Souls players have dodging second nature to them, but sekiro throws that out the window and punished you for dodging. It was my first one so parrying was the first thing I learned. Honestly Elden Ring was harder for me.
Yeah, I've reached a point where I can do no death runs and I think in a year or two I might start trying no damage runs.  It really is just the best rhythm game of all time!  At this point I find it 1000 times easier than the other soul games.
Beating Sekiro the first time is one of the toughest games of all time. Beating Sekiro in every subsequent playthrough is a casual afternoon.
Took me 8 hours straight to beat genichiro first time. 2nd playthrough I didn’t die a single time. Really wild.
I can go long stretches without playing, pick it up, and absolutely fucking dominate on bosses that I KNOW nearly broke me on my first playthrough. It really is the muscle memory.
Its funnier if you know xcom actually cheats rolls in your favor, except in the hardest difficulty. So this is just straight up bad luck in both cases.
    Oh i know it does lol, I just don't like to think about it after I get squad wiped😅😅
This is a different thing, as it is a bug with the wrong calculation or wrong display of hit chances and the second one is just bad game design, that the enemies are triggered in 3er packs instead of walking around the map. This discourages you from exploring the map, as you have the danger of triggering more enemies than you already have to fight.

And don't get me started on the turn limits in XCOM 2 and all that stuff, oh my god.

But well, i'm glad there are much better remakes around, like Xenonauts 1 & 2. I'd say Xenonauts 1 with the Community Edition is the best you can get, as the second one is still in Early Access and not finished yet.
Yeah, Sekiro is a walk in the park compared to that bullshit
That brought back horrible memories of playing Ninja Gaiden 1, Fuck that game man.
    I beat Ninja Gaiden (NES). I could not beat Sekiro.
Every Ninja Gaiden is like pure sweat from start to finish. Normal difficulty in NG1 will push your shit ALOT, and if you go Hard or higher you will be shitting bricks by the end of it. 

I played these games after dark souls and such, and holy shit, people think they play hard games just because they FromSoft games lol.

Ahh these FromSoft babies will never know
    Seriously. NES Ninja Gaidens were tough as hell, but doable. The mid-2000 NGs were pure bullshit. 

Still stuck on Sword Saint 🤦🏻‍♂️
Oh god i forgot about those shurikins, plus even the thought of them was distracting when fighting those ninjas because you knew one could stick one in you at any time just like your mom
You can block them when they are thrown directly at you, it’s just when they hit the ground or wall next to you and explode that they will guard crush you, then it’s a matter of stringing iframe moves together to avoid them. NGII on master ninja is the best action game ever made imo, at least when fighting human enemies (like IS ninjas!) or enemies that can be delimbed. The game is noticeably unfinished unfortunately so there are some rough patches with certain enemies and bosses, but when it’s at its best it’s unmatched by anything. I encourage everyone to play it, there’s literally nothing like it. I always get excited when people post about it outside the NG sub since it’s so niche lol 

I have IS ninjas in my post history in case anyone wants to see what the parent comment is talking about. They can be real bastards, but they’re also extremely fun. 

Sekiro is easy as pie in comparison to any ninja gaiden game for that matter. I do love sekiro tho, not saying that as if it’s a bad thing to be clear. 

(IS = incendiary shuriken)
Are you guys talking about NES NG?? Yea those two games can rot in Hell
Thank you! 🤣 this is the best, I genuinely lol’d. I gotta remember that line.
It's not a soulsborne, but, like other people are saying, it's a rhythm game. If you got really good at Guitar Hero, you'll probably be good at Sekiro.
Except the bull. I hate that bull.
    The bull fight was bull shit (pun intended).
    I hated the bull too until I realized I could just parry his charge for the win every time
        As soon as I learned you could parry that, the bull was a cakewalk lol
    I have to fight him unlike any other battle lol. Im just sprinting in circles hoping to catch a spinning cut on his hiney before I take off again lol 
 Yea fuck that bull
You’re joking right? I spent at least 15 weeks on the Mist Noble. The most broken boss Fromsoft has created hands-down. I mean you’re supposed to jump ON TOP of him and stab him from the rafters. Ridiculous design - 0/10.
    You're right. Mist Noble is way too difficult, even for Sekiro. He's the hardest boss in the game and it's not even close
    Miyazaki put him in just to fuck you in the ass
    Isshin kind of balances it out though, he's way too easy, he needed at least 2 more phases, and don't get me started on Demon of Hatred.
It just caters to a different type of player. I have no rhythm so I find Sekiro insanely hard while I’ve beaten the rest of the dark souls/elden ring. It’s why I struggled through lies of P is partying is very difficult when you don’t have rhythm
    The real thing with Sekiro that I think a lot of people struggle with is that you can't just pad your stats like you can in the other games, it demands you meet it at the level you're at. A lot of people beat souls games by just grinding out stats and then steamrolling a boss while being overleveled- which, I'm not hating, it's a totally valid and fun playstyle, it's just not something you can really do in Sekiro. You can increase your HP by finding minibosses and stuff, but most players will be around the same level for most of the bosses.
    Unlike souls/elden ring you also just cant level up or gimmick build past the difficulty. It really showed that when my friends got stuck on either Genichiro or Owl
Well it's the only fromsoft game I struggled with 😅 rest were easy
Agree 100%. I tell my friends that Sekiro is the closest thing to a “perfect” game. I don’t mean fun for everyone, but that it sets rules, and follows them. Every death felt like it was my fault and motivated me to push through the hardest fights
The last part of your comment is what I had to say to those who found Metroid Dread too difficult. Obviously, there isn't the same expectation of difficulty with this series, but I think many players aren't used to adapting the way they play to what the game expects and keep hitting the same wall until they give up in frustration.

It's often by playing hard and above that you come to understand the subtleties of the combat system, because you need every advantage you can to progress.

With that said, I wouldn't blame anyone for giving up in the case of Sekiro, especially if they have limitations.
Yeah but in Dark Souls you can walk in overleveled and carve a boss up in like 10 hits. You also dodge a lot more and can avoid attacks due to invincibility while rolling.

Dark Souls becomes a cake walk if you make a pyromancer and throw flaming balls of death at enemies. There's like one boss in Dark Souls 3 that resists fire (Demon Prince) and that's a DLC boss. You can burn your way through the game with barely any risk to your character thanks largely to ranged attacks.

In Sekiro you need to get in and be aggressive. It's not easy coming from one game where you take your time, position yourself, calculate your attacks and then play one where speed and reaction are more important. You are also not invincible while dodging so you have one play style you have to get good at. It's also a strange mix of action and stealth so you spend much of your time sneaking about, learning how to quietly backstab your way through the game, only to go all out sword fighting when you get to the boss.

It's similar to Middlearth: Shadow of Mordor/War. But in those games you feel like a badass walking into a group of Uruk. In Sekiro, you feel overwhelmed if there are two or more enemies.
    One: the Sekiro dodge does have iframes. Not as many as DS, but saying it doesn't is factually incorrect. Maybe look up something before you say it

Two: Sekiro being a more aggressive game is exactly why it's got better combat and flow to the fights. In Sekiro, you the player gets to dictate the pace of the fight and can push the boss into a corner and into being defensive. This is impossible against DS and ER bosses. Those bosses will jump over you or do some stupid aoe move that literally forces you away. The bosses also are the ones setting the flow of the fight. You must be reactive in DS and ER. You must be proactive in Sekiro. It may not sound like much of a difference, but it actually is the very reason people say Sekiro has the perfect combat. And having stealth mechanics makes it so you can deal with the trash mobs and then go for the big guy. It brings a strategy to the game more than any DS or ER area can. Every trash mob can be one shot by stealth, and you can also use stealth to take away one hp bar of most mini bosses. Sometimes you might be able to stealth in DS or ER, but it always ends up being a narrow doorway technique situation. Lots of retreating and chipping away.

Three: overlevelling and using OP skills doesn't have anything to do with the design of bosses and encounters. It just means you can ignore any mechanics of the game. Sekiro doesn't let you do that because it wants you to play a certain way. If you don't like that play style, it's not the game for you.

Four: you are supposed to be the overpowered badass in the middle earth games. It makes sense that you can jump into a group of urukai and destroy all of them in a minute or less. Sekiro is not an overpowered character. He is badass, but the bosses he fights are much more powerful than him. He is the underdog and being caught unaware by several enemies is obviously going to go poorly for you. This is why stealth is so important
The twin monkey bossfight certainly is the complete opposite of fair. But yeah most bosses are insanely well designed
    A mortal blade or two and the girlyfriend goes down.. not near the difficulty solo monk was imo.
        Corrupted monk? She was easy as balls. She has a determined rythm that you follow.
            No not corrupted monk you candlestick. Read context... Monk short for monkey. Use contextual clues next time
                Oh yeah, sorry. I'm stupid.
    Wait till they're close together, stun them with fireworks, and then focus on the girlfriend who can be killed pretty quickly.  She really doesn't have much health.
    The twin monkey fight actually is a very unique gank boss for FS games.

Basically the AI of the brown Ape is 100% dependent on what the white Ape and you do.

In theory this makes it so that the two apes never overlap their attack patterns if you play it right. 

In practice you kinda have to know how the AI works to really achieve this. 

On a normal playthrough the fight is also very easy because they have very low stats.
Fire demon is garbage.

Whole game you go parrying attacks but you have to fight it traditionally which just doesnt work
    You're supposed to use the umbrella with fire upgrade. 

Without umbrella, the headless are also ridiculously hard.
i thought Demon of Hatred was more bs than even Malenia
    I thought so too. Until I found a way to beat him. You just have to play differently than before. I do still think it's unfair though. Much like Malenia, he uses mechanics from other games that aren't really prevalent in this one.
    Once you learn how to fight DoH, he's much more fair than Malenia's waterfowl garbage. DoH doesn't require absolute frame perfect dodging, just know what is coming and you can run or deflect
        Im sorry but Malenia does not require frame perfect dodging or anything close to it XD   
You can run to dodge the firs two and the third is a simple dodge into to avoid it fully.
Elden Ring does easily have the worst enemy, level, and game design of the series hands down
FromSoftware games don't have difficulty, they intentionally hamper players with absolutely horrendously designed control schemes and mechanics to make the game seem "difficult". They're not hard, just poorly designed.
    Sounds like you need to git gud
        Nah, I beat Dark Souls 1 and 2 with ease. In retrospect they just weren't fun. Sounds like you just need to grow up. 😉
            Git gud again
    You must be thinking of the dog shit controls in the Resident Evil series.  Control and mechanics in From Soft games are fine.  lol “poorly designed” - here’s your chum you silly troll.
        I don't think you understand what a troll is. You really think I'm just saying this stuff to say it? It was my genuine experience with those games. They were not fun to play and were not difficult.
            That’s fine if you truly didn’t enjoy the games, nothing wrong with that.  Saying they are poorly designed is clearly speaking out of your ass though.  The souls borne games have wracked up a ton of accolades for either game of the year, or ….. drum roll… GAME DESIGN.
    I can't say anything about other non-Sekiro FromSoftware games, but there wasn't anything wrong with Sekiro's controls and mechanics.
    Classic case of not getting gud
        Even though I beat them with ease? They're just not fun.
    Actual skill issue.
    They are smooth games on controllers, you are just bad.
        No, I beat them no problem, they just aren't good.
            Lying on the internet is fun
Have you done the mortal journey gauntlet? ;)
>double monkey fight and maybe the Demon of Hatred

Fire crackers for the Guardian Apes and Suzakus Lotus Umbrella for DoH

Demon of Hatred fight is an all time favourite of mine, next to Owl (Father) and Isshin I think Sekiro has some of the best and most memorable bosses ever
It's been multiple months, but I personally got stuck on some dude on a horse iirc.
    Yeah thats like one of the first major bosses. Gyoubu Oniwa Masataka (I believe is his name).


Most bosses have some tool that you can use to great effect. The firecracker tool will scare the horse and allow you hit him a bunch of time.


Have you played other From Soft games like Dark Souls or Bloodborne or even Elden Ring?

I ask because you can't really play Sekiro like those games. Sekiro is like a dance or a game of tug of war. You have to alternate on attacking to build up their posture (which will lead you to a death blow) and deflecting their attacks which will also build their posture.
        How could you forget "MY NAME IS GYOBU MASATAKA ONIWA!". A voice so loud it can blow out speakers
        I played Dark Souls for a bit. I got stuck at the Bell Gargoyles for like 8 hours and uninstalled tbh
Came here to say this
You press deflect as soon as the attack looks like it hits you, there's no timing per se
I hear that though. 


People have different priorities in the enjoyment of a video game.


Some seem to get off most on overcoming the greatest adversity. 


I don't generally like to stick on doing the same thing over and over and over until I am grandmaster of a specific mechanic.


I consider I most enjoy gaming for similar reasons to why a book lover may love reading an epic fantasy novel. To immerse myself in and get lost in new worlds. To explore and enjoy a journey. Add some fun gameplay and progression and I'm sold.


I dont love FromSoft games because of the difficulty. I love them because each one I've played shits all over most of the gaming industry in terms of quality gaming experiences to the bone. 


I don't have to be good at a game to recognise how good it is.
    I get that! And I’m glad you’re clear on what makes a game a game for you. Fromsoftware stuff is always on point!
Truer words have never been spoken
Last of us 2 on grounded is even worse, and I swear it breaks the enemy ai, and not in your favor. Numerous times I'd be spotted through walls while staying still, or hiding in tall grass I'd get spotted by an enemy across the map, which completely defeated the purpose of it being there. Enemies also become aimbots and have insane accuracy with any weapon at any range.
You got to the literal end of the game, and THEN the rhythmic feel became overwhelming?
    Well I was managing by almost brute forcing through the rhythmic aspects, spamming deflect and praying to come out ontop. I did not know how to nor did I really care to actually learn how to play to the rhythm. Hence why I struggled with enemies like ministry shinobi for the whole goddamn game. And not many of the endgame bosses have a pace close to isshin. I can deal with the pace of Corrupt monk. Genochiro is a skill check and was easy at that point (and was also not as fast as Isshin). 

Ashina elites and giraffes I got through by spamming deflect or magnet umbrella. 

I also was never able to figure out how to properly deflect lightning.

All those factors meant i could brute force and cheese through most things, but isshin was a goddamn wall. I nearly completely ragequit and dropped the game at Owl as it was.
        Sorry you didn’t enjoy it, I thought it was a phenomenal game.
Brother man isshin is the final boss you were right there 😅
    Owl and Isshin were each harder than almost all the other bosses combined on their own for me. And I was getting burnt out and annoyed with all the other annoying and hard bullshit that when I got to Isshin I just kind of felt like "yeah... nah"

I made it through most of the game never fully figuring out how to deflect lightning, and never actually playing to rhythm. Just spamming deflect. I don't feel like going through the tedium of learning it now
Okay dude, Sekiro isnt THAT hard.
Sorry your opinion is wrong
    Yknow, that means a lot to me, Nate Higgers
Press deflect as the attack hits you. Only attack when it's safe. Stick with it its worth it
Me with every Fromsoft game. I just don't bother anymore, I don't care enough about games to try to "git gud" anymore.
    I think the gameplay balance is just a bit worse than the other from soft games in terms of demanding a lot from the player mechanically right at the start when most souls games are easy for the first couple hours before really ramping up.
What boss did you have to walk 5 minutes to get to? It isn’t Dark Souls 1, I honestly can’t think of a boss fight that takes more than around a minute to get back to, and most take like 30 seconds or less.

The first enemy that I can think of that gives a lot of people trouble is Chained Ogre, and that’s like 15 seconds away from the bonfire assuming you take the time to take out the two enemies in front of him.

Maybe you mean Gyoubu? Again if you just run to the boss fight it takes like a minute.

I’m not going to say that Sekiro is perfect but the run backs to bosses are all pretty short.
u/Gorgii98 ask and you shall receive.
That's fair, I don't find games that refuse to challenge or kill me to be very engaging.
I don't mind dying a bunch in a game if the punishment for dying isn't that bad...

Like a boss can be tough if I start right back at the beginning of the battle but if I have to do the whole level over again...yeah fuck that
Sounds like you dont understand sekiro if you think it also doesnt focus on both. Most bosses require you to keep the pressure up by both attacking and parrying or their posture bar goes down quickly. Sekiro also has so many combat options with the shinobi tools, consumables and combat arts like what are on about?.
    Arts and Tools are just „Martial Arts“ and combat items in Wo Long aswell, but they can be cheesed and i played Sekiro. A handful of opponents require you to put on the pressure yourself or use items to make it an easier fight, but for 90%, being a parry god is what gets you over a fight
How?
Man that’s so weird.  I have the exact opposite experience.  I feel like the inputs and animations in sekiro are tighter than any other from game.  I feel much more in control of my character.
You probably had some horrendous input lag.
    Nah
What part of it is unfair? I mean specifically.
    I can’t pin point a certain part, the whole thing is unfair and pushes you towards either learning enemy animations or the way out. Player creativity is very limited ( I’m gonna get hate for this but it is what it is ) and seriously if you can’t think of 1 moment where you felt like it’s unfair this convo is over and pointless. Also I hated fighting all the headless bullshits. 
Never got to feel the satisfaction people talk about when beating the game also. Very average game.
        To each his own I guess. But I personally don’t find it unfair at all. I also don’t like the headless bosses, but I simply just skip them. Sekiro is definitely on my list of top 5 games I’ve ever played. I beat it 6 times and still counting.
        Its unfair cause it forces you to 'learn enemy animations'? (by which you mean actually know how an enemy attacks)
            It’s unfair because it sucks a$$. And it’s not fun. That’s it.
a bit of encouragement to push through a tough challenge can lead to a meaningful and rewarding victory.  The self-esteem boost from overcoming defeat can be a reward in itself.
    Not everyone enjoys the insane difficulty man. With how limited the amount of time many people have to play games, they’d rather not sink a ton of time into trying to beat a single boss that just frustrates them until they’re finally about to beat it after 10+ hours of trying to beat it. That just isn’t everyone’s idea of fun
That is an optional boss, u can just go a different way (look it up if you really can't find it)
They are fair games, minus occasional bs
    Usually barely even
But they aren't unfair, just challenging. The player is given all the tools they need to get trough the game, all except skill. If 'getting good' is too big of a burden, souls games let you upgrade the character to make the game easier
You are just bad/gen. No offense but I found this game WAY easier than bloodborne, elden ring, etc.
u/Gorgii98 ask and you shall receive.
After gyoubu or before?
    It was back when the game came out, so I can't remember. What I do remember is that I beat a big knight on a horse and then went into a castle/fortress. I tooled around in there for a bit before I ran into trouble.
        I know you're gonna guess this but i would really recommend giving it another shot, it's genuinely imo just a perfect game. It's challenging but fair and not even that hard if you use the tools the game gives you, honestly if you were able to beat the horse man you can beat the game.
            I've thought about it since then because I enjoyed it when I didn't find it to be frustrating. There's a decent shot that I'll give it another try eventually
Sekiro is literally a rhythm game. Literally, with no exaggeration. Listen to someone fight any of the humanoid bosses without looking, and you'll hear it clear as day.
    As a musician I've never found Sekiro to be inherently difficult, it solely functions on rhythm and pattern recognition
        How about you(or another musically capable human) play it, and I'll watch, and we'll both have fun.
        This is why Dancer of the Boreal Valley is the big wall for some DS3 players. Most DS3 bosses have a 4/4 tempo, and Dancer is a relatively slow-paced 3/4. Gael feels like playing polyrhythms with his cape. 

>!Pontiff is just bullshit, but he’s parryable and you have like a billion summons in the area!<
            Ds3 was easy af up until pontiff
Idk I used to study classical trombone at a high level and Sekiro does not feel like learning/mastering an instrument.
    It's a metaphor
    As a “high level” musician myself, I think it’s more than fair to say learning any skill has a lot in common with each other, and there’s plenty of similarities between sekiro and instruments. I also think you can apply wisdom gained from any skill to another, like with sekiro, you have to get up and try again when you die. Maybe you could pick the trombone up again.
        Thanks for actually responding in good faith instead of insulting me and speculating about my motivations for mentioning I used to play trombone. 

The only similarity I see is that mastering Sekiro takes repetition and a willingness to check your ego. Music is artistic, Sekiro is purely mechanical. There is some creativity involved in combat style, but not like in other FromSoft franchises such as Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and Armored Core. This is just my perspective. 

That was actually very sweet to encourage someone to pick up an instrument again, but I stopped because I no longer found pleasure in it. Like seriously that’s sweet. I’d rather spend more time consuming creative media or hanging out with my friends and family. I also didn’t fit into the community on vibes level, except within Norman Bolter’s studio. Nothing to do with failing, I was 20 years old gigging around Boston regularly and had professional connections in Atlanta, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. Plus, long-term job security has always been a problem for orchestral musicians in the United States, especially in the wake of COVID-19.
    Dude this comment is so obviously just to show off that you play an instrument lol cmon now
I actually just recently played this and hell house almost killed the game for me but thats kinda my fault. It’s the first time the game really tests your knowledge of the battle mechanics and it wasn’t till my 4th loss that I realized it was a magic based fight.
    I think I scraped by that fight and won despite my idiocy regarding the mechanics.
        Same, definitely not the case on hard mode however
That's how it works for me. I don't get better mid-session anymore. Need to go away, sleep, and come back better the next day. Maybe it's age, I don't know. Seems like I learned faster when I was young.
I feel you. I played Hollow Knight recently and what most people say is “an easy bossfight, 2 hours tops even for the greenest of noobs” was 1 - 2 weeks of gaming for me. But it didn’t matter. I just turned the game on, tried to beat it until I felt that today was not the day I’ll get through. And that was fine. Eventually I got better (at that one boss, I still suck), beat it and it felt great. 10 minutes later, another one comes my way and makes me busy for another week 😄🤷🏻‍♀️ Currently I’m wondering whether I should try Elden Ring. I know I’ll suck at it too, but it might be fun.
Genichiro is probably my all time favorite boss, hes extremely hard when you havent learnt the combat system yet but when it finally clicks hes one of the easiest bosses in game. I would argue that if you cant defeat his 1st phase with relative ease you havent fully learned the combat yet
Detlof? Or however you spell it. Yeah, he was a pain in the ass on death March. That stupid bat attack was some cheese
    Yea, horrible to go against but the bat attack was easy once I figured it out, basically run tf away, and right as they plume upwards dodge sideways. Works 100%
Probably got outglocked
We all know, hesitation is defeat
Parry this you filthy casual
    The neat part is that you can, and are actually expected to, parry his bullets. You get a tutorial popup literally at the first group of enemies in Ashina Outskirts
I was gonna make a joke about Glocks not letting you hesitate because they don't have an outer trigger safety, from my understanding, but it doesn't make sense cuz Glocks were designed for the shooter to be the safety and only prevent misfire from a fall or whatever......flashy thing this whole comment Agent K!!
yes don’t treat it like a souls game. it’s a rhythm game. as long as u aren’t rhythmically deaf u should be able to figure out the parry rhythm of every basic attack. for the ‘perilous’ attacks that ask u to either jump, run, or sidestep/mikiri (red death warning) those are pure reaction and pattern recognition checks which might be hard walls to pass for some though
    Lmfao if you say so, but I've turned the sound completely off one time cuz of my girl sleeping and my headset was dead, and I actually read the enemies body language better. If you just watch their chest and stomach, you'll know exactly when to parry ngl
    I have been thinking about coming back to the game after previous attempts at it. I think my Souls mindset has me thinking that exact statement of how can I parry a bulls charge or other attacks that aren't parry-able in other souls' games. Thank you, I'll keep this in mind and give in another shot and parry everything, haha.
The parrying is fine for me. It's the needing to jump that fucks me up. It seems so simple but so much of my muscle memory is built around parrying and dodging. I eventually brute forced my way through it but it was a time for sure.
Most souls games have parry windows of 12-20 frames but sekiro is 30 frames and generally much more forgiving with parries. Funny enough dodging does work in Sekiro but it's much riskier and more punishing, like parries in Dark Souls.
    I’ve brought this up tons of times.

Not only is it 30 active frame, but:        
- it has almost no start up frames.        
- it has no recovery frames at the end to punish.              
- it can lead immediately into a block so long as you don’t spam.

The Sekiro die hards won’t have any of it.        
There was a whole wave of people saying “Sekiro made me good at parrying finally!”         
When I would bring up those stats I would just get downvoted to hell. You may get good at parrying Sekiro, but partying in all the other souls games will remain far more difficult
        Yea, those worlds in the dark souls series are honestly really depressing...it would, indeed, be far more difficult to party in a place like that.
        that's actually interesting. I wouldn't argue that getting the timing of one attack's parry is harder in sekiro after reading that. 

But to be effective at parrying in sekiro for many bosses its not 1 parry --> stagger like dark souls. It's more like parrying groups of 5 attacks and mixing in different forms of dodging or running away in between to fully negate damage. 

So I can see why people push back, just not for the right reason, i think its the speed and need for back to back parries. I agree that it's harder in souls, but curious on your thoughts since I have played much more sekiro than early dark souls games
            Love to hear someone on the internet whi can voice a different opinion without getting overly heated. 

But yeah, so I’ve played nearly every game from fromsoftware (not DS2 and only like 3 of the armored cores).           
So coming from that experience I just figuratively substituted my roll button for the parry button and had no troubles at all. There are plenty of bosses in the souls series that have moves which require multiple well timed dodges allowing for a brief punish at the end. Go and read that sentence again, but change the word dodges for parries and see how well it fits for Sekiro.         
I think anyone with good rolling instincts from other souls games probably adapted very easily to Sekiro by just parrying instead of rolling.         
The only difference was that the parry was actually just way safer than a roll to be honest, mostly for the reasons I already mentioned.      

I agree that, in general, bosses are for sure faster in Sekiro and have more consecutive attacks… however just like dark souls you learn a kind of universal rhythm to dodging (parrying in Sekiro) that applies to all bosses.        
- consecutive dodges (immediate back to back with no pause).        
- roll catches (slight pause in the next dodge, as the attack was designed to catch you).

It’s the same feel in Sekiro, just a slightly faster rhythm. You either press it back to back, or add a slight pause if the attack was meant to catch you.

Anywayyyy, that felt like a tangent lol. Sorry adhd has me going off all over the place sometimes. Hope that kinda addressed what you were asking though.

(Edit: typos… I’m on mobile)
                delayed on my response but I appreciate that explanation. I very much enjoyed sekiro, ER, and AC6 and planned on actually playing through DS next

I got ass blasted in sekiro and did alright in ER. That perspective helps quite a bit in understanding why sekiro I felt the way it did playing through that first lol
                    Happy cake day!
        It's not 30 frames. This was early spread misinformation by fextralife which they corrected.

    That’s the thing, Sekiro you can parry basically everything. Dark souls you have to dodge and sometimes still get lucky, so once you figure out the pattern Sekiro is way easier imo

Those guys are meant for endgame. It is stupid where they're placed, It makes you think you can/should be able to beat them when you encounter them...

But yeah, wait until endgame when the amount of resources and money you have are no issue. You can even grind money indefinitely to buy infinite divine confetti if you want.

Those guys drop really good items for ng+, but are also entirely skippable... (I can't even remember if they drop prayer beads) definitely one of the weak points of the game, enemies that need consumables.
    None of them drop prayer beads.  The headless drop charms that work as infinite sugars, which you really don't need since you can just buy normal sugars.  There's one that there's no corresponding sugar for and increases your damage by alot, but it also takes away half your maximum health while using it.
        There is a corresponding sugar for the Yashariku buff.
If you're talking about headless literally just skip him. Completely optional. Everything else is doable no items
You know they're all optional right?
The only bosses that you need divine confetti for are the Headless and Warrior Shichimen.  All of them are optional, and you can hold off on doing them until after you've unlocked being able to purchase unlimited divine confetti from merchants.  Just progress the story until you've killed the Corrupted Monk that guards Fountainhead Palace late in the game.
Using a consumable is not cheese. The only one I would consider cheese in all of the games I've played was the God Arrow (or whatever) from Dragons Dogma that was basically a 1-hit kill on anything. Bad take.
    They said using a consumable OR cheese. Not that consumables are cheesing.
        I consume cheese
        Sometimes they are, too!

Like cheesing the capra demon with firebombs over the wall lmao.
headless are ass I don't blame you they suck better to just leave them for endgame
Which boss, Headless or Guardian ape? At one point in the game you can unlock the Divine conffeti and buy it from one merchant (i can't remember his location) :D 
I hated the Headless bosses, but near the end of the game you encounter two of them under the water, i was like wtfff, can you make this any more painful than it is🤣 but i beat them all, you can do it too!

>blocking and parrying are the best ways to fight enemies when every part of you is saying “there is no way you could party that,”

It is this, one hundred percent.

People seem to focus on dodging too much, but the reality is the game wants you to clash swords.
The Bull is the first real test of faith because your instincts are -screaming- to dodge but if you block and parry it, the fight suddenly makes a lot more sense.
    Damn and here I was just sprinting around the arena and chipping away at his health by getting behind or to the side of it until it died.
This is probably why I hated it so much. 

I'm that guy who never used a shield in dark souls serie. 
I just roll and roll, very well. 

So my brain couldn't understand that this was a different game, and I kept my habits.
    And again, even if you’re unfamiliar with the souls series, every natural instinct screams at you to dodge instead of block.

Gyoubu can be handled without taking damage pretty easily, but nobody would ever think you could block a weapon/guy 2-3 times your size, *especially* one charging you down on horseback. Yet he’s one of the more plausible enemies you can block.
Pinky finger
I would be a guitar hero player still if the game and controller weren’t impossible to find for a reasonable price.
    I have two modded ones with mechanical frets lol found both of them at a thrift store took out the original parts and put  arduino kit in there.
Yeah it's literally not hard. You just have to actually learn how to play it
Truly. It's still the only Fromsoft game that I've gotten 100% completion on. Also, each NG+ gets easier and easier, which ime is contrary to the SoulsBorne games.
Rest in peace ZP, long live FR.
    *skrrrrrrrt*

What happened to ZP?!
        The company that owned ZP basically wanted to fire everyone that wasnt him. He said fuck you, left with them and now the whole crew runs a channel named "second wind"

Tldr Zero Punctuation is now Fully Ramblomatic
            Ah, thats good to know. Is this new "Fully Ramblomatic" show the same sort of of format and style as ZP or is it something new entirely?
                Its nearly identical, but black and red colored and a new theme song.
            Yahtzee is a real one for that.
        Don't panic. He's not dead, he just doesn't work there anymore.
Fair enough but disregarding what title this quote was referring to, would you at least agree with it? Does a game just stop being challenging and just fucks you about instead
    Yes, of course. And why I will never finish Sekiro. Not fun.
        *Not fun for you
            Um....duh?
Best way to put it
The major hurdle is figuring out that parrying is your best friend, even if you instinctively feel like you shouldn’t be able to do so with most things.

Other things include that you pretty much *need* to read item descriptions to beat some bosses, dragonrot, due to a slight mistranslation/misinformation, isn’t anywhere near as bad as you think it is (though I still will say having a punishment for dying in a game designed to kill you is honestly pushing it); and dodging isn’t anywhere near as good as you think it would be, but jumping can and will save you more than you would think.
    Can… can you parry the butterfly lady?…. I can not get past her
Yeah after i beat ishhin i fight him as a past-time once in a while lol
Second playthrough I didn’t even die until Guardian Ape
Oh i know it does lol, I just don't like to think about it after I get squad wiped😅😅
I beat Ninja Gaiden (NES). I could not beat Sekiro.
Seriously. NES Ninja Gaidens were tough as hell, but doable. The mid-2000 NGs were pure bullshit. 

Still stuck on Sword Saint 🤦🏻‍♂️
The bull fight was bull shit (pun intended).
I hated the bull too until I realized I could just parry his charge for the win every time
    As soon as I learned you could parry that, the bull was a cakewalk lol
I have to fight him unlike any other battle lol. Im just sprinting in circles hoping to catch a spinning cut on his hiney before I take off again lol 
 Yea fuck that bull
You're right. Mist Noble is way too difficult, even for Sekiro. He's the hardest boss in the game and it's not even close
Miyazaki put him in just to fuck you in the ass
Isshin kind of balances it out though, he's way too easy, he needed at least 2 more phases, and don't get me started on Demon of Hatred.
The real thing with Sekiro that I think a lot of people struggle with is that you can't just pad your stats like you can in the other games, it demands you meet it at the level you're at. A lot of people beat souls games by just grinding out stats and then steamrolling a boss while being overleveled- which, I'm not hating, it's a totally valid and fun playstyle, it's just not something you can really do in Sekiro. You can increase your HP by finding minibosses and stuff, but most players will be around the same level for most of the bosses.
Unlike souls/elden ring you also just cant level up or gimmick build past the difficulty. It really showed that when my friends got stuck on either Genichiro or Owl
One: the Sekiro dodge does have iframes. Not as many as DS, but saying it doesn't is factually incorrect. Maybe look up something before you say it

Two: Sekiro being a more aggressive game is exactly why it's got better combat and flow to the fights. In Sekiro, you the player gets to dictate the pace of the fight and can push the boss into a corner and into being defensive. This is impossible against DS and ER bosses. Those bosses will jump over you or do some stupid aoe move that literally forces you away. The bosses also are the ones setting the flow of the fight. You must be reactive in DS and ER. You must be proactive in Sekiro. It may not sound like much of a difference, but it actually is the very reason people say Sekiro has the perfect combat. And having stealth mechanics makes it so you can deal with the trash mobs and then go for the big guy. It brings a strategy to the game more than any DS or ER area can. Every trash mob can be one shot by stealth, and you can also use stealth to take away one hp bar of most mini bosses. Sometimes you might be able to stealth in DS or ER, but it always ends up being a narrow doorway technique situation. Lots of retreating and chipping away.

Three: overlevelling and using OP skills doesn't have anything to do with the design of bosses and encounters. It just means you can ignore any mechanics of the game. Sekiro doesn't let you do that because it wants you to play a certain way. If you don't like that play style, it's not the game for you.

Four: you are supposed to be the overpowered badass in the middle earth games. It makes sense that you can jump into a group of urukai and destroy all of them in a minute or less. Sekiro is not an overpowered character. He is badass, but the bosses he fights are much more powerful than him. He is the underdog and being caught unaware by several enemies is obviously going to go poorly for you. This is why stealth is so important
A mortal blade or two and the girlyfriend goes down.. not near the difficulty solo monk was imo.
    Corrupted monk? She was easy as balls. She has a determined rythm that you follow.
        No not corrupted monk you candlestick. Read context... Monk short for monkey. Use contextual clues next time
            Oh yeah, sorry. I'm stupid.
Wait till they're close together, stun them with fireworks, and then focus on the girlfriend who can be killed pretty quickly.  She really doesn't have much health.
The twin monkey fight actually is a very unique gank boss for FS games.

Basically the AI of the brown Ape is 100% dependent on what the white Ape and you do.

In theory this makes it so that the two apes never overlap their attack patterns if you play it right. 

In practice you kinda have to know how the AI works to really achieve this. 

On a normal playthrough the fight is also very easy because they have very low stats.
You're supposed to use the umbrella with fire upgrade. 

Without umbrella, the headless are also ridiculously hard.
I thought so too. Until I found a way to beat him. You just have to play differently than before. I do still think it's unfair though. Much like Malenia, he uses mechanics from other games that aren't really prevalent in this one.
Once you learn how to fight DoH, he's much more fair than Malenia's waterfowl garbage. DoH doesn't require absolute frame perfect dodging, just know what is coming and you can run or deflect
    Im sorry but Malenia does not require frame perfect dodging or anything close to it XD   
You can run to dodge the firs two and the third is a simple dodge into to avoid it fully.
Sounds like you need to git gud
    Nah, I beat Dark Souls 1 and 2 with ease. In retrospect they just weren't fun. Sounds like you just need to grow up. 😉
        Git gud again
You must be thinking of the dog shit controls in the Resident Evil series.  Control and mechanics in From Soft games are fine.  lol “poorly designed” - here’s your chum you silly troll.
    I don't think you understand what a troll is. You really think I'm just saying this stuff to say it? It was my genuine experience with those games. They were not fun to play and were not difficult.
        That’s fine if you truly didn’t enjoy the games, nothing wrong with that.  Saying they are poorly designed is clearly speaking out of your ass though.  The souls borne games have wracked up a ton of accolades for either game of the year, or ….. drum roll… GAME DESIGN.
I can't say anything about other non-Sekiro FromSoftware games, but there wasn't anything wrong with Sekiro's controls and mechanics.
Classic case of not getting gud
    Even though I beat them with ease? They're just not fun.
Actual skill issue.
They are smooth games on controllers, you are just bad.
    No, I beat them no problem, they just aren't good.
        Lying on the internet is fun
Yeah thats like one of the first major bosses. Gyoubu Oniwa Masataka (I believe is his name).


Most bosses have some tool that you can use to great effect. The firecracker tool will scare the horse and allow you hit him a bunch of time.


Have you played other From Soft games like Dark Souls or Bloodborne or even Elden Ring?

I ask because you can't really play Sekiro like those games. Sekiro is like a dance or a game of tug of war. You have to alternate on attacking to build up their posture (which will lead you to a death blow) and deflecting their attacks which will also build their posture.
    How could you forget "MY NAME IS GYOBU MASATAKA ONIWA!". A voice so loud it can blow out speakers
    I played Dark Souls for a bit. I got stuck at the Bell Gargoyles for like 8 hours and uninstalled tbh
I get that! And I’m glad you’re clear on what makes a game a game for you. Fromsoftware stuff is always on point!
Well I was managing by almost brute forcing through the rhythmic aspects, spamming deflect and praying to come out ontop. I did not know how to nor did I really care to actually learn how to play to the rhythm. Hence why I struggled with enemies like ministry shinobi for the whole goddamn game. And not many of the endgame bosses have a pace close to isshin. I can deal with the pace of Corrupt monk. Genochiro is a skill check and was easy at that point (and was also not as fast as Isshin). 

Ashina elites and giraffes I got through by spamming deflect or magnet umbrella. 

I also was never able to figure out how to properly deflect lightning.

All those factors meant i could brute force and cheese through most things, but isshin was a goddamn wall. I nearly completely ragequit and dropped the game at Owl as it was.
    Sorry you didn’t enjoy it, I thought it was a phenomenal game.
Owl and Isshin were each harder than almost all the other bosses combined on their own for me. And I was getting burnt out and annoyed with all the other annoying and hard bullshit that when I got to Isshin I just kind of felt like "yeah... nah"

I made it through most of the game never fully figuring out how to deflect lightning, and never actually playing to rhythm. Just spamming deflect. I don't feel like going through the tedium of learning it now
Yknow, that means a lot to me, Nate Higgers
I think the gameplay balance is just a bit worse than the other from soft games in terms of demanding a lot from the player mechanically right at the start when most souls games are easy for the first couple hours before really ramping up.
Arts and Tools are just „Martial Arts“ and combat items in Wo Long aswell, but they can be cheesed and i played Sekiro. A handful of opponents require you to put on the pressure yourself or use items to make it an easier fight, but for 90%, being a parry god is what gets you over a fight
Nah
I can’t pin point a certain part, the whole thing is unfair and pushes you towards either learning enemy animations or the way out. Player creativity is very limited ( I’m gonna get hate for this but it is what it is ) and seriously if you can’t think of 1 moment where you felt like it’s unfair this convo is over and pointless. Also I hated fighting all the headless bullshits. 
Never got to feel the satisfaction people talk about when beating the game also. Very average game.
    To each his own I guess. But I personally don’t find it unfair at all. I also don’t like the headless bosses, but I simply just skip them. Sekiro is definitely on my list of top 5 games I’ve ever played. I beat it 6 times and still counting.
    Its unfair cause it forces you to 'learn enemy animations'? (by which you mean actually know how an enemy attacks)
        It’s unfair because it sucks a$$. And it’s not fun. That’s it.
Not everyone enjoys the insane difficulty man. With how limited the amount of time many people have to play games, they’d rather not sink a ton of time into trying to beat a single boss that just frustrates them until they’re finally about to beat it after 10+ hours of trying to beat it. That just isn’t everyone’s idea of fun
Usually barely even
It was back when the game came out, so I can't remember. What I do remember is that I beat a big knight on a horse and then went into a castle/fortress. I tooled around in there for a bit before I ran into trouble.
    I know you're gonna guess this but i would really recommend giving it another shot, it's genuinely imo just a perfect game. It's challenging but fair and not even that hard if you use the tools the game gives you, honestly if you were able to beat the horse man you can beat the game.
        I've thought about it since then because I enjoyed it when I didn't find it to be frustrating. There's a decent shot that I'll give it another try eventually
As a musician I've never found Sekiro to be inherently difficult, it solely functions on rhythm and pattern recognition
    How about you(or another musically capable human) play it, and I'll watch, and we'll both have fun.
    This is why Dancer of the Boreal Valley is the big wall for some DS3 players. Most DS3 bosses have a 4/4 tempo, and Dancer is a relatively slow-paced 3/4. Gael feels like playing polyrhythms with his cape. 

>!Pontiff is just bullshit, but he’s parryable and you have like a billion summons in the area!<
        Ds3 was easy af up until pontiff
It's a metaphor
As a “high level” musician myself, I think it’s more than fair to say learning any skill has a lot in common with each other, and there’s plenty of similarities between sekiro and instruments. I also think you can apply wisdom gained from any skill to another, like with sekiro, you have to get up and try again when you die. Maybe you could pick the trombone up again.
    Thanks for actually responding in good faith instead of insulting me and speculating about my motivations for mentioning I used to play trombone. 

The only similarity I see is that mastering Sekiro takes repetition and a willingness to check your ego. Music is artistic, Sekiro is purely mechanical. There is some creativity involved in combat style, but not like in other FromSoft franchises such as Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and Armored Core. This is just my perspective. 

That was actually very sweet to encourage someone to pick up an instrument again, but I stopped because I no longer found pleasure in it. Like seriously that’s sweet. I’d rather spend more time consuming creative media or hanging out with my friends and family. I also didn’t fit into the community on vibes level, except within Norman Bolter’s studio. Nothing to do with failing, I was 20 years old gigging around Boston regularly and had professional connections in Atlanta, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. Plus, long-term job security has always been a problem for orchestral musicians in the United States, especially in the wake of COVID-19.
Dude this comment is so obviously just to show off that you play an instrument lol cmon now
I think I scraped by that fight and won despite my idiocy regarding the mechanics.
    Same, definitely not the case on hard mode however
Yea, horrible to go against but the bat attack was easy once I figured it out, basically run tf away, and right as they plume upwards dodge sideways. Works 100%
The neat part is that you can, and are actually expected to, parry his bullets. You get a tutorial popup literally at the first group of enemies in Ashina Outskirts
Lmfao if you say so, but I've turned the sound completely off one time cuz of my girl sleeping and my headset was dead, and I actually read the enemies body language better. If you just watch their chest and stomach, you'll know exactly when to parry ngl
I have been thinking about coming back to the game after previous attempts at it. I think my Souls mindset has me thinking that exact statement of how can I parry a bulls charge or other attacks that aren't parry-able in other souls' games. Thank you, I'll keep this in mind and give in another shot and parry everything, haha.
I’ve brought this up tons of times.

Not only is it 30 active frame, but:        
- it has almost no start up frames.        
- it has no recovery frames at the end to punish.              
- it can lead immediately into a block so long as you don’t spam.

The Sekiro die hards won’t have any of it.        
There was a whole wave of people saying “Sekiro made me good at parrying finally!”         
When I would bring up those stats I would just get downvoted to hell. You may get good at parrying Sekiro, but partying in all the other souls games will remain far more difficult
    Yea, those worlds in the dark souls series are honestly really depressing...it would, indeed, be far more difficult to party in a place like that.
    that's actually interesting. I wouldn't argue that getting the timing of one attack's parry is harder in sekiro after reading that. 

But to be effective at parrying in sekiro for many bosses its not 1 parry --> stagger like dark souls. It's more like parrying groups of 5 attacks and mixing in different forms of dodging or running away in between to fully negate damage. 

So I can see why people push back, just not for the right reason, i think its the speed and need for back to back parries. I agree that it's harder in souls, but curious on your thoughts since I have played much more sekiro than early dark souls games
        Love to hear someone on the internet whi can voice a different opinion without getting overly heated. 

But yeah, so I’ve played nearly every game from fromsoftware (not DS2 and only like 3 of the armored cores).           
So coming from that experience I just figuratively substituted my roll button for the parry button and had no troubles at all. There are plenty of bosses in the souls series that have moves which require multiple well timed dodges allowing for a brief punish at the end. Go and read that sentence again, but change the word dodges for parries and see how well it fits for Sekiro.         
I think anyone with good rolling instincts from other souls games probably adapted very easily to Sekiro by just parrying instead of rolling.         
The only difference was that the parry was actually just way safer than a roll to be honest, mostly for the reasons I already mentioned.      

I agree that, in general, bosses are for sure faster in Sekiro and have more consecutive attacks… however just like dark souls you learn a kind of universal rhythm to dodging (parrying in Sekiro) that applies to all bosses.        
- consecutive dodges (immediate back to back with no pause).        
- roll catches (slight pause in the next dodge, as the attack was designed to catch you).

It’s the same feel in Sekiro, just a slightly faster rhythm. You either press it back to back, or add a slight pause if the attack was meant to catch you.

Anywayyyy, that felt like a tangent lol. Sorry adhd has me going off all over the place sometimes. Hope that kinda addressed what you were asking though.

(Edit: typos… I’m on mobile)
            delayed on my response but I appreciate that explanation. I very much enjoyed sekiro, ER, and AC6 and planned on actually playing through DS next

I got ass blasted in sekiro and did alright in ER. That perspective helps quite a bit in understanding why sekiro I felt the way it did playing through that first lol
                Happy cake day!

That’s the thing, Sekiro you can parry basically everything. Dark souls you have to dodge and sometimes still get lucky, so once you figure out the pattern Sekiro is way easier imo

None of them drop prayer beads.  The headless drop charms that work as infinite sugars, which you really don't need since you can just buy normal sugars.  There's one that there's no corresponding sugar for and increases your damage by alot, but it also takes away half your maximum health while using it.
    There is a corresponding sugar for the Yashariku buff.
They said using a consumable OR cheese. Not that consumables are cheesing.
    I consume cheese
    Sometimes they are, too!

Like cheesing the capra demon with firebombs over the wall lmao.
Damn and here I was just sprinting around the arena and chipping away at his health by getting behind or to the side of it until it died.
And again, even if you’re unfamiliar with the souls series, every natural instinct screams at you to dodge instead of block.

Gyoubu can be handled without taking damage pretty easily, but nobody would ever think you could block a weapon/guy 2-3 times your size, *especially* one charging you down on horseback. Yet he’s one of the more plausible enemies you can block.
I have two modded ones with mechanical frets lol found both of them at a thrift store took out the original parts and put  arduino kit in there.
*skrrrrrrrt*

What happened to ZP?!
    The company that owned ZP basically wanted to fire everyone that wasnt him. He said fuck you, left with them and now the whole crew runs a channel named "second wind"

Tldr Zero Punctuation is now Fully Ramblomatic
        Ah, thats good to know. Is this new "Fully Ramblomatic" show the same sort of of format and style as ZP or is it something new entirely?
            Its nearly identical, but black and red colored and a new theme song.
        Yahtzee is a real one for that.
    Don't panic. He's not dead, he just doesn't work there anymore.
Yes, of course. And why I will never finish Sekiro. Not fun.
    *Not fun for you
        Um....duh?
Can… can you parry the butterfly lady?…. I can not get past her
As soon as I learned you could parry that, the bull was a cakewalk lol
Corrupted monk? She was easy as balls. She has a determined rythm that you follow.
    No not corrupted monk you candlestick. Read context... Monk short for monkey. Use contextual clues next time
        Oh yeah, sorry. I'm stupid.
Im sorry but Malenia does not require frame perfect dodging or anything close to it XD   
You can run to dodge the firs two and the third is a simple dodge into to avoid it fully.
Nah, I beat Dark Souls 1 and 2 with ease. In retrospect they just weren't fun. Sounds like you just need to grow up. 😉
    Git gud again
I don't think you understand what a troll is. You really think I'm just saying this stuff to say it? It was my genuine experience with those games. They were not fun to play and were not difficult.
    That’s fine if you truly didn’t enjoy the games, nothing wrong with that.  Saying they are poorly designed is clearly speaking out of your ass though.  The souls borne games have wracked up a ton of accolades for either game of the year, or ….. drum roll… GAME DESIGN.
Even though I beat them with ease? They're just not fun.
No, I beat them no problem, they just aren't good.
    Lying on the internet is fun
How could you forget "MY NAME IS GYOBU MASATAKA ONIWA!". A voice so loud it can blow out speakers
I played Dark Souls for a bit. I got stuck at the Bell Gargoyles for like 8 hours and uninstalled tbh
Sorry you didn’t enjoy it, I thought it was a phenomenal game.
To each his own I guess. But I personally don’t find it unfair at all. I also don’t like the headless bosses, but I simply just skip them. Sekiro is definitely on my list of top 5 games I’ve ever played. I beat it 6 times and still counting.
