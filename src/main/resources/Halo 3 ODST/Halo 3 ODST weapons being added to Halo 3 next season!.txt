[[Halo 3 ODST weapons being added to Halo 3 next season!]]





Trilogy Characters and Multiplayer Spartans/Elites for Firefight would be cool too.
    Here's to hoping. They did say updated customization for Halo 3: ODST
        Character Customization is coming. Sergeant Johnson!
        I'm hoping to see Reach's Elites get better customization. I want to be able to swap out the helmet, chest, shoulders, wrists, and legs independently. Would probably go with Zealot helmet, Zealot chest, Major shoulders, Officer legs, Minor wrists.
            Am I the only one who finds it impossible to get into invasion matches?
                Nope, I can't get into one for the life of me
                You're not the only one. They should remove it from competitive.
        With Season 1 being Reach, Season 2 being CE, Season 3 being 3 and ODST, Season 4 being 4 I wonder if Season 5 will be Halo 2 Anniversary focused coming with more remastered maps.
        How about playing as odsts in halo 3 multiplayer.
    Honestly I'd settle for being able to play as Elites in Reach's Firefight
        You can but only in the Covenant side
        You can in the versus mode
So the Brute Plasma Rifle. M7S, and M6C/SOCOM are coming to Halo 3.  

I wonder if Halo 3 weapons are going to be added to ODST (besides the Battle Rifle). Like the Plasma Rifle and Sentinel Beam for example.

It would also be amazing to see the unique assets introduced with ODST be ported over into Halo 3’s Forge.
    I wonder if the Brute Plasma Rifle will actually be added since I’m pretty sure it’s just a straight reskin in ODST since the base plasma rifle was buffed between Halos 2 and 3.
        If you zoom in on the picture with the SMG, it's right there
            That might just be a plasma rifle with a skin on it though. The CE plasma rifle has a Brute skin this season, but it’s not the actual gun.
                Not a skin, it's shooting red bolts , would be blue if it was just a reskin
                    But that still doesn’t mean it’s the original brute plasma rifle because that had a different fire rate from the blue one. 

It could be functionally the same as the blue rifle, but have the appearance of the the red one. We can’t tell from a picture though.
        I believe that Brute Plasma rifled have a faster fire rate than the standard blue.
            Only in Halo 2. In ODST it’s just a reskin of the regular plasma rifle.
                Somehow, I don’t believe that to be true. I’ll be right back.

EDIT: Son of a bitch, you’re right!
            Yes
        It will most likely just be a skin since the elite plasma rifle was just reskinned as a brute plasma rifle for ODST. I just hope they change the plasma bolts to red when you have the skin on because they didn't do that for the bolts in CE.
            you can see in the bottom image that the plasma rifle is indeed shooting red bolts, it’s not a skin it’s the actual red plasma rifle
                Thanks for pointing it out. I didn't notice he was even using a plasma rifle. It's better as a separate option despite the fact that it was just a skin in ODST.
            Except the fire rate was modified. Exactly like the original Halo 2 Brute Plasma Rifle.
                That's all the BPR ever was-- faster firing plasma rifle, which thus overheated quicker
                No it wasn't. In Halo 2 the brute plasma has a higher fire rate than the elite plasma rifle. In ODST they just reskinned the elite plasma rifle from Halo 3. It has the same stats, they didn't bother changing it. Even the old bunige.net stats say that. 

http://halo.bungie.net/projects/odst/guide.aspx

http://halo.bungie.net/projects/halo3/content.aspx?link=h3plasmarifle

Interestingly, the brute plasma rifle description for ODST still says it does more damage and has a higher fire rate which is true in halo 2 and in lore but not in gameplay for ODST as the stats are the same as 3.
    Which unique assets?
    Now only if we could fix Forge since it was broken in the newest release...

weapon skins too!
Is this legit?
    yup

https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/mcc-development-update-july-2020
AWWW SNAP 

MOTHA FUCKA SILENCE SMG
This makes me happy! I'm glad 343 aren't putting MCC on PC then ignoring it/each game. They're making new modes, now they're adding skins and taking guns from other games and putting them into these games, it's nice, it's giving old games some new variety. 

You can argue and say that they should keep these games the way that they are, but I mean how can you say no to new content? We all crave new content eventually. While I absolutely love Halo 3, there just isn't anything to chase after and I've become bored rather quick.
    [deleted]
        >	Now if we ended up in a situation where you couldn't play a matchmade game of H3 without seeing the ODST pistol and SMG on the map, that's a far more legitimate complaint.

Well I personally would be okay with something like a randomized weapon pool system. Sometimes you'll get the H3 Magnum and the H3 SMG, sometimes you'll get the ODST Pistol and the ODST SMG.

The game is 13 years old after all, would seeing a different set of weapons really piss you off that much?
            [deleted]
                Idk, I guess to each their own, I still wouldn't mind that. I would only mind that if the ODST weapons are worse than the original H3 weapons. But I've used these weapons for so many years that I'd be okay with the idea. Not permanent of course, but say like a whole week all the normal weapons except for the BR and AR were swapped with ODST weapons, I'd be cool with it.
If we get Halo 3 ODST armor customization in Halo 3 that would be sick
    I'd love to have Romeo's helmet and Mickey's helmet. Maybe they can add the ODST chest piece to 3 also.
Imagine the Brutes using brute plasma rifles instead plasma rifles
    I was always wondered why they took it out. It'd be very cool to see
    Usually when people start their sentences with "imagine" it's a negative so is this meant to be negative? Lol because I love the brute plasma rifle and was hoping we would get it as skin for Halo 3 and looks like we will judging by the photo :) what's weird is the brutes use elite plasma rifles in 3

Edit: not sure why I got downvoted for asking a genuine question lol
        How the hell do you see his comment as negative? And you got downvoted because your whole comment reeks of r/iamverysmart
            Nah this comment isn't riamverysmart material at all. It was a genuine question and I was expressing my like of the brute plasma rifle. I wasn't attacking him or anything. Literally just asking him for clarification. Also people pretty much always use the "imagine" as a negative in that context which is why I was genuinely asking so nice try. 

The guy even said I don't know which is fine lol it was just a question if he meant that to be negative or not. That is all.
        Imagine all the people, living life in peace.

Imagine everyone always had enough to eat.

Imagine getting to ride a dragon or a unicorn.

Imagine a new Jet Set Radio.

Imagine Half-Life 3 actually coming out.

Imagine having the Force.

Yep, all sentences that start with the word imagine are negative.
            You don't get what I'm saying. I've only ever seen it used on the forums or anywhere in a negative fashion towards someone else's actions when people say for example:

Imagine thinking you're tougher than the sun? In response to someone who called me a pussy for not wearing sunscreen.

Imagine thinking you can breathe in space? 

Imagine thinking this is r/iamverysmartmaterial

Imagine thinking you can take on the whole empire yourself?

The half life 3 one you used just proves my point. You would say that as negative to someone who was had some overly wishful thinking of half life 3 coming out. Btw it is coming out eventually.

I was just asking for clarification of he meant it as a negative or not. I wasn't attacking him or anything lol chill out
        I don't know
            Thanks
Yessss
They should consider patching BRs into the ODST campaign
    I'm wondering if that's what the "redacted" was when they were talking about adding something to ODST firefight
        Flood Firefight. Please be Flood Firefight. I know modders managed to get Flood Firefight working on Xbox 360 ODST, surely it could be done for ODST PC.
            Oh holy shit, I didn't even think about that.
            And when you die, your corpse should get reanimated with buffed stats. Please.
            Holy Jesus, do I need this in my life.
            For some reason my mind jumped to vehicles, or friendly AI
        The Battle Rifle showed up un-redacted in [one of the pictures](https://content.halocdn.com/media/Default/community/MCC/odst2-e8ca6724ae0c440aacba7eda14076991.jpg), so I don't think it's that.
            Wow.
        Golf club?
        I'm hoping vehicles.
            The pic below shows that you can spawn a gauss hog so maybe it's something else.
    Maybe in Firefight, but I wouldn't like it if they put it in campaign. The BR was kept out purposely to keep the SMG and Magnum more relevant on their own. 

Perhaps if they included it with a skull that also let the Energy Sword, regular Plasma Rifle, H3 Magnum and unsilenced SMG spawn, that'd be cool.
        I really hope they add those weapons and the sentinel beam.
            Sentinel beam would be a bit much. Other stuff was kept out for balancing reasons but there is zero reason whatsoever for a sentinel beam to show up in ODST
                Reason: fun?
                    ...did you really consider the sentinel beam fun? Always hated it.
                        I love constant beam weapons in any game. The X-43 MIKE was my go-to in Crysis 2/3.
                > there is zero reason whatsoever for a sentinel beam to show up in ODST 

Well, there's at least one rationalization for it's addition. Covenant are excavating the Forerunner portal generator beneath Kenya, right? Maybe some unfortunate Jiralhanae shipmaster put just a bit too much power into their excavation beam and ended up drawing Sentinel aggro.
                    I don’t think sentinels were present in the ark portal mainframe? At least as far as Hunters in the Dark (one of the few novels delving into the portal) indicates, the portal was left with no caretakers or guardians.
                        D'oh. Forgot about that. 

Which is still quite weird.
                    I don't think they started doing that until part of the way through Halo 3, no? ODST wouldn't be completed by then.
                        They start the glassing process in ODST. That’s what you see when the first ships arrive during Coastal Highway.
                It would just be an option for custom firefight so I don't see a problem with that. It's just another weapon from Halo 3's sandbox that got left out of ODST obviously because campaign takes place on Earth. It would just be for fun. Besides that people want a bunch of flood firefight which would be cool and probably easier to import since it's the same engine as H3.
            Having a sentinel beam in halo 3 ODST would make absolutely no sense. How would you even go about implementing it?
                The same way they're implementing the Battle Rifle, adding it as an option in the Firefight menu. How else?
                ODST uses the same engine as Halo 3 so it would be easy to import same way their putting the battle rifle, silenced smg, and automag into halo 3.
                    But I'm not talking about ease of implementation. It simply wouldn't make sense for there to be a forerunner weapon being used in the streets of Mombasa.
                        You also don't respawn when you die, I doubt Buck was actually picking stuff out of a monkeys hair and eating it, there's no reason for having no BR, etc etc etc. Make it a skull that adds H3 weapons, who cares whats canon then. People wanna have fun.
        The silenced SMG and Magnum made sense during the stealth-oriented Mombasa Streets segments but I don't see why there couldn't be BRs during the flashbacks
            According to bungie it was for gameplay reasons like making the smg and pistol more relevant. They didn't want the BR to be the one size fits all weapon. I mean it's practically a power weapon. That's one reason why it got nerfed from halo 2 to be less dominant in 3's multiplayer. 

Lore wise it's a little odd considering everybody had BRs in New Mombassa but all of the sudden nobody has a BR. At least the BR came out in one of the cutscenes as an easter egg.
        Battle rifle is confirmed for ODST firefight
        [deleted]
            I was playing through CE on legendary this past week, and when I got to the second half of the game I had a shotgun on me almost always. I could have picked something else up, but why would I? The shotgun is the best weapon to have in the second half of the game. Get the magnum or sniper as your other weapon and you have the most effective combo for the game. Why would I pick up anything else unless I am out of ammo?
            An interesting note is that more options is not always better when it comes to a hand crafted user experience.

If given the option some players will optimize the fun out of a game for themselves.
    The whole game was designed to work with the Pistol and the SMG in mind. And when you think about it they are the BR but split in 2.
Now how about Halo 3 ODST forge mode
    Adding some kind of PvE element to Forge is one of my dreams for Halo, but that would probably be an Infinite-only feature at best. As someone with experience modding Left 4 Dead, getting enemies to move around a new environment correctly is 100 times more work than you'd expect from the outside looking in.
    Unlikely. The issue with Forging Firefight (or even Campaign) in these titles is the AI navmesh.  I think at best you'd be limited to moving around dynamic objects like crates that the AI already know how to get around/push away from themselves, but it won't be possible to make entire new maps or add new buildings/block off sections because the AI won't have a navmesh to deal with actual geometry. They would see a Block, Double just like any other dynamic object and just permanently walk into it or melee it in an endless loop.
Wonder if they could slide in reach grenade launcher. Love that weapon
    The Thumper?
A few years ago this'd be a very cursed image
OH GOD I'M GONNA COOM

AAAAAAAAAHHHHH
OH GOD I'M COOMING
AAAAAAARRRRRGGGHHHH
    What the?
        HES COOMING DIDNT YOU HEAR?!
            I heard but I'm just shocked lol
                I think he was too. Woof.
                When you first saw him coom, were you blinded by its majesty?
                    ...blinded?
                        Paralyzed? Dumbstruck?
                            NoOoOoO
                    He coomed right in my face lol
Are we gonna be able to dual wield the silenced SMG like in Halo 2 PC and H2A?
    That's the real question here, same with the silenced Magnum. I'd expect no because they'd probably have to do some new animation work or at least new coding, but it's definitely possible.
        I figured they would just rip the animations for the regular SMG, which also has dual wield animations.
            That's certainly what they would do, but even ripping animations can be surprisingly complex work. I guess we'll have to wait and see. Here's hoping!
                They would just be able to re-use the standard magnum and smg animations i would assume.
That's cool. But are they powerful enough?
Does anyone know if they'll be integrated in Halo 3 matchmaking? While I love this idea, I hope they leave it out of matchmaking to preserve the original gameplay experience online, while giving us more options in private games. Or a separate matchmaking playlist for that sort of mode that breaks from the original experience.
They should bring the Halo 3 SMG and Magnum to ODST Firefight
They need to get skulls working properly in ODST! They fucked it up in Reach, if you can survive a round you can survive forever since it doesn’t get more difficult in the next rounds, only in the sets within a round. Or the other way around, I forgot
But will they sound different?
Cursed
*is that a weapon skin I see on that spartan’s back?*
    Or are you just happy to see me?
I’m saving my season points for this particular season. Liked Spark don’t get me wrong but I’d rather have the stuff for games I play more.
Is that a reskined sniper on his back?
This is only gonna be in customs games right? Like they’re not gonna change the sandbox of matchmaking after 13 years right?
    what's the problem with these being put into matchmaking?
        Because matchmaking has been an established classic for 13 years. People still play Halo 3 because they love Halo 3 the way it is. These weapons being added to custom games would be amazing, but to add them to matchmaking would change the meta and that’s not a good idea for a game with such a dedicated following of people that love it the way it is. The ODST pistol especially would be far too overpowered compared to the H3 magnum, and it raises the question, can we duel wield them? Because that’d be even worse
            I think it'd be interesting to see how AR starts with ODST magnum secondary would play out. Throw it in as a rotating playlist at first to gauge popularity.
Okay but *when* is season 3, I mean we waited like what; 2-3 years for season 2?

Edit: legit question

Edit 2: of all the comments I’ve posted, getting downvotes on this thread confuses me.
    You're getting downvoted because you're ridiculously wrong. Season 1 launched with Reach's PC launch, last December. Season 2 started with Halo 3's PC launch, July 14. Six months. Not 2-3 years by any stretch of the imagination.
        Lol, yeah, I just could’ve swore that Reach have been out for longer!
    In the blog, we state that season 3 is launching with ODST
        I mean no disrespect, but that is probably both the most obvious and the vaguest, least helpful answer.

That like saying season 3 will launch with Half Life 3. Could be anytime between tomorrow and next century! Lol
            It’s not actually. In the blog (if you’ve read it, and you should if you haven’t) we go into this in a couple different ways. We state that it’s coming with ODST and I also talk about how the time between season 1-2 was way longer than we wanted it be. Now, if you do a little back of the napkin math based on how we’ve been releasing these games over the last year you can deduce that it’s not going to be a long window between season 2-3. 

TLDR: Read the blog and all your answers are there
    Huh? Season 1 (the revamp of earning cosmetics and launch of Reach MCC) started in November or December with Reach launching on MCC. It was a sevenish month wait for season 2.
        Whaaaaat? Nooooo, that can’t be!

Can it? It felt way longer than that!

Edit: Welp, that explains the downvotes. Guess I’m just a Clown with time problems!
            Each month of 2020 has felt like a month. I don't blame you
                >Each month of 2020 has felt like a month

What did he mean by this?
                    It was supposed to read, "each month of 2020 has felt like a year," but I wrote it wrong haha
                Well, you're not wrong.
            Why are you talking like an anime character? Just use google or literally look at the timeline of the seasons. No need to play the victim.
                I was simply expressing my disbelief and having doubt fill my judgment as what I had believed was being conflicted.

I did in fact google it and provided an edit admitting I was wrong and that was the reason why I was getting downvotes.

I wasn’t playing the victim and the anime thing is just be on you projecting it as such.
    when odst launches
        To be as specific as possible, ODST is flighting this month, and games usually launch on PC a month or two after flighting begins. I'd expect a September release -- maybe even Sept. 22 for the 11th anniversary?
            Well that would work them releasing every game so far on a Tuesday.
        Uuuuhhhh, okay.

So when is ODST gonna launch?
            Flight starts late aughts early sept I’m pretty sure
                So if flight starts in August, I’m gonna guess season 3 with drop in November.
                    Maybe not such a crazy wait ODST and halo 3 share a lot of assets so it may be just adding a few things and see how with what’s already there with halo 3 probably fire fight is gonna need the most feedback/ further work
                        That’s true, but we all know how... stable MCC is. Lol

                            MCC has been pretty stable for well over a year now. If you’re still having issues, then it’s either a PC problem (stability isn’t as strong there yet) or your Xbox sucks.
                                Ha I’m not really having problems myself (yet, I do have a gen 1 xbone), but I just hear of others at how rough halo reach and 3 have been on PC. Lol
                                    It could stand to be improved. I’m running off a laptop from three ears ago and it’s rough. Not really meant for lower end rigs.
                            Ironically on pc the mcc is super stable as a platform lol
                    November? No way. It's gonna launch late Aug or early Sept.
    This subreddit is so bad some times, try to post some thing to start a discussion, you get down voted. Post a shitty meme that is probably a repost anyway, get upvotes, awards and everything. I for one am glad that you asked and got an answer.
        Thanks friend, I’m only human, I make mistakes and I learn.
        Thats just reddit in general. It somehow has devolved to have less meaningful discussion than 4chan. When is genuinely impressive
[deleted]
    nah bro, it's currently the same as the original days. but they're planning on adding some ODST weapons when ODST drops for the MCC. plus you don't need to use "new" weapons if you don't want.
        [deleted]
            Reach and Halo 3's current forge additions have been only in customs so far. Though it's likely some special hoppers will be created that takes advantage of these new items (ODST Slayer, expanded Heavies variety, new Infection modes, etc) it's likely that many of these items will remain in customs only.
                You need more upvotes, I think it’s evident these will be custom games only and locked to special playlists, like let’s say an ODST rumble pit for halo 3 where you spawn with the silenced SMG and pistol.
                    There was an official ODST game mode for Halo 3 when ODST released. It was around for like a week and it wasn't very good so I don't think it ever came back. Halo 3's SMG and magnum though obviously.
                I wouldn't mind in social some freshness. A few new weapons won't matter. As long as ranked stays as the original I don't think anyone in social matchmaking will mind some new stuff added to Halo 3 multiplayer.
            not sure about the multiplayer with weapons, but I don't think it will effect that economy too badly. it'll still be the same, just a few "new" weapons. and ODST and 4 aren't in the PC version of the MCC yet.
    [deleted]
I have to be honest, maybe I’m just crazy, but I definitely have used an smg in h3 multiplayer that looked exactly like that 2 days ago
    that SMG is in Halo 2 Anniversary MP, maybe that’s what you saw
    Probably H2A
    there is an smg in halo 3, but it's not the silenced smg from odst
    [deleted]
        Halo 2 anniversary
            [deleted]
                Halo ODST has basically the same code as halo 3, so it's probably pretty easy
        I found it again today, definitely the same gun, it was hiding away under  someplace In H3 MCC on oracle in br slayer
But how about BR in ODST....I mean, y’all....
    [Well...](https://content.halocdn.com/media/Default/community/MCC/odst2-e8ca6724ae0c440aacba7eda14076991.jpg)

Now we wait for AR in Halo 2.
        Adding the AR to classic Halo 2 is a dream for me. It's the only thing that feels missing from that game.

Hopefully porting over the Halo 1 model and giving it Halo 3 stats with Halo 2 BR animations would be doable for the MCC team, but knowing game development, that might be a hell of a tall order in practice.
            I've always felt that with a few tweaks H2A could've been the best classic experience. A sort of "Halo All-stars" that just knits the best of everything together.

It's a shame that it kinda got swallowed by the mammoth task of porting all of MCC over, I feel like it lost the individual attention it deserved because of it. It's definitely not bad but it just falls short of being on another level.
Are they going to unionize?
    Oh no the games want basic human rights guys, guess we gotta massacre their entire families. That makes total and complete sense doesn't it.
Fucking hate skins
    you can turn them off in the settings
        Well that’s good news
    I see no problem

                            I'm afraid you're wrong on that one. Is your monitor broken? Because I'm not sure how you can confuse halo 2A with Halo 3?
Well thats gonna screw with the game balance, really awesome though.
    Not really,  I think the only ones that are exclusive to ODST are the silenced pistol/SMG, and they shouldn't be any better than the actual SMG and would likely be worse than the Magnum.

On top of that, just because those weapons are being added does not mean they'll be sticking them into the maps, it more likely means you'll be able to use them for Forge and stuff
        Lmao why did I get downvoted I literally said its awesome that they’re adding the weapons to the game. 

Anyway if you’ve played ODST you know that the silenced SMG is way more effective than the standard one, is has a tighter spread and zoom. And the ODST pistol compared to the Halo 3 Magnum, theres no comparison there at all, ODST’s has a faster fighter rate larger magazine and zoom.
        Brute plasma rifle as well, but you’re probably right in that you won’t see them on maps by default, like you don’t see a saber in the Blood Gulch redux.
Nooo why
    Why not?
Here's to hoping. They did say updated customization for Halo 3: ODST
    Character Customization is coming. Sergeant Johnson!
    I'm hoping to see Reach's Elites get better customization. I want to be able to swap out the helmet, chest, shoulders, wrists, and legs independently. Would probably go with Zealot helmet, Zealot chest, Major shoulders, Officer legs, Minor wrists.
        Am I the only one who finds it impossible to get into invasion matches?
            Nope, I can't get into one for the life of me
            You're not the only one. They should remove it from competitive.
    With Season 1 being Reach, Season 2 being CE, Season 3 being 3 and ODST, Season 4 being 4 I wonder if Season 5 will be Halo 2 Anniversary focused coming with more remastered maps.
    How about playing as odsts in halo 3 multiplayer.
Honestly I'd settle for being able to play as Elites in Reach's Firefight
    You can but only in the Covenant side
    You can in the versus mode
I wonder if the Brute Plasma Rifle will actually be added since I’m pretty sure it’s just a straight reskin in ODST since the base plasma rifle was buffed between Halos 2 and 3.
    If you zoom in on the picture with the SMG, it's right there
        That might just be a plasma rifle with a skin on it though. The CE plasma rifle has a Brute skin this season, but it’s not the actual gun.
            Not a skin, it's shooting red bolts , would be blue if it was just a reskin
                But that still doesn’t mean it’s the original brute plasma rifle because that had a different fire rate from the blue one. 

It could be functionally the same as the blue rifle, but have the appearance of the the red one. We can’t tell from a picture though.
    I believe that Brute Plasma rifled have a faster fire rate than the standard blue.
        Only in Halo 2. In ODST it’s just a reskin of the regular plasma rifle.
            Somehow, I don’t believe that to be true. I’ll be right back.

EDIT: Son of a bitch, you’re right!
        Yes
    It will most likely just be a skin since the elite plasma rifle was just reskinned as a brute plasma rifle for ODST. I just hope they change the plasma bolts to red when you have the skin on because they didn't do that for the bolts in CE.
        you can see in the bottom image that the plasma rifle is indeed shooting red bolts, it’s not a skin it’s the actual red plasma rifle
            Thanks for pointing it out. I didn't notice he was even using a plasma rifle. It's better as a separate option despite the fact that it was just a skin in ODST.
        Except the fire rate was modified. Exactly like the original Halo 2 Brute Plasma Rifle.
            That's all the BPR ever was-- faster firing plasma rifle, which thus overheated quicker
            No it wasn't. In Halo 2 the brute plasma has a higher fire rate than the elite plasma rifle. In ODST they just reskinned the elite plasma rifle from Halo 3. It has the same stats, they didn't bother changing it. Even the old bunige.net stats say that. 

http://halo.bungie.net/projects/odst/guide.aspx

http://halo.bungie.net/projects/halo3/content.aspx?link=h3plasmarifle

Interestingly, the brute plasma rifle description for ODST still says it does more damage and has a higher fire rate which is true in halo 2 and in lore but not in gameplay for ODST as the stats are the same as 3.
Which unique assets?
Now only if we could fix Forge since it was broken in the newest release...
yup

    >	Now if we ended up in a situation where you couldn't play a matchmade game of H3 without seeing the ODST pistol and SMG on the map, that's a far more legitimate complaint.

Well I personally would be okay with something like a randomized weapon pool system. Sometimes you'll get the H3 Magnum and the H3 SMG, sometimes you'll get the ODST Pistol and the ODST SMG.

The game is 13 years old after all, would seeing a different set of weapons really piss you off that much?
        [deleted]
            Idk, I guess to each their own, I still wouldn't mind that. I would only mind that if the ODST weapons are worse than the original H3 weapons. But I've used these weapons for so many years that I'd be okay with the idea. Not permanent of course, but say like a whole week all the normal weapons except for the BR and AR were swapped with ODST weapons, I'd be cool with it.
I'd love to have Romeo's helmet and Mickey's helmet. Maybe they can add the ODST chest piece to 3 also.
I was always wondered why they took it out. It'd be very cool to see
Usually when people start their sentences with "imagine" it's a negative so is this meant to be negative? Lol because I love the brute plasma rifle and was hoping we would get it as skin for Halo 3 and looks like we will judging by the photo :) what's weird is the brutes use elite plasma rifles in 3

Edit: not sure why I got downvoted for asking a genuine question lol
    How the hell do you see his comment as negative? And you got downvoted because your whole comment reeks of r/iamverysmart
        Nah this comment isn't riamverysmart material at all. It was a genuine question and I was expressing my like of the brute plasma rifle. I wasn't attacking him or anything. Literally just asking him for clarification. Also people pretty much always use the "imagine" as a negative in that context which is why I was genuinely asking so nice try. 

The guy even said I don't know which is fine lol it was just a question if he meant that to be negative or not. That is all.
    Imagine all the people, living life in peace.

Imagine everyone always had enough to eat.

Imagine getting to ride a dragon or a unicorn.

Imagine a new Jet Set Radio.

Imagine Half-Life 3 actually coming out.

Imagine having the Force.

Yep, all sentences that start with the word imagine are negative.
        You don't get what I'm saying. I've only ever seen it used on the forums or anywhere in a negative fashion towards someone else's actions when people say for example:

Imagine thinking you're tougher than the sun? In response to someone who called me a pussy for not wearing sunscreen.

Imagine thinking you can breathe in space? 

Imagine thinking this is r/iamverysmartmaterial

Imagine thinking you can take on the whole empire yourself?

The half life 3 one you used just proves my point. You would say that as negative to someone who was had some overly wishful thinking of half life 3 coming out. Btw it is coming out eventually.

I was just asking for clarification of he meant it as a negative or not. I wasn't attacking him or anything lol chill out
    I don't know
        Thanks
I'm wondering if that's what the "redacted" was when they were talking about adding something to ODST firefight
    Flood Firefight. Please be Flood Firefight. I know modders managed to get Flood Firefight working on Xbox 360 ODST, surely it could be done for ODST PC.
        Oh holy shit, I didn't even think about that.
        And when you die, your corpse should get reanimated with buffed stats. Please.
        Holy Jesus, do I need this in my life.
        For some reason my mind jumped to vehicles, or friendly AI
    The Battle Rifle showed up un-redacted in [one of the pictures](https://content.halocdn.com/media/Default/community/MCC/odst2-e8ca6724ae0c440aacba7eda14076991.jpg), so I don't think it's that.
        Wow.
    Golf club?
    I'm hoping vehicles.
        The pic below shows that you can spawn a gauss hog so maybe it's something else.
Maybe in Firefight, but I wouldn't like it if they put it in campaign. The BR was kept out purposely to keep the SMG and Magnum more relevant on their own. 

Perhaps if they included it with a skull that also let the Energy Sword, regular Plasma Rifle, H3 Magnum and unsilenced SMG spawn, that'd be cool.
    I really hope they add those weapons and the sentinel beam.
        Sentinel beam would be a bit much. Other stuff was kept out for balancing reasons but there is zero reason whatsoever for a sentinel beam to show up in ODST
            Reason: fun?
                ...did you really consider the sentinel beam fun? Always hated it.
                    I love constant beam weapons in any game. The X-43 MIKE was my go-to in Crysis 2/3.
            > there is zero reason whatsoever for a sentinel beam to show up in ODST 

Well, there's at least one rationalization for it's addition. Covenant are excavating the Forerunner portal generator beneath Kenya, right? Maybe some unfortunate Jiralhanae shipmaster put just a bit too much power into their excavation beam and ended up drawing Sentinel aggro.
                I don’t think sentinels were present in the ark portal mainframe? At least as far as Hunters in the Dark (one of the few novels delving into the portal) indicates, the portal was left with no caretakers or guardians.
                    D'oh. Forgot about that. 

Which is still quite weird.
                I don't think they started doing that until part of the way through Halo 3, no? ODST wouldn't be completed by then.
                    They start the glassing process in ODST. That’s what you see when the first ships arrive during Coastal Highway.
            It would just be an option for custom firefight so I don't see a problem with that. It's just another weapon from Halo 3's sandbox that got left out of ODST obviously because campaign takes place on Earth. It would just be for fun. Besides that people want a bunch of flood firefight which would be cool and probably easier to import since it's the same engine as H3.
        Having a sentinel beam in halo 3 ODST would make absolutely no sense. How would you even go about implementing it?
            The same way they're implementing the Battle Rifle, adding it as an option in the Firefight menu. How else?
            ODST uses the same engine as Halo 3 so it would be easy to import same way their putting the battle rifle, silenced smg, and automag into halo 3.
                But I'm not talking about ease of implementation. It simply wouldn't make sense for there to be a forerunner weapon being used in the streets of Mombasa.
                    You also don't respawn when you die, I doubt Buck was actually picking stuff out of a monkeys hair and eating it, there's no reason for having no BR, etc etc etc. Make it a skull that adds H3 weapons, who cares whats canon then. People wanna have fun.
    The silenced SMG and Magnum made sense during the stealth-oriented Mombasa Streets segments but I don't see why there couldn't be BRs during the flashbacks
        According to bungie it was for gameplay reasons like making the smg and pistol more relevant. They didn't want the BR to be the one size fits all weapon. I mean it's practically a power weapon. That's one reason why it got nerfed from halo 2 to be less dominant in 3's multiplayer. 

Lore wise it's a little odd considering everybody had BRs in New Mombassa but all of the sudden nobody has a BR. At least the BR came out in one of the cutscenes as an easter egg.
    Battle rifle is confirmed for ODST firefight
    [deleted]
        I was playing through CE on legendary this past week, and when I got to the second half of the game I had a shotgun on me almost always. I could have picked something else up, but why would I? The shotgun is the best weapon to have in the second half of the game. Get the magnum or sniper as your other weapon and you have the most effective combo for the game. Why would I pick up anything else unless I am out of ammo?
        An interesting note is that more options is not always better when it comes to a hand crafted user experience.

If given the option some players will optimize the fun out of a game for themselves.
The whole game was designed to work with the Pistol and the SMG in mind. And when you think about it they are the BR but split in 2.
Adding some kind of PvE element to Forge is one of my dreams for Halo, but that would probably be an Infinite-only feature at best. As someone with experience modding Left 4 Dead, getting enemies to move around a new environment correctly is 100 times more work than you'd expect from the outside looking in.
Unlikely. The issue with Forging Firefight (or even Campaign) in these titles is the AI navmesh.  I think at best you'd be limited to moving around dynamic objects like crates that the AI already know how to get around/push away from themselves, but it won't be possible to make entire new maps or add new buildings/block off sections because the AI won't have a navmesh to deal with actual geometry. They would see a Block, Double just like any other dynamic object and just permanently walk into it or melee it in an endless loop.
The Thumper?
What the?
    HES COOMING DIDNT YOU HEAR?!
        I heard but I'm just shocked lol
            I think he was too. Woof.
            When you first saw him coom, were you blinded by its majesty?
                ...blinded?
                    Paralyzed? Dumbstruck?
                        NoOoOoO
                He coomed right in my face lol
That's the real question here, same with the silenced Magnum. I'd expect no because they'd probably have to do some new animation work or at least new coding, but it's definitely possible.
    I figured they would just rip the animations for the regular SMG, which also has dual wield animations.
        That's certainly what they would do, but even ripping animations can be surprisingly complex work. I guess we'll have to wait and see. Here's hoping!
            They would just be able to re-use the standard magnum and smg animations i would assume.
Or are you just happy to see me?
what's the problem with these being put into matchmaking?
    Because matchmaking has been an established classic for 13 years. People still play Halo 3 because they love Halo 3 the way it is. These weapons being added to custom games would be amazing, but to add them to matchmaking would change the meta and that’s not a good idea for a game with such a dedicated following of people that love it the way it is. The ODST pistol especially would be far too overpowered compared to the H3 magnum, and it raises the question, can we duel wield them? Because that’d be even worse
        I think it'd be interesting to see how AR starts with ODST magnum secondary would play out. Throw it in as a rotating playlist at first to gauge popularity.
You're getting downvoted because you're ridiculously wrong. Season 1 launched with Reach's PC launch, last December. Season 2 started with Halo 3's PC launch, July 14. Six months. Not 2-3 years by any stretch of the imagination.
    Lol, yeah, I just could’ve swore that Reach have been out for longer!
In the blog, we state that season 3 is launching with ODST
    I mean no disrespect, but that is probably both the most obvious and the vaguest, least helpful answer.

That like saying season 3 will launch with Half Life 3. Could be anytime between tomorrow and next century! Lol
        It’s not actually. In the blog (if you’ve read it, and you should if you haven’t) we go into this in a couple different ways. We state that it’s coming with ODST and I also talk about how the time between season 1-2 was way longer than we wanted it be. Now, if you do a little back of the napkin math based on how we’ve been releasing these games over the last year you can deduce that it’s not going to be a long window between season 2-3. 

TLDR: Read the blog and all your answers are there
Huh? Season 1 (the revamp of earning cosmetics and launch of Reach MCC) started in November or December with Reach launching on MCC. It was a sevenish month wait for season 2.
    Whaaaaat? Nooooo, that can’t be!

Can it? It felt way longer than that!

Edit: Welp, that explains the downvotes. Guess I’m just a Clown with time problems!
        Each month of 2020 has felt like a month. I don't blame you
            >Each month of 2020 has felt like a month

What did he mean by this?
                It was supposed to read, "each month of 2020 has felt like a year," but I wrote it wrong haha
            Well, you're not wrong.
        Why are you talking like an anime character? Just use google or literally look at the timeline of the seasons. No need to play the victim.
            I was simply expressing my disbelief and having doubt fill my judgment as what I had believed was being conflicted.

I did in fact google it and provided an edit admitting I was wrong and that was the reason why I was getting downvotes.

I wasn’t playing the victim and the anime thing is just be on you projecting it as such.
when odst launches
    To be as specific as possible, ODST is flighting this month, and games usually launch on PC a month or two after flighting begins. I'd expect a September release -- maybe even Sept. 22 for the 11th anniversary?
        Well that would work them releasing every game so far on a Tuesday.
    Uuuuhhhh, okay.

So when is ODST gonna launch?
        Flight starts late aughts early sept I’m pretty sure
            So if flight starts in August, I’m gonna guess season 3 with drop in November.
                Maybe not such a crazy wait ODST and halo 3 share a lot of assets so it may be just adding a few things and see how with what’s already there with halo 3 probably fire fight is gonna need the most feedback/ further work
                    That’s true, but we all know how... stable MCC is. Lol

                        MCC has been pretty stable for well over a year now. If you’re still having issues, then it’s either a PC problem (stability isn’t as strong there yet) or your Xbox sucks.
                            Ha I’m not really having problems myself (yet, I do have a gen 1 xbone), but I just hear of others at how rough halo reach and 3 have been on PC. Lol
                                It could stand to be improved. I’m running off a laptop from three ears ago and it’s rough. Not really meant for lower end rigs.
                        Ironically on pc the mcc is super stable as a platform lol
                November? No way. It's gonna launch late Aug or early Sept.
This subreddit is so bad some times, try to post some thing to start a discussion, you get down voted. Post a shitty meme that is probably a repost anyway, get upvotes, awards and everything. I for one am glad that you asked and got an answer.
    Thanks friend, I’m only human, I make mistakes and I learn.
    Thats just reddit in general. It somehow has devolved to have less meaningful discussion than 4chan. When is genuinely impressive
nah bro, it's currently the same as the original days. but they're planning on adding some ODST weapons when ODST drops for the MCC. plus you don't need to use "new" weapons if you don't want.
    [deleted]
        Reach and Halo 3's current forge additions have been only in customs so far. Though it's likely some special hoppers will be created that takes advantage of these new items (ODST Slayer, expanded Heavies variety, new Infection modes, etc) it's likely that many of these items will remain in customs only.
            You need more upvotes, I think it’s evident these will be custom games only and locked to special playlists, like let’s say an ODST rumble pit for halo 3 where you spawn with the silenced SMG and pistol.
                There was an official ODST game mode for Halo 3 when ODST released. It was around for like a week and it wasn't very good so I don't think it ever came back. Halo 3's SMG and magnum though obviously.
            I wouldn't mind in social some freshness. A few new weapons won't matter. As long as ranked stays as the original I don't think anyone in social matchmaking will mind some new stuff added to Halo 3 multiplayer.
        not sure about the multiplayer with weapons, but I don't think it will effect that economy too badly. it'll still be the same, just a few "new" weapons. and ODST and 4 aren't in the PC version of the MCC yet.
[deleted]
that SMG is in Halo 2 Anniversary MP, maybe that’s what you saw
Probably H2A
there is an smg in halo 3, but it's not the silenced smg from odst
[deleted]
    Halo 2 anniversary
        [deleted]
            Halo ODST has basically the same code as halo 3, so it's probably pretty easy
    I found it again today, definitely the same gun, it was hiding away under  someplace In H3 MCC on oracle in br slayer
[Well...](https://content.halocdn.com/media/Default/community/MCC/odst2-e8ca6724ae0c440aacba7eda14076991.jpg)

Now we wait for AR in Halo 2.
    Adding the AR to classic Halo 2 is a dream for me. It's the only thing that feels missing from that game.

Hopefully porting over the Halo 1 model and giving it Halo 3 stats with Halo 2 BR animations would be doable for the MCC team, but knowing game development, that might be a hell of a tall order in practice.
        I've always felt that with a few tweaks H2A could've been the best classic experience. A sort of "Halo All-stars" that just knits the best of everything together.

It's a shame that it kinda got swallowed by the mammoth task of porting all of MCC over, I feel like it lost the individual attention it deserved because of it. It's definitely not bad but it just falls short of being on another level.
Oh no the games want basic human rights guys, guess we gotta massacre their entire families. That makes total and complete sense doesn't it.
you can turn them off in the settings
    Well that’s good news
I see no problem

Not really,  I think the only ones that are exclusive to ODST are the silenced pistol/SMG, and they shouldn't be any better than the actual SMG and would likely be worse than the Magnum.

On top of that, just because those weapons are being added does not mean they'll be sticking them into the maps, it more likely means you'll be able to use them for Forge and stuff
    Lmao why did I get downvoted I literally said its awesome that they’re adding the weapons to the game. 

Anyway if you’ve played ODST you know that the silenced SMG is way more effective than the standard one, is has a tighter spread and zoom. And the ODST pistol compared to the Halo 3 Magnum, theres no comparison there at all, ODST’s has a faster fighter rate larger magazine and zoom.
    Brute plasma rifle as well, but you’re probably right in that you won’t see them on maps by default, like you don’t see a saber in the Blood Gulch redux.
Why not?
Character Customization is coming. Sergeant Johnson!
I'm hoping to see Reach's Elites get better customization. I want to be able to swap out the helmet, chest, shoulders, wrists, and legs independently. Would probably go with Zealot helmet, Zealot chest, Major shoulders, Officer legs, Minor wrists.
    Am I the only one who finds it impossible to get into invasion matches?
        Nope, I can't get into one for the life of me
        You're not the only one. They should remove it from competitive.
With Season 1 being Reach, Season 2 being CE, Season 3 being 3 and ODST, Season 4 being 4 I wonder if Season 5 will be Halo 2 Anniversary focused coming with more remastered maps.
How about playing as odsts in halo 3 multiplayer.
You can but only in the Covenant side
You can in the versus mode
If you zoom in on the picture with the SMG, it's right there
    That might just be a plasma rifle with a skin on it though. The CE plasma rifle has a Brute skin this season, but it’s not the actual gun.
        Not a skin, it's shooting red bolts , would be blue if it was just a reskin
            But that still doesn’t mean it’s the original brute plasma rifle because that had a different fire rate from the blue one. 

It could be functionally the same as the blue rifle, but have the appearance of the the red one. We can’t tell from a picture though.
I believe that Brute Plasma rifled have a faster fire rate than the standard blue.
    Only in Halo 2. In ODST it’s just a reskin of the regular plasma rifle.
        Somehow, I don’t believe that to be true. I’ll be right back.

EDIT: Son of a bitch, you’re right!
    Yes
It will most likely just be a skin since the elite plasma rifle was just reskinned as a brute plasma rifle for ODST. I just hope they change the plasma bolts to red when you have the skin on because they didn't do that for the bolts in CE.
    you can see in the bottom image that the plasma rifle is indeed shooting red bolts, it’s not a skin it’s the actual red plasma rifle
        Thanks for pointing it out. I didn't notice he was even using a plasma rifle. It's better as a separate option despite the fact that it was just a skin in ODST.
    Except the fire rate was modified. Exactly like the original Halo 2 Brute Plasma Rifle.
        That's all the BPR ever was-- faster firing plasma rifle, which thus overheated quicker
        No it wasn't. In Halo 2 the brute plasma has a higher fire rate than the elite plasma rifle. In ODST they just reskinned the elite plasma rifle from Halo 3. It has the same stats, they didn't bother changing it. Even the old bunige.net stats say that. 

http://halo.bungie.net/projects/odst/guide.aspx

http://halo.bungie.net/projects/halo3/content.aspx?link=h3plasmarifle

Interestingly, the brute plasma rifle description for ODST still says it does more damage and has a higher fire rate which is true in halo 2 and in lore but not in gameplay for ODST as the stats are the same as 3.
>	Now if we ended up in a situation where you couldn't play a matchmade game of H3 without seeing the ODST pistol and SMG on the map, that's a far more legitimate complaint.

Well I personally would be okay with something like a randomized weapon pool system. Sometimes you'll get the H3 Magnum and the H3 SMG, sometimes you'll get the ODST Pistol and the ODST SMG.

The game is 13 years old after all, would seeing a different set of weapons really piss you off that much?
    [deleted]
        Idk, I guess to each their own, I still wouldn't mind that. I would only mind that if the ODST weapons are worse than the original H3 weapons. But I've used these weapons for so many years that I'd be okay with the idea. Not permanent of course, but say like a whole week all the normal weapons except for the BR and AR were swapped with ODST weapons, I'd be cool with it.
How the hell do you see his comment as negative? And you got downvoted because your whole comment reeks of r/iamverysmart
    Nah this comment isn't riamverysmart material at all. It was a genuine question and I was expressing my like of the brute plasma rifle. I wasn't attacking him or anything. Literally just asking him for clarification. Also people pretty much always use the "imagine" as a negative in that context which is why I was genuinely asking so nice try. 

The guy even said I don't know which is fine lol it was just a question if he meant that to be negative or not. That is all.
Imagine all the people, living life in peace.

Imagine everyone always had enough to eat.

Imagine getting to ride a dragon or a unicorn.

Imagine a new Jet Set Radio.

Imagine Half-Life 3 actually coming out.

Imagine having the Force.

Yep, all sentences that start with the word imagine are negative.
    You don't get what I'm saying. I've only ever seen it used on the forums or anywhere in a negative fashion towards someone else's actions when people say for example:

Imagine thinking you're tougher than the sun? In response to someone who called me a pussy for not wearing sunscreen.

Imagine thinking you can breathe in space? 

Imagine thinking this is r/iamverysmartmaterial

Imagine thinking you can take on the whole empire yourself?

The half life 3 one you used just proves my point. You would say that as negative to someone who was had some overly wishful thinking of half life 3 coming out. Btw it is coming out eventually.

I was just asking for clarification of he meant it as a negative or not. I wasn't attacking him or anything lol chill out
I don't know
    Thanks
Flood Firefight. Please be Flood Firefight. I know modders managed to get Flood Firefight working on Xbox 360 ODST, surely it could be done for ODST PC.
    Oh holy shit, I didn't even think about that.
    And when you die, your corpse should get reanimated with buffed stats. Please.
    Holy Jesus, do I need this in my life.
    For some reason my mind jumped to vehicles, or friendly AI
The Battle Rifle showed up un-redacted in [one of the pictures](https://content.halocdn.com/media/Default/community/MCC/odst2-e8ca6724ae0c440aacba7eda14076991.jpg), so I don't think it's that.
    Wow.
Golf club?
I'm hoping vehicles.
    The pic below shows that you can spawn a gauss hog so maybe it's something else.
I really hope they add those weapons and the sentinel beam.
    Sentinel beam would be a bit much. Other stuff was kept out for balancing reasons but there is zero reason whatsoever for a sentinel beam to show up in ODST
        Reason: fun?
            ...did you really consider the sentinel beam fun? Always hated it.
                I love constant beam weapons in any game. The X-43 MIKE was my go-to in Crysis 2/3.
        > there is zero reason whatsoever for a sentinel beam to show up in ODST 

Well, there's at least one rationalization for it's addition. Covenant are excavating the Forerunner portal generator beneath Kenya, right? Maybe some unfortunate Jiralhanae shipmaster put just a bit too much power into their excavation beam and ended up drawing Sentinel aggro.
            I don’t think sentinels were present in the ark portal mainframe? At least as far as Hunters in the Dark (one of the few novels delving into the portal) indicates, the portal was left with no caretakers or guardians.
                D'oh. Forgot about that. 

Which is still quite weird.
            I don't think they started doing that until part of the way through Halo 3, no? ODST wouldn't be completed by then.
                They start the glassing process in ODST. That’s what you see when the first ships arrive during Coastal Highway.
        It would just be an option for custom firefight so I don't see a problem with that. It's just another weapon from Halo 3's sandbox that got left out of ODST obviously because campaign takes place on Earth. It would just be for fun. Besides that people want a bunch of flood firefight which would be cool and probably easier to import since it's the same engine as H3.
    Having a sentinel beam in halo 3 ODST would make absolutely no sense. How would you even go about implementing it?
        The same way they're implementing the Battle Rifle, adding it as an option in the Firefight menu. How else?
        ODST uses the same engine as Halo 3 so it would be easy to import same way their putting the battle rifle, silenced smg, and automag into halo 3.
            But I'm not talking about ease of implementation. It simply wouldn't make sense for there to be a forerunner weapon being used in the streets of Mombasa.
                You also don't respawn when you die, I doubt Buck was actually picking stuff out of a monkeys hair and eating it, there's no reason for having no BR, etc etc etc. Make it a skull that adds H3 weapons, who cares whats canon then. People wanna have fun.
The silenced SMG and Magnum made sense during the stealth-oriented Mombasa Streets segments but I don't see why there couldn't be BRs during the flashbacks
    According to bungie it was for gameplay reasons like making the smg and pistol more relevant. They didn't want the BR to be the one size fits all weapon. I mean it's practically a power weapon. That's one reason why it got nerfed from halo 2 to be less dominant in 3's multiplayer. 

Lore wise it's a little odd considering everybody had BRs in New Mombassa but all of the sudden nobody has a BR. At least the BR came out in one of the cutscenes as an easter egg.
Battle rifle is confirmed for ODST firefight
[deleted]
    I was playing through CE on legendary this past week, and when I got to the second half of the game I had a shotgun on me almost always. I could have picked something else up, but why would I? The shotgun is the best weapon to have in the second half of the game. Get the magnum or sniper as your other weapon and you have the most effective combo for the game. Why would I pick up anything else unless I am out of ammo?
    An interesting note is that more options is not always better when it comes to a hand crafted user experience.

If given the option some players will optimize the fun out of a game for themselves.
HES COOMING DIDNT YOU HEAR?!
    I heard but I'm just shocked lol
        I think he was too. Woof.
        When you first saw him coom, were you blinded by its majesty?
            ...blinded?
                Paralyzed? Dumbstruck?
                    NoOoOoO
            He coomed right in my face lol
I figured they would just rip the animations for the regular SMG, which also has dual wield animations.
    That's certainly what they would do, but even ripping animations can be surprisingly complex work. I guess we'll have to wait and see. Here's hoping!
        They would just be able to re-use the standard magnum and smg animations i would assume.
Because matchmaking has been an established classic for 13 years. People still play Halo 3 because they love Halo 3 the way it is. These weapons being added to custom games would be amazing, but to add them to matchmaking would change the meta and that’s not a good idea for a game with such a dedicated following of people that love it the way it is. The ODST pistol especially would be far too overpowered compared to the H3 magnum, and it raises the question, can we duel wield them? Because that’d be even worse
    I think it'd be interesting to see how AR starts with ODST magnum secondary would play out. Throw it in as a rotating playlist at first to gauge popularity.
Lol, yeah, I just could’ve swore that Reach have been out for longer!
I mean no disrespect, but that is probably both the most obvious and the vaguest, least helpful answer.

That like saying season 3 will launch with Half Life 3. Could be anytime between tomorrow and next century! Lol
    It’s not actually. In the blog (if you’ve read it, and you should if you haven’t) we go into this in a couple different ways. We state that it’s coming with ODST and I also talk about how the time between season 1-2 was way longer than we wanted it be. Now, if you do a little back of the napkin math based on how we’ve been releasing these games over the last year you can deduce that it’s not going to be a long window between season 2-3. 

TLDR: Read the blog and all your answers are there
Whaaaaat? Nooooo, that can’t be!

Can it? It felt way longer than that!

Edit: Welp, that explains the downvotes. Guess I’m just a Clown with time problems!
    Each month of 2020 has felt like a month. I don't blame you
        >Each month of 2020 has felt like a month

What did he mean by this?
            It was supposed to read, "each month of 2020 has felt like a year," but I wrote it wrong haha
        Well, you're not wrong.
    Why are you talking like an anime character? Just use google or literally look at the timeline of the seasons. No need to play the victim.
        I was simply expressing my disbelief and having doubt fill my judgment as what I had believed was being conflicted.

I did in fact google it and provided an edit admitting I was wrong and that was the reason why I was getting downvotes.

I wasn’t playing the victim and the anime thing is just be on you projecting it as such.
To be as specific as possible, ODST is flighting this month, and games usually launch on PC a month or two after flighting begins. I'd expect a September release -- maybe even Sept. 22 for the 11th anniversary?
    Well that would work them releasing every game so far on a Tuesday.
Uuuuhhhh, okay.

So when is ODST gonna launch?
    Flight starts late aughts early sept I’m pretty sure
        So if flight starts in August, I’m gonna guess season 3 with drop in November.
            Maybe not such a crazy wait ODST and halo 3 share a lot of assets so it may be just adding a few things and see how with what’s already there with halo 3 probably fire fight is gonna need the most feedback/ further work
                That’s true, but we all know how... stable MCC is. Lol

                    MCC has been pretty stable for well over a year now. If you’re still having issues, then it’s either a PC problem (stability isn’t as strong there yet) or your Xbox sucks.
                        Ha I’m not really having problems myself (yet, I do have a gen 1 xbone), but I just hear of others at how rough halo reach and 3 have been on PC. Lol
                            It could stand to be improved. I’m running off a laptop from three ears ago and it’s rough. Not really meant for lower end rigs.
                    Ironically on pc the mcc is super stable as a platform lol
            November? No way. It's gonna launch late Aug or early Sept.
Thanks friend, I’m only human, I make mistakes and I learn.
Thats just reddit in general. It somehow has devolved to have less meaningful discussion than 4chan. When is genuinely impressive

    Reach and Halo 3's current forge additions have been only in customs so far. Though it's likely some special hoppers will be created that takes advantage of these new items (ODST Slayer, expanded Heavies variety, new Infection modes, etc) it's likely that many of these items will remain in customs only.
        You need more upvotes, I think it’s evident these will be custom games only and locked to special playlists, like let’s say an ODST rumble pit for halo 3 where you spawn with the silenced SMG and pistol.
            There was an official ODST game mode for Halo 3 when ODST released. It was around for like a week and it wasn't very good so I don't think it ever came back. Halo 3's SMG and magnum though obviously.
        I wouldn't mind in social some freshness. A few new weapons won't matter. As long as ranked stays as the original I don't think anyone in social matchmaking will mind some new stuff added to Halo 3 multiplayer.
    not sure about the multiplayer with weapons, but I don't think it will effect that economy too badly. it'll still be the same, just a few "new" weapons. and ODST and 4 aren't in the PC version of the MCC yet.
Halo 2 anniversary
    [deleted]
        Halo ODST has basically the same code as halo 3, so it's probably pretty easy
I found it again today, definitely the same gun, it was hiding away under  someplace In H3 MCC on oracle in br slayer
Adding the AR to classic Halo 2 is a dream for me. It's the only thing that feels missing from that game.

Hopefully porting over the Halo 1 model and giving it Halo 3 stats with Halo 2 BR animations would be doable for the MCC team, but knowing game development, that might be a hell of a tall order in practice.
    I've always felt that with a few tweaks H2A could've been the best classic experience. A sort of "Halo All-stars" that just knits the best of everything together.

It's a shame that it kinda got swallowed by the mammoth task of porting all of MCC over, I feel like it lost the individual attention it deserved because of it. It's definitely not bad but it just falls short of being on another level.
Well that’s good news
[deleted]
    They look completely different so yes you should be very ashamed of yourself lol
        [deleted]
            No. Why do you ask?
                [deleted]
                    I'm afraid you're wrong on that one. Is your monitor broken? Because I'm not sure how you can confuse halo 2A with Halo 3?
Lmao why did I get downvoted I literally said its awesome that they’re adding the weapons to the game. 

Anyway if you’ve played ODST you know that the silenced SMG is way more effective than the standard one, is has a tighter spread and zoom. And the ODST pistol compared to the Halo 3 Magnum, theres no comparison there at all, ODST’s has a faster fighter rate larger magazine and zoom.
Brute plasma rifle as well, but you’re probably right in that you won’t see them on maps by default, like you don’t see a saber in the Blood Gulch redux.
Am I the only one who finds it impossible to get into invasion matches?
    Nope, I can't get into one for the life of me
    You're not the only one. They should remove it from competitive.
That might just be a plasma rifle with a skin on it though. The CE plasma rifle has a Brute skin this season, but it’s not the actual gun.
    Not a skin, it's shooting red bolts , would be blue if it was just a reskin
        But that still doesn’t mean it’s the original brute plasma rifle because that had a different fire rate from the blue one. 

It could be functionally the same as the blue rifle, but have the appearance of the the red one. We can’t tell from a picture though.
Only in Halo 2. In ODST it’s just a reskin of the regular plasma rifle.
    Somehow, I don’t believe that to be true. I’ll be right back.

EDIT: Son of a bitch, you’re right!
Yes
you can see in the bottom image that the plasma rifle is indeed shooting red bolts, it’s not a skin it’s the actual red plasma rifle

not sure about the multiplayer with weapons, but I don't think it will effect that economy too badly. it'll still be the same, just a few "new" weapons. and ODST and 4 aren't in the PC version of the MCC yet.

    Halo ODST has basically the same code as halo 3, so it's probably pretty easy
I've always felt that with a few tweaks H2A could've been the best classic experience. A sort of "Halo All-stars" that just knits the best of everything together.

It's a shame that it kinda got swallowed by the mammoth task of porting all of MCC over, I feel like it lost the individual attention it deserved because of it. It's definitely not bad but it just falls short of being on another level.
They look completely different so yes you should be very ashamed of yourself lol

        No. Why do you ask?

                I'm afraid you're wrong on that one. Is your monitor broken? Because I'm not sure how you can confuse halo 2A with Halo 3?
Nope, I can't get into one for the life of me
You're not the only one. They should remove it from competitive.
Not a skin, it's shooting red bolts , would be blue if it was just a reskin
    But that still doesn’t mean it’s the original brute plasma rifle because that had a different fire rate from the blue one. 

It could be functionally the same as the blue rifle, but have the appearance of the the red one. We can’t tell from a picture though.
Somehow, I don’t believe that to be true. I’ll be right back.

EDIT: Son of a bitch, you’re right!
Thanks for pointing it out. I didn't notice he was even using a plasma rifle. It's better as a separate option despite the fact that it was just a skin in ODST.
That's all the BPR ever was-- faster firing plasma rifle, which thus overheated quicker
No it wasn't. In Halo 2 the brute plasma has a higher fire rate than the elite plasma rifle. In ODST they just reskinned the elite plasma rifle from Halo 3. It has the same stats, they didn't bother changing it. Even the old bunige.net stats say that.

Interestingly, the brute plasma rifle description for ODST still says it does more damage and has a higher fire rate which is true in halo 2 and in lore but not in gameplay for ODST as the stats are the same as 3.
Idk, I guess to each their own, I still wouldn't mind that. I would only mind that if the ODST weapons are worse than the original H3 weapons. But I've used these weapons for so many years that I'd be okay with the idea. Not permanent of course, but say like a whole week all the normal weapons except for the BR and AR were swapped with ODST weapons, I'd be cool with it.
Reason: fun?
    ...did you really consider the sentinel beam fun? Always hated it.
        I love constant beam weapons in any game. The X-43 MIKE was my go-to in Crysis 2/3.
> there is zero reason whatsoever for a sentinel beam to show up in ODST 

Well, there's at least one rationalization for it's addition. Covenant are excavating the Forerunner portal generator beneath Kenya, right? Maybe some unfortunate Jiralhanae shipmaster put just a bit too much power into their excavation beam and ended up drawing Sentinel aggro.
    I don’t think sentinels were present in the ark portal mainframe? At least as far as Hunters in the Dark (one of the few novels delving into the portal) indicates, the portal was left with no caretakers or guardians.
        D'oh. Forgot about that. 

Which is still quite weird.
    I don't think they started doing that until part of the way through Halo 3, no? ODST wouldn't be completed by then.
        They start the glassing process in ODST. That’s what you see when the first ships arrive during Coastal Highway.
It would just be an option for custom firefight so I don't see a problem with that. It's just another weapon from Halo 3's sandbox that got left out of ODST obviously because campaign takes place on Earth. It would just be for fun. Besides that people want a bunch of flood firefight which would be cool and probably easier to import since it's the same engine as H3.
The same way they're implementing the Battle Rifle, adding it as an option in the Firefight menu. How else?
ODST uses the same engine as Halo 3 so it would be easy to import same way their putting the battle rifle, silenced smg, and automag into halo 3.
    But I'm not talking about ease of implementation. It simply wouldn't make sense for there to be a forerunner weapon being used in the streets of Mombasa.
        You also don't respawn when you die, I doubt Buck was actually picking stuff out of a monkeys hair and eating it, there's no reason for having no BR, etc etc etc. Make it a skull that adds H3 weapons, who cares whats canon then. People wanna have fun.
I think he was too. Woof.
When you first saw him coom, were you blinded by its majesty?
    ...blinded?
        Paralyzed? Dumbstruck?
            NoOoOoO
    He coomed right in my face lol
They would just be able to re-use the standard magnum and smg animations i would assume.
>Each month of 2020 has felt like a month

What did he mean by this?
    It was supposed to read, "each month of 2020 has felt like a year," but I wrote it wrong haha
Well, you're not wrong.
I was simply expressing my disbelief and having doubt fill my judgment as what I had believed was being conflicted.

I did in fact google it and provided an edit admitting I was wrong and that was the reason why I was getting downvotes.

I wasn’t playing the victim and the anime thing is just be on you projecting it as such.
So if flight starts in August, I’m gonna guess season 3 with drop in November.
    Maybe not such a crazy wait ODST and halo 3 share a lot of assets so it may be just adding a few things and see how with what’s already there with halo 3 probably fire fight is gonna need the most feedback/ further work
        That’s true, but we all know how... stable MCC is. Lol

            MCC has been pretty stable for well over a year now. If you’re still having issues, then it’s either a PC problem (stability isn’t as strong there yet) or your Xbox sucks.
                Ha I’m not really having problems myself (yet, I do have a gen 1 xbone), but I just hear of others at how rough halo reach and 3 have been on PC. Lol
                    It could stand to be improved. I’m running off a laptop from three ears ago and it’s rough. Not really meant for lower end rigs.
            Ironically on pc the mcc is super stable as a platform lol
    November? No way. It's gonna launch late Aug or early Sept.
You need more upvotes, I think it’s evident these will be custom games only and locked to special playlists, like let’s say an ODST rumble pit for halo 3 where you spawn with the silenced SMG and pistol.
