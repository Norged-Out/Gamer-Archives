[[Who's your favorite Halo 3 ODST character and why ]]


Mine is Dutch due to the fact that he's strong as shit and he's such a badass plus that uplift reserve mission with him was pretty cool along with "The Menagiere" (idk if I spelled that right)


Mickey until New Blood.

Lines like "Wait for me!" after getting told to move his ass thanks to a wraith and "As long as I get to drive the tank." Really made me love the character.

Then New Blood happened.

I also liked Romeo. 

"Do you ever get tired of bitching Romeo?"

"Do you ever get tired of busting my balls?"

"Point taken."
    Don't forget when he asks the marine "Which way is the fight??" And the marine replies "Take a guess genius" (all the scorpions and  stones running towards the city) Mickey was cool but they ruined his character after that.
Mine was mickey until I read new bloods.
    #FuckMickey
    Honestly I used to love Mickey until I heard the piece of shit he turned into. Him and Dutch were like brothers 
        All of alpha nine were like brothers, especially after everything that happened in new mombasa. 
            It's sad how after that the only one who stayed active was Buck and look how far he's gotten.
                If I recall Romeo is still a spartan IV, he's just not part of fireteam Osiris.
                    Imma have to look into that. Thank you for the info
                Romeo is still in active service as a Spartan as well.
Rookie actually. Always been a fan of the strong silent types, and the fact that he was supposed to be the new guy was interesting to me.  
Then they went and killed him in a dumbass book because Mickey and Buck are worthless idiots.

SO I guess that leaves Romeo. Or Virgil.
    I liked rookie he was really calm and collected when all the bullshit was going on it just sucks that he dies :(
I really liked Buck due to his similarity to Captain Reynolds from Firefly and although now in Halo 5 he's a bit less gruff I still think he's really cool. Got a quick wit and kicks ass.
    And hes a hell of a leader 
Eh, it's a hard choice. I'm not a fan of silent protagonists, but Rookie still had personality in the way he moved and reacted to things. He was in way over his head in New Mombasa, but he still pulled through... clumsily.

He was cute.
    It's funny how you mention that he pulled through clumsily and his nick name is "Rookie" you think they did that on purpose ?
For the graphics it was mediocre but other than that it was awesome. But I wouldn't always rate a game by graphics. Bugs glitches etc. yes but not graphics.
    Hey I'l take ODST's facials animations over Halo 3's any day of the week.
        They really weren't that bad
            They really were. The lip movements are all pretty much terrible. Especially on Johnson and Truth
                Gameplay wise the graphics were actually really good, the colors the guns , how everythjng looked throughout the night time it was pretty good.
                    Agreed. I'm not saying Halo 3 looks bad overall. Just that the faces and facial animation in that game are horrible.
                        Like that other guy said they really didn't pay too much attention to Halo 3 ODST cause at the time they were seveloping reach but imagine what could've been if they actually made it a big game like the other halos.
Mickey was my favorite, and to an extent he still is.

Romeo also really grew on me after reading New Blood. He is a huge asshole, but also a loyal brother in arms.

Mickey really let me down, but I think he can be very interesting in the future.
    I think new blood kinda ruined Mickey for good in my opinion 
        I can completely understand that.
Rookie. Because like Noble 6, you could make him *almost* into what you want him to be.
    Which is why neither of them show their faces. In order to better immerse you into the character and feel like you're actually them.
Dutch all the way!
    Good man
Buck I suppose. Didn't really care for any of them. 
Buck, I guess?

They were all pretty one-note and under-developed.
I loved Buck in ODST probably because he was the most fleshed out. Too bad he was ruined in Halo 5.
    Yeah buck is always a badass do what you gotta do to finish the mission type of guy. But yeah I really don't like the way that 343 is going.
I couldnt like any of them because their face models were potato.  Even when it released, their face models were kinda meh.

Thats wht rookie is best character.
    Yeah but you have to recall when that game came out think about when halo CE came out , everyone fell in love with SGT. Johnson and look at the face models from back then.
        Thats because at the time that was pretty damn good.  ODST looked bad for its time
            That's the Halo 3 engine for you. It's always good to remember that ODST was basically a side project while Reach was being developed. 
                The engine doesn't impact the look of models. Its the ability of the hardware, and talent of the artist that determines how they look. The Halo 3 engine was awesome.
Miles as well for me.
Don't forget when he asks the marine "Which way is the fight??" And the marine replies "Take a guess genius" (all the scorpions and  stones running towards the city) Mickey was cool but they ruined his character after that.
