[[how do ODSTs flip vehicles]]


like seriously, warthogs? TANKS!?


They press X
    of course it was so obvious.
    Uhhhh I play recon controlls though...
It’s simple; they can’t. It’s a non-canon gameplay convenience. 

It’s a 66 metric ton tank. Does anyone think they just crack their knuckles and flip that shit like a coffee table? That shit ain’t happening, chief.
    Never tell the rookie he can’t. Cause he will
With their hands
Because they are green, and very very mean
It’s actually a pneumatic ram and tow cable that flips the vehicle.  Simplified into the pressing of the X button for your playing pleasure.  

If it helps any, not even Spartans can actually flip vehicles in the lore.
    Spartans can flip most vehicles in lore. Just probably not the scorpion tank.
        They can definitely flip the Scorpion.
            Has it happened in the lore?
                Along with Frank stating so in the commentary track for Legends, Chief lifted over 100 tons in Gen 3 armor in Shadows of Reach. The heavier Scorpion, the M808, weighs 66 tons. The Halo 5 Scorpion, the M820, weighs 33 tons.
                Frank O Connor has stated that they can in the Halo Legends commentary tracks
            It just takes a bit longer then it’s shown in gameplay. It took Cal a good startup to pull out a Drop Pod from a ditch.
                She was only wearing Mk. IV though, and that only doubled strength. Mk. VI quintuples it and Gen 3 is absolutely ridiculous.
        “This doesn’t seem physically possible!” The marines as they watch a spartan causally flip their 5 ton warthog, equipped with a 700 pound gauss rifle, plus ammunition for the rifle, supplies, ammo, and medicine for the marines. XD
            They are that strong lol.
            >“This doesn’t seem physically possible!”

That's exactly what Jimmy kept saying.
    thank you this question just came across my mind and now I can sleep.
All human vehicles in halo have super gyroscopes that respond to standard UNSC neutral interfaces, so you just have to touch them...  and stand back. Yeah.
Min-maxing. The Rookie took the stat points that would have been allocated to Charisma and put them all into Strength.
Spartans can flip warthogs, can go melee with mongoose, but they might not be able to flip tanks, but still, i think they might actually, given that Spartans can go melee with hunters that are stronger than brutes who are about hundred times stronger than peak humans, i would like to see Spartans like jorge or sam flipping entire tanks,

About the odst, i think they have some kind of war game simulation like spartan 4s, connected with their neural interface and welcomed into virtual combat training
    > but they might not be able to flip tanks

They can. Frank O'Connor notes that they can in the *Halo Legends* commentary track. That said, it may not be as simple or easy as it looks in game (naturally).
With one thrust of their gargantuan balls of steel
    lol
Because it's a video game.
Gameplay mechanic. In lore they can’t do it, not alone at least.
Gameplay mechanic. If you wanted a lore explanation, in the Uplift Reserve mission notice that the entire Marine squad runs up to the Warthog once you secure the area. Consider that the lore version is that it took the whole squad to right the Warthog, but for the sake of gameplay we just get the same mechanic as Halo 3 of press X to create a controlled gravitational anomaly to spin this vehicle right side up.

So, in reality, no a single ODST couldn't flip a hog, but an entire Marine squad possibly could.
of course it was so obvious.
