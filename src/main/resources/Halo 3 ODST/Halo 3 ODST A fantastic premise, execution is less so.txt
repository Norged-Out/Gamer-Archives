[[Halo 3 ODST A fantastic premise, execution is less so]]


I think this is an unpopular opinion among Halo fans, but I finished ODST today and was ultimately disappointed by how similar the game is the other Halo games.

I really loved what ODST was trying to go for. The whole idea of playing as a marine in the Halo universe lends itself to some interesting concepts. The New Mombasa streets sections gave me a lot of hope for the game: I'm a marine by myself in a dark and gloomy city devoid of any other human life and filled with hostiles. Coupled with the music, this was giving a fun a different (different for Halo) atmosphere. I thought the semi-'open world' city was unnecessary, but otherwise I was liking the game. The big let down comes with the actual levels when you play as the other ODST squad members (and the last levels as the Rookie), those levels end up feeling no different that any other Halo level. Sure I can't jump as high, I have stamina instead of shields, and seem to die quicker, but otherwise I feel just as capable as an ODST marine as I do as Master Chief. It was all a massive let down because I was expecting the game to be much more different that it's predecessors.

I think ODST should've leaned more into some survival horror elements. Stick with the dark and dreary atmosphere throughout the entire game instead of just the city sections and make every enemy encounter feel dangerous. I want a single brute to be a challenge instead of a dozen being no problem in the final fight. Also I would just drop the semi-open world entirely, I don't think it really helped the game.

It feels that Bungie attempted to do something different, but either got cold feet or just is incapable of making anything other than just standard Halo because they didn't really stray too far. I don't think it's a bad game by any means, it's as enjoyable as the previous Halos, I was just expecting something actually different and not just Halo 3.5.

    I would love a new odst spin off with different mechanics, instead of still playing as if we were spartans. Hell, Infinity Ward would probably do a good enough job on this if they could get away from the cod franchise for a bit.


Just in case, I'm not asking to change 343, just that spin off games could be done by different studios to spice things up, kinda like Arkham Origins in a way.
    > You have to look at the game in the context of the time it came out though.

That is a very good point, though it can often be hard to do so.

> I mean I just wanted more Halo back then so I bought this at launch, loved it, 

And that is the thing, as another Halo it's a good and fun game. My problem is that I got a certain impression from the beginning city sections that ODST was going to be *more* different when instead I found it not to be much different overall.

With all of the studios Microsoft owns now, it would be interesting to see them give a Halo game to someone else to do something more similar to what I was expecting. Maybe all I want is Star Wars Republic Command but with Halo.

Thing is, Bungie with ODST is a bit of a story. From memory, so I may have misremembered certain things, ODST was meant to be a DLC for Halo 3. At the same time, ODST came after Bungie negotiate a split from Microsoft & that negotiation ended in Microsoft saying to Bungie that they could leave but only after releasing 3 more games, which would end up being Halo 3, ODST, Reach. If I remember correctly, ODST even had a smaller team working on it.

Now, that last line is interesting because I read somewhere that it was during the same time that they were meant to be helping Peter Jackson's game studio with their Halo game. Jackson's Halo game was gonna involve you playing as a Promethean, remember them?, in a semi-open world with some stealth elements, remember this? However, Jackson's game never came to fruition, same fate as his Halo film, & Bungie then reused some of the ideas for ODST. 343 then reused some for Halo 4.
There's no way Bungie/343 would make a Halo game without it being a straight-up shooter.

What you are asking for would have gotten them killed by the fanbase.

Incidentally I didn't like ODST at all, but not because of your reason. I felt the level/city design was just boring and looked all the same. And it was way too dark everywhere.
    Someone didn't find the VISR button...
        I kinda get where they're coming from though, it starts feeling kinda useless if you need to have it on at all times. Having it off becomes kinda like a hard mode.
            Oh no doubt, I just saw a good time to throw some jokes lol. Gimme that up vote back! I was on a round 20 yo

I still wanted an FPS game, but I just wanted it to play into the idea of being much weaker than Master Chief. Spin-offs are exactly where studios can play with doing something different. As long as they market it as being a different spin-off, I don't think they would upset the fans too much.

>  I felt the level/city design was just boring and looked all the same

That probably comes from the city being only a single section that you would re-traverse between levels. It all looked the same because it often was all the same. I think it would've been much better to keep the atmosphere of the city and just make the linear levels with that. They could still do some different unique areas.

> And it was way too dark everywhere.

It does seem like an odd design choice that you basically needed the VISR because of how dark it is, and there is no downside so you just leave it active at all times.
The marketing of that game when it released made it seem like it was going to be a detective game of some sort, with shooting sections. Not like Layton but still that you were investigating something in the city.
ODST is the one game I didn't finish. For me I didn't hate a specific part of it. What I hated was the flip between Halo action and quiet city streets. I would prefer if they just stuck to one style and polished it instead of trying to play both camps

Just gave me whiplash and lost my interest
It’s called Halo 3: ODST. You set yourself up for disappointment thinking it wouldn’t be halo 3.5 when it’s in the title. It sounds like you liked the game but you were expecting a different approach. Halo 3 wasn’t broke and didn’t need to be fixed. It was marketed as a new game but this is an expansion to Halo 3. It was $5 dlc for Halo MCC while Reach was $10 dlc. 

That being said, this is my favorite game. The music, the atmosphere, the characters, the dialogue, and confetti coming out of grunts heads has never been so appealing.
    I did know beforehand that it was just an expandalone of H3, but Bungie was trying to do something different, but they couldn't/didn't go the full mile. I appreciate what they were doing with the city sections, I just wish that was expanded into the entire game.
You're supposed to be an ODST, a normal soldier, and feel weaker than master chief.

But the game plays exactly the same, you have nearly the same health as chief, the same mobility, and you're a killing machine. Makes no sense.

I personally found it boring. Too much walking through the empty map at turtle pace. The new weapons were cool tho
Glad I’m not the only one. I really feel like ODST didn’t make the player feel very vulnerable, I still felt able to take on covenant squadrons by myself on heroic. I feel they should’ve leant further into the stealth side of the game; make the silenced weapons actually silent, hugely decrease melee damage, maybe create a fully fledged stealth mechanic?
I would love a new odst spin off with different mechanics, instead of still playing as if we were spartans. Hell, Infinity Ward would probably do a good enough job on this if they could get away from the cod franchise for a bit.
