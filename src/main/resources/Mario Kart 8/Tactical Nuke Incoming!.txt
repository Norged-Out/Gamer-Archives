[[Tactical Nuke Incoming!]]





Nice throw, that’s some crazy skill
    Thank you, there was a lot of hope behind the throw
        What’s your VR?
            I believe it’s somewhere in the 50,000
                Damn I’m barely cracking 3,000
                    I mean I’ve played online since the beginning of the Booster Pass, thus why I have a lot of VR (because I’ve played a lot since then), in the end they are just numbers, not ranking system.
Luigi's got some arm on him oml
Nice bomb snipe, and it's nice to see another fellow Sports Coupe user in the high vr levels.

Actual chad throwing a bomb forward and keeping the shell at the end
This is the only snipe clip I’ve seen where my jaw has dropped
That’s some throw for sure
Speaking of "Tactical Nuke™", am I the only one who at first thought it was "time to go nuke"? There was some Flipnote, possibly sourced from a pre-existing YouTube video, and it went like this. "Yes, 25-kill streak! TIME TO GO NUKE (TACTICAL NUKE™)!!!" and then it explodes.

...I blame the crusty Flipnote audio.
I’d be screaming if that happened to me, nice clip.
That boy Luigi got a CANNON on him gotdamn
That was the best snipe I've ever seen wow!
Right on! I love launching a bomb out of a flip. Especially on ExciteBike course.
How is it possible to throw that far ahead?
That clip was perhaps the most beautiful I have ever seen
WHAT A SNIPE!!!

    Uh… that’s never been a thing
Well played
I would’ve quit so hard
Best snipe I’ve seen in a min, good one
That Mario must be absolutely seething
So gooood!!
Great job dude
Ima assume he was able to throw it way further was due to the blue line that adjusts ur kart with a glider which must've also sped the bomb's speed up making it go that far and hitting the player in 1st. Now this is just an assumption and if I'm wrong.... well ima just be scratching my head and being puzzled on how he able to do that then
    And the speed effect was probably increased more when he did a trick shot, idk how else to comprehend what i saw today
Dang, nice!
That was so cold lol
