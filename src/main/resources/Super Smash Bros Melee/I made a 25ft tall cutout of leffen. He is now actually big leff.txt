[[I made a 25ft tall cutout of leffen. He is now actually big leff]]

    Lmao
    what‚Äôs the context for that?
        The Hax$ ‚Äúevidence.zip 2.0‚Äù or whatever it was called
            What was that?
                The Pepe Silvia of Melee
                    I got B0XXes full of pepe!
                Hax posted a nearly 3 hour video rambling about how leffen is actually evil and a cult leader that will destroy the smash community. 

His evidence of that was that Leffen blocks people on twitter, used a light yagami twitter profile picture and that he wore a red adidas shirt on stream. Super unhinged.
                    Crazy time.
                    Don't forget Leff posturing as the defender of sexual assault victims.
Scientist holding test tube: Finally. Big Leff!
I thought, "Reminds me of that one holo fan."

When I realized lol

You, sir, have godlike taste. Other things, too, but I'll focus on that.
    I was about to check post history to see if it was the same guy lol

edit: NOT ONLY THAT THIS IS THE AX YAGOO GUY AND THE HOLO WALL GUY WHAT
        Clearly, he's a man of many passions.
            or hes simply trying to launder a glue addiction thats spiraling out of control
    didn't even notice it was the same guy lol nice
The fact that this is life sized is crazy
I can‚Äôt get over how you chose a picture of you blinking
    It‚Äôs someone who thought making a 25ft cut out of a melee player was a good idea üòê
    Not blinking, averting eyes from a deity
THE FUCKING MAIZONO GUY???
    Oh yes
Literally why
    [deleted]
        Definitely took this photo in front of his mansion
            weirdly bitter comment chain
we have now gone beyond big leff

introducing: kaiju leff
I‚Äôll have one Humongous Hjelte please
Why
Imagine this going on an art auction‚Ä¶ honestly that wouldn‚Äôt be a bad Idea.
Dude you're a legend

Your sayaka maizono vid is so good
    I appreciate although I‚Äôm curious which one lol, I‚Äôm curious which one as I want to know like what people like so I can figure out which direction I should go
        The one where you show your entire house, the cutouts, your social media accounts, etc and its all sayaka maizono

Just do more unhinged insane weeb stuff like that, that shit goes so hard
            I appreciate it I shall
Man, I wish my parents were this rich when I was growing up and that they wouldn't have kicked my ass for wasting their money on shit like this.
    He's stated before that his dad deducts it from his taxes as a "business expense"
        Does this kiddo realize that his posts are evidence of a crime lol?
            I'll do my best to express this in the kindest way possible and without making any sweeping generalizations:

This is a young man who seems to have very intense passion and a wealth of knowledge when it comes to a small group of topics that have grabbed his interest. When it comes to skills outside his area of interest, I'm not sure if he's made much progress, and I suspect that it's by no fault of his own.
why
What could you possibly do with this thing? There's no way you could bring it to an event, and I don't know about your house but it definitely wouldn't fit anywhere in any house I've ever lived in
    He did a similar thing with the CEO of Hololive (anime girl streamer group) and brought the whole thing to a convention. He absolutely can and does bring these things to events.
Now we have to sumerge him and obtain Deep Leff.
"Leffen and his ego" to-scale
Hilarious
r/madlads
Cool :)
I am proud
A little creepy tbh. Only a little, though.
Accurate Representation of Leffens ego
That is indeed humongus! Very nice
little fucking weird dude, it's not as funny of a joke as it might seem
    Yeah man it's pretty scary. Never seen something so big
    Pretty funny to me and I would gladly purchase this from him.  

Your comment wasn't as necessary as it might seem.
The Dark Triad comes out of the ground like a ghost.
Idk why you'd even give this pos the time of day. He's a horrible person. Leffen is literally the Keemstar of Smash, using his notoriety and cult following to destroy any smash player he doesn't like personally then lying about the reason behind it.
I didn't know a piece of shit could grow
Lmao
