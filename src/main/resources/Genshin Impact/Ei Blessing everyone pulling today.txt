[[Ei Blessing everyone pulling today]]





Today? TODAY?!!!
    Her banner starts in 12~ hours for NA
        ..
i have 11 primogems
            Best of luck, lmao
            Time to start hustling then.
            Better start grinding lol
            wallet-kun will save you!
                or truck-kun if you can manage to wake up in a world where you're rich and genshin exists
                    Wish misunderstood, you have reincarnated as Xingqiu.
                        Happy cake day 

I'm already a book addict so that's ok
                    Nooo then you”d have to deal with the Sakoku Decree and Vision Hunt Decree and geopolitical realities and you’d never get her!
                I have three dollars.
            That should be enough
            Your avatar makes this so much better
            7. That's the best I can do. Take it or leave it.
            i have 3200 primogems but I lost my 50/50 to the last banner... but check this, I lost my 50:50 to MONA!!!! on YAE MIKOS BANNER!!!!
            Did Yae steal everything?
        Already up in Asia now
            Shouldn't it be up in the EU as well already? It's still not.
                3 and a half hours left. You can check the timeline on paimon.moe, but new banners always go up at 5PM GMT when they're not preceded by a maintenance/patch release.
                    Paimon Moe says it should already be available.
                        Are you sure you checked the "show local time"? Because I have it set to the EU server and the timer is at 3:36 as of this post.
                            Okay yeah I saw it now. You have to select your server as you said. Thanks a lot man. I didn’t use this site too much.
                                Yeah, no problem! It happens -- I don't use the site much either.
        I have 2 pulls, its fine
        7 hours ? Edit : you are playin in na right?
            Am playing in NA
        I got her 2 hours ago...
            Notice the “for NA” part
                yeah just commenting on how slow NA is
        fuck /u/spez
            I’m not sure, but it’s pretty common for gacha games to releases content to Asian servers first
All hail the Electro Archon!
I'm honestly excited. I don't have Bennett, and Sara as well. I have enough to reach 50/50, so we'll see where that takes me. After this, I'll save everything for Itto.
Update: Got her, c3 Sara and c0 Bennett :)
    Itto’s gonna be awhile 😬
        I realize that, but it's even better, I could make my teams better while I'm waiting for him. I have absolutely no problem with saving primos so for me it's an absolute win :D
            I like your attitude!  
Meanwhile I am basically addicted to pulling and can't help pulling for any character I like when I should be saving for the ones I *really* like.
            Itto is so good I got him got him not awesome but decent artifacts got for him gorou zhongli and bennet all of them not really good builded yet and my C0 Itto is hitting 70k with Ushi
    i spent over 8k primos for bennett c1 but it gave me every 4-star's c1 but bennett's

side note: got kokomi on soft pity tho
        Congrats on Kokomi! Let's hope that I could c1 Bennett, I'd love to see it.
    Eyy I’m planning to save everything for Itto too
        We'll definitely get him when he's gonna have a rerun, cheers!
            That’s right! Tho I’m sad, i started playing right after his banner ended and i saw his gameplay and went (/;-;)/ come back Itto. Best of luck to us both xD
                I'm sad as well, but oh well - silver lining is, we'll definitely have him. Can't wait to throw Ushi around lol
                    EYY I GOT RAIDEN JUST NOW BEST OF LUCK TO YOU
                        WOW THAT'S INSANE, congrats!!! Thank you as well! I still need to wait 2 more hours for the banner :D
    Good luck

Since when did you start playing?
        Thank you! I started playing since the very beginning, but I definitely had long breaks, for personal reasons, and because of that I missed on so much content...but I started playing again 3 weeks ago! AR50, still a long way to go!
    I have enough to reach 50/50 as well.  I am saving for Kazuha though.  No idea how long before his banner, but I have wanted to draw on him since I started playing.
    Try to get Bennett's C1 too, it's his most important constellation. Trust me, it's completely worth it
    c5 sara, c2 (from c1) bennet, qiqi, raiden, mona and 60 into pity for kokomi   
probably the best banner yet for me
    We had almost the exact same pulls! Won my (first ever) 50/50 with c4 Sara and c0 Bennett! Kinda want c1 Bennett, c6 Sara, and wouldn’t hurt to get c1 Shogun…………..
        Wow, congrats!! It was also my first ever 50/50 won, I lost my first one to Zhongli. I also want to get Shogun constellations; what do you say, are you up to save for 6+ months to get a packed Shogun? xD
            Congrats to you too! I think we had good pulls all things considered :) Well c2 is as far as I would go I think… gonna wait until the 2.6 livestream to see who the next banner characters are and if I don’t need any of them, I’ll spend everything else on this banner. After that, I’m saving for Kazuha!
    Rumors have it that >!Itto banner might rerun on 2.7!<
    > I don't have Bennett

Same! And even if it takes a C20 Xinyan and real money I'm 100% getting a C1 Bennett and it will be worth it lol
bruh i didnt even notice the sign i hate myself so much

Edit: thanks to this image I got shogun :D
    I understand. Her eyes are really beautiful, right?
    there’s a sign??
        A big one
            You mean two big ones?
    I hope that the Hydro Archon is half as hot as Ei is since she's such a treat on the eyes and ears.
    Sign?
Me who just got reset to 0 pity after getting Ganyu:
    Well worth it. Ganyu is the best.
I’m ready! 60 pity, 180 wishes saved, farmed all her mats already.
    Have fun!
        Thanks I did! I lost a 50/50 to Diluc....but she came home and now I have lv80 Raiden! And 87 wishes left
            i did 50 draws at 3 pity lol no luck :(
                5*s don’t come home before soft pity for me either. But her banner just started and there’s events soon so you have plenty of time to save more primos!
                    i need ways to get more primos i would do abyss but im stuck lol
I don't need luck when I have guaranteed.
    Same here lol

But it would be nice not having to spend many primos
    Did u get one? i did
    Im jelly
    I have guaranteed

but no primos
        oof
    [Travelers, get ready](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM1UxIigH9w)
    Same! I just pulled and I'm on 59 pity. I need to grind more :/
        grinding for me is boring :(
I wish everyone who's pulling on her banner to win the 50/50

EDIT: I won the 50/50, she came home at 72 pulls
    I don’t have bennet, using 10k to get as much of him as I can and if I can manage to get raiden… even better.
I wish my luck will be as big as those
Nope, got my first Qiqi and now I'm bankrupt

(I just want a Mona...)
    i got both qiqi and mona today, raiden in between them, good luck
Already got her the first time...skipped so many characters because i had 50/50. 

Now i have my two most wanted inazuma characters: Yae and Ei. 

If i can, i might get yoimiya during her rerun.
    Yaaaay congratulations! So happy for you
        Thank you <3
I didn't get Zhongli or Ganyu. I didn't get Yae. What makes you think I can get Ei? My luck is terrible.
    well whats ur pity at? and how many draws?
        Well... I kind of forget to count pity.. all I know is that I wished at least 15 times for Zhongli, a bit after I got Shenhe, a few times for Yae (but I'm bad at estimating and remembering events properly so I'm not sure)
            You can check the banner history to count your pity. 

Or use paimon.moe
                Oh ok thanks
                    so whats ur pity now?
                        I haven't checked yet but I'll get back to you when I do
                            ok!
don't ask me about any colors
    What color was the words on the sign?
Won the 50/50, my happiness is immeasurable
    Congratulations I'm so happy for you buddy
Please let me win 50/50 🙏🏾
I just pulled, I don't think ei is the grandmaster of mondstat
    Nah she just got into cosplay after reading so many Light Novels

(in all seriousness im so sorry hope she can manage to come home early on guarantee)
I loss
Didn't get her :(
    sad :(
I will note fail you, Ei
-raiden wanters
Just got raiden after 15 pulls from the previous 5 star
    Holy shit congratulations
    wait, is it actually true you can get raiden in low pity?
        It's true with any character banner but the chances are extremely low
        yeah but i lost all my 50/50s
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
May RNGjesus bless everyone with their waifu today.
Didn't work got Mona :/
    mona is just a cheaper raiden soooooo

&#x200B;

oops lol
        Mona is nothing like raiden shogun, they are completely different 0_o
            I feel like they are similar mona being a cheaper raiden
                Mona uses catalysts, is hydro, has a burst that is a bit complicated, Raiden shogun uses spears, is electro, has a burst that deals damage up front... They are nothing alike.
                    crap thought of kequing lol
lost to qiqi
59 wishes, no luck. But hey, pity at 78, 3 Bennets and 2 Saras.

Still a month worth of primos to farm, so it should be arright if I get the 50/50. If not... ;\_\_\_\_;
    gl!
        Many thanks <3
        I lost the 50 / 50

&#x200B;

;\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_;
            to who? just no Qiqi's.....
                a 2nd Jean
                    oof

i hope u get enough primos if you go for shogun again
Thank god i win the 50/50

The fortune slip is really working lol
Thank Raiden i fucking won the 50/50 (70 wishes).
im looking respectfully
lost to 50~50 pull for Jean but got Raiden 30 pulls laters!!

That was from saved BP gems since Kokomi. So decided to top up 30 and with some balance BP gems got her weapon at within 50 pulls. Thank you!! her weapon storage is definitely big
    Omg congratulations
    Same thing happened to me. I was dying inside when I got Jean, but 20 pulls later, Raiden came home! :D
        so u got on 20 pity?
            It seems so!
                hope I get Ei within 50 pulls then!
        Jean is great for healing and farming though. Toss mages and assassins in water for instant kill
            Yeah, but it's not great when you get her for the fourth time 💀
                And here I am, still waiting to get her. I've been playing since launch and I still don't have her and Mona.
                I guess considering the things you had to give up but c3 mean sounds kind of awesome to me
What time does the banner release?
    In 15minutes for asia,7hours eu,13 hours NA
I would need it
No 50/50 this time lets goooooo
    Im jealous
    Got her after 50 try’s :D
Thx. I hope i can get you my future main
Is the Miko banner already gone? Fuuuuuuuck
    You have a few more hours this morning i think (Im US EST)
        Well, I am at work but I do not think I have enough time to gather more wishes anyways. Was hoping it would be a few more days as I was so busy with Elden Ring I haven't noticed it's almost gone already
            Similar boat. Was busy playing Lost Ark instead lol And I bought 3 months worth of Welkin prior so def missed out on hundreds of Primogems whoops!
                Oh now that u mention it I completely forgot about my welkin... oof
            Yeah, I'm glad I went ahead and got Miko right at the start of her banner and pre-farmed.  Since Elden Ring released, I've spent very little time on Genshin outside of doing dailies and weekly bosses/bounties
                Oh yeah I farmed for Miko too and got her level 90 day 1 but because of the energy recharge problem I wanted to try for a C1. Maybe next time for I try for Ei C1 now
                    Yeah, I got c1 and it definitely makes a big difference
        im waiting 9 hours till new banners here
I already have her but imma pull for fun since I got her on 5 pity last time.
    Pulling Raiden for fun. Have we achieved utopia?
        Crazy times
(＾་།＾)
Soon ™
Got enough to hit my 90th wish on my F2P account I started a few weeks ago, let's hope the 50/50 odds are in my favor!
    good luck!
Pffffft... I'm not pulling for the shogun. 

&#x200B;

I need engulfing lightning... Please, donut stay away from me.
    Only reason I'm not pulling for Engulfing lightning because of that damn doughnut. 😅
I got her now, that's 3 50/50s won, haven't loss one yet.

Tried pulling for her weapon (already has the catch, but why not), and got bennett to c1 (in weapon banner lmao) and xingqiu to c5 instead.
    Congrats on the c5 xingqiu. If you didn't know, he's confirmed to be a reward for a particular 2.6 patch event so don't buy his c6 from the shop.
        I was wrong, checked again, it was c4, my sleep deprived ass thought it was c5 and was excited when I got him that time. Kind of debating whether to buy one of the blackcliffs or just get xingqiu to c5 instead. Just need to get enough starglitters for it (since I bought 10 more wishes)
    EPIC
    You fool! Now you just jinxed yourself!

Congrats btw, also won the 50/50 myself.
Ok so



I just c6 my bennett after rolling.
Ye pls, bless my last attempt to get Yae
I just ran out of gems trying to get a sword, so... No Ei for me.
I want Kokomi and Ayato, and I have a guaranteed
Got her in 40 pulls while listening to Mozart's Lacrimosa
God bless ei. Plz give my Genshin luck the same luck on fifa
I’m glad I already got her! Good luck to everyone!
Got C2 today, winning 50/50 twice.
wonder if her sales will be as high as her first run. IIRC she had the highest sales currently.
I failed to get C2 on the first banner. Ran out of primo.

REVENGE, MIHOYO.

Update: got the C2. I think I set some sort of record on how many character banner 50/50's I've won in a row. I'm screwed for Ayato. I can feel it.
Too much boobie
I won 50/50 for the first time
Aaaaaah an arm and a leg for Ei! All these great banners try my limited luck. After 2.5 I should have some breathing room. Maybe Kazuha but im not sure if I want to wish only for meta reasons.
saving for God knows how long, at 42k primogems atm and aiming for her C4 (C2 atm) and weapon.
Thank you :3
Ayo saved on both accounts. We’re ready for c2 on my paid account and c0 on my f2p.
Finally!!! I have 184 wishes saved up (last wish made was 12/13/21) and the 50/50 went to Jean last time 🤣 so one Raiden is a sure thing 😍
Shogun wanters will be shogun havers. Best of luck to all pulling for her.
the power of the bewbs worked for me, 2nd 10 pull :)

&#x200B;

Thanks man!
I got her, had already farmed stuff for her to get to lvl 80. Didn't even lose the 50/50.
No idea if it was this post but....

I had saved up 110 wishes. 7 wishes since my last 5 star, so a long way to go till the next one. And next one would be 50/50.

I did go from not having Raiden to C2 Raiden in those 110 wishes.

Thank you very much\^\^
    >I did go from not having Raiden to C2 Raiden in those 110 wishes.

! :O That's crazy lucky and a nice damage buff. Enjoy 🤘🏻
I just pulled her!
    Congrats! Enjoy 😁
Very nice boobs...er I mean wish!
    lmao
Well 4 minutes and 2 pulls in and I'm already Qiqi'ed.

At least Ayato's guaranteed now.
    qiqi'ed lol
I got her boiiii mommy is home boiiiii
    Let's goooo
I lost to mona but the next 5 star is raiden

I screamed and shouted like a maniac cause I am so happy. 
I love this game. Btw f2p

Anyways mona is my favorite cause of the dash :)
    Epic gamer moment

Congrats
        Thank you, I am so happy that I am hugging my pillow so hard
        I'm so confused. Of course the next five star was riding what was great about this?
Thanks! It helped. Got C1 on my first 10 pull.
    Hooray!
I got C2 RAIDEN in 1 tell pull on my F2P account
https://youtu.be/1FzeVzUBJqk
Ei come home! Yae waiting for you 😜
    Good strategy
        yes
First thing that catched my eye when I was scrolling wasn't her face but her boobs ^^'
    huh
Because of this, i got c1 raiden in 20 pity, effectively removing my guaranteed i was saving for venti, while i was trying to get a c5 bennett, got him the next pull.


I am, in fact, fucked in the ass as i only have 20 pity, no guaranteed, 271 primos and a most likely venti rerun in 2.6 together with ayaya and ayayo


C1 doesnt work if there isnt another electro character using burst so its useless in my spot


Pls pray for my family and grades, im gonna speedrun 100%-ing chasm for a venti when 2.6 comes

edit: turns out i got raiden at 11 pity and i somehow have 30 pity despite having 20 before getting raiden
    u got a 5 star in 20 pity?
        Yep, somehow
            u dont need raiden? or not want to use raiden?
                I use raiden but not on a electro resonance team like with sara, bennett, and a flex

i use her on a full archon team (Venti (which i potentially cant get due to this accident), zhongli, raiden, and a flex (can be bennett but will be later replaced by dendro archon)
                    well if u ever dont want raiden ill take ur raiden lol
                        Only the constellation lol
                            ill take the constellation and use rituals to turn it into a raiden
                                Heres a ritual that i used when i got the accidental raiden if you want (only works when u completed raiden's 2nd story quest tho):

- get a waverider in ritou

- drive it to one of the docks of liyue harbor and jump out

- get back in the waverider and go to the heart-shaped island then climb up the pillar there

- go back again and go to the Dragonspine Ruin grader near the shore

- dont make him fight you, just shoot random cannons from ur waverider then leave again with ur waverider

- go to the unnamed island

- interact with the time dial then go to the centerpoint of the island

- wish
                                    good thing im done the 2nd story
Unfortunatly gonna have to skip her but may Ei wanters be Ei havers! Good luck everyone!
Recently pulled for and got Yae so didn't have high hopes, but I had managed to get together 10 fates since then so I did a 10 pull and prayed. Cheered when I saw my screen blessed with a golden meteor giving me a Qiqi!

Anyway, I still had like 600 primos left after that, so I decided I might as well use them. A couple pulls later and I got Raiden. Then immediately a second Raiden on my third pull.

And that's how I got C2 Raiden and my first Qiqi while thinking my chances of getting anything at all were basically 0.
I have 2 goals. Kokomi and Bennet C1. (don't have him yet)

If I get Kokomi before Bennet C1, I will continue on raiden banner.

Anything left will be saved for Kazuha. Currently sitting on 21k Primo's and 28 fates, no guarantee. Still have to wait 6 hours.

Update: Got Kokomi, C1 bennet, Sara, even a Xiangling. IN 70 PULLS =D. 16k primo's left for Kazuha.
    f2p?
        Yeah, I think they forgot to end with, "I'm f2p btw lul"
            wow how u got somany primos then?
        No, I bought welkin

I still quite new, so still a lot of content for me to do. Currently Mona and Ganyu are my only 5 stars. This will be the second event banner I will be wishing on. Even though I am AR50, so I saved it up.
            ok
I pulled 30 and I get 3 Xinyan

BRB, gone to burn this account.

At least gimme one copy of Bennett ffs
Why everyone focusing on Raiden? Kokomo is insane good
deadass pulled a Miko

im asia
Damn she's making me wanna do a different pull
Single roll, no pity and got her
    fr?!!!
No need, I already have Ei the last time she was here
First and last character I will spend money on. I purposely bought the 100$ pack before the shop reset so I don't buy primos again. Luckily enough, 100$ is all I needed to get C2. Contemplating if I should try to get her weapon or save for Ayato
    She was the 2nd character I spent money on, the other was Kazuha. Not proud of the spending but didn't regret it either lmao Managed to get her C2(plus Jean lol) so I'm already happy and will be skipping all her reruns for other characters. She's so worth it!
    That's a lot of money to spend on this kind of game. As long as you can afford it go for it
sorry, I tried to pull your friend Kokomi instead. But it didn't work out. I got Qiqi'd. I asked for a healer. I guess they obliged, just gave me the wrong one.
I don't know... should I? or save for... I don't even know what, to be honest. how fucking amazing is she? and in what situations?
FUCK You QIQI!
I hope I win my 50/50 for her c1
Dont let them breast fool you
Got 3 Bennetts and 2 Favonious Warbow. Really dissapointed now my Bennetts at c5 with 2 extra pulls i couldn't use with Sara at c0 and that rock chick at c4. Bad luck so far but wasn't really trying to get any of the 5 stars. Wished I got more Sara.

Edit: 3 pulls today. One was a weapon, thrilling tales probably. Then an early Mona (was about 50 pulls in). I thought nice.. next ones a confirm. Pulled one more and got Raiden. Pretty sure odds of a double 5 star is pretty rare so I'm stoked af. Though should've pulled on Kokomi though.
Fuck i only have enough primogems for 3 pulls 🥲
I got her in 70 pulls
got c1 in 40 pulls only
i already have raiden on my second acc since her first banner but i neither have bennet nor XQ xd
What's her eye colour? NOW!
Spent 70 rolls, lost the 50/50 and had to spend 70 more rolls, but hey Jean C4 is actually very good.
Thank you Ei, I'll need it
I already have her C2 and saving up for Ayato and Venti instead. So I'm wishing everyone wishing for her(and Kokomi) the best of luck!!! Manifesting Ei and Kokomi for y'all 🙏🏼
can you cook? no? then get off the banner!
still waiting on na server

edit: got both raiden and kokomi
I have enough for a 90 pull and i already have 35 pity. Hopefully this mean a constellation for raiden. Also i can finally get benny lmao
Time to finally get C3 for my the best girl!
im just here for the Weapon
I woke up today and my monitor is broken, nice blessing
Unrelated but why does the post have nsfw tag? booba?
Cuuuuuuuuuuute.
Lost my 50/50 on Yae for Mona. ~30 wishes deep, with ~45 saved up. 🙏🏻
More than 70 wishes and couldn’t get her. Unlucky.
the second i got the banner, i dumped 27 wishes. got 1 bell, 2 constellations for bennet (making that c3 bennet) and 1 constellation for kujou sara (making that c2 sara)  


61 pity. hope to get 20 pulls lol. otherwise, i can wait if kazuha ever gets a rerun banner because im on guarentee rn
No way I'm getting her. I won way too many 50/50 before. Now it's gonna be a long line of losing them.
I'm going to pull for her weapon. I'll tell y'all when I get R2 Doughnut
I already got her. Lost the 50/50 last time, this time it was a victory.
Well I farmed so much for the pink fox Im sure I'll have enough pity

*cries*
I lost 50/50 but it was C1 for Jean, my main so I'm quite happy :)
i'm curious... how much would it cost to get her if you have zero pity?
    Depends if you're at guaranteed featured or 50/50

If you're at 50/50 it can take up to 180 pulls (realistically like 160ish)

If you're at guaranteed then 90 ( realistically like 80)
I lost my first 50/50 to Mona (which I was perfectly ok with) on the Ganyu banner before it ended, now I have about 110 pulls to work with on the Raiden banner. Hopefully if I lose the 50/50 again I’ll still be able to get her by the end of the banner. But I really hope I win the 50/50, thank you
Got Mona… already wanted 20 rolls more, but i will get her before banner ends
    Best of luck to you 🍀
        Thanks now trying with every single wish. Went rly unlucky with this roll. Pismom.moe shows me i rolled mona AT 80 pity
Thank you I hope I can get her and then c2 her
Glad I already got Raiden the first time around.  Going to try for Kokomi and then lie in wait to see if Kazuha gets a rerun soon.  I was thinking of going all out to get the last two Ayaka combinations, but getting Kokomi and Kazuha instead would strengthen my account a lot more
    Fist bump, same here.

Just got Kokomi with only 70 wishes, did not have guarantee. Now I have quite some primogems left for Kazuha!
        Congrats!  Hope you get him
Got c2 . Very excited
    **That's a lot of damage**. Enjoy  ☻
Soo I had Raiden and wanted c2..but after 80 pulls I got c1...I will wait another re run for c2...I need to save for Ayato now
    Well the chance to get her 2 times in 80 wishes is quite small. Even if you started with guarantee.
        Yeah I know. I had guarantee soo i though that maybe I would be lucky but its okay c1 is good and c2 will come one day.
    >Soo I had Raiden and wanted c2..but after 80 pulls I got c1...I will wait another re run for c2...I need to save for Ayato now

I was even more overconfident. Didn't have Raiden but i was close to pity. 121 pulls. Wanted C2. What did i get? Mona and C0 Ei 🙃 Oh well. At least we have her 🤞🏻
        Yeah, Raiden is soo good. My favorite character. Mona is good too soo dont be sad haha
She have costed 170 fates (50/50 lost), pain.
    But you still got her tho?
        Yeah, but at what cost xD
            >Yeah, but at what cost xD

I also wasted 130 wishes to only get a C0 if that makes you feel any better... 😆
I have a guaranteed and already have Raiden (my first limited *5 when started playing). But I'm contemplating the idea of getting cons of her. 

Good luck anyone pulling for her.
    Not an expert, but youtubers recommend is to either leave het c0 or go for c2. So either have enough saved up for a chance on c2 or get c1 now so you can get her c2 in the future. Or leave her at c0.
    >I have a guaranteed and already have Raiden (my first limited *5 when started playing). But I'm contemplating the idea of getting cons of her. 

"If" you're guaranteed i would highly suggest against C1 **if** you really want another Character really bad like Kazuha or Venti. Those are supposed to rerun in the near Future
Omg i had the most insane luck got raiden, sara c0, Bennett c5 and engulfing lighting c0 in 80 pulls.

Did i just waste my entire luck in my lifespan?
    >Did i just waste my entire luck in my lifespan?

Most likely yes. That's crazy. Enjoy tho! :)
Me who got Diluc in her banner: *Sigh*

***Rage and salt, this player speedrun researching a plane in War Thunder. Yes, he got that plane which is Ta-152 H1.***

*~~should buy J2M3 as ritual smh~~*
Got er!
50/50 was qiqi

never playing this game again
Saved 180 wishes, got her 2times with 130.. thats fine. 
50 wishes for the next waifu that will be released
Bruh it felt like yae’s banner started a week ago and we’re already on the second half of 2.5
lost the 50/50 to qiqi, got raiden 30 pulls later and there was mona in the same multi after her so now i'm back to the guarantee for free  
got c2(from 1) bennet and c5 sara while i was at it, i assume i'll get sara to c6 in the next 30 pulls in the kokomi banner since i have 60 in pity by now
3rd 50/50 i lost and its Qiqi who im never gonna use, i got 4th const on Xinyan, 2nd on Sara and 3rd time i pull Ninguang after c6, rip fates and primos time to farm for 4 months again
I lost my 50/50.. but hey at least I got Jean.

Still mad at myself I rolled on the Yea Miko banner after I lost my first 50/50. Didnt expect to get Yae after 20 wishes.

I really wanted Raiden so bad though. The pain.

I have a C4 Bennett now and a C2 Sara. Didnt have either char yet
    I wanted Raiden so bad as well but didn’t get her after like 80 wishes and got Diluc and some other instead. So sad.
        Same I had like 85+ wishes.. sucks to be us
            We‘re just bunch of unlucky Bennett‘s.
Thank you Ei. I got my Raiden from C1 to C3 and got C0 Kokomi
Me who already has her, constellation time baby
I got her and her weapon
    Enjoy! Can't really get better than that
The blessing worked!
    Enjoy!!! :)
270 Rolls for C0R0 > C3R1.

Got Koko's Donut as well. 80 Rolls + 320€. Overall rather lucky but definitely not something I wish to repeat.
Today I finally get Bennett
Just pulled for her, I can finally use the booba swordu
    Same, now it's Anime time lol 🗡️
Ugh I can’t pull for her until I’m done with work. I’m sooo excited! I have her guaranteed with r4 Catch!
    Good luck to you :) Hope you got her
I want to pull but I need to know who's in 2.6 reruns. Gotta have those primo reserves for the pyro gals if they get reruns and got to save for cyno/dendro
I need
SHIT THE BANNER IS TODAY? I was on a break and thought we were still on the Yae Miko banner wtf?
Good news... I got her c2 after 158 pulls (I had her since the first banner, and now won 50/50 twice)
    My friend won the C2 50/50 instantly as well! Glad to see so many are lucky
No need for luck. I have 368 dango milk
Lol, I have 60k Primos and already got her in first 10 pull..... idk what to do now 😂
Sadly didn't help, lost 50/50 to Keqing :(
    [That's basically the same tho!](https://imgur.com/a/cSQV7AI) 
lol jokes aside you got 3 more weeks or so left of wishing 😁 Good luck to you
        Yea, I'm 30 in and I'm spent so I don't have much hopes, and it would be only c1 anyway, just in my wild dreams I hoped for two Shoguns in 110 pulls, instead got 1 Keqing ;P
            You can still get her! I spend like 130 wishes too only for a C0, the Banners can be brutal
                Will see how I will be with primos in her last day and what banners will be next.
I got qiqi at hard pity once again T-T
    **Sad Violin noises 🎻** Oh well. At least Qiqi is cute
Skipped Yae to get best girl to C2 and I am not disappointed.
I just had the best pulling session of my entire genshin career. hope that everyone will get what they want
First 5 star was Diluc (which is already C12) and the next three 5-Star was Raiden. 

unfortunately I pulled 2 times the donut before getting EL...
*Proceeds to lose 50/50 to Jean😪*
    I got another Mona. Man i would've loved Jean lol
        Jean's all right but it hurts, cause I wanted to phase her out with Kokomi since she's a better healer.
Thanks! I did one random wish on the weapon banner and got the Engulfing Lightning!
    Damn that's lucky. I stopped going into the Weapon Banner. I'm cursed 💀 But that Weapon will sure be electorifying for you now! Get it? Electro frying 

.....

...

..

😅😆 pls enjoy
Quite a bit of cleavage
Ei coming in 30 mins for meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
    also cute art
    Good luuuuuuuuuuuck 🤞🏻🍀
So Ei blessed me with Electro bc I pulled a Keqing constellation ;_;
    [So you basically still got her!](https://imgur.com/a/cSQV7AI)
Lol jokes aside you got 3 more weeks or so to put some more Fates into the Banner. Best of luck to you! :)
Fuck, I really want her but Covid finally got me after my dear siblings brought it home. I'm at week two and I can barely function for about three hours per day. No energy to even farm primogems :/
    Don't worry about it, your Health is way more important than any in-game Character! She'll be back anyway. Be well. Drink a lot of water and eat some vegetables
121 fates = C1 Mona at first and then Shogun very late. I would've wished for C1 but at the very least she came home.

When her first Banner came out i barely started the game a few weeks prior so i couldn't get her.

Now i have her and 20 or so more days to put in some more Wishes every day.. and i will 😌
Didn't work :/
Should I pull for her or not? 😭 I have 50 wishes only and 30 pity 😭😭💀
    Do it
Got my C2 Raiden.


...Also C4 Mona and C2 Diluc


Sigh
50 pulls wasnt enough :(
Big bitties
Shit.... no please don't do this to me... I need to save for kazuha, I must be strong.

Edit: well I caved and got Raiden.
    Tempteition was too strong. Congrats
        Thank you. I wasn't planning on getting her so I still need to build her but I can't wait to try her out. Just mostly finished building zhongli and now need to build XQ and Ei. If you haven't already got her good luck to you as well!
Thank you. My Kokomi pulls have been blessed
Pulled 70, did not get her, but I have 20 more days until she gone so I still have hope
Thanks! I super lucksacked near the end of Yae's banner and at the start of Koko/Ei Reruns.

Got Jean and C1 Yae in a fresh 10-pull.

When Kokomi rerun started got a C2 Mona con again on the first 10-pull, then got Kokomi on soft pity.

Had some more wishes left and tried for C3 Raiden con. Failed at 50/50 at 76 for a Keqing con but got C3 Raiden con at 65 wishes.

All in all only spent 242 wishes for so many 5-stars! Pretty happy about that.
Started with 71 on my pity count and 50/50 in effect. Had another 70 wishes saved. I farmed enough mats for Raiden and was pretty set getting her. I've been F2P and would've broken that if I lost the 50/50 and didn't manage to get her by the end of the banner.

Luckily, I won the 50/50 for Raiden on my first 10 pull and was so happy that I decided to put half of my remaining 60 wishes into Kokomi's banner. I lucked out and pulled Kokomi on the third batch. 

I'm pretty estatic right now, but am not looking to forward to farming specters.
I had 50 ish pity and did 40 pulls, I managed to get xinyan, razor, 2 bennets, diluc, and raiden as well as rust.

Diluc went to c1
Bennett was already to c5
Xinyan to c3
Razor to c1

I think with the amount of pulls I did pretty well. Would've preferred to get Jean or mona, but I use diluc pretty often so all things considered, well invested and now I got a ton of primos for ayato in the future
I got her weapon on soft pity, now I just need to wait 2 days for moneh and I will pull for raiden, I still have to win 50/50 though, wish me luck
i really need her so i can get a decent dps on my team lmao
Keqing C4........
She does not want to be replaced by Ei obviously.
Her banner starts in 12~ hours for NA
    ..
i have 11 primogems
        Best of luck, lmao
        Time to start hustling then.
        Better start grinding lol
        wallet-kun will save you!
            or truck-kun if you can manage to wake up in a world where you're rich and genshin exists
                Wish misunderstood, you have reincarnated as Xingqiu.
                    Happy cake day 

I'm already a book addict so that's ok
                Nooo then you”d have to deal with the Sakoku Decree and Vision Hunt Decree and geopolitical realities and you’d never get her!
            I have three dollars.
        That should be enough
        Your avatar makes this so much better
        7. That's the best I can do. Take it or leave it.
        i have 3200 primogems but I lost my 50/50 to the last banner... but check this, I lost my 50:50 to MONA!!!! on YAE MIKOS BANNER!!!!
        Did Yae steal everything?
    Already up in Asia now
        Shouldn't it be up in the EU as well already? It's still not.
            3 and a half hours left. You can check the timeline on paimon.moe, but new banners always go up at 5PM GMT when they're not preceded by a maintenance/patch release.
                Paimon Moe says it should already be available.
                    Are you sure you checked the "show local time"? Because I have it set to the EU server and the timer is at 3:36 as of this post.
                        Okay yeah I saw it now. You have to select your server as you said. Thanks a lot man. I didn’t use this site too much.
                            Yeah, no problem! It happens -- I don't use the site much either.
    I have 2 pulls, its fine
    7 hours ? Edit : you are playin in na right?
        Am playing in NA
    I got her 2 hours ago...
        Notice the “for NA” part
            yeah just commenting on how slow NA is
    fuck /u/spez
        I’m not sure, but it’s pretty common for gacha games to releases content to Asian servers first
Itto’s gonna be awhile 😬
    I realize that, but it's even better, I could make my teams better while I'm waiting for him. I have absolutely no problem with saving primos so for me it's an absolute win :D
        I like your attitude!  
Meanwhile I am basically addicted to pulling and can't help pulling for any character I like when I should be saving for the ones I *really* like.
        Itto is so good I got him got him not awesome but decent artifacts got for him gorou zhongli and bennet all of them not really good builded yet and my C0 Itto is hitting 70k with Ushi
i spent over 8k primos for bennett c1 but it gave me every 4-star's c1 but bennett's

side note: got kokomi on soft pity tho
    Congrats on Kokomi! Let's hope that I could c1 Bennett, I'd love to see it.
Eyy I’m planning to save everything for Itto too
    We'll definitely get him when he's gonna have a rerun, cheers!
        That’s right! Tho I’m sad, i started playing right after his banner ended and i saw his gameplay and went (/;-;)/ come back Itto. Best of luck to us both xD
            I'm sad as well, but oh well - silver lining is, we'll definitely have him. Can't wait to throw Ushi around lol
                EYY I GOT RAIDEN JUST NOW BEST OF LUCK TO YOU
                    WOW THAT'S INSANE, congrats!!! Thank you as well! I still need to wait 2 more hours for the banner :D
Good luck

Since when did you start playing?
    Thank you! I started playing since the very beginning, but I definitely had long breaks, for personal reasons, and because of that I missed on so much content...but I started playing again 3 weeks ago! AR50, still a long way to go!
I have enough to reach 50/50 as well.  I am saving for Kazuha though.  No idea how long before his banner, but I have wanted to draw on him since I started playing.
Try to get Bennett's C1 too, it's his most important constellation. Trust me, it's completely worth it
c5 sara, c2 (from c1) bennet, qiqi, raiden, mona and 60 into pity for kokomi   
probably the best banner yet for me
We had almost the exact same pulls! Won my (first ever) 50/50 with c4 Sara and c0 Bennett! Kinda want c1 Bennett, c6 Sara, and wouldn’t hurt to get c1 Shogun…………..
    Wow, congrats!! It was also my first ever 50/50 won, I lost my first one to Zhongli. I also want to get Shogun constellations; what do you say, are you up to save for 6+ months to get a packed Shogun? xD
        Congrats to you too! I think we had good pulls all things considered :) Well c2 is as far as I would go I think… gonna wait until the 2.6 livestream to see who the next banner characters are and if I don’t need any of them, I’ll spend everything else on this banner. After that, I’m saving for Kazuha!
Rumors have it that >!Itto banner might rerun on 2.7!<
> I don't have Bennett

Same! And even if it takes a C20 Xinyan and real money I'm 100% getting a C1 Bennett and it will be worth it lol
I understand. Her eyes are really beautiful, right?
there’s a sign??
    A big one
        You mean two big ones?
I hope that the Hydro Archon is half as hot as Ei is since she's such a treat on the eyes and ears.
Sign?
Well worth it. Ganyu is the best.
Have fun!
    Thanks I did! I lost a 50/50 to Diluc....but she came home and now I have lv80 Raiden! And 87 wishes left
        i did 50 draws at 3 pity lol no luck :(
            5*s don’t come home before soft pity for me either. But her banner just started and there’s events soon so you have plenty of time to save more primos!
                i need ways to get more primos i would do abyss but im stuck lol
Same here lol

But it would be nice not having to spend many primos
Did u get one? i did
Im jelly
I have guaranteed

but no primos
    oof
[Travelers, get ready](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM1UxIigH9w)
Same! I just pulled and I'm on 59 pity. I need to grind more :/
    grinding for me is boring :(
I don’t have bennet, using 10k to get as much of him as I can and if I can manage to get raiden… even better.
i got both qiqi and mona today, raiden in between them, good luck
Yaaaay congratulations! So happy for you
    Thank you <3
well whats ur pity at? and how many draws?
    Well... I kind of forget to count pity.. all I know is that I wished at least 15 times for Zhongli, a bit after I got Shenhe, a few times for Yae (but I'm bad at estimating and remembering events properly so I'm not sure)
        You can check the banner history to count your pity. 

Or use paimon.moe
            Oh ok thanks
                so whats ur pity now?
                    I haven't checked yet but I'll get back to you when I do
                        ok!
What color was the words on the sign?
Congratulations I'm so happy for you buddy
Nah she just got into cosplay after reading so many Light Novels

(in all seriousness im so sorry hope she can manage to come home early on guarantee)
sad :(
Holy shit congratulations
wait, is it actually true you can get raiden in low pity?
    It's true with any character banner but the chances are extremely low
    yeah but i lost all my 50/50s
mona is just a cheaper raiden soooooo

&#x200B;

oops lol
    Mona is nothing like raiden shogun, they are completely different 0_o
        I feel like they are similar mona being a cheaper raiden
            Mona uses catalysts, is hydro, has a burst that is a bit complicated, Raiden shogun uses spears, is electro, has a burst that deals damage up front... They are nothing alike.
                crap thought of kequing lol
gl!
    Many thanks <3
    I lost the 50 / 50

&#x200B;

;\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_;
        to who? just no Qiqi's.....
            a 2nd Jean
                oof

i hope u get enough primos if you go for shogun again
Omg congratulations
Same thing happened to me. I was dying inside when I got Jean, but 20 pulls later, Raiden came home! :D
    so u got on 20 pity?
        It seems so!
            hope I get Ei within 50 pulls then!
    Jean is great for healing and farming though. Toss mages and assassins in water for instant kill
        Yeah, but it's not great when you get her for the fourth time 💀
            And here I am, still waiting to get her. I've been playing since launch and I still don't have her and Mona.
            I guess considering the things you had to give up but c3 mean sounds kind of awesome to me
In 15minutes for asia,7hours eu,13 hours NA
Im jealous
Got her after 50 try’s :D
You have a few more hours this morning i think (Im US EST)
    Well, I am at work but I do not think I have enough time to gather more wishes anyways. Was hoping it would be a few more days as I was so busy with Elden Ring I haven't noticed it's almost gone already
        Similar boat. Was busy playing Lost Ark instead lol And I bought 3 months worth of Welkin prior so def missed out on hundreds of Primogems whoops!
            Oh now that u mention it I completely forgot about my welkin... oof
        Yeah, I'm glad I went ahead and got Miko right at the start of her banner and pre-farmed.  Since Elden Ring released, I've spent very little time on Genshin outside of doing dailies and weekly bosses/bounties
            Oh yeah I farmed for Miko too and got her level 90 day 1 but because of the energy recharge problem I wanted to try for a C1. Maybe next time for I try for Ei C1 now
                Yeah, I got c1 and it definitely makes a big difference
    im waiting 9 hours till new banners here
Pulling Raiden for fun. Have we achieved utopia?
    Crazy times
good luck!
Only reason I'm not pulling for Engulfing lightning because of that damn doughnut. 😅
Congrats on the c5 xingqiu. If you didn't know, he's confirmed to be a reward for a particular 2.6 patch event so don't buy his c6 from the shop.
    I was wrong, checked again, it was c4, my sleep deprived ass thought it was c5 and was excited when I got him that time. Kind of debating whether to buy one of the blackcliffs or just get xingqiu to c5 instead. Just need to get enough starglitters for it (since I bought 10 more wishes)
EPIC
You fool! Now you just jinxed yourself!

Congrats btw, also won the 50/50 myself.
>I did go from not having Raiden to C2 Raiden in those 110 wishes.

! :O That's crazy lucky and a nice damage buff. Enjoy 🤘🏻
Congrats! Enjoy 😁
lmao
qiqi'ed lol
Let's goooo
Epic gamer moment

Congrats
    Thank you, I am so happy that I am hugging my pillow so hard
    I'm so confused. Of course the next five star was riding what was great about this?
Hooray!
Good strategy
    yes
huh
u got a 5 star in 20 pity?
    Yep, somehow
        u dont need raiden? or not want to use raiden?
            I use raiden but not on a electro resonance team like with sara, bennett, and a flex

i use her on a full archon team (Venti (which i potentially cant get due to this accident), zhongli, raiden, and a flex (can be bennett but will be later replaced by dendro archon)
                well if u ever dont want raiden ill take ur raiden lol
                    Only the constellation lol
                        ill take the constellation and use rituals to turn it into a raiden
                            Heres a ritual that i used when i got the accidental raiden if you want (only works when u completed raiden's 2nd story quest tho):

- get a waverider in ritou

- drive it to one of the docks of liyue harbor and jump out

- get back in the waverider and go to the heart-shaped island then climb up the pillar there

- go back again and go to the Dragonspine Ruin grader near the shore

- dont make him fight you, just shoot random cannons from ur waverider then leave again with ur waverider

- go to the unnamed island

- interact with the time dial then go to the centerpoint of the island

- wish
                                good thing im done the 2nd story
f2p?
    Yeah, I think they forgot to end with, "I'm f2p btw lul"
        wow how u got somany primos then?
    No, I bought welkin

I still quite new, so still a lot of content for me to do. Currently Mona and Ganyu are my only 5 stars. This will be the second event banner I will be wishing on. Even though I am AR50, so I saved it up.
        ok
fr?!!!
She was the 2nd character I spent money on, the other was Kazuha. Not proud of the spending but didn't regret it either lmao Managed to get her C2(plus Jean lol) so I'm already happy and will be skipping all her reruns for other characters. She's so worth it!
That's a lot of money to spend on this kind of game. As long as you can afford it go for it
Depends if you're at guaranteed featured or 50/50

If you're at 50/50 it can take up to 180 pulls (realistically like 160ish)

If you're at guaranteed then 90 ( realistically like 80)
Best of luck to you 🍀
    Thanks now trying with every single wish. Went rly unlucky with this roll. Pismom.moe shows me i rolled mona AT 80 pity
Fist bump, same here.

Just got Kokomi with only 70 wishes, did not have guarantee. Now I have quite some primogems left for Kazuha!
    Congrats!  Hope you get him
**That's a lot of damage**. Enjoy  ☻
Well the chance to get her 2 times in 80 wishes is quite small. Even if you started with guarantee.
    Yeah I know. I had guarantee soo i though that maybe I would be lucky but its okay c1 is good and c2 will come one day.
>Soo I had Raiden and wanted c2..but after 80 pulls I got c1...I will wait another re run for c2...I need to save for Ayato now

I was even more overconfident. Didn't have Raiden but i was close to pity. 121 pulls. Wanted C2. What did i get? Mona and C0 Ei 🙃 Oh well. At least we have her 🤞🏻
    Yeah, Raiden is soo good. My favorite character. Mona is good too soo dont be sad haha
But you still got her tho?
    Yeah, but at what cost xD
        >Yeah, but at what cost xD

I also wasted 130 wishes to only get a C0 if that makes you feel any better... 😆
Not an expert, but youtubers recommend is to either leave het c0 or go for c2. So either have enough saved up for a chance on c2 or get c1 now so you can get her c2 in the future. Or leave her at c0.
>I have a guaranteed and already have Raiden (my first limited *5 when started playing). But I'm contemplating the idea of getting cons of her. 

"If" you're guaranteed i would highly suggest against C1 **if** you really want another Character really bad like Kazuha or Venti. Those are supposed to rerun in the near Future
>Did i just waste my entire luck in my lifespan?

Most likely yes. That's crazy. Enjoy tho! :)
I wanted Raiden so bad as well but didn’t get her after like 80 wishes and got Diluc and some other instead. So sad.
    Same I had like 85+ wishes.. sucks to be us
        We‘re just bunch of unlucky Bennett‘s.
Enjoy! Can't really get better than that
Enjoy!!! :)
Same, now it's Anime time lol 🗡️
Good luck to you :) Hope you got her
My friend won the C2 50/50 instantly as well! Glad to see so many are lucky
[That's basically the same tho!](https://imgur.com/a/cSQV7AI) 
lol jokes aside you got 3 more weeks or so left of wishing 😁 Good luck to you
    Yea, I'm 30 in and I'm spent so I don't have much hopes, and it would be only c1 anyway, just in my wild dreams I hoped for two Shoguns in 110 pulls, instead got 1 Keqing ;P
        You can still get her! I spend like 130 wishes too only for a C0, the Banners can be brutal
            Will see how I will be with primos in her last day and what banners will be next.
**Sad Violin noises 🎻** Oh well. At least Qiqi is cute
I got another Mona. Man i would've loved Jean lol
    Jean's all right but it hurts, cause I wanted to phase her out with Kokomi since she's a better healer.
Damn that's lucky. I stopped going into the Weapon Banner. I'm cursed 💀 But that Weapon will sure be electorifying for you now! Get it? Electro frying 

.....

...

..

😅😆 pls enjoy
also cute art
Good luuuuuuuuuuuck 🤞🏻🍀
[So you basically still got her!](https://imgur.com/a/cSQV7AI)
Lol jokes aside you got 3 more weeks or so to put some more Fates into the Banner. Best of luck to you! :)
Don't worry about it, your Health is way more important than any in-game Character! She'll be back anyway. Be well. Drink a lot of water and eat some vegetables
Do it
Tempteition was too strong. Congrats
    Thank you. I wasn't planning on getting her so I still need to build her but I can't wait to try her out. Just mostly finished building zhongli and now need to build XQ and Ei. If you haven't already got her good luck to you as well!
..
i have 11 primogems
    Best of luck, lmao
    Time to start hustling then.
    Better start grinding lol
    wallet-kun will save you!
        or truck-kun if you can manage to wake up in a world where you're rich and genshin exists
            Wish misunderstood, you have reincarnated as Xingqiu.
                Happy cake day 

I'm already a book addict so that's ok
            Nooo then you”d have to deal with the Sakoku Decree and Vision Hunt Decree and geopolitical realities and you’d never get her!
        I have three dollars.
    That should be enough
    Your avatar makes this so much better
    7. That's the best I can do. Take it or leave it.
    i have 3200 primogems but I lost my 50/50 to the last banner... but check this, I lost my 50:50 to MONA!!!! on YAE MIKOS BANNER!!!!
    Did Yae steal everything?
Already up in Asia now
    Shouldn't it be up in the EU as well already? It's still not.
        3 and a half hours left. You can check the timeline on paimon.moe, but new banners always go up at 5PM GMT when they're not preceded by a maintenance/patch release.
            Paimon Moe says it should already be available.
                Are you sure you checked the "show local time"? Because I have it set to the EU server and the timer is at 3:36 as of this post.
                    Okay yeah I saw it now. You have to select your server as you said. Thanks a lot man. I didn’t use this site too much.
                        Yeah, no problem! It happens -- I don't use the site much either.
I have 2 pulls, its fine
7 hours ? Edit : you are playin in na right?
    Am playing in NA
I got her 2 hours ago...
    Notice the “for NA” part
        yeah just commenting on how slow NA is
fuck /u/spez
    I’m not sure, but it’s pretty common for gacha games to releases content to Asian servers first
I realize that, but it's even better, I could make my teams better while I'm waiting for him. I have absolutely no problem with saving primos so for me it's an absolute win :D
    I like your attitude!  
Meanwhile I am basically addicted to pulling and can't help pulling for any character I like when I should be saving for the ones I *really* like.
    Itto is so good I got him got him not awesome but decent artifacts got for him gorou zhongli and bennet all of them not really good builded yet and my C0 Itto is hitting 70k with Ushi
Congrats on Kokomi! Let's hope that I could c1 Bennett, I'd love to see it.
We'll definitely get him when he's gonna have a rerun, cheers!
    That’s right! Tho I’m sad, i started playing right after his banner ended and i saw his gameplay and went (/;-;)/ come back Itto. Best of luck to us both xD
        I'm sad as well, but oh well - silver lining is, we'll definitely have him. Can't wait to throw Ushi around lol
            EYY I GOT RAIDEN JUST NOW BEST OF LUCK TO YOU
                WOW THAT'S INSANE, congrats!!! Thank you as well! I still need to wait 2 more hours for the banner :D
Thank you! I started playing since the very beginning, but I definitely had long breaks, for personal reasons, and because of that I missed on so much content...but I started playing again 3 weeks ago! AR50, still a long way to go!
Wow, congrats!! It was also my first ever 50/50 won, I lost my first one to Zhongli. I also want to get Shogun constellations; what do you say, are you up to save for 6+ months to get a packed Shogun? xD
    Congrats to you too! I think we had good pulls all things considered :) Well c2 is as far as I would go I think… gonna wait until the 2.6 livestream to see who the next banner characters are and if I don’t need any of them, I’ll spend everything else on this banner. After that, I’m saving for Kazuha!
A big one
    You mean two big ones?
Thanks I did! I lost a 50/50 to Diluc....but she came home and now I have lv80 Raiden! And 87 wishes left
    i did 50 draws at 3 pity lol no luck :(
        5*s don’t come home before soft pity for me either. But her banner just started and there’s events soon so you have plenty of time to save more primos!
            i need ways to get more primos i would do abyss but im stuck lol
oof
grinding for me is boring :(
Thank you <3
Well... I kind of forget to count pity.. all I know is that I wished at least 15 times for Zhongli, a bit after I got Shenhe, a few times for Yae (but I'm bad at estimating and remembering events properly so I'm not sure)
    You can check the banner history to count your pity. 

Or use paimon.moe
        Oh ok thanks
            so whats ur pity now?
                I haven't checked yet but I'll get back to you when I do
                    ok!
It's true with any character banner but the chances are extremely low
yeah but i lost all my 50/50s
Mona is nothing like raiden shogun, they are completely different 0_o
    I feel like they are similar mona being a cheaper raiden
        Mona uses catalysts, is hydro, has a burst that is a bit complicated, Raiden shogun uses spears, is electro, has a burst that deals damage up front... They are nothing alike.
            crap thought of kequing lol
Many thanks <3
I lost the 50 / 50

&#x200B;

;\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_;
    to who? just no Qiqi's.....
        a 2nd Jean
            oof

i hope u get enough primos if you go for shogun again
so u got on 20 pity?
    It seems so!
        hope I get Ei within 50 pulls then!
Jean is great for healing and farming though. Toss mages and assassins in water for instant kill
    Yeah, but it's not great when you get her for the fourth time 💀
        And here I am, still waiting to get her. I've been playing since launch and I still don't have her and Mona.
        I guess considering the things you had to give up but c3 mean sounds kind of awesome to me
Well, I am at work but I do not think I have enough time to gather more wishes anyways. Was hoping it would be a few more days as I was so busy with Elden Ring I haven't noticed it's almost gone already
    Similar boat. Was busy playing Lost Ark instead lol And I bought 3 months worth of Welkin prior so def missed out on hundreds of Primogems whoops!
        Oh now that u mention it I completely forgot about my welkin... oof
    Yeah, I'm glad I went ahead and got Miko right at the start of her banner and pre-farmed.  Since Elden Ring released, I've spent very little time on Genshin outside of doing dailies and weekly bosses/bounties
        Oh yeah I farmed for Miko too and got her level 90 day 1 but because of the energy recharge problem I wanted to try for a C1. Maybe next time for I try for Ei C1 now
            Yeah, I got c1 and it definitely makes a big difference
im waiting 9 hours till new banners here
Crazy times
I was wrong, checked again, it was c4, my sleep deprived ass thought it was c5 and was excited when I got him that time. Kind of debating whether to buy one of the blackcliffs or just get xingqiu to c5 instead. Just need to get enough starglitters for it (since I bought 10 more wishes)
Thank you, I am so happy that I am hugging my pillow so hard
I'm so confused. Of course the next five star was riding what was great about this?
yes
Yep, somehow
    u dont need raiden? or not want to use raiden?
        I use raiden but not on a electro resonance team like with sara, bennett, and a flex

i use her on a full archon team (Venti (which i potentially cant get due to this accident), zhongli, raiden, and a flex (can be bennett but will be later replaced by dendro archon)
            well if u ever dont want raiden ill take ur raiden lol
                Only the constellation lol
                    ill take the constellation and use rituals to turn it into a raiden
                        Heres a ritual that i used when i got the accidental raiden if you want (only works when u completed raiden's 2nd story quest tho):

- get a waverider in ritou

- drive it to one of the docks of liyue harbor and jump out

- get back in the waverider and go to the heart-shaped island then climb up the pillar there

- go back again and go to the Dragonspine Ruin grader near the shore

- dont make him fight you, just shoot random cannons from ur waverider then leave again with ur waverider

- go to the unnamed island

- interact with the time dial then go to the centerpoint of the island

- wish
                            good thing im done the 2nd story
Yeah, I think they forgot to end with, "I'm f2p btw lul"
    wow how u got somany primos then?
No, I bought welkin

I still quite new, so still a lot of content for me to do. Currently Mona and Ganyu are my only 5 stars. This will be the second event banner I will be wishing on. Even though I am AR50, so I saved it up.
    ok
Thanks now trying with every single wish. Went rly unlucky with this roll. Pismom.moe shows me i rolled mona AT 80 pity
Congrats!  Hope you get him
Yeah I know. I had guarantee soo i though that maybe I would be lucky but its okay c1 is good and c2 will come one day.
Yeah, Raiden is soo good. My favorite character. Mona is good too soo dont be sad haha
Yeah, but at what cost xD
    >Yeah, but at what cost xD

I also wasted 130 wishes to only get a C0 if that makes you feel any better... 😆
Same I had like 85+ wishes.. sucks to be us

- get a waverider in ritou

- drive it to one of the docks of liyue harbor and jump out

- get back in the waverider and go to the heart-shaped island then climb up the pillar there

- go back again and go to the Dragonspine Ruin grader near the shore

- dont make him fight you, just shoot random cannons from ur waverider then leave again with ur waverider

- go to the unnamed island

- interact with the time dial then go to the centerpoint of the island

- wish
        good thing im done the 2nd story
Yeah, no problem! It happens -- I don't use the site much either.
