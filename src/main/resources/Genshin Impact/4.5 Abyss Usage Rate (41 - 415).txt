[[4.5 Abyss Usage Rate (41 - 415)]]





*"Your dps is zero when you're dead"*

— Zhongli, probably
    Player (Ruler) : "My mindset already changed since early game, now i will maximize any DPS to its ceiling even if it means sacrificing my comfort"

Zhongli (Faker aka GOAT) : "Dear player, you must not forget..... That All Roads Lead To Me"
        LEGENDS NEVEER DIEEEEEEE starts playing
        That line went so hard though. 


"i have seen the ride and fall of many teams, but the player who stood at the end was always me."
            That line goes well with Zhongli as well. He has seen so many meta going up and down (vape meta, dendro meta, now hypercarry meta and such) but in the end only him that can comfortably fits to all of those. He is trully the Dad of this game.
        No way a league ref?!
            Ngl I think there’s a big overlap in the communities
                Oh for sure. BeryL (DRX’s support) designed an Ashe skin to resemble [Elysia](https://www.oneesports.gg/league-of-legends/elysia-drx-worlds-2022-ashe/) from honkai impact 3rd after winning worlds. Obvi not genshin but same idea of player base crossover.
        Zhongli's inner Thanos is showing..
"Where did that bring you? Back to me."
    Dumb machine that takes 0 damage until you break it's geo shield on one side.

Oh by the way there are some geo resistant enemies on the other side, that also get buffed if you are hit with a  shield... which... happens to be reaction of the element that we are giving you a buff for, yeah...

— Floor 12, probably

Been a while since a saw such a force synergy in abyss, all geo/zhongli teams are going to part 2 (except that brute force with Neuvillette)
        Actually that machine has 210% all resistance when it has shield (10% without shield). It is still doable without breaking it as long as you can do equivalent of 20M damage. Not recommended except C6 whale showcase, of course.
            Doable is a very strong word in that context lol.

                    What manner of sea creature is this?

I swear high constellation Genshin is practically another game.
                    why are people always spamming the menu
                        To pick up particles, I'm pretty sure. It pauses the timer but those still move. If not that, then I dunno.
                            My favorite was this one video of an abyss speedrunner who was menu'ing after every action to collect particles, the actual video was like 3 minutes long or something but in-game it was like 15 seconds or something 💀
                                it might have been against maguu kenki, you can skip his stalling invulnerable phase by constantly booking/opening the map every millisecond
                                You mean something like this https://youtu.be/cxnvuTNyy3c?si=irH_l84ZGS9ZygLy ?
                                    LOL yeah that was the video I was thinking of
                        To pick up energy particles and reset character switching cooldown (I think)
                        Menus Freeze time for everything except particles
                    Hi, I'm Old and Dumb, so could someone please explain something to me:

* C6R5 characters are, according to Google, 1-1.2k$ on average, they have both Furina and Yelan C6R5
* Xianyun is C2R5, so I assume 600-700$ at least?

So that's what, 2.5-3k usd on average, which is fine, I'm not here to police what people spend their money on, and it's not like it's that absurd of a sum all things considered (depending on where you live in the world).

However, my question is this: why, in the name of all holy fucks in the world, would they then be playing the game on a phone??????????????
                    Did I....do this by accident?

I technically had Zhongli so probably not I suppose.

Definitely just used Hu Tao / Zhongli / Xingqiu / Yelan though and just smashed Hu Tao vape plunge attacks into it until it died.
            Went in blind and Overload did it for me
            I jut used raiden national as always. 

Simply have Raiden jump a couple of times before doing your usual rotation. 

Repeat once more if you can't one-cycle it (I can't) and that's it 

Just breaking the shield twice with a couple of quick plunges takes like no time at all. 

It buffs jumping height of all charactersnear, so everyone can just plunge attack by simply jumping straight from standing on the ground without any special setup
        I tried to do Itto first half and Navia second half but the shield guys were pissing me off so I had to go Neuvillette oonga boonga for that one (as much as I'd rather use my boy Arataki instead of the usual strong meta characters like Neuvi)
            pro tip : use crystallize shield instead, the enemies won't get their buff if your shield breaks when they attack you.
That's how I managed to do Itto first half and Navia second half.
                > he enemies won't get their buff if your shield breaks when they attack you

Instruction unclear. Itto's crystalize shield is way too beefy, it takes at least 4 simultaneous hits to break through it(Redhorn to good)


Altho truthfully, I'm careful with my crystalize placement.  I don't apply any elements when they spawn and just geo smack them.  I also know which attack is the shield steal so I can avoid it if I do still have a crystalize shield active.
                    What does redhorn have to do with crystalize
                        Defense reduces damage taken which also applies to shields. A Noelle using Layla’s shield for example can tank more hits with it compared to a different chara
                            Ohhh yeah true
                 It is possible that even if you do not use a shield on your team that the Husks' buff is activated because of the rumbling stone aura that causes Geo damage independently of Geo Husk (which in base form only causes physical damage), I I realized that Husk was in enhanced form even though my team lacks geo and shield (Furina, Neuvillette, Kazuha and Kuki).
        I just brute forced the machine with Raiden National. Didn't know it had a geo mechanism. It didn't take that long to kill.
            Is not a geo mechanic, you need to hit it with blunt damage to break the shield. And since the shield is a geo shield it takes extra damage from geo sources, you can take someone like Zhongli whose hold skill deletes more than half the shield and burst the other half.

Well if you are not breaking the shield you required around 19 million equivalent damage to brute force through it resistances, so either you are a major whale or you are indeed breaking the shield, that or you are talking about another machine.
                I just break the shield with normal attacks
                    You are breaking it with overload.
    It always baffles me how Zhongli is constantly being bashed upon for being "a DPS loss" and how even slotting him in a team or having a particular character rely on him is seen as "bad", but then everytime I look at usage rates he is always on top.
        TCs and CCs can't calculate practical improvements of which Zhongli can provide. TCs assume perfect rotations when calculating dps of a team or character, but it ain't all true since everyone can fumble and there is a lot of RNG involved in order of enemy attacks. Zhongli is king of consistency.
            Not everyone can play like a TAS Speedrun, and you don’t really need to be faster than 3.00 minutes, so comfortable play is better than -5 sec.
        I feel like this is kind misleading. The teams ZL is used in are teams where he is a dps increase. 


It's not ZL being used in a bunch of teams for his defensive utility. It's ZL being used in teams where he increases the dps on top of his defensive utility. 


People aren't plugging him into random teams for defensive utility. They are playing the teams that value him offensively and defensively. 


 If you ignore the teams using him to break the shield in 12-3 almost all of his usage comes from the 4 most popular dps atm. 
            Genuine question: what are the teams where he is considered a DPS increase? Because everytime I see someone even suggesting running him in any given team causes people to go wild claiming you'd be better off replacing him with someone else.
                He's very good in Tighnari teams, since swirl does nothing for Tighnari (>50% of the team dps) and only increases your electro unit's aggravate damage.
                Neuvilette furin Kazuha zhongli is neuvillettes highest dps team at any investment level
                    That team SHREDS. Zhongli shield bot + Petra = chef kiss
                To expand on why Zhongli makes it into Neuvillette's best double hydro team even at C1+, it is because of 4pc archaic petra on top of the universal shred.
                Navia
            Except a while ago people would constantly push replacing him with another character even in teams where he isn't that big a DPS loss. For instance people pushed Funernational replacing ZL with Xiangling in double hydro Hutao claiming a DPS increase, but teams like that never receive widespread adoption because it only takes a single reset to have lost any time saved by increasing DPS by a few thousand replacing him.
                Teams like that aren't popular because they took your XL from your aoe. At the time you had Ayaka, international and Raiden as aoe dps.


It's very clear why it wasn't popular.
                Depends on your level of investment. All the popular Hu Tao teams now don't use Zhongli for a reason - Furina requires a complementary healer and the extra damage through those two units is greater than the utility provided by Zhongli + Xingqiu.
                    Thats not true hutao popular team is still with zhongli,its not with furina since she is generally on the other side and that she still has enormous damage without her
        No sane person would call Zhongli a DPS loss, dude earns his place with res shred alone. His ultimate specifically however is indeed a DPS loss, its damage is not worth the animation time, it's a relic from his original kit days when Hoyo wanted him to be a shitty DPS for some reason.
            his ult kit is gated behind a lot of constellations and talent level scaling, simple screenwide 90k+ crit unbuffed at max while re-applying shield
            His ult Seems to be useful against geo shield
                It can be, but in those cases it's not really a "DPS" option, it's just a shield shred option. Those cases are generally VERY rare.

You basically never build Zhongli for his own personal damage.

At the end of the day the actual damage output of his burst compared to the time the animation takes to cast is just bad. The only situation where you see people using his burst is usually if that person has C2, in which case it's NOT a huge DPS loss as you can easily use the instant swap/burst and you refresh his shield without ever having to hold his skill instead.
        >Zhongli is constantly being bashed upon for being "a DPS loss"

cause those people are playing spreadsheet impact
        In this Abyss, he is not a dps loss because he does immense damage to geo shields. He is also used to stack resist shred against super high resistance enemies.  If you want to fight Coppelia with Wanderer for example you will need both Faruzan and Zhongli resist shred.
        Zhongli is a DPS loss to actually use him offensively. Unless you have his C2 you effectively never use his burst because it's just a waste of time. All you do is pop him on field and hold E for his shield and swap off him.

His entire purpose is basically just for a shield with resistance shred and maybe more buff depending on his artifacts.

Shield in general though are generally a "DPS loss" compared to alternatives, and are mostly used for ease of play. In most cases if you just avoid enemy attacks you're better off using a more offensive off fielder for higher DPS. Zhongli can somewhat get around this due to how strong his shield is and the duration, requiring less frequent field time to refresh it, on top of providing offensive buffs with the resistance shred. The resistance shred in particular gets MUCH stronger when you're running a team that deals multiple types of damage as this means he's providing a 20% resistance shred buff to each type of damage, more overall value.

At the end of the day the peak of player character DPS FAR outscales the DPS requirements to beat floor 12. If you're able to run the top usage teams your DPS output generally far exceeds the "challenge" of the chambers. There is essentially no reason you actually need to run 100% optimized DPS teams when you can instead clear much more easily with more comfortable teams that are easier to play. Running the top played Hu Tao team with Xiangling instead of Zhongli is objectively a pretty huge DPS increase, but you have to avoid enemies constantly making sure you don't die, often while at very low hp on Hu Tao. Instead though you can just run Zhongli and basically play with your brain turned off just spamming CA on Hu Tao never needing to dodge at all, and you still clear anyway. Likewise you COULD run the Neuvillette team with Nahida instead and it'd likely be quite a bit more overall DPS; Baizhu really provides basically zero value to the team's reactions and is just a shielder / healer that can easily add a hydro reaction stack to Neuvillette's A4. Nahida on Prototype Amber (particularly if you run Proto Amber on Neuvillette too) would be "better" but far less comfortable to play, and at the end of the day that's usually what it comes down to in the end.

You'll notice that the top teams are NOT what you'll see people run if they're mega whales that are trying to speed run Abyss. In those cases, where you're trying to get every spec of DPS, people run other teams.
        Sure, he is a dps loss, but you know what is an even bigger dps loss? Having to do fight mechanics.

As the old saying goes: " Stand in fire, dps higher". Zhongli lets you stand in the proverbial fire all day long.
        its because people are very bad and don't dodge, hope that helps. very easy abyss lol
        It's because people suffer from Anti-Geo brainrot.
    The true dps loss was the dodging we did along the way.
Seriously Zhongli and kazuha never seem to step down tier list lol. Kazuha feels like literally impossible to dethrone ever..
    They tried to bring Kazuha down with the dendro meta, but no, my man will always find a way to be one of the most relevant units. And now with Fontaine he's better than ever.
        As long as one of the four swirlable elements is meta, so will he be meta.

Honestly Furina probably is more significant in affecting his usage than Dendro - there's an appreciable niche for Xianyun/Jean consolidating VV and healer categories, at least until we get more teamwide healers that also provide other utility. 

Chevy is also an attempt at making him less mandatory, as you now have hypercarry setups for Pyro and Electro excluding him.
            C2 Kazuha also buffs pretty much any dendro comp that has a flex slot, so a lot of people have him there
        >They tried to bring Kazuha down with the dendro meta

Dendro Meta brought us Aggravate, which benefits from Kazuha
        He can trigger aggravates, hyperblooms, and burgeons. Anemo units in general can trigger other reactions due to swirls inflicting the absorbed element (partly why Sucrose is a good driver), so he won't be dropped unless they introduce an enemy that cannot be swirled or repels Anemo damage hard.
            don't forget that in quickbloom he can cluster bomb by grabbing the seeds
        True,He is the best choice for all fontaine dps except Navia
        and Arlecchino is coming lol
        I mean, whenever something counters dendro, it can be fucked by another meta team, and Kazuha makes wonders in that scenario.
        He did go down a bit during Dendro saga. Nahida was dominating with usage rates no one ever saw. Others such as Zhongli/Yelan/Raiden/Kazuha usually keep having turns in who would be at the top with rest, but Zhongli and Kazuha usually do make it on more number
        Kazuha is the single most broken dendro flex pick if you already have one electro and one dendro outside of maybe xingqiu
    Zhongli even more eternal. Kazu's usage wont mean much if a player decided to runs Geo and Dendro for each side, Zhongli still can be there regardless.
        Zhongli drops off for me whenever the Wenut/Ruin Serpent shows up or tag team consecrated beast floors (basically the whole of 3.x Abyss floors).

Its not that he's bad, is just that I need his slot to time the floor, a shield is helpful but I argue that learning how to dodge or healing through the damage is much more advisable.
            Last patch has wenut and ruin serpent both and he still like high S (68% or something). I think with Navia around he also have a premier frontload DPS so he even got more options nowadays to deal with short windows enemies
                Also a mainstay in Tighnari-Yae spread because he plays the 12s rotations well. That team is a silver bullet for the Wenut.
            I think most people don't realize that not everyone aim for 36 stars. Some people just like to be able to clear abyss and have fun and Zhongli allows them to comfortably clear it even though in some cases he can be dps lost and can't get you 36* but you can surely clear chambers and for some clearing it is already an achievement. This is also one of the reasons he is mostly used.
                This data is full star clears only though so it's exclusively people who used Zhongli *and* got 36 stars.
            >Zhongli drops off for me whenever the Wenut/Ruin Serpent shows up or tag team consecrated beast floors

???

>learning how to dodge or healing through the damage is much more advisable.

The reality in genshin is that you CANNOT dodge everything. His shield is FAR superior to dodging and healing. And whatever loss your team gets by bringing him in is almost always so insignificant you most likely end up with better dps by never getting interrupted or be forced to play safe.
        Dendro is fine for Kazu, mono geo and Nilou bloom are the only two comps where he's not useful.
    Ah yes, the real anemo archon
Solo Wriothesley in 25th place lmao
    the duke needs no help in doing his job lmao.
    I still can't comprehend how wriothesley can solo this particular abyss ;-;
        All the attacks on the second side are very dodgeable and wrios charged attacks can get through the geo shield, just bring a really fast first side and the second side with solo wrio is free
        These are all C6 Wriothesley.
            There was one c1r1 Wriothesley main solo on 2nd half. Idk how they do that but they did
                I think it was u/wriotheslycumdumpster
                    I couldve lived without knowing about his existence, btw
                    Hey its me! HAHAHA
                        I'm wish i could get on your lvl one day... Abyss skill, I mean. Not the username lol
                    That username definitely rings the bell lmao
            Is that a fact or just your own assumption? Because you only needs C1 to be able to solo shit and that’s what I’ve been doing ever since he’s out
    I get that's probably a joke but what is the real team supposed to be?
        It is not a joke. You can refer to The Genshin Scientist's guide to reading abyss usage rates on YouTube. In brief, there are not many Wriothesley owners and even less users. So the whales get to be a bigger percentage of Wriothesley users and whales who do solo Wriothesley runs can appear higher in percentage than normal.
in the neuv, kaz, furina, baizhu team do you just ignore the blooms that spawn and pretend it's a mono hydro team?
    Yes. The dendro is mostly for the elemental stacks for Neuvi. However it is a nice side damage, you can use kazuha to scoop em together.
        Kazuha will prioritise sucking Pyro from anywhere in the field, from enemy shields/torches, or even yourself if your on fire

That means random Burgeon explosion nukes
            It's all right though since his built with em. Thats a nice burgeon dmg. 

On side note. Im using him for aggravate and that pyro infusion sucks. Fuck that second chamber.
            bum bum bakudan at home
            > Burgeon explosion nukes

If only there wasn't a 2 dmg instance per 0.5s rule
            More passive stacks for Neuvillette then
                Burgeon won't trigger Neuvillette passive, it's not a hydro reaction.
                    Oh I see
        I dont have baizu and furina, is this something that can be utilize with neuvi, zhongli, kazuha, and nahida? I also have yelan, and xingqui if i need to swap somebody else.
            Yeah I just use zhongli instead of Baizhu, works fine. You can probably use fischl or something if you have Neuvilette c2
            I wouldn't recommend Nahida in this combination. She would have more utility in another team. Else you can do Nahida Neuvillette, full EM raiden and zhongli. This team deletes everything as well. Xinqui and Yelan wouldn't do much but add hydro resonance. Do you have Fischl? You can add Fischl instead of Nahida.
                Yeah but i only have her at C0. Would that be alright?
    Yep, baizhu is just there to heal for fanfare and give neuv a passive stack.
        With C2 Baizhu he doesn’t even bother coming on field, he just happens to be the most efficient way for a passive stack. The heal is largely irrelevant and the shield becomes less relevant after C1 Neuv.
    I remember leaks saying neuv's a mono hydro carry, then his kit came out saying he fits rainbow teams, but right now he's unironically mono-hydro(always has been)
    Yes, it never really had a ‘bloom’ identity to it. It was more like a hypercarry or mono team. Baizhu is just there for the heals.
    yes
    HAHA that is exactly my team and yes I just pretend that I didn't see anything and as someone already said yes Baizhu is there because his healing is just too good + for Neuv's 3rd stack on A1.

One of the reasons why I was coping that Chiori would be a Geo Healer is because she would be 100% better than Baizhu in that team.
    its like Rational, its not overload, its just a bonus
    I don’t even ult on baizhu. I generally dislike it since it can’t make subsequent hydro swirls harder. Plus it basically does nothing that useful and it feels like a dps loss.
    it's not mono hydro. It's neuv hypercarry bis team with c0/c1 furina. baizhu just stacks fanfare and provides song of days past buff (he ain't even using dendro set)
1.2% Diluc gang, rise up! 🫡🫡
    Rise up! 🫡🫡🔥🦅
    It's a shame that he's still so slept on even after the glow-up from Xianyun. Plunge Diluc is a genuine monster, especially if you properly Swirl with Viridescent Venerer.
        I don't think he's really slept on anymore.  He's talked about in every Xianyun discussion, and Gaming was compared to him in every third comment when he released.  People who lose their 50/50s to Diluc just tend not to build him unless they wanted him anyway, so his usage rate is always going to be low, even if he gets godlike supports.
        what’s the proper rotation here then? to get the most out of xianyun/furina ult as well as swirling correctly
            Depends on if you use CW and Bennett C6 or not.  2pc2pc is pretty good, but CW is better.  CW rotation is a little more annoying IMO, cause without it you don't need to worry about not having VV and Bennett burst active on all his plunges.

If you use CW and Bennett C6, I do Furina EQ -> Bennet EQ (you may need to do short hold E on Bennett to make sure you keep pyro aura, I forgor) -> Xianyun EQ -> Diluc E plunge E plunge E plunge x6 - Q.  

Numbers wise I think the boost from his Q isn't worth losing uptime on either Bennett or VV, however if you don't have Bennett C6 (you should if you want to use Diluc Plunge tbh), you'll need to do EQ at the beginning of Diluc's rotation to get the pyro infusion.
                yep i have c6 and rocking a very strong CW set and ittos weapon . thanks for this i really appreciate it. gonna try it out tonight.
                    One more thing, Xianyun has a long burst so if you have to rotate more than once what I sometimes do is just Q on her, no E, then I do her E and catch particles after Diluc is done.  Cause the E is gonna swirl pyro away, not the Q, so you lose a second or two of VV 💀
                        my goat, ty
        The vv helps but Is pretty unnecessary thankfully. 

Xianyun got me to buy his costume and finish up his levels. Even with I think lvl 8 normals he's still more than capable of clearing
        Wish I managed to get her but I was really short on gems at the time. Although I say that but I managed to get 146 pulls for Mona in 4 weeks lol
    RAAAAAA 🦅🦅🦅🔥
    🫡🫡
    Burnnnnnnn🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
    any suggestions for my diluc?
trying to him
        Play plunge diluc with furina c6 benny and xianyun
            don't have furina or Benny 🥲 
but has xianyun
                You can play melt plunge but still need benny atleast c1 and play xingqui instead of furina
                    i play diluc - xingqui - xiangling - zhongli and it's rather comfortable. depending on the enemies ill throw nahida in there instead
                    don't have furina and xinqui and no Benny🥲
                        Play with kaeya and whoever you have you seem like new player
                            bro literally just got neuvelite 😱
                                Neat, build around him, he is incredibly good
    Liked playing him as trials
    You didn’t mention 0.6%Qiqi and 0.1%Aloy.
    My only actual dps raaaaaaaaa
    It's criminal that he's that low.

He basically replaced my C1R1 Hu Tao ever since Xianyun came out. Diluc plunge is absurd.

125-170k plunge attacks.
Lol, I just find it funny that S+ is just made up of Neuvillette's team, not even like, here are a few characters that work well with him, it's like, 4 characters and this is his best team exactly
    I use Baizhu in place of Zhongli so everyone is full health and i guess i technically deal more damage because of the Blooms?

JK it's because i needed Zhongli in the other half
        Everything hurts so much nowadays on mobile, I'm for pulling for survivability now. Baizhu's the closest I'll get to a second Zhongli.
            Everyone laughed at me last year when I said baizhu had as much pull value as zhongli, that he was better than kokomi, now he is the meta support slot for the best characters
    I use that variation except replace Kazuha with Fischl.

Unlimited off field damage made that last floor 12 boss a cakewalk.
    And hands down the best team in the game as well. It has mixes of high damage and comfort plus utilities (Kazuha and Zhongli are universal shield breaker and resistance down). This only countered by hydro immune enemies, to thing that thats the only counter show how incredibly powerful this team is.
        Sometimes I just put Childe in there and never switch to him just for the +1 normal attack because Neuvillette will destroy any chamber anyway
            and if you have C3 Neuv you get to unlock the lvl14 talent which is cracked btw 
        How is this team played? Does Furina just drain everyone except Neuv's health down to 50% and then they're just left like that unhealed?
            Yeah. You couldn't care less about them being 50% hp and Neuvilette stacks fanfare by himself. For c0 Neuv it's probably his best team if we take comfort into consideration.
            Yes, net-net it trades a bit of Furina's damage for Neuv's. Baizhu's frontloading fanfare and Zhongli's Archaic Petra+res shred benefit them equally; the small difference comes from Baizhu giving Furina's pets more HP to drain vs Zhongli's buffs stacking on top of Furina and Kazuha for Neuv. 

It's just that Neuv is 2-3 times Furina's damage contribution, and his damage has greater AOE. So you tend to take the trade that favors Neuv.

^(This abyss of course, you're probably reserving Zhongli for shieldbreaking on second side, in which case you're likely picking Baizhu for Neuv into first side.)
    Neuvillette has a team? /j
    Its also straight up the best team in the game bar none currently unless they are dropping hydro tupa on both sides
Alhaitham fell down quite bit but tbh its expected considering 1st half has enemies inmune to dendro and the 2nd benefits of a geo character (tho not necessary). Personally I usually use him on a quickbloom team but for this one I used him on a spread team (zhongli/haitham/nahida/fischl) on the 2nd half bc the QB team kept dying on the last chamber lmao 💀
    Well last chamber pretty much wants a Geo character/clamore/overload otherwise its get very hard to survive. You can always run Haitham Xingqui Kuki ZL for hyperbloom. Once shield is down that boss isn't that hard.
        You can just plunge.
            You can, but plunging really eats into your time more then just running Zhongli/a Geo Based team if you have one. Especially since Cope isn't exactly the easiest to get fast clears against.
                It takes like 10s to break the shield with sword plunges, nahida can just save more time by adding dmg than saving 7s on the shield breaking with zhongli. It all just depends and geo is obviously favoured with the current abyss blessing 
            Yeah but like... why bother when you can use other more suitable teams lol (the reason why he dropped)
        Yeah, I struggled more the last cycle bc I forgot that thing had a shield and I tried to brute force it with plunge atks 💀 but then I just switched my teams a bit and it was fine. This time I just used the same teams and I did everything on the 1st try.

I never thought of that teamcomp tho but tbh using my haitham spread team was good bc I rarely use him on that team despite the fact I've invested quite a bit on him lmao
    Second side is definitely clearable with Alhaitham, did it myself with his Quickbloom team. But it does technically check him in two chambers with both the Jadeplume Terrorshroom having high Dendro Res, and then the Supercomputing Field Generator being favored by Geo Units. 

These meta usage rates are always going to favor who's the most efficient character to use in the Abyss Cycle, not who you can brute force your way through with the proper investment. It's why Ayaka continues to plummet to the bottom.
        Oh yeah, it's clearable with his QB team, I changed it mostly bc I got impatient bc I couldn't break the shield faster so I just changed the teams for one with zhongli in it. I didn't really have problems with the jadeplume tho.

And definitely, supports tend to stay more consistent on this lists but yes, it definitely depends on the enemy line-up (and sometimes the blessing and the character on the banner)
        It is clearable. But the speed isn't comparable with a proper geo team. I used Itto and cleared faster even though my Alhaitham team is more invested.
            Yeah that's how it be when chambers are more geared towards specific types of units. lol

But yeah, Ayaka is probably the unit who has been done most dirty overall. Because it's not even just Freeze, they're making her mono-cryo comp miserable to play too. And if the 4.6 abyss is anything to go by, it's not going to get any better.
        Eh, Dendro had Asimon checking all other teams in ST sides, so now its time for Dendro to get checked.
    I don't get why. I just replaced Baizhu with Zhongli in his team and everything went smooth on the 2nd side. First side..well Neuvillette just gave the Abyss a much needed powerwash.
    I still run Al-Haitham Hyperbloom for top half of floor 12.

He basically makes the dancing duo really easy.
    Haitham spread still have Zhongli as it's BiS sustain but yeah that team is not popular compared to Hyperbloom Haitham
        Kuki is better in that slot. Electro res + instructor + her personal damage + whatever support sword.
            Zhongli literally buffs the whole team unconditionally with his shred and ToTM and Kuki's personal damage is non existent in spread team.
    Personally running Quicken with Yae, Fischl and Baizhu second Half. Takes time with plunges sure, but baizhu's healing and protection are actually felt there.
    Al haitham has only ever been as high as he is due to people liking the character. everyone runs him with nahida yet I don't think there's a single al haitham team that's better than some nahida driver teams

    Nah not the k'sante Creepypasta 💀💀
        and why does it perfectly fit 😭
Furina+Neuvillette is the strongest combo in game,hands down.
    Hydro will never be dethroned as being the strongest element.
        Realistically i think they will make both sides of the Abyss hydro-immune eventually to see what happens
            We might see that shift in 5.x seeing as they probably want to give Pyro the opportunity to shine.
                Buffing pyro will probably end up buffing hydro as well, as Hydro is crucial in one of Pyro’s most important reactions, vape. (Unless they single out not buffing vape) 

Same with Cryo with Freeze. So I can only see Hydro getting stronger as we move forward with the game.
                    They could buff vape.

But they could also make an abyss with nothing but hydro heralds, spectres, mimics, slimes, eidolons, tulpa and the cube.

Imagine the only vape DPS they release in 5.x is a main dps so Neuv and Childe don't get benefits AND a mechanic that doesn't work with Furina. Like maybe, idk Bond of Life or something, ya know? /j

Realistically, yes, I do agree, hydro being a core reaction element will just remain the best. XQ had been strong and relevant since forever.
                        If they focused on a vape DPS, that’s only going to make the Hydro supports shine even more. 

The only way to make hydro not broken is to force restrictions against it. Which we already see with Chevreuse (by not including Hydro), Lyney (by making him focus on Mono), and now with Arle (by making BOL anti-synergistic with Furina).

Adding hydro immune enemies is just a direct attack against Hydro.

But anyway, the point is, I agree, Hydro is such a core reaction element that the only way to not make it broken is to not include it (by forcing restrictions against it) in the buffs that the other elements get.
                    Not necessarily. Lyney teams and Chevreuse teams can now nearly match the clear speeds of normal vape teams (I'm not saying that they beat Hu Tao and Childe, just that they aren't far behind them).   

We just need to have a little more variety in the type of pyro and cryo units launched to allow for different team styles.   

Also, the addition of good pyro and cryo off fielders will open up new possibilities for team compositions. For example, I tried out a burning team which I had decent success with. It turns out that the best pyro I could use for the job was.... Bennet, whose attack buff doesn't matter much for the team, and his healing is lacking as it caps to 70%. The best pyro applicator in that team was Kazuha.  

If a pyro off fielder existed who could heal/shield (and maybe CC enemies), it would allow me to on field Nahida. This is just an example, on how we're limited by the type of characters we have and that buffing an element by releasing different types of characters will not necessarily buff hydro.
                        > If a pyro off fielder existed who could heal/shield (and maybe CC enemies), it would allow me to on field Nahida

thoma?
                            Thoma and Dehya are sadly not good. It kinda gives the feeling that I'm using Barbara just because a character like Kokomi doesn't exist. I did say that I wanted the addition of good off fielders.
                    They could focus on melt (both forward and reverse melt). Incredibly underutilized, and almost always is reliant on Bennet XL currently.
                        Yeah that’s true, they could just focus on Melt, but Freeze is such an important part to Cryo’s identity. They can’t just leave it out to die. One way or the other, Hydro is going to shine once they revisit Freeze.
                            Forward melt can incorporate freeze as that still triggers melts, so I don't think it will be left out entirely (unless we just get Tulpa every abyss). Besides, even in a nation of hydro, cryo units besides Wriothesley are not faring too well so it might be another year of freeze struggles.
                    They probably won't be buffing vape but more of the underutilized reactions like melt, overload, burning, and burgeon. 
That means that hydro will only be enhanced in utility for burgeon which, while it buffs hydro, may not buff Neuvillette if it's basically a pyro Alhaitham of burgeon.
                Eww then I need to use Bennett & XL one side (hyperbloom should still work with hydro immunes) and I hate circle impact and even with high ER my XL always falls short. Or maybe the Natlan archon is like Bennett but without a circle.
            Has there ever been an abyss where 2 sides is same element immune?
            Doesn't even have to be immune on both sides. Just highly resistant boss on one side and abyss heralds on the other side would do it.

e.g. Hydro tulpa on one side and Suanni on the other and you'll see hydro dps stocks plummet. But I'm sure they'll just go with Icewind Suite again like every other 4.X abyss.
            The Hydro DPS might be affected but the strongest reaction still needs hydro. Vape, Freeze, and all bloom related reactions still need a hydro applicator. 


People still used Neuvillette against Hydro Tulpa by having a hyperbloom team.
        Pyro Kings when Hydro took the crown.
        Hydro will only ever be dethroned by a cryo or an electro shield abyss, or just a bunch of hydro lectors. I remember 3.8 basically encouraging us to play burgeon. Wild times. It would also kill Neuvillette. Can't move away if you're frozen. 

Now the curious solution is hydro tulpa both sides. Neuvillette can just be moral support against the boss.
        HYDRO SUPREMACY - BEST ELEMENT - STRONGEST UNITS - BEST WAIFUS/HUSBANDOS - STAY HYDRATED HOMIES
        I remember when they said this about pyro in 1.0-2.something
            Tbf a lot was said during 1.0 that was veeeery questionable 😂
    Its funny people then skeptical how hydro archon could become better than the already stacked roster. Now she comes with hydro sovereign dragon and still entirely own the meta.
    >y wil

neuv and kazuha?
        Yes?
If you told anyone back in 2021 that Ganyu and Ayaka would have one of the lowest limited character usage, they would've called you insane.
    No, I unironically knew it was coming back in 2021. The weakness of Freeze is that majority of enemies just don't get Frozen.

When Venti got countered in Inazuma it was apparent to me that Freeze would follow.
        Not to mention neither of the characters has gotten any good buffs in the form of another character or weapon or artifacts..

The last actual buff for Ayaka teams was Shenhe who was released in 2.4 .. 2 years ago (I don't count Furina since Furina isn't really good in Ayaka Freeze teams)

And Ganyu's last major/minor buff was Nahida for Burnmelt teams..It's actually funny how in 2021 people were talking about the "Liyue Big three" (Xiao , Hu tao and Ganyu) and said that Ganyu was considered better than the other 2 and was said to age better than Xiao and Hu tao... Now with consistent buffs throughout patches , Xiao and Hu tao teams are now at top even rivaling current good dmg dealers teams..
            Ganyu for what it's worth can still compete she doesn't dominate like before but she is still decent. Her biggest issue is being so squishy.
            Nahida wasn't a buff for Ganyu, more like a side grade. Burnmelt is just another option with it's own set of preferable circumstances
        Same. I know it’s confirmation bias but stillllll. Freeze is always and will always gimped unless (normally) the slow debuff is also present with helpful modifiers (like slow being Def reduced or RES shred)
    both sides floor12 just hard bodied cryo tbh, that damned coppelia and spider robot
        But how is Wriothesley high?
            Wrio is good against single target which is every second half chamber and none of the enemies are actually cryo resistant like the first half is. All you need is a character that can plunge away the shield in 12-3. I've done both Wrio freeze and burn-melt second half and those are not even his best teams  which is probably the melt team at 15th place as seen above.
            Ayaka has more raw usage number but Wrio has more usage rate.

&#x200B;

also people seems to run him on a reverse melt 15\* rather than the usual freeze.
    i really wonder what their ownership would look like if they were released today because cryo has been kinda neglected by hoyo since dendro dropped lmao
        Lower than what we have thats for sure
Wriothesley hanging on that consistent A. People really underestimated him on release, or just really wanted to pull both Furina and Neuvillette lol.

That said I love Zhongli and Kazuha so three cheers to them being awesome. Neuvillette is indeed amazing too.
    Man has been carrying cryo since his release, the only exception was in 4.4 when Ayaka got slightly lower usage than him because the entire first side was freeze friendly
    Isn't he like the second or third least owned 5* though? That's bound to skew stuff
    I'm saving for Wriothesley's rerun, can't wait to get C1+
        good luck on getting his cons! he's c1 right now and I'm planning to get c3 on his rerun. been carrying my skill issue troubles away so he's never left my teams lol
    I wanted him but like Yoimiya he was released in an unfortunate time between Neuv and Furina.

So I'm just eagerly waiting for a rerun, unless said rerun is between Arlecchino and Clorinde then... next time.
    and Top 25th team is Wriothesley solo
    He still has large flaws at c0
        running him in a burn melt team is actually pretty strong at c0 but i'm convinced his usage rate would be way higher if c1 was in his base kit
            Agreed 100%, because otherwise he does feel amazing to play. But that C1 being such a big bonus + his OG banner having poor release timing is a nasty combo.
        Can I ask what are his flaws at c0? I’m planning to pull for him next time around. Probably gonna get him c1r1 (or over c1)
    Look at the actual usage, 3000 which is quite low compared to others around him. It's just his ownership rate which is skewing the data, like chiori and some characters. Compare that to jean who has 8k usage but is much lower
    I got him c6 and now I’ve removed all the challenge from combat
    I'm that guy. Skipped him after getting Neuv to guarantee Furina. Now I'm not sure I have a slot for Wrio to use with all the dpses that came in Fontaine.
Damn my OG best team Ayaka is at 26th spot already... I feel left behind😂
    First half and 3rd half have 70% cryo res on first side, second side needs geo
        oh yeah omg i didn't think about that🤣 thank you! just thought that I may be "out-seasoned" already (for context I just came back from months of hiatus😊)
            They have been trying insanely hard to hard counter ayaka since 3.0. but because of that anemo DPS and cryo DPS have to go through 70 and 90% res almost every abyss
Umm, Chiori has 12.3% own rate, lowest limited 5-star character ever. Most people would just pull C0, but Chiori C0 can have only one doll without geo construct, so she does not work well with Navia or Noelle. That could explain why she is not welcome.

However, for those who have Chiori, 10.6% of them have C6, much higher than all other limited 5-star characters. It says that her C5 is around 85% better than C0, while her C6 is even much better than all C0 > C5 combined, and Chiori C6 has the highest damage increase from C0 when compared to all other 5-star characters.

Edit: The second highest usage team of Wriothesley is Wriothesley solo, and 7% of them chose to use him on first half. That is definitely a brave challenge, as the icesuit boss of third floor has 90% cryo resistance (also 90% anemo resistance). Two-thirds of Ayaka-Shenhe freeze and Xiao-Furina-Xianyun plunge also decide to challenge it,  but at least Kazuha and Faruzan can shred some resistance.
    >so she does not work well with Navia or Noelle.

She's technically an upgrade over Zhongli/Albedo at C0 still, but not actually enough of one to warrant pulling her.
    I was hoping to get Arlecchino and her weapon, but I figured I would’ve been short one five star to guarantee it so I got Chiori’s C1 instead. I have her talents at 9/9/9 and she has some mediocre artifacts, but she helps generate so many shards for Navia and I used her to 36 star the abyss. I thought I might’ve regret getting her C1, but I love how OP Navia feels with her.
    Yeah the wriothesley solo ones are crazy. I cleared it too but had to use wriothesley freeze
    idk if it's going to provee anything but I also noticed many c6 havers in r/ChioriMains
        There's a lot of C6 havers on every character mains subreddit.
    I have Chiori C4 and she adds a lot of dmg.
    Navia isn’t great for Chiori, but Chiori is great for Navia. Even at C0 she’s Navia’s most reliable source of Crystallize shards as well as energy, and her burst damage also benefits a good amount from Bennett who is a common Navia teammate. The only real reason to not run her with Navia is if you want Zhongli’s survivability instead.
        I did some calculations for the most used Navia team: Navia Zhongli Xiangling Bennett. If I swap Zhongli for C0 Chiori, it is actually a downgrade. One-doll Chiori does more damage than Zhongli, but Zhongli version will do more team damage. The better Navia and Xiangling are built, the difference is also bigger.
            What’s the breakdown for the calculations? I’m curious. I can’t imagine that realistically Navia will have the same amount of shards in both teams especially if Zhongli’s pillar isn’t hitting.
            Without the pillar, Zhongli does not proc tenacity or generate energy. The calcs that have Zhongli at just 5% below Chiori have both with fav. Without those he falls down a bit more below both Chiori and Albedo. Where are the calcs that say she is worse to begin with anyway? TGS, KQM’s Jaime, Jstern, etc. are all the other way using KQM standards.
    isn't wriothesley the same story? He is somewhat clunky without his c1, so most people who pulled him went for c1 too. Not to mention his banner was between Neuvillette and Furina so he was also skipped a lot. The first cryo catalyst aspect might have carried him a bit, but what's his own rate? I remember he was the lowest before Chiori.
    not​ welcome  when​ more​ than​ navia? in​ term  of​ %use?
When​ zl​ who​ is​ most​ usage​ rate​ already​ have​ pillar
i​ dont​ think​ that​ the​ problem
        I think I should say, "That is one of the reasons why fewer players pull her."
    > Chiori C0 can have only one doll without geo construct, so she does not work well with Navia or Noelle

Funnily enough Geo options are so bad, that she is still the best option for Navia even with just one doll.

As for C6, many whales argue that she's has basically one of if not straight up the strongest non-archon C6 in the game. Which is kinda sad considering she is one of the weakest limited 5\*s at C0.
        She’s actually one of the strongest subdps in the game at c0 in personal damage.

She just severely lacks utility compared to other subdps.
    Of all the people that own her, only 58% used her this Abyss. And considering that she's a new character, that's very low, unless there's people still building her.
        Some still building her, some don't even play abyss.  Especially this is geo we are talking about, so many owners are casual players who just pull for characters they like
        Most people don't pull for abyss.


Only the Furina and Nahida have ever had usage rates similar to their ownership rates.


For example Raiden has 79% ownership and sits around 50% usage on a good day.
            I do wonder why people care about meta so much if they don't pull for abyss. Bc the meta characters are always the more desirable units, but barely anyone does abyss
    What??
    > but Chiori C0 can have only one doll without geo construct, so she does not work well with Navia or Noelle.

i hate this clown narritive too much

like nothing really stops you using zl or albedo with them and even a 1 doll chiori is enough to make her look good in the team

my naviori team is legit the only team i got that can 0 cycle the whale and they make it braindead free to get
        Man, i was using my c0 Chiori with Mistsplitter and Ningguang in abyss, plus Furina and Shinobu full EM, and Chiori was on field most of the time with infusion. My Ning was using Dodoco and Furina is C0 with Festering, nothing amazing. Plus i suck with rotations. 

The fact that she brought up my Ningguang to Abyss for a 36 is fact alone that she works well.

One doll works pretty well anyway, if your dps is good, since hwr infusion is really not good. 

People just love to bash on anything if it's not the "best scenario". Navia benefits a lot from her. Or from zhong. Or from Candace. Or amber. Navia just works with anything, why optimize someone who is so strong 😂

Noelle I'm not so sure, though, because i don't use her.
        2 geo, 2 pyro is better because of pyro synergy. Not to mention if you go for Xiangling then you have to get Bennett too or the energy would be terrible.
Wonder when Cryo is going to have their comeback
    The second they release a decent pyro offielder instead of pyro on-fielder #2715252
    in *Snezhnaya* probably
    Wrio must be tired of carrying cryo on his back, man needs some company
    Let Tsaritsa cook
it's honestly pretty amazing that kokomi has had basically a complete identity shift in terms of her role.

she went from being the premier hydro support in Ayaka freeze teams to surpassing Ayaka in usage as an on-field DPS in mono-hydro and nilou bloom.

and it's not even that she's way less owned than Ayaka and it's skewing her usage rate, their ownership rates are very close, both around 50%, but she has almost 5x the usage.

I know abyss cycles have not been very kind to freeze lately but it's just crazy to see, I don't think I've ever seen a character have such a drastic role shift before?

if you had told people on kokomi's release that in a couple of years she would be one of the most commonly used main dpses far surpassing Ayaka they would've laughed you out of the room lol.
    Ayaka will return in Avengers: Snezhnaya.  Trust.

(Srsly  I hope they boost cryo somehow in 6.0, its suffering even more than Geo lately)
    It's interesting to me cause Kokomi was always designed as an onfield driver, but since her jellyfish worked so well with Ayaka people got used to thinking of her as an E bot.

That mentality stuck around even after she got Clam to make her onfield DPS/healer/driver stronger. Hyperbloom and burgeon also worked nicely with her as onfield driver, but she was still seen as kind of a niche choice for onfield.

It took Nilou being broken and having perfect synergy with Kokomi for that mentality to change. I'm really happy she has that mono hydro team now. It's my strongest team by far, and it's sooooooo ridiculously easy and comfy to play. No one in that team is ever at low health 😂
    Koko was always designed as a DPS healer like Noelle, just freeze was popular at the time and there isn't any good off field hydro char that also doubles as defensive/healer. 

Furina is honestly what enabled Koko the most, the two perfect match each other and you can very comfortable clear everything with just two of them alone.
I have never seen Alhaitham that low
I’ve lived long enough to see Gorou outperform Ganyu in the Spiral abyss
Navia 2nd most used DPS nice
    It helps that the abyss blessing it worth a damn this time.
        People read those? 🤔
    The second half of this abyss really pushes you to use Geo(or overload perhaps) + blessing benefiting geo damage
        Indeed but even in the previous abyss, she was already pretty high usage despite thr drop between 4.3 and 4.4 since people want to play with their shiny new toy. 

Navia just keeps winning though. Xianyun? A Navia buff. Chiori?   A Navia buff. Navia is just super flexible and not even energy reliant. She is a geo Alhaitham if geo Alhaitham exists (not Chiori).
            She was in B tier in previous abyss though, but that abyss wasnt that good for her anyways

Unless you mean previous usage rate but thats still the same abyss as the current one
        I'm confused, how exactly does it push to use Geo? I didn't use Geo, pyro or electro at all and didn't feel like I'm going against the flow.
            Breaking the boss's shield in third chamber second half, you can break it will plunge attacks but its comparatively much slower. The shield is easy asf if you have geo characters in your team
                Ah, makes sense.. I just pushed through with Xiao and didn't even consider that I needed something else XD
                    Navia is also a claymore character, meaning even her physical Attacks deal blunt dmg (the thing you need against the shield)
                        Well, yeah.. The question wasn't about navia tho, just about Geo in general
Problem not with team but my LAGGY DEVICE!
    This is why afk teams are king
    Alhaitham quickbloom with Furina was NOT fun against Coppelia on a potato phone... but I did it somehow
        Which half?
what team are people running charlotte with? or is she just an alternative pick for Jean?
    Neuvi, Kazuha, Furina, Charlotte
    She's a good Healer Option for Furina Teams
    navia albedo furina charlotte
    Ayaka/Furina/Kazuha. And in that team, you don't slot Jean because Ayaka needs Kazuha grouping.

Healer, cryo res and cryo battery, NO/TTDS holder, easy to build, not so bad for a 4* unit !
    Yeah with Kazuha having vv Jean is just a waste on Neuvi Furina team Charlotte is better. She is a bit annoying when she randomly puts you into photography mode but otherwise she is fine and her healing definitely made the abyss way easier.
I now understand why cyno is so low, it's probably the first abyss since forever where he is mostly kinda clunky to use (12-1-1 and 12-2-1 were very uncomfortable for me, still destroyed coppelia within a minute tho)
    isnt 2nd side perfect for him? the dendro shroom has high dendro res but thats about it
        I don't have zhongli on same acc with jackal boi, neither I wanna run them together, plus playing on mobile so it's difficult to break geo shield faster

Besides I have many more suitable teams for that
Not Faruzan being on only B tier out of FFXX 😔 Bring back abysses with no anemo res lmao
Wonder who can make teams with the lowest tier
    * Chevreuse Beidou Klee Lisa, some energy issues but good damage. Use 3 fav's if worse comes to worst. Will clear second side well, but I think it'll have to go first side. 

* Ganyu Layla Rosaria Sucrose for 2nd side since Coppelia on 1st side.

Low tier here doesn't mean units are bad or anything, just  that they are unpopular among this group.
        There's a melt [Amber player](https://youtu.be/dVyHnGfV_yg?si=5ht4ugt0FEd95V_Y) that runs Amber, Sucrose, Diona, Rosaria. Ganyu in Rosaria's place works too.

An overload team with Chev, Lisa, Dori/Beidou, Diluc/Klee should work fine.  
I personally ran Chev, Lisa, Fischl, Yoimiya for boss halves in past abysses.

Dori hyperbloom probably works. Dori, Collei, Barbara/Candace, Flex.

A bunch of mono-geo core units are in C tier. Just put Noelle where Itto normally goes, and you get Noelle, Gorou, Yunjin, Geo-Traveler/Ninguang.

Lisa/Keqing aggravate is another option. Lisa, Sucrose, Yaoyao/Collei, Dori or Keqing, Sucrose, Yaoyao/Kirara, Collei/Beidou.
        i wasnt thinking of this spiral abyss specificaly, just spiral abyss in general
            The same holds true in any abyss. Usage rate generally has very little correlation to character viability or performance.
    You can make a decent Morgana team with the lowest tier ones frankly.
        Never tried her outside of story quest

Heizou is cool but not sure what would work

i guess Heizou could swirl Monas hydro, and maybe pull in enemies with burst and Kaeya or someone to freeze
    Dehya melt
International still there :]

And... //squints eyes// Neuvillette-Childe Backpack is back for a bit I guess? I'm assuming those who did that don't have Furina or have such a hyperinvested Childe that they have Furina on a different team and let his Talent carry Neuvillette hahaha
    honestly!! for childe back packing yea it is. ive also been using a core of childe/zl/kazoo since 1.6 so slotting neuvi in was super easy . i have a very hyperinvested childe so i want to use him always

my neuvi is c1r1 so  his damage is already so good. it feels like using furina with him feels almost wasteful. like stealing candy from a baby 😭 i could use her in another team that does struggle more than him
        I got Furina to C3 just for him since aside from Kazuha he doesn't really have any buffers being an HP scaler. Now I usually run her on the other side since he doesn't really need her 😅
Was zhongli ever below s+?
    He sits comfortably on S on 60+ if no geo advantage in abyss
How is that Tighnari team always this high? I mean I have & love him but I didn't know that he was that popular
    Teams with limited team options tend to rank high due to minimal alternatives to their team. The team is often not actually played that much. Just has no variety so the one team ranks higher. 


 For example. That team is literally Tighnari's only appearance in top 50. Navia who has the team right below it appears 9 times.


 Another example is international. It looks like it's being used often because it only has 1 variation. However if you check Tartaglia's team usage he's actually used more as a Wrioth and Neuv slave. There is just a bunch of different variations of these teams.
    He's actually pretty great in ST chmabers.
    I run it, its one of the smoothest teams you'll ever play. 12 second rotations, amazing ST damage (which is all the rage these days), can hit the janky bosses that run and hide super easily.
    It's a good single target team with zhongli. It can deal with annoying enemies like works just as easily. Your every attack is guaranteed to land.
    Because as a standard character a lot of people own him and people who have been playing for long enough don't even need to farm for him as they probably already have a decent enough 4pc Wanderers Troupe set to slap on him. Adding to that, both Zhongli and Nahida are two of the most owned characters and Yae is also quite popular.

So tldr he dishes out awesome dmg without much investment as most people already have the units required for his team.
        Havent checked but his cons are good too right? 

Also, for those successfully pulled on the Chronicle banner, Tighnari mains who werent able to get his sig weapon are now able to use him with Hunter’s Path
            Yes, he definitely has amazing cons for a standard character.
            Nah the cons are pretty weak till c6, c1 looks ok but its a pretty small buff.
Gaming being so low is criminal. He's an amazing dps.
It's wild how the entire tier of S+... is just one of my teams-

Makes sense cause they synergize well
S+ is just Neuvilette's premium team 😂
S+ is deadass just Neuvillette's best team😂
I went with Layla with 50k hp and her shield was still not enough for the Ice Coppelia lol on the first side.

I mean, she has 250%effectiveness against cryo damage...
    This sounds like a massive skill issue.


At 50k hp your shield should have nearly 60k hp vs cryo.


That's 2 Zhongli shields.
    Maybe you got sucked into that tornado thingy they releases. My Layla have 30k Hp and she still can tank 2 or 3 Cryo hit until I got sucked into that thing and it started to break.
        My Kokomi got sucked into that sht and i couldn't get out no matter what, and just had to watch everyone die.

I don't think it's supposed to work like this?!

I jump, run, walk, anything, and got stuck there.

I never got there before because i avoid it easily, but this time i used burst near her and during the animation she threw me exactly to the tornado...
    Her whirlwinds are Anemo. The guy does the cryo damage.
    I still don’t really know the right way to defeat them. That boss always takes me the longest to kill I think I’m doing something wrong lol
        I really don't think there's a strategy to beating them unlike the Wenut or the Wolflord. Coppelia doesn't have a weakness phase (i think) so it's literally just go through your rotation and just dodge their attacks (especially the ice slashes. Those hurt 🤕) or time your bursts for invulnerability during the animation. If you can't beat it, it's either your team doesn't pass the DPS check or you need to work on your dodging.
    You might not be paying atention to her shield's duration.
        Also true, and with Wanderer it's not easy at all.
Chiori and Navia having this much usage rate is reasonable since Chiori has a very low ownership rate plus current blessings gives like 50% Geo dmg bonus. Not to mention the boss also in third chamber. 

Alhaitham and Xiao having low usage rate is also reasonable because of high Anemo and Dendro Res Enemies
(I'm surprised they are still at 20% . That tells you how insane these two are) 

Neuv and Furina being in top doesn't surprise anyone.

Bennett and Xingqiu still being in the top even though they are 1.0 character 4* tells you everything...


Zhongli being high is reasonable because of that second half third chamber boss and the overall comfort. 

And the abyss really favours Hu tao a lot since second half is completely ST based. (Surprised she isn't that high but reasonable)
    What scary is Xiao's team still no 6 highest usage and like 65:35 of used sides. Means that team mostly used on chamber with both Fatui Operatives and Copellia with their 70% anemo resist, i can see this team become #2 after Neuvi team if such enemies doesn't exists. This legit an extremely powerful team
        The Furina, Faruzan and Xianyun core is so strong that I can easily clear first half with plunge Lynette (it's a really fun team).
        That team will never be #2 because it takes Furina. The only way for it to rise is to reduce neuv's usage.
        I was lucky enough to get C2 Xianyun and with C6 Faruzan I could legitimately brute force Wenut with my Xiao team. His new best teams are scary good.
    ST is now spread out.

Look at Yoimiya. Tighnari has slowly been creeping upwards and upwards because his team is honestly just easier to use with Yae countering worms, infinite CA range and actual AoE. 

Not to mention Navia, Wanderer, Hyperbloom and AoE teams that also deal high ST. And Hutao herself hogging premium supports. 

Hutao used to have a niche all on her own. There's a lot of competition now.
        His usage rate has actually stayed the same or decreased over time. Team usage rate is misleading. Characters with 1 team will have that 1 team place high.
            It did drop from early Sumeru but he's been hovering around the same spot for a while, but he's generally in a better spot than the drop atleast past 4.0. He used to be only be seen when he actually counters the floor and has recently maintained a steady appearance rate. 

It does makes sense he drops a bit given a recent double worm in abyss. And tbf, this team is his best team without much sidegrades to it bar Baizhu. The previous one had three of his teams, even forcing a Raiden variant specifically to handle the worms. 

But nontheless, ever since Sumeru, a lot of single target teams have been around and Hutao's usage spike is stabilizing a bit towards the center.
    Ownership rate is weird. People bring it up when units that are controversial do well, but keep their lips tight when character's like Alhaitham were basically carried by being one of the single least owned dps for a year.


Not the case after the Fontaine cast since they all have low ownership besides Furina. 
        Neuvillette was one of the highest sale banner in all china before furina. His ownership is not low.
    Geos being the mandatory flex just to breat the final boss shield because the plunge mechanic sometimes doesn't work.
Gaming is fucking cracked and I need people to realise that
Ganyu still placed 2nd least used character 😭 she needs some serious help. Cryo is getting more uninteresting to play
    Dw cryo archon tsaritsa gonna make an heavy drip marketing 😬
Zhongli is DPD LOSS- they say, u have better options - they say🤡, yet our Jade Emperor, Lord Of Geo sits at the top, like the boss🎉

Double hydro HuTao Zhongli is my go to Team since her initial release, it hits hard and is super comfy to play
Seeing Ganyu barely beating Klee is kinda surreal lol
    In this cryo cursed abyss no less.
        but look at wriothesley….
Beidou being less used than traveler is blasphemy
That solo wriothesley 🗿
4,1% Klee usage, could've sworn it was less in the past. Who discovered the truth?
Kuki still top four 4 stars, let’s goooo!
Glad to see Baizhu getting recognised after been shut on for majority of his banner. Like some of the YouTube comments were downplaying him so bad, I felt bad. BUT THE LEGEND HAS RISEN. *Snake Noises*
guess I'm the 0.9% using Gaming
Representing that 0,2% Dori!
Alhaitham washed up already???? OMG he has been pOwErCrEpT?????? /s
hell yeah, shout out to 25 the solo Wrio.
BatChesting
honestly shocked that layla is in C tier, like.. if you dont have zhongli wynaut use her as an alternative
    In that sample, 84.7% of players have Zhongli...
        then how does zhongli have a 89% usage rate?
            Out of those 84.7% of people who have Zhongli, 89%  are using him.  

That's certainly impressive.
                Ah, I see
Yoimiya has been the biggest winner of this past few  months imo. always got good matchup, both her viable comp are actually great (vape and overload) and her range gives her advantage over other pyro dps comp.
Everyone's Neuvillette team: Furina, Kazuha, Baizhu  
My Neuvillette team: Dehya, Beidou, Fischl
I wonder why plunge Hu Tao is not more popular. Or to be more precise, not popular at all.

It feels really comfy to me. Went through the first side of this floor 12 like a hot knife through butter.
    My theory is, if you main a character for months, or years, it's because you like the way that character plays.

It's hard to convince someone to play their main a different way than what convinced you to main them in the first place.
        That could very well be the case.
    Because xianyun with xiao or because not all people pull her or because furina with the other team (neuvillette and co)
    Because most people who pulled for Xianyun likely also have Xiao so if they’re going to use her with anyone it’s him.
    Last boss geo shield incentivizes using Zhongli instead, Furina is used in many other teams, CN usually vertically invest in characters more than us; as an example, 50% of the Hu Taos on [akashadata.com](http://akashadata.com) are C1+ and 78.1% of them have Homa, so if you have C1 you probably won't use the Xianyun team, I believe they also value comfort more thus Zhongli.
Baizhu best dendro character. /s
    2nd best
I'm in that 2.8% that still uses Noelle
hope you keep posting these! the other dude blocked me just because i corrected them 💀
Can't believe Itto is that low, he smashes the second half
I still find the complete lack of Hu Tao plunge crazy. That team is much better than the Zhongli version.
    Zhongli is just so comfy
    I see a lot of bias towards comfy teams in usage rates lists regardless of whether there's more stronger teams
        the CN meta tends to favor comfort over speed running. Easier execution is more reliable, and if you're going to get your 600 primos anyway, you don't get bonus primos for lower times. Retrying if you mess up or get bad RNG sucks. I like it when my record says Battles Fought: 12.

that said, this is the first time I have used ZL in a very long time.
        Yeah but not even top 36? It's still a basicly unkillable team with what feels like twice the damage.
            I mean you got ask too, which character did the majority of people pull Xianyun for to use?

Western TCs definitely sung the praises of Xianyun's synergy with Furina opening the door for a lot of new team comps, which is true, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say most Xianyun pullers who are 36 starring ended up pulling her for Xiao teams.
                I pulled her for Navia amd skipped Xiao. Even my kind exists lmao.
    I used it on 4.4 abyss, and its really nice to have another playstyle for a character I've had since patch 1.3.
    For the same reason why Diluc plunge is also absent. Cuz people just prefer to use Xianyun with Xiao.
    she can plunge for free against the 12-3 boss.

I didn't use XY because I didn't use Furina on her team. Without Furina, the incentive to use XY falls off. I went back to ZL + sucrose + XQ. This was my old team before Yelan released.
    Form is Temporary, Zhongli is Eternal
    Yeah. Like XQ in place of Yelan is still stronger than classic Double Hydro with ZL. The XQ variant literally is just as comfy because you have enough interrupt resistance for almost everything and an HT with her bigger HP pool + XQ dmg reduction + Xianyun healing is near unkillable.
Itto/Zhongli/Gorou/Chiori on 2nd side feels so good.

Also, first side Neuvillette is just broken.
Got muscles from trying to lift Eula higher in the tier list.
    I also always use her in abyss, but I don't put my data in, feels like too much work.
Wrio solo is rank 25 but neuv solo doesn't even make the list despite being the 3rd most used overall? Insanity!
Itto you will always be famous to me
love that u have all these well put together teams and #25 is just wriothesley
How is solo Wriothesley here but not solo Neuvillette
Love seeing Chiori this high up! She is sooo much fun to use in a Navia team! I run her with Navia, Zhongli & Bennett and that team SLAYS!
Anyone able to translate the text? Curious also about the sample size for this as well.
    Post flair
Just wondering is there any advantage using baizhu over jean in the neuv comp?
    If he is C0, you will have a shield and Neuvi wont fall so easily while on charged attack
    You can use kazuha with baizhu, higher ceiling. Baizhu gives some interruption resistance too
Wish Heizou would more recognition. I mean look at him, he's literally genshin's one punch man and he's a detective, isn't that appealing these days? Lol
So much for Keqing and Diluc’s buffs..
Hu Tao, Furina, Yelan, Healer shielder Yanfei
.
Tighnari, Yae Miko, Kirara, Nahida
Been away for a while. What happened to ganyu?
    How long is a while? Because she’s been out of the meta for a very long time.
I won my 50/50 on Neuvillette so now i have another 5 star character after Raiden. What team do i make for Neuvillette? I'm already using Raiden national, and i have leftover characters like sucrose, cehvrouse and sara?
    Do you have Layla/Kirara and Fishl? You can use those and Sucrose in his team. Or Beidou with dendro mc/collei + Sucrose. You'll need favounius on anyone in your team or sacrificial on Beidou to comfortably battery her so her personal dps won't be much but at least her burst works with Neuvi's charge attacks.
        I dont have Layla, Kirara and Fischl but i do have beidou and sucrose. I also have a wolf's gravestone. I'll make sure to try beidou dendromc and sucrose with neuvillette.
            Nice. Give a favonius weapon to either mc or Sucrose if you have one to help battery Beidou's burst. You need to build some crit on that character then tho, to proc the weapon's passive. Also prototype amber on Neuvi. It's his best f2p weapon, it's craftable, and will help a bit with survivability and charging Neuvi's burst.
                TYSM, im saving for Zhongli and i already have like 60 pulls.
                    Great, he's a fantastic comfort character. He'll work great with Neuvillette as well
seems like less people submitted their data this time. last time it was over 170k samples and now it's only 99k.
Baizhu still going ultra strong
Another razor L 😔
I’m disappointed that ganyu is lower than A tier. But it’s respectable
Razor and Chongyun at the bottom of the list? Splendid.  I don't have to worry about this one either, as I can't attend it.. Not like I can even start it because I'm still stuck trying to make a second team for the spiral thing
    What do you expect? They're 4 stars and are launch characters, even if they're usable in abyss they won't be popular in usage rate lists. Cryo and Phys aren't at a good place currently either. Doesn't mean you can't use them if you like them and build them well enough. As a new player it's better to focus on more meta 4 stars if you care about spiral abyss tho, like dendro mc, Kuki, Xingqiu, Xiangling and Bennett. You can build your faves after you have more reliable teams for clearing abyss. Unless you don't care, then just build your favourites. Everything works in overworld and if anything gives you trouble you can always ask for help in coop.
        Honestly, I might as well just give up on spiral abyss then.. If I need to play meta and minmax the fun out of the equation, I'm better off not doing that. Most Meta characters I simply don't have, or don't like the playstyle of. Just spent all my luck getting Klee, and apparently she's a B tier or sth.. Can't give a shit. Every character I play is low tier somehow
            You neither need to play meta nor min max, you just need to be able to make reasonable teams and get everyone to a passable level when it comes to builds. Even launch players don't have min maxed teams with that artifact rng lol. If you want to give up, your choice, but it's quite a sum of primos to give up on. Also this tier list just shows usage rates, characters being lower doesn't mean they aren't good nor that they can't pass abyss.

Also you don't need to pass abyss 12 right away. If you can pass 11 it's already good enough for a newish player. I do abyss on my sister's 3 months old account and can consistently pass up to floor 11 with full stars and can finish 12 even (did that just for the achievement and the namecard for the sis) although just with 3 stars for now. I did recommend some characters to her but otherwise told her to get and build whoever the hell she wants, cause it's more important she has characters she likes, and leave worring about how to pass abyss to me. Her artifacts are horrendous btw. Abyss is more a team building check and knowledge about mechanics check than anything else. The so called meta characters just make some things easier. If you want, you can list what characters you have, maybe I can recommend some comps out of what you have. You can also visit mains subreddits of your favourites and check there.
NINGGUANG OVER 1%?

I MUST BE DREAMING
That 0,1% Amber Mains scare me
My beloved Diluc 😭😭😭
Nilou is only low because of those fucking dendritic specters
Proud to say i’m one of the 0.1% xinyans :D
Never seen Alhaitham this low
Wriothsley is much higher than I thought he would be. Never really vibes with his teams but he’s as played as alhaithem
I feel called out...

My two abyss teams are literally the 2 top used teams.

The only difference is the order in which I have my characters lmao.

Kind of surprised by the 3rd team...maybe it's something specific to this abyss but it doesn't seem like a particularly great team. Including Zhongli in particular is a pretty huge DPS loss compared to running Fischl. I guess people just don't like running squishy Yae and Tighnari without a shield...though that's where I run Baizhu and Fischl instead if I were running that team, potentially Kirara if I need Baizhu on the other team.
Where are my 4.4% Gorou users at? 🤣
My Navia and Chiori team absolutely trivializes the second side. 

First side is annoying though because it's a mix of AoE BS and single boss floors. Hu Tao plunge vape is solid but the grouping and lack of shielder make it kind of annoying - becomes more of a kill them before they kill you situation.
Haven't played in a long time...

\*scroll scroll\* Awww yea - Taser team bringing up the C tier, let's go!
How is Yae use rate still around 30%? It never increase but it never decrease either. HOW?
Proud part of the 0.9% gaming users 🗣️‼️
Huh I expected sucrose to be higher
From Ganyu Impact in the early days to her now being the second least used limited 5* for abyss, wew. If you told me that in 1.x I wouldn't have believed you.
I don't know anything about the game but this sub pops up on the front page a lot and in the S+ und S category it seems that it's completely unchanged since a year or so.
The temptations to pull for Kazuha are everywhere, I must be strong
Proudly representing the 4.6% of Keqing users.
Doing my part with Keqing, my queen
That Razor at the bottom is me. :)

Nilou'ed first half, used random bull\*\*\* for the 2nd. Easy clear.
.02% yanfei wya
As a Geo main, I shall cherish this fleeting moment with Mono Geo as the 5th most popular team.
Glad to be the 0.3 with my bbg heizo
How good is the #3 team Tig, Yae, ZL, Nahida? I actually own all of them but never use Tig, he seemed to be too much of a hassle. 
What else is new?
0.1% amber rise up 🫡🫡
I really need Baizhu, or another heavy healer like him that isn't anemo. I wanna see that Neuv stonk damage with Kazoo Furina.
All of my mains are in C- oops?
Can someone explain Party 8? Kazuha, Kokomi, Yelan, Furina
    There is no explaining, that what makes it so good. No ER requirements, impossible to die, simple rotations, no worry about elemental auras, crazy high damage, its the definition if random bullshit go, the team.

It also works with XQ if you wanna leave Kazuha open, and its still enough to one cycle abyss f12 bosses [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/s/4UncEqIMQ1)
    FuriKok Mono Hydro.

Kokomi on-field driver for Yelan and heals for Furina. Kazuha for res shred and buffing Hydro. Furina for Furina.
Im proudly part of that 0.1% using Chongyun
Is baizhu better than Nahida? I only have Baizhu and I’m happy with the healing and dendro application by him so I don’t have any plans of pulling for Nahida but I thought she would be at least higher than him
    This is usage rate, which takes the percentage of people who owned a character and actually used them this abyss. If you look at the last picture on the post, you’ll see that of the 27390 people who own Baizhu, 17559 people used him. 17559/27390 \* 100 = 64.1%. If you look at Nahida’s statistics, of the 92,958 people who own her, the highest of all limited 5-star units, 53292 people used. 53292/92958 \* 100 = 57.3%. 

So despite being used more than twice as many successful 36-star runs as Baizhu, Nahida has a lower usage rate because she’s the most owned limited 5-star unit in the game. You’ll see a similar thing with Chiori who has a higher usage rate than Navia simply because almost 3x as many people own Navia compared to Chiori, and no one would say Chiori is better than Navia. So to answer your question, no, these statistics don’t mean that Baizhu is better than Nahida, just that Baizhu’s significantly lower ownership compared to Nahida gives a better usage statistic.
People year or two ago wouldnt believe ganyu's going to be C tier in a few years lol
oh zhongli you'll always be famous
As usual, the only part of me that isn't basic as hell is my use of Tighnari. Every other part of me is stock IG.
So I'm part of that 8% who always use Fischl.
Geo blessing and new toy in chiori, and itto still on the bench :(
HEIZOU MAINS WERE SINKING
Does anyone have a link to the source these are posted on?
why is my neuvillette team comp at the top
Huh diluc is c and kazuha is S+...


am close to soft and he has a rerun rn.......


Nah fuck that (goes back to farming)
Wow teams 4 and 5 seem great but everything else seems to give up a whole lot of damage
How is itto 3 times gorou?
    usage rate is based on ownership rate. more people own gorou because he's a 4 star.

most itto users are using gorou, but most gorou havers don't even have itto, tanking his usage rate.
        Then what's the point of usage rate
            it's really just to show which 5 stars (and popular 4 stars) are useful for the current abyss lineup, and to show the current trends; which characters are popular with the people who own them.

but people often misinterpret it as evidence to how strong characters are.

that said, the fact that a character like xiangling manages to be 52% despite 100% of players owning her is rather impressive. it literally means that 52% of players use xiangling in the abyss (though it should be noted that this is just people who submitted their data, not all players across all servers. still impressive though)

anyway, you can see the ownership rate in the last image, second to rightmost number. chiori for example, despite having a high usage rate, only has around a 12% ownership rate. only around 12% of players who submitted their data own chiori. but, the people who pulled for her are most likely going to use her, especially since geo is good this abyss. so, she gets a high usage rate.
    First page is calculated based on usage divided by ownership. Many more people own Gorou than they do Itto.
        That makes sense
Solo floor 12 with wrio enjoyer!!!
More people use Deyha than Diluc.

Big smile
S+ team is just the standard Neuvelite team. That team is crack even without an healer it deal ton of damage.
The top S is the best neuv team lol
Seeing my boy Razor on the very bottom every time makes me sad. Even Aloy is higher than him.
    What’s there to be sad about? Think you need to just be realistic of his power levels in this game.
Part of the 0.3% who’s using Kaeya 😋🤞
i fear that wriothesley main
Seeing Xiao above Wanderer is kind of funny to me, considering how many people I used to see saying Wanderer was the better Anemo DPS while using the usage rates as evidence.

Can't we just agree both characters are good, and move on?
    I mean im not saying usage rate  is an evidence but xiao got literally buff by furina and xianyun since then ,everyone are aware that hes a beast
S+ tier itself is one of the greatest team🤣🤣
love how S+ is a team of their own, aka, Neuvillette’s best team
Random Wrio solo lmao
Player (Ruler) : "My mindset already changed since early game, now i will maximize any DPS to its ceiling even if it means sacrificing my comfort"

Zhongli (Faker aka GOAT) : "Dear player, you must not forget..... That All Roads Lead To Me"

    That line went so hard though. 


"i have seen the ride and fall of many teams, but the player who stood at the end was always me."
        That line goes well with Zhongli as well. He has seen so many meta going up and down (vape meta, dendro meta, now hypercarry meta and such) but in the end only him that can comfortably fits to all of those. He is trully the Dad of this game.
    No way a league ref?!
        Ngl I think there’s a big overlap in the communities
            Oh for sure. BeryL (DRX’s support) designed an Ashe skin to resemble [Elysia](https://www.oneesports.gg/league-of-legends/elysia-drx-worlds-2022-ashe/) from honkai impact 3rd after winning worlds. Obvi not genshin but same idea of player base crossover.
    Zhongli's inner Thanos is showing..
"Where did that bring you? Back to me."
Dumb machine that takes 0 damage until you break it's geo shield on one side.

Oh by the way there are some geo resistant enemies on the other side, that also get buffed if you are hit with a  shield... which... happens to be reaction of the element that we are giving you a buff for, yeah...

— Floor 12, probably

Been a while since a saw such a force synergy in abyss, all geo/zhongli teams are going to part 2 (except that brute force with Neuvillette)
    Actually that machine has 210% all resistance when it has shield (10% without shield). It is still doable without breaking it as long as you can do equivalent of 20M damage. Not recommended except C6 whale showcase, of course.
        Doable is a very strong word in that context lol.

                What manner of sea creature is this?

I swear high constellation Genshin is practically another game.
                why are people always spamming the menu
                    To pick up particles, I'm pretty sure. It pauses the timer but those still move. If not that, then I dunno.
                        My favorite was this one video of an abyss speedrunner who was menu'ing after every action to collect particles, the actual video was like 3 minutes long or something but in-game it was like 15 seconds or something 💀
                            it might have been against maguu kenki, you can skip his stalling invulnerable phase by constantly booking/opening the map every millisecond
                            You mean something like this https://youtu.be/cxnvuTNyy3c?si=irH_l84ZGS9ZygLy ?
                                LOL yeah that was the video I was thinking of
                    To pick up energy particles and reset character switching cooldown (I think)
                    Menus Freeze time for everything except particles
                Hi, I'm Old and Dumb, so could someone please explain something to me:

* C6R5 characters are, according to Google, 1-1.2k$ on average, they have both Furina and Yelan C6R5
* Xianyun is C2R5, so I assume 600-700$ at least?

So that's what, 2.5-3k usd on average, which is fine, I'm not here to police what people spend their money on, and it's not like it's that absurd of a sum all things considered (depending on where you live in the world).

However, my question is this: why, in the name of all holy fucks in the world, would they then be playing the game on a phone??????????????
                Did I....do this by accident?

I technically had Zhongli so probably not I suppose.

Definitely just used Hu Tao / Zhongli / Xingqiu / Yelan though and just smashed Hu Tao vape plunge attacks into it until it died.
        Went in blind and Overload did it for me
        I jut used raiden national as always. 

Simply have Raiden jump a couple of times before doing your usual rotation. 

Repeat once more if you can't one-cycle it (I can't) and that's it 

Just breaking the shield twice with a couple of quick plunges takes like no time at all. 

It buffs jumping height of all charactersnear, so everyone can just plunge attack by simply jumping straight from standing on the ground without any special setup
    I tried to do Itto first half and Navia second half but the shield guys were pissing me off so I had to go Neuvillette oonga boonga for that one (as much as I'd rather use my boy Arataki instead of the usual strong meta characters like Neuvi)
        pro tip : use crystallize shield instead, the enemies won't get their buff if your shield breaks when they attack you.
That's how I managed to do Itto first half and Navia second half.
            > he enemies won't get their buff if your shield breaks when they attack you

Instruction unclear. Itto's crystalize shield is way too beefy, it takes at least 4 simultaneous hits to break through it(Redhorn to good)


Altho truthfully, I'm careful with my crystalize placement.  I don't apply any elements when they spawn and just geo smack them.  I also know which attack is the shield steal so I can avoid it if I do still have a crystalize shield active.
                What does redhorn have to do with crystalize
                    Defense reduces damage taken which also applies to shields. A Noelle using Layla’s shield for example can tank more hits with it compared to a different chara
                        Ohhh yeah true
             It is possible that even if you do not use a shield on your team that the Husks' buff is activated because of the rumbling stone aura that causes Geo damage independently of Geo Husk (which in base form only causes physical damage), I I realized that Husk was in enhanced form even though my team lacks geo and shield (Furina, Neuvillette, Kazuha and Kuki).
    I just brute forced the machine with Raiden National. Didn't know it had a geo mechanism. It didn't take that long to kill.
        Is not a geo mechanic, you need to hit it with blunt damage to break the shield. And since the shield is a geo shield it takes extra damage from geo sources, you can take someone like Zhongli whose hold skill deletes more than half the shield and burst the other half.

Well if you are not breaking the shield you required around 19 million equivalent damage to brute force through it resistances, so either you are a major whale or you are indeed breaking the shield, that or you are talking about another machine.
            I just break the shield with normal attacks
                You are breaking it with overload.
It always baffles me how Zhongli is constantly being bashed upon for being "a DPS loss" and how even slotting him in a team or having a particular character rely on him is seen as "bad", but then everytime I look at usage rates he is always on top.
    TCs and CCs can't calculate practical improvements of which Zhongli can provide. TCs assume perfect rotations when calculating dps of a team or character, but it ain't all true since everyone can fumble and there is a lot of RNG involved in order of enemy attacks. Zhongli is king of consistency.
        Not everyone can play like a TAS Speedrun, and you don’t really need to be faster than 3.00 minutes, so comfortable play is better than -5 sec.
    I feel like this is kind misleading. The teams ZL is used in are teams where he is a dps increase. 


It's not ZL being used in a bunch of teams for his defensive utility. It's ZL being used in teams where he increases the dps on top of his defensive utility. 


People aren't plugging him into random teams for defensive utility. They are playing the teams that value him offensively and defensively. 


 If you ignore the teams using him to break the shield in 12-3 almost all of his usage comes from the 4 most popular dps atm. 
        Genuine question: what are the teams where he is considered a DPS increase? Because everytime I see someone even suggesting running him in any given team causes people to go wild claiming you'd be better off replacing him with someone else.
            He's very good in Tighnari teams, since swirl does nothing for Tighnari (>50% of the team dps) and only increases your electro unit's aggravate damage.
            Neuvilette furin Kazuha zhongli is neuvillettes highest dps team at any investment level
                That team SHREDS. Zhongli shield bot + Petra = chef kiss
            To expand on why Zhongli makes it into Neuvillette's best double hydro team even at C1+, it is because of 4pc archaic petra on top of the universal shred.
            Navia
        Except a while ago people would constantly push replacing him with another character even in teams where he isn't that big a DPS loss. For instance people pushed Funernational replacing ZL with Xiangling in double hydro Hutao claiming a DPS increase, but teams like that never receive widespread adoption because it only takes a single reset to have lost any time saved by increasing DPS by a few thousand replacing him.
            Teams like that aren't popular because they took your XL from your aoe. At the time you had Ayaka, international and Raiden as aoe dps.


It's very clear why it wasn't popular.
            Depends on your level of investment. All the popular Hu Tao teams now don't use Zhongli for a reason - Furina requires a complementary healer and the extra damage through those two units is greater than the utility provided by Zhongli + Xingqiu.
                Thats not true hutao popular team is still with zhongli,its not with furina since she is generally on the other side and that she still has enormous damage without her
    No sane person would call Zhongli a DPS loss, dude earns his place with res shred alone. His ultimate specifically however is indeed a DPS loss, its damage is not worth the animation time, it's a relic from his original kit days when Hoyo wanted him to be a shitty DPS for some reason.
        his ult kit is gated behind a lot of constellations and talent level scaling, simple screenwide 90k+ crit unbuffed at max while re-applying shield
        His ult Seems to be useful against geo shield
            It can be, but in those cases it's not really a "DPS" option, it's just a shield shred option. Those cases are generally VERY rare.

You basically never build Zhongli for his own personal damage.

At the end of the day the actual damage output of his burst compared to the time the animation takes to cast is just bad. The only situation where you see people using his burst is usually if that person has C2, in which case it's NOT a huge DPS loss as you can easily use the instant swap/burst and you refresh his shield without ever having to hold his skill instead.
    >Zhongli is constantly being bashed upon for being "a DPS loss"

cause those people are playing spreadsheet impact
    In this Abyss, he is not a dps loss because he does immense damage to geo shields. He is also used to stack resist shred against super high resistance enemies.  If you want to fight Coppelia with Wanderer for example you will need both Faruzan and Zhongli resist shred.
    Zhongli is a DPS loss to actually use him offensively. Unless you have his C2 you effectively never use his burst because it's just a waste of time. All you do is pop him on field and hold E for his shield and swap off him.

His entire purpose is basically just for a shield with resistance shred and maybe more buff depending on his artifacts.

Shield in general though are generally a "DPS loss" compared to alternatives, and are mostly used for ease of play. In most cases if you just avoid enemy attacks you're better off using a more offensive off fielder for higher DPS. Zhongli can somewhat get around this due to how strong his shield is and the duration, requiring less frequent field time to refresh it, on top of providing offensive buffs with the resistance shred. The resistance shred in particular gets MUCH stronger when you're running a team that deals multiple types of damage as this means he's providing a 20% resistance shred buff to each type of damage, more overall value.

At the end of the day the peak of player character DPS FAR outscales the DPS requirements to beat floor 12. If you're able to run the top usage teams your DPS output generally far exceeds the "challenge" of the chambers. There is essentially no reason you actually need to run 100% optimized DPS teams when you can instead clear much more easily with more comfortable teams that are easier to play. Running the top played Hu Tao team with Xiangling instead of Zhongli is objectively a pretty huge DPS increase, but you have to avoid enemies constantly making sure you don't die, often while at very low hp on Hu Tao. Instead though you can just run Zhongli and basically play with your brain turned off just spamming CA on Hu Tao never needing to dodge at all, and you still clear anyway. Likewise you COULD run the Neuvillette team with Nahida instead and it'd likely be quite a bit more overall DPS; Baizhu really provides basically zero value to the team's reactions and is just a shielder / healer that can easily add a hydro reaction stack to Neuvillette's A4. Nahida on Prototype Amber (particularly if you run Proto Amber on Neuvillette too) would be "better" but far less comfortable to play, and at the end of the day that's usually what it comes down to in the end.

You'll notice that the top teams are NOT what you'll see people run if they're mega whales that are trying to speed run Abyss. In those cases, where you're trying to get every spec of DPS, people run other teams.
    Sure, he is a dps loss, but you know what is an even bigger dps loss? Having to do fight mechanics.

As the old saying goes: " Stand in fire, dps higher". Zhongli lets you stand in the proverbial fire all day long.
    its because people are very bad and don't dodge, hope that helps. very easy abyss lol
    It's because people suffer from Anti-Geo brainrot.
The true dps loss was the dodging we did along the way.
They tried to bring Kazuha down with the dendro meta, but no, my man will always find a way to be one of the most relevant units. And now with Fontaine he's better than ever.
    As long as one of the four swirlable elements is meta, so will he be meta.

Honestly Furina probably is more significant in affecting his usage than Dendro - there's an appreciable niche for Xianyun/Jean consolidating VV and healer categories, at least until we get more teamwide healers that also provide other utility. 

Chevy is also an attempt at making him less mandatory, as you now have hypercarry setups for Pyro and Electro excluding him.
        C2 Kazuha also buffs pretty much any dendro comp that has a flex slot, so a lot of people have him there
    >They tried to bring Kazuha down with the dendro meta

Dendro Meta brought us Aggravate, which benefits from Kazuha
    He can trigger aggravates, hyperblooms, and burgeons. Anemo units in general can trigger other reactions due to swirls inflicting the absorbed element (partly why Sucrose is a good driver), so he won't be dropped unless they introduce an enemy that cannot be swirled or repels Anemo damage hard.
        don't forget that in quickbloom he can cluster bomb by grabbing the seeds
    True,He is the best choice for all fontaine dps except Navia
    and Arlecchino is coming lol
    I mean, whenever something counters dendro, it can be fucked by another meta team, and Kazuha makes wonders in that scenario.
    He did go down a bit during Dendro saga. Nahida was dominating with usage rates no one ever saw. Others such as Zhongli/Yelan/Raiden/Kazuha usually keep having turns in who would be at the top with rest, but Zhongli and Kazuha usually do make it on more number
    Kazuha is the single most broken dendro flex pick if you already have one electro and one dendro outside of maybe xingqiu
Zhongli even more eternal. Kazu's usage wont mean much if a player decided to runs Geo and Dendro for each side, Zhongli still can be there regardless.
    Zhongli drops off for me whenever the Wenut/Ruin Serpent shows up or tag team consecrated beast floors (basically the whole of 3.x Abyss floors).

Its not that he's bad, is just that I need his slot to time the floor, a shield is helpful but I argue that learning how to dodge or healing through the damage is much more advisable.
        Last patch has wenut and ruin serpent both and he still like high S (68% or something). I think with Navia around he also have a premier frontload DPS so he even got more options nowadays to deal with short windows enemies
            Also a mainstay in Tighnari-Yae spread because he plays the 12s rotations well. That team is a silver bullet for the Wenut.
        I think most people don't realize that not everyone aim for 36 stars. Some people just like to be able to clear abyss and have fun and Zhongli allows them to comfortably clear it even though in some cases he can be dps lost and can't get you 36* but you can surely clear chambers and for some clearing it is already an achievement. This is also one of the reasons he is mostly used.
            This data is full star clears only though so it's exclusively people who used Zhongli *and* got 36 stars.
        >Zhongli drops off for me whenever the Wenut/Ruin Serpent shows up or tag team consecrated beast floors

???

>learning how to dodge or healing through the damage is much more advisable.

The reality in genshin is that you CANNOT dodge everything. His shield is FAR superior to dodging and healing. And whatever loss your team gets by bringing him in is almost always so insignificant you most likely end up with better dps by never getting interrupted or be forced to play safe.
    Dendro is fine for Kazu, mono geo and Nilou bloom are the only two comps where he's not useful.
Ah yes, the real anemo archon
the duke needs no help in doing his job lmao.
I still can't comprehend how wriothesley can solo this particular abyss ;-;
    All the attacks on the second side are very dodgeable and wrios charged attacks can get through the geo shield, just bring a really fast first side and the second side with solo wrio is free
    These are all C6 Wriothesley.
        There was one c1r1 Wriothesley main solo on 2nd half. Idk how they do that but they did
            I think it was u/wriotheslycumdumpster
                I couldve lived without knowing about his existence, btw
                Hey its me! HAHAHA
                    I'm wish i could get on your lvl one day... Abyss skill, I mean. Not the username lol
                That username definitely rings the bell lmao
        Is that a fact or just your own assumption? Because you only needs C1 to be able to solo shit and that’s what I’ve been doing ever since he’s out
I get that's probably a joke but what is the real team supposed to be?
    It is not a joke. You can refer to The Genshin Scientist's guide to reading abyss usage rates on YouTube. In brief, there are not many Wriothesley owners and even less users. So the whales get to be a bigger percentage of Wriothesley users and whales who do solo Wriothesley runs can appear higher in percentage than normal.
Yes. The dendro is mostly for the elemental stacks for Neuvi. However it is a nice side damage, you can use kazuha to scoop em together.
    Kazuha will prioritise sucking Pyro from anywhere in the field, from enemy shields/torches, or even yourself if your on fire

That means random Burgeon explosion nukes
        It's all right though since his built with em. Thats a nice burgeon dmg. 

On side note. Im using him for aggravate and that pyro infusion sucks. Fuck that second chamber.
        bum bum bakudan at home
        > Burgeon explosion nukes

If only there wasn't a 2 dmg instance per 0.5s rule
        More passive stacks for Neuvillette then
            Burgeon won't trigger Neuvillette passive, it's not a hydro reaction.
                Oh I see
    I dont have baizu and furina, is this something that can be utilize with neuvi, zhongli, kazuha, and nahida? I also have yelan, and xingqui if i need to swap somebody else.
        Yeah I just use zhongli instead of Baizhu, works fine. You can probably use fischl or something if you have Neuvilette c2
        I wouldn't recommend Nahida in this combination. She would have more utility in another team. Else you can do Nahida Neuvillette, full EM raiden and zhongli. This team deletes everything as well. Xinqui and Yelan wouldn't do much but add hydro resonance. Do you have Fischl? You can add Fischl instead of Nahida.
            Yeah but i only have her at C0. Would that be alright?
Yep, baizhu is just there to heal for fanfare and give neuv a passive stack.
    With C2 Baizhu he doesn’t even bother coming on field, he just happens to be the most efficient way for a passive stack. The heal is largely irrelevant and the shield becomes less relevant after C1 Neuv.
I remember leaks saying neuv's a mono hydro carry, then his kit came out saying he fits rainbow teams, but right now he's unironically mono-hydro(always has been)
Yes, it never really had a ‘bloom’ identity to it. It was more like a hypercarry or mono team. Baizhu is just there for the heals.
yes
HAHA that is exactly my team and yes I just pretend that I didn't see anything and as someone already said yes Baizhu is there because his healing is just too good + for Neuv's 3rd stack on A1.

One of the reasons why I was coping that Chiori would be a Geo Healer is because she would be 100% better than Baizhu in that team.
its like Rational, its not overload, its just a bonus
I don’t even ult on baizhu. I generally dislike it since it can’t make subsequent hydro swirls harder. Plus it basically does nothing that useful and it feels like a dps loss.
it's not mono hydro. It's neuv hypercarry bis team with c0/c1 furina. baizhu just stacks fanfare and provides song of days past buff (he ain't even using dendro set)
Rise up! 🫡🫡🔥🦅
It's a shame that he's still so slept on even after the glow-up from Xianyun. Plunge Diluc is a genuine monster, especially if you properly Swirl with Viridescent Venerer.
    I don't think he's really slept on anymore.  He's talked about in every Xianyun discussion, and Gaming was compared to him in every third comment when he released.  People who lose their 50/50s to Diluc just tend not to build him unless they wanted him anyway, so his usage rate is always going to be low, even if he gets godlike supports.
    what’s the proper rotation here then? to get the most out of xianyun/furina ult as well as swirling correctly
        Depends on if you use CW and Bennett C6 or not.  2pc2pc is pretty good, but CW is better.  CW rotation is a little more annoying IMO, cause without it you don't need to worry about not having VV and Bennett burst active on all his plunges.

If you use CW and Bennett C6, I do Furina EQ -> Bennet EQ (you may need to do short hold E on Bennett to make sure you keep pyro aura, I forgor) -> Xianyun EQ -> Diluc E plunge E plunge E plunge x6 - Q.  

Numbers wise I think the boost from his Q isn't worth losing uptime on either Bennett or VV, however if you don't have Bennett C6 (you should if you want to use Diluc Plunge tbh), you'll need to do EQ at the beginning of Diluc's rotation to get the pyro infusion.
            yep i have c6 and rocking a very strong CW set and ittos weapon . thanks for this i really appreciate it. gonna try it out tonight.
                One more thing, Xianyun has a long burst so if you have to rotate more than once what I sometimes do is just Q on her, no E, then I do her E and catch particles after Diluc is done.  Cause the E is gonna swirl pyro away, not the Q, so you lose a second or two of VV 💀
                    my goat, ty
    The vv helps but Is pretty unnecessary thankfully. 

Xianyun got me to buy his costume and finish up his levels. Even with I think lvl 8 normals he's still more than capable of clearing
    Wish I managed to get her but I was really short on gems at the time. Although I say that but I managed to get 146 pulls for Mona in 4 weeks lol
RAAAAAA 🦅🦅🦅🔥
🫡🫡
Burnnnnnnn🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
any suggestions for my diluc?
trying to him
    Play plunge diluc with furina c6 benny and xianyun
        don't have furina or Benny 🥲 
but has xianyun
            You can play melt plunge but still need benny atleast c1 and play xingqui instead of furina
                i play diluc - xingqui - xiangling - zhongli and it's rather comfortable. depending on the enemies ill throw nahida in there instead
                don't have furina and xinqui and no Benny🥲
                    Play with kaeya and whoever you have you seem like new player
                        bro literally just got neuvelite 😱
                            Neat, build around him, he is incredibly good
Liked playing him as trials
You didn’t mention 0.6%Qiqi and 0.1%Aloy.
My only actual dps raaaaaaaaa
It's criminal that he's that low.

He basically replaced my C1R1 Hu Tao ever since Xianyun came out. Diluc plunge is absurd.

125-170k plunge attacks.
I use Baizhu in place of Zhongli so everyone is full health and i guess i technically deal more damage because of the Blooms?

JK it's because i needed Zhongli in the other half
    Everything hurts so much nowadays on mobile, I'm for pulling for survivability now. Baizhu's the closest I'll get to a second Zhongli.
        Everyone laughed at me last year when I said baizhu had as much pull value as zhongli, that he was better than kokomi, now he is the meta support slot for the best characters
I use that variation except replace Kazuha with Fischl.

Unlimited off field damage made that last floor 12 boss a cakewalk.
And hands down the best team in the game as well. It has mixes of high damage and comfort plus utilities (Kazuha and Zhongli are universal shield breaker and resistance down). This only countered by hydro immune enemies, to thing that thats the only counter show how incredibly powerful this team is.
    Sometimes I just put Childe in there and never switch to him just for the +1 normal attack because Neuvillette will destroy any chamber anyway
        and if you have C3 Neuv you get to unlock the lvl14 talent which is cracked btw 
    How is this team played? Does Furina just drain everyone except Neuv's health down to 50% and then they're just left like that unhealed?
        Yeah. You couldn't care less about them being 50% hp and Neuvilette stacks fanfare by himself. For c0 Neuv it's probably his best team if we take comfort into consideration.
        Yes, net-net it trades a bit of Furina's damage for Neuv's. Baizhu's frontloading fanfare and Zhongli's Archaic Petra+res shred benefit them equally; the small difference comes from Baizhu giving Furina's pets more HP to drain vs Zhongli's buffs stacking on top of Furina and Kazuha for Neuv. 

It's just that Neuv is 2-3 times Furina's damage contribution, and his damage has greater AOE. So you tend to take the trade that favors Neuv.

^(This abyss of course, you're probably reserving Zhongli for shieldbreaking on second side, in which case you're likely picking Baizhu for Neuv into first side.)
Neuvillette has a team? /j
Its also straight up the best team in the game bar none currently unless they are dropping hydro tupa on both sides
Well last chamber pretty much wants a Geo character/clamore/overload otherwise its get very hard to survive. You can always run Haitham Xingqui Kuki ZL for hyperbloom. Once shield is down that boss isn't that hard.
    You can just plunge.
        You can, but plunging really eats into your time more then just running Zhongli/a Geo Based team if you have one. Especially since Cope isn't exactly the easiest to get fast clears against.
            It takes like 10s to break the shield with sword plunges, nahida can just save more time by adding dmg than saving 7s on the shield breaking with zhongli. It all just depends and geo is obviously favoured with the current abyss blessing 
        Yeah but like... why bother when you can use other more suitable teams lol (the reason why he dropped)
    Yeah, I struggled more the last cycle bc I forgot that thing had a shield and I tried to brute force it with plunge atks 💀 but then I just switched my teams a bit and it was fine. This time I just used the same teams and I did everything on the 1st try.

I never thought of that teamcomp tho but tbh using my haitham spread team was good bc I rarely use him on that team despite the fact I've invested quite a bit on him lmao
Second side is definitely clearable with Alhaitham, did it myself with his Quickbloom team. But it does technically check him in two chambers with both the Jadeplume Terrorshroom having high Dendro Res, and then the Supercomputing Field Generator being favored by Geo Units. 

These meta usage rates are always going to favor who's the most efficient character to use in the Abyss Cycle, not who you can brute force your way through with the proper investment. It's why Ayaka continues to plummet to the bottom.
    Oh yeah, it's clearable with his QB team, I changed it mostly bc I got impatient bc I couldn't break the shield faster so I just changed the teams for one with zhongli in it. I didn't really have problems with the jadeplume tho.

And definitely, supports tend to stay more consistent on this lists but yes, it definitely depends on the enemy line-up (and sometimes the blessing and the character on the banner)
    It is clearable. But the speed isn't comparable with a proper geo team. I used Itto and cleared faster even though my Alhaitham team is more invested.
        Yeah that's how it be when chambers are more geared towards specific types of units. lol

But yeah, Ayaka is probably the unit who has been done most dirty overall. Because it's not even just Freeze, they're making her mono-cryo comp miserable to play too. And if the 4.6 abyss is anything to go by, it's not going to get any better.
    Eh, Dendro had Asimon checking all other teams in ST sides, so now its time for Dendro to get checked.
I don't get why. I just replaced Baizhu with Zhongli in his team and everything went smooth on the 2nd side. First side..well Neuvillette just gave the Abyss a much needed powerwash.
I still run Al-Haitham Hyperbloom for top half of floor 12.

He basically makes the dancing duo really easy.
Haitham spread still have Zhongli as it's BiS sustain but yeah that team is not popular compared to Hyperbloom Haitham
    Kuki is better in that slot. Electro res + instructor + her personal damage + whatever support sword.
        Zhongli literally buffs the whole team unconditionally with his shred and ToTM and Kuki's personal damage is non existent in spread team.
Personally running Quicken with Yae, Fischl and Baizhu second Half. Takes time with plunges sure, but baizhu's healing and protection are actually felt there.
Al haitham has only ever been as high as he is due to people liking the character. everyone runs him with nahida yet I don't think there's a single al haitham team that's better than some nahida driver teams
    ok zajeff
        zajeff is a smart guy
Nah not the k'sante Creepypasta 💀💀
    and why does it perfectly fit 😭
Hydro will never be dethroned as being the strongest element.
    Realistically i think they will make both sides of the Abyss hydro-immune eventually to see what happens
        We might see that shift in 5.x seeing as they probably want to give Pyro the opportunity to shine.
            Buffing pyro will probably end up buffing hydro as well, as Hydro is crucial in one of Pyro’s most important reactions, vape. (Unless they single out not buffing vape) 

Same with Cryo with Freeze. So I can only see Hydro getting stronger as we move forward with the game.
                They could buff vape.

But they could also make an abyss with nothing but hydro heralds, spectres, mimics, slimes, eidolons, tulpa and the cube.

Imagine the only vape DPS they release in 5.x is a main dps so Neuv and Childe don't get benefits AND a mechanic that doesn't work with Furina. Like maybe, idk Bond of Life or something, ya know? /j

Realistically, yes, I do agree, hydro being a core reaction element will just remain the best. XQ had been strong and relevant since forever.
                    If they focused on a vape DPS, that’s only going to make the Hydro supports shine even more. 

The only way to make hydro not broken is to force restrictions against it. Which we already see with Chevreuse (by not including Hydro), Lyney (by making him focus on Mono), and now with Arle (by making BOL anti-synergistic with Furina).

Adding hydro immune enemies is just a direct attack against Hydro.

But anyway, the point is, I agree, Hydro is such a core reaction element that the only way to not make it broken is to not include it (by forcing restrictions against it) in the buffs that the other elements get.
                Not necessarily. Lyney teams and Chevreuse teams can now nearly match the clear speeds of normal vape teams (I'm not saying that they beat Hu Tao and Childe, just that they aren't far behind them).   

We just need to have a little more variety in the type of pyro and cryo units launched to allow for different team styles.   

Also, the addition of good pyro and cryo off fielders will open up new possibilities for team compositions. For example, I tried out a burning team which I had decent success with. It turns out that the best pyro I could use for the job was.... Bennet, whose attack buff doesn't matter much for the team, and his healing is lacking as it caps to 70%. The best pyro applicator in that team was Kazuha.  

If a pyro off fielder existed who could heal/shield (and maybe CC enemies), it would allow me to on field Nahida. This is just an example, on how we're limited by the type of characters we have and that buffing an element by releasing different types of characters will not necessarily buff hydro.
                    > If a pyro off fielder existed who could heal/shield (and maybe CC enemies), it would allow me to on field Nahida

thoma?
                        Thoma and Dehya are sadly not good. It kinda gives the feeling that I'm using Barbara just because a character like Kokomi doesn't exist. I did say that I wanted the addition of good off fielders.
                They could focus on melt (both forward and reverse melt). Incredibly underutilized, and almost always is reliant on Bennet XL currently.
                    Yeah that’s true, they could just focus on Melt, but Freeze is such an important part to Cryo’s identity. They can’t just leave it out to die. One way or the other, Hydro is going to shine once they revisit Freeze.
                        Forward melt can incorporate freeze as that still triggers melts, so I don't think it will be left out entirely (unless we just get Tulpa every abyss). Besides, even in a nation of hydro, cryo units besides Wriothesley are not faring too well so it might be another year of freeze struggles.
                They probably won't be buffing vape but more of the underutilized reactions like melt, overload, burning, and burgeon. 
That means that hydro will only be enhanced in utility for burgeon which, while it buffs hydro, may not buff Neuvillette if it's basically a pyro Alhaitham of burgeon.
            Eww then I need to use Bennett & XL one side (hyperbloom should still work with hydro immunes) and I hate circle impact and even with high ER my XL always falls short. Or maybe the Natlan archon is like Bennett but without a circle.
        Has there ever been an abyss where 2 sides is same element immune?
        Doesn't even have to be immune on both sides. Just highly resistant boss on one side and abyss heralds on the other side would do it.

e.g. Hydro tulpa on one side and Suanni on the other and you'll see hydro dps stocks plummet. But I'm sure they'll just go with Icewind Suite again like every other 4.X abyss.
        The Hydro DPS might be affected but the strongest reaction still needs hydro. Vape, Freeze, and all bloom related reactions still need a hydro applicator. 


People still used Neuvillette against Hydro Tulpa by having a hyperbloom team.
    Pyro Kings when Hydro took the crown.
    Hydro will only ever be dethroned by a cryo or an electro shield abyss, or just a bunch of hydro lectors. I remember 3.8 basically encouraging us to play burgeon. Wild times. It would also kill Neuvillette. Can't move away if you're frozen. 

Now the curious solution is hydro tulpa both sides. Neuvillette can just be moral support against the boss.
    HYDRO SUPREMACY - BEST ELEMENT - STRONGEST UNITS - BEST WAIFUS/HUSBANDOS - STAY HYDRATED HOMIES
    I remember when they said this about pyro in 1.0-2.something
        Tbf a lot was said during 1.0 that was veeeery questionable 😂
Its funny people then skeptical how hydro archon could become better than the already stacked roster. Now she comes with hydro sovereign dragon and still entirely own the meta.
>y wil

neuv and kazuha?
    Yes?
No, I unironically knew it was coming back in 2021. The weakness of Freeze is that majority of enemies just don't get Frozen.

When Venti got countered in Inazuma it was apparent to me that Freeze would follow.
    Not to mention neither of the characters has gotten any good buffs in the form of another character or weapon or artifacts..

The last actual buff for Ayaka teams was Shenhe who was released in 2.4 .. 2 years ago (I don't count Furina since Furina isn't really good in Ayaka Freeze teams)

And Ganyu's last major/minor buff was Nahida for Burnmelt teams..It's actually funny how in 2021 people were talking about the "Liyue Big three" (Xiao , Hu tao and Ganyu) and said that Ganyu was considered better than the other 2 and was said to age better than Xiao and Hu tao... Now with consistent buffs throughout patches , Xiao and Hu tao teams are now at top even rivaling current good dmg dealers teams..
        Ganyu for what it's worth can still compete she doesn't dominate like before but she is still decent. Her biggest issue is being so squishy.
        Nahida wasn't a buff for Ganyu, more like a side grade. Burnmelt is just another option with it's own set of preferable circumstances
    Same. I know it’s confirmation bias but stillllll. Freeze is always and will always gimped unless (normally) the slow debuff is also present with helpful modifiers (like slow being Def reduced or RES shred)
both sides floor12 just hard bodied cryo tbh, that damned coppelia and spider robot
    But how is Wriothesley high?
        Wrio is good against single target which is every second half chamber and none of the enemies are actually cryo resistant like the first half is. All you need is a character that can plunge away the shield in 12-3. I've done both Wrio freeze and burn-melt second half and those are not even his best teams  which is probably the melt team at 15th place as seen above.
        Ayaka has more raw usage number but Wrio has more usage rate.

&#x200B;

also people seems to run him on a reverse melt 15\* rather than the usual freeze.
i really wonder what their ownership would look like if they were released today because cryo has been kinda neglected by hoyo since dendro dropped lmao
    Lower than what we have thats for sure
Man has been carrying cryo since his release, the only exception was in 4.4 when Ayaka got slightly lower usage than him because the entire first side was freeze friendly
Isn't he like the second or third least owned 5* though? That's bound to skew stuff
I'm saving for Wriothesley's rerun, can't wait to get C1+
    good luck on getting his cons! he's c1 right now and I'm planning to get c3 on his rerun. been carrying my skill issue troubles away so he's never left my teams lol
I wanted him but like Yoimiya he was released in an unfortunate time between Neuv and Furina.

So I'm just eagerly waiting for a rerun, unless said rerun is between Arlecchino and Clorinde then... next time.
and Top 25th team is Wriothesley solo
He still has large flaws at c0
    running him in a burn melt team is actually pretty strong at c0 but i'm convinced his usage rate would be way higher if c1 was in his base kit
        Agreed 100%, because otherwise he does feel amazing to play. But that C1 being such a big bonus + his OG banner having poor release timing is a nasty combo.
    Can I ask what are his flaws at c0? I’m planning to pull for him next time around. Probably gonna get him c1r1 (or over c1)
Look at the actual usage, 3000 which is quite low compared to others around him. It's just his ownership rate which is skewing the data, like chiori and some characters. Compare that to jean who has 8k usage but is much lower
I got him c6 and now I’ve removed all the challenge from combat
I'm that guy. Skipped him after getting Neuv to guarantee Furina. Now I'm not sure I have a slot for Wrio to use with all the dpses that came in Fontaine.
First half and 3rd half have 70% cryo res on first side, second side needs geo
    oh yeah omg i didn't think about that🤣 thank you! just thought that I may be "out-seasoned" already (for context I just came back from months of hiatus😊)
        They have been trying insanely hard to hard counter ayaka since 3.0. but because of that anemo DPS and cryo DPS have to go through 70 and 90% res almost every abyss
>so she does not work well with Navia or Noelle.

She's technically an upgrade over Zhongli/Albedo at C0 still, but not actually enough of one to warrant pulling her.
I was hoping to get Arlecchino and her weapon, but I figured I would’ve been short one five star to guarantee it so I got Chiori’s C1 instead. I have her talents at 9/9/9 and she has some mediocre artifacts, but she helps generate so many shards for Navia and I used her to 36 star the abyss. I thought I might’ve regret getting her C1, but I love how OP Navia feels with her.
Yeah the wriothesley solo ones are crazy. I cleared it too but had to use wriothesley freeze
idk if it's going to provee anything but I also noticed many c6 havers in r/ChioriMains
    There's a lot of C6 havers on every character mains subreddit.
I have Chiori C4 and she adds a lot of dmg.
Navia isn’t great for Chiori, but Chiori is great for Navia. Even at C0 she’s Navia’s most reliable source of Crystallize shards as well as energy, and her burst damage also benefits a good amount from Bennett who is a common Navia teammate. The only real reason to not run her with Navia is if you want Zhongli’s survivability instead.
    I did some calculations for the most used Navia team: Navia Zhongli Xiangling Bennett. If I swap Zhongli for C0 Chiori, it is actually a downgrade. One-doll Chiori does more damage than Zhongli, but Zhongli version will do more team damage. The better Navia and Xiangling are built, the difference is also bigger.
        What’s the breakdown for the calculations? I’m curious. I can’t imagine that realistically Navia will have the same amount of shards in both teams especially if Zhongli’s pillar isn’t hitting.
        Without the pillar, Zhongli does not proc tenacity or generate energy. The calcs that have Zhongli at just 5% below Chiori have both with fav. Without those he falls down a bit more below both Chiori and Albedo. Where are the calcs that say she is worse to begin with anyway? TGS, KQM’s Jaime, Jstern, etc. are all the other way using KQM standards.
isn't wriothesley the same story? He is somewhat clunky without his c1, so most people who pulled him went for c1 too. Not to mention his banner was between Neuvillette and Furina so he was also skipped a lot. The first cryo catalyst aspect might have carried him a bit, but what's his own rate? I remember he was the lowest before Chiori.
not​ welcome  when​ more​ than​ navia? in​ term  of​ %use?
When​ zl​ who​ is​ most​ usage​ rate​ already​ have​ pillar
i​ dont​ think​ that​ the​ problem
    I think I should say, "That is one of the reasons why fewer players pull her."
> Chiori C0 can have only one doll without geo construct, so she does not work well with Navia or Noelle

Funnily enough Geo options are so bad, that she is still the best option for Navia even with just one doll.

As for C6, many whales argue that she's has basically one of if not straight up the strongest non-archon C6 in the game. Which is kinda sad considering she is one of the weakest limited 5\*s at C0.
    She’s actually one of the strongest subdps in the game at c0 in personal damage.

She just severely lacks utility compared to other subdps.
Of all the people that own her, only 58% used her this Abyss. And considering that she's a new character, that's very low, unless there's people still building her.
    Some still building her, some don't even play abyss.  Especially this is geo we are talking about, so many owners are casual players who just pull for characters they like
    Most people don't pull for abyss.


Only the Furina and Nahida have ever had usage rates similar to their ownership rates.


For example Raiden has 79% ownership and sits around 50% usage on a good day.
        I do wonder why people care about meta so much if they don't pull for abyss. Bc the meta characters are always the more desirable units, but barely anyone does abyss
What??
> but Chiori C0 can have only one doll without geo construct, so she does not work well with Navia or Noelle.

i hate this clown narritive too much

like nothing really stops you using zl or albedo with them and even a 1 doll chiori is enough to make her look good in the team

my naviori team is legit the only team i got that can 0 cycle the whale and they make it braindead free to get
    Man, i was using my c0 Chiori with Mistsplitter and Ningguang in abyss, plus Furina and Shinobu full EM, and Chiori was on field most of the time with infusion. My Ning was using Dodoco and Furina is C0 with Festering, nothing amazing. Plus i suck with rotations. 

The fact that she brought up my Ningguang to Abyss for a 36 is fact alone that she works well.

One doll works pretty well anyway, if your dps is good, since hwr infusion is really not good. 

People just love to bash on anything if it's not the "best scenario". Navia benefits a lot from her. Or from zhong. Or from Candace. Or amber. Navia just works with anything, why optimize someone who is so strong 😂

Noelle I'm not so sure, though, because i don't use her.
    2 geo, 2 pyro is better because of pyro synergy. Not to mention if you go for Xiangling then you have to get Bennett too or the energy would be terrible.
The second they release a decent pyro offielder instead of pyro on-fielder #2715252
in *Snezhnaya* probably
Wrio must be tired of carrying cryo on his back, man needs some company
Let Tsaritsa cook
Ayaka will return in Avengers: Snezhnaya.  Trust.

(Srsly  I hope they boost cryo somehow in 6.0, its suffering even more than Geo lately)
It's interesting to me cause Kokomi was always designed as an onfield driver, but since her jellyfish worked so well with Ayaka people got used to thinking of her as an E bot.

That mentality stuck around even after she got Clam to make her onfield DPS/healer/driver stronger. Hyperbloom and burgeon also worked nicely with her as onfield driver, but she was still seen as kind of a niche choice for onfield.

It took Nilou being broken and having perfect synergy with Kokomi for that mentality to change. I'm really happy she has that mono hydro team now. It's my strongest team by far, and it's sooooooo ridiculously easy and comfy to play. No one in that team is ever at low health 😂
Koko was always designed as a DPS healer like Noelle, just freeze was popular at the time and there isn't any good off field hydro char that also doubles as defensive/healer. 

Furina is honestly what enabled Koko the most, the two perfect match each other and you can very comfortable clear everything with just two of them alone.
It helps that the abyss blessing it worth a damn this time.
    People read those? 🤔
The second half of this abyss really pushes you to use Geo(or overload perhaps) + blessing benefiting geo damage
    Indeed but even in the previous abyss, she was already pretty high usage despite thr drop between 4.3 and 4.4 since people want to play with their shiny new toy. 

Navia just keeps winning though. Xianyun? A Navia buff. Chiori?   A Navia buff. Navia is just super flexible and not even energy reliant. She is a geo Alhaitham if geo Alhaitham exists (not Chiori).
        She was in B tier in previous abyss though, but that abyss wasnt that good for her anyways

Unless you mean previous usage rate but thats still the same abyss as the current one
    I'm confused, how exactly does it push to use Geo? I didn't use Geo, pyro or electro at all and didn't feel like I'm going against the flow.
        Breaking the boss's shield in third chamber second half, you can break it will plunge attacks but its comparatively much slower. The shield is easy asf if you have geo characters in your team
            Ah, makes sense.. I just pushed through with Xiao and didn't even consider that I needed something else XD
                Navia is also a claymore character, meaning even her physical Attacks deal blunt dmg (the thing you need against the shield)
                    Well, yeah.. The question wasn't about navia tho, just about Geo in general
This is why afk teams are king
Alhaitham quickbloom with Furina was NOT fun against Coppelia on a potato phone... but I did it somehow
    Which half?
Neuvi, Kazuha, Furina, Charlotte
She's a good Healer Option for Furina Teams
navia albedo furina charlotte
Ayaka/Furina/Kazuha. And in that team, you don't slot Jean because Ayaka needs Kazuha grouping.

Healer, cryo res and cryo battery, NO/TTDS holder, easy to build, not so bad for a 4* unit !
Yeah with Kazuha having vv Jean is just a waste on Neuvi Furina team Charlotte is better. She is a bit annoying when she randomly puts you into photography mode but otherwise she is fine and her healing definitely made the abyss way easier.
isnt 2nd side perfect for him? the dendro shroom has high dendro res but thats about it
    I don't have zhongli on same acc with jackal boi, neither I wanna run them together, plus playing on mobile so it's difficult to break geo shield faster

Besides I have many more suitable teams for that
* Chevreuse Beidou Klee Lisa, some energy issues but good damage. Use 3 fav's if worse comes to worst. Will clear second side well, but I think it'll have to go first side. 

* Ganyu Layla Rosaria Sucrose for 2nd side since Coppelia on 1st side.

Low tier here doesn't mean units are bad or anything, just  that they are unpopular among this group.
    There's a melt [Amber player](https://youtu.be/dVyHnGfV_yg?si=5ht4ugt0FEd95V_Y) that runs Amber, Sucrose, Diona, Rosaria. Ganyu in Rosaria's place works too.

An overload team with Chev, Lisa, Dori/Beidou, Diluc/Klee should work fine.  
I personally ran Chev, Lisa, Fischl, Yoimiya for boss halves in past abysses.

Dori hyperbloom probably works. Dori, Collei, Barbara/Candace, Flex.

A bunch of mono-geo core units are in C tier. Just put Noelle where Itto normally goes, and you get Noelle, Gorou, Yunjin, Geo-Traveler/Ninguang.

Lisa/Keqing aggravate is another option. Lisa, Sucrose, Yaoyao/Collei, Dori or Keqing, Sucrose, Yaoyao/Kirara, Collei/Beidou.
    i wasnt thinking of this spiral abyss specificaly, just spiral abyss in general
        The same holds true in any abyss. Usage rate generally has very little correlation to character viability or performance.
You can make a decent Morgana team with the lowest tier ones frankly.
    Never tried her outside of story quest

Heizou is cool but not sure what would work

i guess Heizou could swirl Monas hydro, and maybe pull in enemies with burst and Kaeya or someone to freeze
Dehya melt
honestly!! for childe back packing yea it is. ive also been using a core of childe/zl/kazoo since 1.6 so slotting neuvi in was super easy . i have a very hyperinvested childe so i want to use him always

my neuvi is c1r1 so  his damage is already so good. it feels like using furina with him feels almost wasteful. like stealing candy from a baby 😭 i could use her in another team that does struggle more than him
    I got Furina to C3 just for him since aside from Kazuha he doesn't really have any buffers being an HP scaler. Now I usually run her on the other side since he doesn't really need her 😅
He sits comfortably on S on 60+ if no geo advantage in abyss
Teams with limited team options tend to rank high due to minimal alternatives to their team. The team is often not actually played that much. Just has no variety so the one team ranks higher. 


 For example. That team is literally Tighnari's only appearance in top 50. Navia who has the team right below it appears 9 times.


 Another example is international. It looks like it's being used often because it only has 1 variation. However if you check Tartaglia's team usage he's actually used more as a Wrioth and Neuv slave. There is just a bunch of different variations of these teams.
He's actually pretty great in ST chmabers.
I run it, its one of the smoothest teams you'll ever play. 12 second rotations, amazing ST damage (which is all the rage these days), can hit the janky bosses that run and hide super easily.
It's a good single target team with zhongli. It can deal with annoying enemies like works just as easily. Your every attack is guaranteed to land.
Because as a standard character a lot of people own him and people who have been playing for long enough don't even need to farm for him as they probably already have a decent enough 4pc Wanderers Troupe set to slap on him. Adding to that, both Zhongli and Nahida are two of the most owned characters and Yae is also quite popular.

So tldr he dishes out awesome dmg without much investment as most people already have the units required for his team.
    Havent checked but his cons are good too right? 

Also, for those successfully pulled on the Chronicle banner, Tighnari mains who werent able to get his sig weapon are now able to use him with Hunter’s Path
        Yes, he definitely has amazing cons for a standard character.
        Nah the cons are pretty weak till c6, c1 looks ok but its a pretty small buff.
This sounds like a massive skill issue.


At 50k hp your shield should have nearly 60k hp vs cryo.


That's 2 Zhongli shields.
Maybe you got sucked into that tornado thingy they releases. My Layla have 30k Hp and she still can tank 2 or 3 Cryo hit until I got sucked into that thing and it started to break.
    My Kokomi got sucked into that sht and i couldn't get out no matter what, and just had to watch everyone die.

I don't think it's supposed to work like this?!

I jump, run, walk, anything, and got stuck there.

I never got there before because i avoid it easily, but this time i used burst near her and during the animation she threw me exactly to the tornado...
Her whirlwinds are Anemo. The guy does the cryo damage.
I still don’t really know the right way to defeat them. That boss always takes me the longest to kill I think I’m doing something wrong lol
    I really don't think there's a strategy to beating them unlike the Wenut or the Wolflord. Coppelia doesn't have a weakness phase (i think) so it's literally just go through your rotation and just dodge their attacks (especially the ice slashes. Those hurt 🤕) or time your bursts for invulnerability during the animation. If you can't beat it, it's either your team doesn't pass the DPS check or you need to work on your dodging.
You might not be paying atention to her shield's duration.
    Also true, and with Wanderer it's not easy at all.
What scary is Xiao's team still no 6 highest usage and like 65:35 of used sides. Means that team mostly used on chamber with both Fatui Operatives and Copellia with their 70% anemo resist, i can see this team become #2 after Neuvi team if such enemies doesn't exists. This legit an extremely powerful team
    The Furina, Faruzan and Xianyun core is so strong that I can easily clear first half with plunge Lynette (it's a really fun team).
    That team will never be #2 because it takes Furina. The only way for it to rise is to reduce neuv's usage.
    I was lucky enough to get C2 Xianyun and with C6 Faruzan I could legitimately brute force Wenut with my Xiao team. His new best teams are scary good.
ST is now spread out.

Look at Yoimiya. Tighnari has slowly been creeping upwards and upwards because his team is honestly just easier to use with Yae countering worms, infinite CA range and actual AoE. 

Not to mention Navia, Wanderer, Hyperbloom and AoE teams that also deal high ST. And Hutao herself hogging premium supports. 

Hutao used to have a niche all on her own. There's a lot of competition now.
    His usage rate has actually stayed the same or decreased over time. Team usage rate is misleading. Characters with 1 team will have that 1 team place high.
        It did drop from early Sumeru but he's been hovering around the same spot for a while, but he's generally in a better spot than the drop atleast past 4.0. He used to be only be seen when he actually counters the floor and has recently maintained a steady appearance rate. 

It does makes sense he drops a bit given a recent double worm in abyss. And tbf, this team is his best team without much sidegrades to it bar Baizhu. The previous one had three of his teams, even forcing a Raiden variant specifically to handle the worms. 

But nontheless, ever since Sumeru, a lot of single target teams have been around and Hutao's usage spike is stabilizing a bit towards the center.
Ownership rate is weird. People bring it up when units that are controversial do well, but keep their lips tight when character's like Alhaitham were basically carried by being one of the single least owned dps for a year.


Not the case after the Fontaine cast since they all have low ownership besides Furina. 
    Neuvillette was one of the highest sale banner in all china before furina. His ownership is not low.
Geos being the mandatory flex just to breat the final boss shield because the plunge mechanic sometimes doesn't work.
Dw cryo archon tsaritsa gonna make an heavy drip marketing 😬
In this cryo cursed abyss no less.
    but look at wriothesley….
In that sample, 84.7% of players have Zhongli...
    then how does zhongli have a 89% usage rate?
        Out of those 84.7% of people who have Zhongli, 89%  are using him.  

That's certainly impressive.
            Ah, I see
My theory is, if you main a character for months, or years, it's because you like the way that character plays.

It's hard to convince someone to play their main a different way than what convinced you to main them in the first place.
    That could very well be the case.
Because xianyun with xiao or because not all people pull her or because furina with the other team (neuvillette and co)
Because most people who pulled for Xianyun likely also have Xiao so if they’re going to use her with anyone it’s him.
Last boss geo shield incentivizes using Zhongli instead, Furina is used in many other teams, CN usually vertically invest in characters more than us; as an example, 50% of the Hu Taos on [akashadata.com](http://akashadata.com) are C1+ and 78.1% of them have Homa, so if you have C1 you probably won't use the Xianyun team, I believe they also value comfort more thus Zhongli.
2nd best
Zhongli is just so comfy
I see a lot of bias towards comfy teams in usage rates lists regardless of whether there's more stronger teams
    the CN meta tends to favor comfort over speed running. Easier execution is more reliable, and if you're going to get your 600 primos anyway, you don't get bonus primos for lower times. Retrying if you mess up or get bad RNG sucks. I like it when my record says Battles Fought: 12.

that said, this is the first time I have used ZL in a very long time.
    Yeah but not even top 36? It's still a basicly unkillable team with what feels like twice the damage.
        I mean you got ask too, which character did the majority of people pull Xianyun for to use?

Western TCs definitely sung the praises of Xianyun's synergy with Furina opening the door for a lot of new team comps, which is true, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say most Xianyun pullers who are 36 starring ended up pulling her for Xiao teams.
            I pulled her for Navia amd skipped Xiao. Even my kind exists lmao.
I used it on 4.4 abyss, and its really nice to have another playstyle for a character I've had since patch 1.3.
For the same reason why Diluc plunge is also absent. Cuz people just prefer to use Xianyun with Xiao.
she can plunge for free against the 12-3 boss.

I didn't use XY because I didn't use Furina on her team. Without Furina, the incentive to use XY falls off. I went back to ZL + sucrose + XQ. This was my old team before Yelan released.
Form is Temporary, Zhongli is Eternal
Yeah. Like XQ in place of Yelan is still stronger than classic Double Hydro with ZL. The XQ variant literally is just as comfy because you have enough interrupt resistance for almost everything and an HT with her bigger HP pool + XQ dmg reduction + Xianyun healing is near unkillable.
I also always use her in abyss, but I don't put my data in, feels like too much work.
Post flair
If he is C0, you will have a shield and Neuvi wont fall so easily while on charged attack
You can use kazuha with baizhu, higher ceiling. Baizhu gives some interruption resistance too
How long is a while? Because she’s been out of the meta for a very long time.
Do you have Layla/Kirara and Fishl? You can use those and Sucrose in his team. Or Beidou with dendro mc/collei + Sucrose. You'll need favounius on anyone in your team or sacrificial on Beidou to comfortably battery her so her personal dps won't be much but at least her burst works with Neuvi's charge attacks.
    I dont have Layla, Kirara and Fischl but i do have beidou and sucrose. I also have a wolf's gravestone. I'll make sure to try beidou dendromc and sucrose with neuvillette.
        Nice. Give a favonius weapon to either mc or Sucrose if you have one to help battery Beidou's burst. You need to build some crit on that character then tho, to proc the weapon's passive. Also prototype amber on Neuvi. It's his best f2p weapon, it's craftable, and will help a bit with survivability and charging Neuvi's burst.
            TYSM, im saving for Zhongli and i already have like 60 pulls.
                Great, he's a fantastic comfort character. He'll work great with Neuvillette as well
What do you expect? They're 4 stars and are launch characters, even if they're usable in abyss they won't be popular in usage rate lists. Cryo and Phys aren't at a good place currently either. Doesn't mean you can't use them if you like them and build them well enough. As a new player it's better to focus on more meta 4 stars if you care about spiral abyss tho, like dendro mc, Kuki, Xingqiu, Xiangling and Bennett. You can build your faves after you have more reliable teams for clearing abyss. Unless you don't care, then just build your favourites. Everything works in overworld and if anything gives you trouble you can always ask for help in coop.
    Honestly, I might as well just give up on spiral abyss then.. If I need to play meta and minmax the fun out of the equation, I'm better off not doing that. Most Meta characters I simply don't have, or don't like the playstyle of. Just spent all my luck getting Klee, and apparently she's a B tier or sth.. Can't give a shit. Every character I play is low tier somehow
        You neither need to play meta nor min max, you just need to be able to make reasonable teams and get everyone to a passable level when it comes to builds. Even launch players don't have min maxed teams with that artifact rng lol. If you want to give up, your choice, but it's quite a sum of primos to give up on. Also this tier list just shows usage rates, characters being lower doesn't mean they aren't good nor that they can't pass abyss.

Also you don't need to pass abyss 12 right away. If you can pass 11 it's already good enough for a newish player. I do abyss on my sister's 3 months old account and can consistently pass up to floor 11 with full stars and can finish 12 even (did that just for the achievement and the namecard for the sis) although just with 3 stars for now. I did recommend some characters to her but otherwise told her to get and build whoever the hell she wants, cause it's more important she has characters she likes, and leave worring about how to pass abyss to me. Her artifacts are horrendous btw. Abyss is more a team building check and knowledge about mechanics check than anything else. The so called meta characters just make some things easier. If you want, you can list what characters you have, maybe I can recommend some comps out of what you have. You can also visit mains subreddits of your favourites and check there.
There is no explaining, that what makes it so good. No ER requirements, impossible to die, simple rotations, no worry about elemental auras, crazy high damage, its the definition if random bullshit go, the team.

It also works with XQ if you wanna leave Kazuha open, and its still enough to one cycle abyss f12 bosses [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/s/4UncEqIMQ1)
FuriKok Mono Hydro.

Kokomi on-field driver for Yelan and heals for Furina. Kazuha for res shred and buffing Hydro. Furina for Furina.
This is usage rate, which takes the percentage of people who owned a character and actually used them this abyss. If you look at the last picture on the post, you’ll see that of the 27390 people who own Baizhu, 17559 people used him. 17559/27390 \* 100 = 64.1%. If you look at Nahida’s statistics, of the 92,958 people who own her, the highest of all limited 5-star units, 53292 people used. 53292/92958 \* 100 = 57.3%. 

So despite being used more than twice as many successful 36-star runs as Baizhu, Nahida has a lower usage rate because she’s the most owned limited 5-star unit in the game. You’ll see a similar thing with Chiori who has a higher usage rate than Navia simply because almost 3x as many people own Navia compared to Chiori, and no one would say Chiori is better than Navia. So to answer your question, no, these statistics don’t mean that Baizhu is better than Nahida, just that Baizhu’s significantly lower ownership compared to Nahida gives a better usage statistic.
usage rate is based on ownership rate. more people own gorou because he's a 4 star.

most itto users are using gorou, but most gorou havers don't even have itto, tanking his usage rate.
    Then what's the point of usage rate
        it's really just to show which 5 stars (and popular 4 stars) are useful for the current abyss lineup, and to show the current trends; which characters are popular with the people who own them.

but people often misinterpret it as evidence to how strong characters are.

that said, the fact that a character like xiangling manages to be 52% despite 100% of players owning her is rather impressive. it literally means that 52% of players use xiangling in the abyss (though it should be noted that this is just people who submitted their data, not all players across all servers. still impressive though)

anyway, you can see the ownership rate in the last image, second to rightmost number. chiori for example, despite having a high usage rate, only has around a 12% ownership rate. only around 12% of players who submitted their data own chiori. but, the people who pulled for her are most likely going to use her, especially since geo is good this abyss. so, she gets a high usage rate.
First page is calculated based on usage divided by ownership. Many more people own Gorou than they do Itto.
    That makes sense
What’s there to be sad about? Think you need to just be realistic of his power levels in this game.
I mean im not saying usage rate  is an evidence but xiao got literally buff by furina and xianyun since then ,everyone are aware that hes a beast
LEGENDS NEVEER DIEEEEEEE starts playing
That line went so hard though. 


"i have seen the ride and fall of many teams, but the player who stood at the end was always me."
    That line goes well with Zhongli as well. He has seen so many meta going up and down (vape meta, dendro meta, now hypercarry meta and such) but in the end only him that can comfortably fits to all of those. He is trully the Dad of this game.
No way a league ref?!
    Ngl I think there’s a big overlap in the communities
        Oh for sure. BeryL (DRX’s support) designed an Ashe skin to resemble [Elysia](https://www.oneesports.gg/league-of-legends/elysia-drx-worlds-2022-ashe/) from honkai impact 3rd after winning worlds. Obvi not genshin but same idea of player base crossover.
Zhongli's inner Thanos is showing..
"Where did that bring you? Back to me."
Actually that machine has 210% all resistance when it has shield (10% without shield). It is still doable without breaking it as long as you can do equivalent of 20M damage. Not recommended except C6 whale showcase, of course.
    Doable is a very strong word in that context lol.
        [It's possible](https://youtu.be/2XO0Mgty5e0?si=zFfVElzKG8fS2o0-)
            What manner of sea creature is this?

I swear high constellation Genshin is practically another game.
            why are people always spamming the menu
                To pick up particles, I'm pretty sure. It pauses the timer but those still move. If not that, then I dunno.
                    My favorite was this one video of an abyss speedrunner who was menu'ing after every action to collect particles, the actual video was like 3 minutes long or something but in-game it was like 15 seconds or something 💀
                        it might have been against maguu kenki, you can skip his stalling invulnerable phase by constantly booking/opening the map every millisecond
                        You mean something like this https://youtu.be/cxnvuTNyy3c?si=irH_l84ZGS9ZygLy ?
                            LOL yeah that was the video I was thinking of

            Hi, I'm Old and Dumb, so could someone please explain something to me:

* C6R5 characters are, according to Google, 1-1.2k$ on average, they have both Furina and Yelan C6R5
* Xianyun is C2R5, so I assume 600-700$ at least?

So that's what, 2.5-3k usd on average, which is fine, I'm not here to police what people spend their money on, and it's not like it's that absurd of a sum all things considered (depending on where you live in the world).

However, my question is this: why, in the name of all holy fucks in the world, would they then be playing the game on a phone??????????????
            Did I....do this by accident?

I technically had Zhongli so probably not I suppose.

Definitely just used Hu Tao / Zhongli / Xingqiu / Yelan though and just smashed Hu Tao vape plunge attacks into it until it died.
    Went in blind and Overload did it for me
    I jut used raiden national as always. 

Simply have Raiden jump a couple of times before doing your usual rotation. 

Repeat once more if you can't one-cycle it (I can't) and that's it 

Just breaking the shield twice with a couple of quick plunges takes like no time at all. 

It buffs jumping height of all charactersnear, so everyone can just plunge attack by simply jumping straight from standing on the ground without any special setup
I tried to do Itto first half and Navia second half but the shield guys were pissing me off so I had to go Neuvillette oonga boonga for that one (as much as I'd rather use my boy Arataki instead of the usual strong meta characters like Neuvi)
    pro tip : use crystallize shield instead, the enemies won't get their buff if your shield breaks when they attack you.
That's how I managed to do Itto first half and Navia second half.
        > he enemies won't get their buff if your shield breaks when they attack you

Instruction unclear. Itto's crystalize shield is way too beefy, it takes at least 4 simultaneous hits to break through it(Redhorn to good)


Altho truthfully, I'm careful with my crystalize placement.  I don't apply any elements when they spawn and just geo smack them.  I also know which attack is the shield steal so I can avoid it if I do still have a crystalize shield active.
            What does redhorn have to do with crystalize
                Defense reduces damage taken which also applies to shields. A Noelle using Layla’s shield for example can tank more hits with it compared to a different chara
                    Ohhh yeah true
         It is possible that even if you do not use a shield on your team that the Husks' buff is activated because of the rumbling stone aura that causes Geo damage independently of Geo Husk (which in base form only causes physical damage), I I realized that Husk was in enhanced form even though my team lacks geo and shield (Furina, Neuvillette, Kazuha and Kuki).
I just brute forced the machine with Raiden National. Didn't know it had a geo mechanism. It didn't take that long to kill.
    Is not a geo mechanic, you need to hit it with blunt damage to break the shield. And since the shield is a geo shield it takes extra damage from geo sources, you can take someone like Zhongli whose hold skill deletes more than half the shield and burst the other half.

Well if you are not breaking the shield you required around 19 million equivalent damage to brute force through it resistances, so either you are a major whale or you are indeed breaking the shield, that or you are talking about another machine.
        I just break the shield with normal attacks
            You are breaking it with overload.
TCs and CCs can't calculate practical improvements of which Zhongli can provide. TCs assume perfect rotations when calculating dps of a team or character, but it ain't all true since everyone can fumble and there is a lot of RNG involved in order of enemy attacks. Zhongli is king of consistency.
    Not everyone can play like a TAS Speedrun, and you don’t really need to be faster than 3.00 minutes, so comfortable play is better than -5 sec.
I feel like this is kind misleading. The teams ZL is used in are teams where he is a dps increase. 


It's not ZL being used in a bunch of teams for his defensive utility. It's ZL being used in teams where he increases the dps on top of his defensive utility. 


People aren't plugging him into random teams for defensive utility. They are playing the teams that value him offensively and defensively. 


 If you ignore the teams using him to break the shield in 12-3 almost all of his usage comes from the 4 most popular dps atm. 
    Genuine question: what are the teams where he is considered a DPS increase? Because everytime I see someone even suggesting running him in any given team causes people to go wild claiming you'd be better off replacing him with someone else.
        He's very good in Tighnari teams, since swirl does nothing for Tighnari (>50% of the team dps) and only increases your electro unit's aggravate damage.
        Neuvilette furin Kazuha zhongli is neuvillettes highest dps team at any investment level
            That team SHREDS. Zhongli shield bot + Petra = chef kiss
        To expand on why Zhongli makes it into Neuvillette's best double hydro team even at C1+, it is because of 4pc archaic petra on top of the universal shred.
        Navia
    Except a while ago people would constantly push replacing him with another character even in teams where he isn't that big a DPS loss. For instance people pushed Funernational replacing ZL with Xiangling in double hydro Hutao claiming a DPS increase, but teams like that never receive widespread adoption because it only takes a single reset to have lost any time saved by increasing DPS by a few thousand replacing him.
        Teams like that aren't popular because they took your XL from your aoe. At the time you had Ayaka, international and Raiden as aoe dps.


It's very clear why it wasn't popular.
        Depends on your level of investment. All the popular Hu Tao teams now don't use Zhongli for a reason - Furina requires a complementary healer and the extra damage through those two units is greater than the utility provided by Zhongli + Xingqiu.
            Thats not true hutao popular team is still with zhongli,its not with furina since she is generally on the other side and that she still has enormous damage without her
No sane person would call Zhongli a DPS loss, dude earns his place with res shred alone. His ultimate specifically however is indeed a DPS loss, its damage is not worth the animation time, it's a relic from his original kit days when Hoyo wanted him to be a shitty DPS for some reason.
    his ult kit is gated behind a lot of constellations and talent level scaling, simple screenwide 90k+ crit unbuffed at max while re-applying shield
    His ult Seems to be useful against geo shield
        It can be, but in those cases it's not really a "DPS" option, it's just a shield shred option. Those cases are generally VERY rare.

You basically never build Zhongli for his own personal damage.

At the end of the day the actual damage output of his burst compared to the time the animation takes to cast is just bad. The only situation where you see people using his burst is usually if that person has C2, in which case it's NOT a huge DPS loss as you can easily use the instant swap/burst and you refresh his shield without ever having to hold his skill instead.
>Zhongli is constantly being bashed upon for being "a DPS loss"

cause those people are playing spreadsheet impact
In this Abyss, he is not a dps loss because he does immense damage to geo shields. He is also used to stack resist shred against super high resistance enemies.  If you want to fight Coppelia with Wanderer for example you will need both Faruzan and Zhongli resist shred.
Zhongli is a DPS loss to actually use him offensively. Unless you have his C2 you effectively never use his burst because it's just a waste of time. All you do is pop him on field and hold E for his shield and swap off him.

His entire purpose is basically just for a shield with resistance shred and maybe more buff depending on his artifacts.

Shield in general though are generally a "DPS loss" compared to alternatives, and are mostly used for ease of play. In most cases if you just avoid enemy attacks you're better off using a more offensive off fielder for higher DPS. Zhongli can somewhat get around this due to how strong his shield is and the duration, requiring less frequent field time to refresh it, on top of providing offensive buffs with the resistance shred. The resistance shred in particular gets MUCH stronger when you're running a team that deals multiple types of damage as this means he's providing a 20% resistance shred buff to each type of damage, more overall value.

At the end of the day the peak of player character DPS FAR outscales the DPS requirements to beat floor 12. If you're able to run the top usage teams your DPS output generally far exceeds the "challenge" of the chambers. There is essentially no reason you actually need to run 100% optimized DPS teams when you can instead clear much more easily with more comfortable teams that are easier to play. Running the top played Hu Tao team with Xiangling instead of Zhongli is objectively a pretty huge DPS increase, but you have to avoid enemies constantly making sure you don't die, often while at very low hp on Hu Tao. Instead though you can just run Zhongli and basically play with your brain turned off just spamming CA on Hu Tao never needing to dodge at all, and you still clear anyway. Likewise you COULD run the Neuvillette team with Nahida instead and it'd likely be quite a bit more overall DPS; Baizhu really provides basically zero value to the team's reactions and is just a shielder / healer that can easily add a hydro reaction stack to Neuvillette's A4. Nahida on Prototype Amber (particularly if you run Proto Amber on Neuvillette too) would be "better" but far less comfortable to play, and at the end of the day that's usually what it comes down to in the end.

You'll notice that the top teams are NOT what you'll see people run if they're mega whales that are trying to speed run Abyss. In those cases, where you're trying to get every spec of DPS, people run other teams.
Sure, he is a dps loss, but you know what is an even bigger dps loss? Having to do fight mechanics.

As the old saying goes: " Stand in fire, dps higher". Zhongli lets you stand in the proverbial fire all day long.
its because people are very bad and don't dodge, hope that helps. very easy abyss lol
It's because people suffer from Anti-Geo brainrot.
As long as one of the four swirlable elements is meta, so will he be meta.

Honestly Furina probably is more significant in affecting his usage than Dendro - there's an appreciable niche for Xianyun/Jean consolidating VV and healer categories, at least until we get more teamwide healers that also provide other utility. 

Chevy is also an attempt at making him less mandatory, as you now have hypercarry setups for Pyro and Electro excluding him.
    C2 Kazuha also buffs pretty much any dendro comp that has a flex slot, so a lot of people have him there
>They tried to bring Kazuha down with the dendro meta

Dendro Meta brought us Aggravate, which benefits from Kazuha
He can trigger aggravates, hyperblooms, and burgeons. Anemo units in general can trigger other reactions due to swirls inflicting the absorbed element (partly why Sucrose is a good driver), so he won't be dropped unless they introduce an enemy that cannot be swirled or repels Anemo damage hard.
    don't forget that in quickbloom he can cluster bomb by grabbing the seeds
True,He is the best choice for all fontaine dps except Navia
and Arlecchino is coming lol
I mean, whenever something counters dendro, it can be fucked by another meta team, and Kazuha makes wonders in that scenario.
He did go down a bit during Dendro saga. Nahida was dominating with usage rates no one ever saw. Others such as Zhongli/Yelan/Raiden/Kazuha usually keep having turns in who would be at the top with rest, but Zhongli and Kazuha usually do make it on more number
Kazuha is the single most broken dendro flex pick if you already have one electro and one dendro outside of maybe xingqiu
Zhongli drops off for me whenever the Wenut/Ruin Serpent shows up or tag team consecrated beast floors (basically the whole of 3.x Abyss floors).

Its not that he's bad, is just that I need his slot to time the floor, a shield is helpful but I argue that learning how to dodge or healing through the damage is much more advisable.
    Last patch has wenut and ruin serpent both and he still like high S (68% or something). I think with Navia around he also have a premier frontload DPS so he even got more options nowadays to deal with short windows enemies
        Also a mainstay in Tighnari-Yae spread because he plays the 12s rotations well. That team is a silver bullet for the Wenut.
    I think most people don't realize that not everyone aim for 36 stars. Some people just like to be able to clear abyss and have fun and Zhongli allows them to comfortably clear it even though in some cases he can be dps lost and can't get you 36* but you can surely clear chambers and for some clearing it is already an achievement. This is also one of the reasons he is mostly used.
        This data is full star clears only though so it's exclusively people who used Zhongli *and* got 36 stars.
    >Zhongli drops off for me whenever the Wenut/Ruin Serpent shows up or tag team consecrated beast floors

???

>learning how to dodge or healing through the damage is much more advisable.

The reality in genshin is that you CANNOT dodge everything. His shield is FAR superior to dodging and healing. And whatever loss your team gets by bringing him in is almost always so insignificant you most likely end up with better dps by never getting interrupted or be forced to play safe.
Dendro is fine for Kazu, mono geo and Nilou bloom are the only two comps where he's not useful.
All the attacks on the second side are very dodgeable and wrios charged attacks can get through the geo shield, just bring a really fast first side and the second side with solo wrio is free
These are all C6 Wriothesley.
    There was one c1r1 Wriothesley main solo on 2nd half. Idk how they do that but they did
        I think it was u/wriotheslycumdumpster
            I couldve lived without knowing about his existence, btw
            Hey its me! HAHAHA
                I'm wish i could get on your lvl one day... Abyss skill, I mean. Not the username lol
            That username definitely rings the bell lmao
    Is that a fact or just your own assumption? Because you only needs C1 to be able to solo shit and that’s what I’ve been doing ever since he’s out
It is not a joke. You can refer to The Genshin Scientist's guide to reading abyss usage rates on YouTube. In brief, there are not many Wriothesley owners and even less users. So the whales get to be a bigger percentage of Wriothesley users and whales who do solo Wriothesley runs can appear higher in percentage than normal.
Kazuha will prioritise sucking Pyro from anywhere in the field, from enemy shields/torches, or even yourself if your on fire

That means random Burgeon explosion nukes
    It's all right though since his built with em. Thats a nice burgeon dmg. 

On side note. Im using him for aggravate and that pyro infusion sucks. Fuck that second chamber.
    bum bum bakudan at home
    > Burgeon explosion nukes

If only there wasn't a 2 dmg instance per 0.5s rule
    More passive stacks for Neuvillette then
        Burgeon won't trigger Neuvillette passive, it's not a hydro reaction.
            Oh I see
I dont have baizu and furina, is this something that can be utilize with neuvi, zhongli, kazuha, and nahida? I also have yelan, and xingqui if i need to swap somebody else.
    Yeah I just use zhongli instead of Baizhu, works fine. You can probably use fischl or something if you have Neuvilette c2
    I wouldn't recommend Nahida in this combination. She would have more utility in another team. Else you can do Nahida Neuvillette, full EM raiden and zhongli. This team deletes everything as well. Xinqui and Yelan wouldn't do much but add hydro resonance. Do you have Fischl? You can add Fischl instead of Nahida.
        Yeah but i only have her at C0. Would that be alright?
With C2 Baizhu he doesn’t even bother coming on field, he just happens to be the most efficient way for a passive stack. The heal is largely irrelevant and the shield becomes less relevant after C1 Neuv.
I don't think he's really slept on anymore.  He's talked about in every Xianyun discussion, and Gaming was compared to him in every third comment when he released.  People who lose their 50/50s to Diluc just tend not to build him unless they wanted him anyway, so his usage rate is always going to be low, even if he gets godlike supports.
what’s the proper rotation here then? to get the most out of xianyun/furina ult as well as swirling correctly
    Depends on if you use CW and Bennett C6 or not.  2pc2pc is pretty good, but CW is better.  CW rotation is a little more annoying IMO, cause without it you don't need to worry about not having VV and Bennett burst active on all his plunges.

If you use CW and Bennett C6, I do Furina EQ -> Bennet EQ (you may need to do short hold E on Bennett to make sure you keep pyro aura, I forgor) -> Xianyun EQ -> Diluc E plunge E plunge E plunge x6 - Q.  

Numbers wise I think the boost from his Q isn't worth losing uptime on either Bennett or VV, however if you don't have Bennett C6 (you should if you want to use Diluc Plunge tbh), you'll need to do EQ at the beginning of Diluc's rotation to get the pyro infusion.
        yep i have c6 and rocking a very strong CW set and ittos weapon . thanks for this i really appreciate it. gonna try it out tonight.
            One more thing, Xianyun has a long burst so if you have to rotate more than once what I sometimes do is just Q on her, no E, then I do her E and catch particles after Diluc is done.  Cause the E is gonna swirl pyro away, not the Q, so you lose a second or two of VV 💀
                my goat, ty
The vv helps but Is pretty unnecessary thankfully. 

Xianyun got me to buy his costume and finish up his levels. Even with I think lvl 8 normals he's still more than capable of clearing
Wish I managed to get her but I was really short on gems at the time. Although I say that but I managed to get 146 pulls for Mona in 4 weeks lol
Play plunge diluc with furina c6 benny and xianyun
    don't have furina or Benny 🥲 
but has xianyun
        You can play melt plunge but still need benny atleast c1 and play xingqui instead of furina
            i play diluc - xingqui - xiangling - zhongli and it's rather comfortable. depending on the enemies ill throw nahida in there instead
            don't have furina and xinqui and no Benny🥲
                Play with kaeya and whoever you have you seem like new player
                    bro literally just got neuvelite 😱
                        Neat, build around him, he is incredibly good
Everything hurts so much nowadays on mobile, I'm for pulling for survivability now. Baizhu's the closest I'll get to a second Zhongli.
    Everyone laughed at me last year when I said baizhu had as much pull value as zhongli, that he was better than kokomi, now he is the meta support slot for the best characters
Sometimes I just put Childe in there and never switch to him just for the +1 normal attack because Neuvillette will destroy any chamber anyway
    and if you have C3 Neuv you get to unlock the lvl14 talent which is cracked btw 
How is this team played? Does Furina just drain everyone except Neuv's health down to 50% and then they're just left like that unhealed?
    Yeah. You couldn't care less about them being 50% hp and Neuvilette stacks fanfare by himself. For c0 Neuv it's probably his best team if we take comfort into consideration.
    Yes, net-net it trades a bit of Furina's damage for Neuv's. Baizhu's frontloading fanfare and Zhongli's Archaic Petra+res shred benefit them equally; the small difference comes from Baizhu giving Furina's pets more HP to drain vs Zhongli's buffs stacking on top of Furina and Kazuha for Neuv. 

It's just that Neuv is 2-3 times Furina's damage contribution, and his damage has greater AOE. So you tend to take the trade that favors Neuv.

^(This abyss of course, you're probably reserving Zhongli for shieldbreaking on second side, in which case you're likely picking Baizhu for Neuv into first side.)
You can just plunge.
    You can, but plunging really eats into your time more then just running Zhongli/a Geo Based team if you have one. Especially since Cope isn't exactly the easiest to get fast clears against.
        It takes like 10s to break the shield with sword plunges, nahida can just save more time by adding dmg than saving 7s on the shield breaking with zhongli. It all just depends and geo is obviously favoured with the current abyss blessing 
    Yeah but like... why bother when you can use other more suitable teams lol (the reason why he dropped)
Yeah, I struggled more the last cycle bc I forgot that thing had a shield and I tried to brute force it with plunge atks 💀 but then I just switched my teams a bit and it was fine. This time I just used the same teams and I did everything on the 1st try.

I never thought of that teamcomp tho but tbh using my haitham spread team was good bc I rarely use him on that team despite the fact I've invested quite a bit on him lmao
Oh yeah, it's clearable with his QB team, I changed it mostly bc I got impatient bc I couldn't break the shield faster so I just changed the teams for one with zhongli in it. I didn't really have problems with the jadeplume tho.

And definitely, supports tend to stay more consistent on this lists but yes, it definitely depends on the enemy line-up (and sometimes the blessing and the character on the banner)
It is clearable. But the speed isn't comparable with a proper geo team. I used Itto and cleared faster even though my Alhaitham team is more invested.
    Yeah that's how it be when chambers are more geared towards specific types of units. lol

But yeah, Ayaka is probably the unit who has been done most dirty overall. Because it's not even just Freeze, they're making her mono-cryo comp miserable to play too. And if the 4.6 abyss is anything to go by, it's not going to get any better.
Eh, Dendro had Asimon checking all other teams in ST sides, so now its time for Dendro to get checked.
Kuki is better in that slot. Electro res + instructor + her personal damage + whatever support sword.
    Zhongli literally buffs the whole team unconditionally with his shred and ToTM and Kuki's personal damage is non existent in spread team.
ok zajeff
    zajeff is a smart guy
and why does it perfectly fit 😭
Realistically i think they will make both sides of the Abyss hydro-immune eventually to see what happens
    We might see that shift in 5.x seeing as they probably want to give Pyro the opportunity to shine.
        Buffing pyro will probably end up buffing hydro as well, as Hydro is crucial in one of Pyro’s most important reactions, vape. (Unless they single out not buffing vape) 

Same with Cryo with Freeze. So I can only see Hydro getting stronger as we move forward with the game.
            They could buff vape.

But they could also make an abyss with nothing but hydro heralds, spectres, mimics, slimes, eidolons, tulpa and the cube.

Imagine the only vape DPS they release in 5.x is a main dps so Neuv and Childe don't get benefits AND a mechanic that doesn't work with Furina. Like maybe, idk Bond of Life or something, ya know? /j

Realistically, yes, I do agree, hydro being a core reaction element will just remain the best. XQ had been strong and relevant since forever.
                If they focused on a vape DPS, that’s only going to make the Hydro supports shine even more. 

The only way to make hydro not broken is to force restrictions against it. Which we already see with Chevreuse (by not including Hydro), Lyney (by making him focus on Mono), and now with Arle (by making BOL anti-synergistic with Furina).

Adding hydro immune enemies is just a direct attack against Hydro.

But anyway, the point is, I agree, Hydro is such a core reaction element that the only way to not make it broken is to not include it (by forcing restrictions against it) in the buffs that the other elements get.
            Not necessarily. Lyney teams and Chevreuse teams can now nearly match the clear speeds of normal vape teams (I'm not saying that they beat Hu Tao and Childe, just that they aren't far behind them).   

We just need to have a little more variety in the type of pyro and cryo units launched to allow for different team styles.   

Also, the addition of good pyro and cryo off fielders will open up new possibilities for team compositions. For example, I tried out a burning team which I had decent success with. It turns out that the best pyro I could use for the job was.... Bennet, whose attack buff doesn't matter much for the team, and his healing is lacking as it caps to 70%. The best pyro applicator in that team was Kazuha.  

If a pyro off fielder existed who could heal/shield (and maybe CC enemies), it would allow me to on field Nahida. This is just an example, on how we're limited by the type of characters we have and that buffing an element by releasing different types of characters will not necessarily buff hydro.
                > If a pyro off fielder existed who could heal/shield (and maybe CC enemies), it would allow me to on field Nahida

thoma?
                    Thoma and Dehya are sadly not good. It kinda gives the feeling that I'm using Barbara just because a character like Kokomi doesn't exist. I did say that I wanted the addition of good off fielders.
            They could focus on melt (both forward and reverse melt). Incredibly underutilized, and almost always is reliant on Bennet XL currently.
                Yeah that’s true, they could just focus on Melt, but Freeze is such an important part to Cryo’s identity. They can’t just leave it out to die. One way or the other, Hydro is going to shine once they revisit Freeze.
                    Forward melt can incorporate freeze as that still triggers melts, so I don't think it will be left out entirely (unless we just get Tulpa every abyss). Besides, even in a nation of hydro, cryo units besides Wriothesley are not faring too well so it might be another year of freeze struggles.
            They probably won't be buffing vape but more of the underutilized reactions like melt, overload, burning, and burgeon. 
That means that hydro will only be enhanced in utility for burgeon which, while it buffs hydro, may not buff Neuvillette if it's basically a pyro Alhaitham of burgeon.
        Eww then I need to use Bennett & XL one side (hyperbloom should still work with hydro immunes) and I hate circle impact and even with high ER my XL always falls short. Or maybe the Natlan archon is like Bennett but without a circle.
    Has there ever been an abyss where 2 sides is same element immune?
    Doesn't even have to be immune on both sides. Just highly resistant boss on one side and abyss heralds on the other side would do it.

e.g. Hydro tulpa on one side and Suanni on the other and you'll see hydro dps stocks plummet. But I'm sure they'll just go with Icewind Suite again like every other 4.X abyss.
    The Hydro DPS might be affected but the strongest reaction still needs hydro. Vape, Freeze, and all bloom related reactions still need a hydro applicator. 


People still used Neuvillette against Hydro Tulpa by having a hyperbloom team.
Pyro Kings when Hydro took the crown.
Hydro will only ever be dethroned by a cryo or an electro shield abyss, or just a bunch of hydro lectors. I remember 3.8 basically encouraging us to play burgeon. Wild times. It would also kill Neuvillette. Can't move away if you're frozen. 

Now the curious solution is hydro tulpa both sides. Neuvillette can just be moral support against the boss.
HYDRO SUPREMACY - BEST ELEMENT - STRONGEST UNITS - BEST WAIFUS/HUSBANDOS - STAY HYDRATED HOMIES
I remember when they said this about pyro in 1.0-2.something
    Tbf a lot was said during 1.0 that was veeeery questionable 😂
Yes?
Not to mention neither of the characters has gotten any good buffs in the form of another character or weapon or artifacts..

The last actual buff for Ayaka teams was Shenhe who was released in 2.4 .. 2 years ago (I don't count Furina since Furina isn't really good in Ayaka Freeze teams)

And Ganyu's last major/minor buff was Nahida for Burnmelt teams..It's actually funny how in 2021 people were talking about the "Liyue Big three" (Xiao , Hu tao and Ganyu) and said that Ganyu was considered better than the other 2 and was said to age better than Xiao and Hu tao... Now with consistent buffs throughout patches , Xiao and Hu tao teams are now at top even rivaling current good dmg dealers teams..
    Ganyu for what it's worth can still compete she doesn't dominate like before but she is still decent. Her biggest issue is being so squishy.
    Nahida wasn't a buff for Ganyu, more like a side grade. Burnmelt is just another option with it's own set of preferable circumstances
Same. I know it’s confirmation bias but stillllll. Freeze is always and will always gimped unless (normally) the slow debuff is also present with helpful modifiers (like slow being Def reduced or RES shred)
But how is Wriothesley high?
    Wrio is good against single target which is every second half chamber and none of the enemies are actually cryo resistant like the first half is. All you need is a character that can plunge away the shield in 12-3. I've done both Wrio freeze and burn-melt second half and those are not even his best teams  which is probably the melt team at 15th place as seen above.
    Ayaka has more raw usage number but Wrio has more usage rate.

&#x200B;

also people seems to run him on a reverse melt 15\* rather than the usual freeze.
Lower than what we have thats for sure
good luck on getting his cons! he's c1 right now and I'm planning to get c3 on his rerun. been carrying my skill issue troubles away so he's never left my teams lol
running him in a burn melt team is actually pretty strong at c0 but i'm convinced his usage rate would be way higher if c1 was in his base kit
    Agreed 100%, because otherwise he does feel amazing to play. But that C1 being such a big bonus + his OG banner having poor release timing is a nasty combo.
Can I ask what are his flaws at c0? I’m planning to pull for him next time around. Probably gonna get him c1r1 (or over c1)
oh yeah omg i didn't think about that🤣 thank you! just thought that I may be "out-seasoned" already (for context I just came back from months of hiatus😊)
    They have been trying insanely hard to hard counter ayaka since 3.0. but because of that anemo DPS and cryo DPS have to go through 70 and 90% res almost every abyss
There's a lot of C6 havers on every character mains subreddit.
I did some calculations for the most used Navia team: Navia Zhongli Xiangling Bennett. If I swap Zhongli for C0 Chiori, it is actually a downgrade. One-doll Chiori does more damage than Zhongli, but Zhongli version will do more team damage. The better Navia and Xiangling are built, the difference is also bigger.
    What’s the breakdown for the calculations? I’m curious. I can’t imagine that realistically Navia will have the same amount of shards in both teams especially if Zhongli’s pillar isn’t hitting.
    Without the pillar, Zhongli does not proc tenacity or generate energy. The calcs that have Zhongli at just 5% below Chiori have both with fav. Without those he falls down a bit more below both Chiori and Albedo. Where are the calcs that say she is worse to begin with anyway? TGS, KQM’s Jaime, Jstern, etc. are all the other way using KQM standards.
I think I should say, "That is one of the reasons why fewer players pull her."
She’s actually one of the strongest subdps in the game at c0 in personal damage.

She just severely lacks utility compared to other subdps.
Some still building her, some don't even play abyss.  Especially this is geo we are talking about, so many owners are casual players who just pull for characters they like
Most people don't pull for abyss.


Only the Furina and Nahida have ever had usage rates similar to their ownership rates.


For example Raiden has 79% ownership and sits around 50% usage on a good day.
    I do wonder why people care about meta so much if they don't pull for abyss. Bc the meta characters are always the more desirable units, but barely anyone does abyss
Man, i was using my c0 Chiori with Mistsplitter and Ningguang in abyss, plus Furina and Shinobu full EM, and Chiori was on field most of the time with infusion. My Ning was using Dodoco and Furina is C0 with Festering, nothing amazing. Plus i suck with rotations. 

The fact that she brought up my Ningguang to Abyss for a 36 is fact alone that she works well.

One doll works pretty well anyway, if your dps is good, since hwr infusion is really not good. 

People just love to bash on anything if it's not the "best scenario". Navia benefits a lot from her. Or from zhong. Or from Candace. Or amber. Navia just works with anything, why optimize someone who is so strong 😂

Noelle I'm not so sure, though, because i don't use her.
2 geo, 2 pyro is better because of pyro synergy. Not to mention if you go for Xiangling then you have to get Bennett too or the energy would be terrible.
People read those? 🤔
Indeed but even in the previous abyss, she was already pretty high usage despite thr drop between 4.3 and 4.4 since people want to play with their shiny new toy. 

Navia just keeps winning though. Xianyun? A Navia buff. Chiori?   A Navia buff. Navia is just super flexible and not even energy reliant. She is a geo Alhaitham if geo Alhaitham exists (not Chiori).
    She was in B tier in previous abyss though, but that abyss wasnt that good for her anyways

Unless you mean previous usage rate but thats still the same abyss as the current one
I'm confused, how exactly does it push to use Geo? I didn't use Geo, pyro or electro at all and didn't feel like I'm going against the flow.
    Breaking the boss's shield in third chamber second half, you can break it will plunge attacks but its comparatively much slower. The shield is easy asf if you have geo characters in your team
        Ah, makes sense.. I just pushed through with Xiao and didn't even consider that I needed something else XD
            Navia is also a claymore character, meaning even her physical Attacks deal blunt dmg (the thing you need against the shield)
                Well, yeah.. The question wasn't about navia tho, just about Geo in general
Which half?
I don't have zhongli on same acc with jackal boi, neither I wanna run them together, plus playing on mobile so it's difficult to break geo shield faster

Besides I have many more suitable teams for that
There's a melt [Amber player](https://youtu.be/dVyHnGfV_yg?si=5ht4ugt0FEd95V_Y) that runs Amber, Sucrose, Diona, Rosaria. Ganyu in Rosaria's place works too.

An overload team with Chev, Lisa, Dori/Beidou, Diluc/Klee should work fine.  
I personally ran Chev, Lisa, Fischl, Yoimiya for boss halves in past abysses.

Dori hyperbloom probably works. Dori, Collei, Barbara/Candace, Flex.

A bunch of mono-geo core units are in C tier. Just put Noelle where Itto normally goes, and you get Noelle, Gorou, Yunjin, Geo-Traveler/Ninguang.

Lisa/Keqing aggravate is another option. Lisa, Sucrose, Yaoyao/Collei, Dori or Keqing, Sucrose, Yaoyao/Kirara, Collei/Beidou.
i wasnt thinking of this spiral abyss specificaly, just spiral abyss in general
    The same holds true in any abyss. Usage rate generally has very little correlation to character viability or performance.
Never tried her outside of story quest

Heizou is cool but not sure what would work

i guess Heizou could swirl Monas hydro, and maybe pull in enemies with burst and Kaeya or someone to freeze
I got Furina to C3 just for him since aside from Kazuha he doesn't really have any buffers being an HP scaler. Now I usually run her on the other side since he doesn't really need her 😅
Havent checked but his cons are good too right? 

Also, for those successfully pulled on the Chronicle banner, Tighnari mains who werent able to get his sig weapon are now able to use him with Hunter’s Path
    Yes, he definitely has amazing cons for a standard character.
    Nah the cons are pretty weak till c6, c1 looks ok but its a pretty small buff.
My Kokomi got sucked into that sht and i couldn't get out no matter what, and just had to watch everyone die.

I don't think it's supposed to work like this?!

I jump, run, walk, anything, and got stuck there.

I never got there before because i avoid it easily, but this time i used burst near her and during the animation she threw me exactly to the tornado...
I really don't think there's a strategy to beating them unlike the Wenut or the Wolflord. Coppelia doesn't have a weakness phase (i think) so it's literally just go through your rotation and just dodge their attacks (especially the ice slashes. Those hurt 🤕) or time your bursts for invulnerability during the animation. If you can't beat it, it's either your team doesn't pass the DPS check or you need to work on your dodging.
Also true, and with Wanderer it's not easy at all.
The Furina, Faruzan and Xianyun core is so strong that I can easily clear first half with plunge Lynette (it's a really fun team).
That team will never be #2 because it takes Furina. The only way for it to rise is to reduce neuv's usage.
I was lucky enough to get C2 Xianyun and with C6 Faruzan I could legitimately brute force Wenut with my Xiao team. His new best teams are scary good.
His usage rate has actually stayed the same or decreased over time. Team usage rate is misleading. Characters with 1 team will have that 1 team place high.
    It did drop from early Sumeru but he's been hovering around the same spot for a while, but he's generally in a better spot than the drop atleast past 4.0. He used to be only be seen when he actually counters the floor and has recently maintained a steady appearance rate. 

It does makes sense he drops a bit given a recent double worm in abyss. And tbf, this team is his best team without much sidegrades to it bar Baizhu. The previous one had three of his teams, even forcing a Raiden variant specifically to handle the worms. 

But nontheless, ever since Sumeru, a lot of single target teams have been around and Hutao's usage spike is stabilizing a bit towards the center.
Neuvillette was one of the highest sale banner in all china before furina. His ownership is not low.
but look at wriothesley….
then how does zhongli have a 89% usage rate?
    Out of those 84.7% of people who have Zhongli, 89%  are using him.  

That's certainly impressive.
        Ah, I see
That could very well be the case.
the CN meta tends to favor comfort over speed running. Easier execution is more reliable, and if you're going to get your 600 primos anyway, you don't get bonus primos for lower times. Retrying if you mess up or get bad RNG sucks. I like it when my record says Battles Fought: 12.

that said, this is the first time I have used ZL in a very long time.
Yeah but not even top 36? It's still a basicly unkillable team with what feels like twice the damage.
    I mean you got ask too, which character did the majority of people pull Xianyun for to use?

Western TCs definitely sung the praises of Xianyun's synergy with Furina opening the door for a lot of new team comps, which is true, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say most Xianyun pullers who are 36 starring ended up pulling her for Xiao teams.
        I pulled her for Navia amd skipped Xiao. Even my kind exists lmao.
I dont have Layla, Kirara and Fischl but i do have beidou and sucrose. I also have a wolf's gravestone. I'll make sure to try beidou dendromc and sucrose with neuvillette.
    Nice. Give a favonius weapon to either mc or Sucrose if you have one to help battery Beidou's burst. You need to build some crit on that character then tho, to proc the weapon's passive. Also prototype amber on Neuvi. It's his best f2p weapon, it's craftable, and will help a bit with survivability and charging Neuvi's burst.
        TYSM, im saving for Zhongli and i already have like 60 pulls.
            Great, he's a fantastic comfort character. He'll work great with Neuvillette as well
Honestly, I might as well just give up on spiral abyss then.. If I need to play meta and minmax the fun out of the equation, I'm better off not doing that. Most Meta characters I simply don't have, or don't like the playstyle of. Just spent all my luck getting Klee, and apparently she's a B tier or sth.. Can't give a shit. Every character I play is low tier somehow
    You neither need to play meta nor min max, you just need to be able to make reasonable teams and get everyone to a passable level when it comes to builds. Even launch players don't have min maxed teams with that artifact rng lol. If you want to give up, your choice, but it's quite a sum of primos to give up on. Also this tier list just shows usage rates, characters being lower doesn't mean they aren't good nor that they can't pass abyss.

Also you don't need to pass abyss 12 right away. If you can pass 11 it's already good enough for a newish player. I do abyss on my sister's 3 months old account and can consistently pass up to floor 11 with full stars and can finish 12 even (did that just for the achievement and the namecard for the sis) although just with 3 stars for now. I did recommend some characters to her but otherwise told her to get and build whoever the hell she wants, cause it's more important she has characters she likes, and leave worring about how to pass abyss to me. Her artifacts are horrendous btw. Abyss is more a team building check and knowledge about mechanics check than anything else. The so called meta characters just make some things easier. If you want, you can list what characters you have, maybe I can recommend some comps out of what you have. You can also visit mains subreddits of your favourites and check there.
Then what's the point of usage rate
    it's really just to show which 5 stars (and popular 4 stars) are useful for the current abyss lineup, and to show the current trends; which characters are popular with the people who own them.

but people often misinterpret it as evidence to how strong characters are.

that said, the fact that a character like xiangling manages to be 52% despite 100% of players owning her is rather impressive. it literally means that 52% of players use xiangling in the abyss (though it should be noted that this is just people who submitted their data, not all players across all servers. still impressive though)

anyway, you can see the ownership rate in the last image, second to rightmost number. chiori for example, despite having a high usage rate, only has around a 12% ownership rate. only around 12% of players who submitted their data own chiori. but, the people who pulled for her are most likely going to use her, especially since geo is good this abyss. so, she gets a high usage rate.
That makes sense
That line goes well with Zhongli as well. He has seen so many meta going up and down (vape meta, dendro meta, now hypercarry meta and such) but in the end only him that can comfortably fits to all of those. He is trully the Dad of this game.
Ngl I think there’s a big overlap in the communities
    Oh for sure. BeryL (DRX’s support) designed an Ashe skin to resemble [Elysia](https://www.oneesports.gg/league-of-legends/elysia-drx-worlds-2022-ashe/) from honkai impact 3rd after winning worlds. Obvi not genshin but same idea of player base crossover.
Doable is a very strong word in that context lol.
    [It's possible](https://youtu.be/2XO0Mgty5e0?si=zFfVElzKG8fS2o0-)
        What manner of sea creature is this?

I swear high constellation Genshin is practically another game.
        why are people always spamming the menu
            To pick up particles, I'm pretty sure. It pauses the timer but those still move. If not that, then I dunno.
                My favorite was this one video of an abyss speedrunner who was menu'ing after every action to collect particles, the actual video was like 3 minutes long or something but in-game it was like 15 seconds or something 💀
                    it might have been against maguu kenki, you can skip his stalling invulnerable phase by constantly booking/opening the map every millisecond
                    You mean something like this https://youtu.be/cxnvuTNyy3c?si=irH_l84ZGS9ZygLy ?
                        LOL yeah that was the video I was thinking of
            To pick up energy particles and reset character switching cooldown (I think)
            Menus Freeze time for everything except particles
        Hi, I'm Old and Dumb, so could someone please explain something to me:

* C6R5 characters are, according to Google, 1-1.2k$ on average, they have both Furina and Yelan C6R5
* Xianyun is C2R5, so I assume 600-700$ at least?

So that's what, 2.5-3k usd on average, which is fine, I'm not here to police what people spend their money on, and it's not like it's that absurd of a sum all things considered (depending on where you live in the world).

However, my question is this: why, in the name of all holy fucks in the world, would they then be playing the game on a phone??????????????
        Did I....do this by accident?

I technically had Zhongli so probably not I suppose.

Definitely just used Hu Tao / Zhongli / Xingqiu / Yelan though and just smashed Hu Tao vape plunge attacks into it until it died.
Went in blind and Overload did it for me
I jut used raiden national as always. 

Simply have Raiden jump a couple of times before doing your usual rotation. 

Repeat once more if you can't one-cycle it (I can't) and that's it 

Just breaking the shield twice with a couple of quick plunges takes like no time at all. 

It buffs jumping height of all charactersnear, so everyone can just plunge attack by simply jumping straight from standing on the ground without any special setup
pro tip : use crystallize shield instead, the enemies won't get their buff if your shield breaks when they attack you.
That's how I managed to do Itto first half and Navia second half.
    > he enemies won't get their buff if your shield breaks when they attack you

Instruction unclear. Itto's crystalize shield is way too beefy, it takes at least 4 simultaneous hits to break through it(Redhorn to good)


Altho truthfully, I'm careful with my crystalize placement.  I don't apply any elements when they spawn and just geo smack them.  I also know which attack is the shield steal so I can avoid it if I do still have a crystalize shield active.
        What does redhorn have to do with crystalize
            Defense reduces damage taken which also applies to shields. A Noelle using Layla’s shield for example can tank more hits with it compared to a different chara
                Ohhh yeah true
     It is possible that even if you do not use a shield on your team that the Husks' buff is activated because of the rumbling stone aura that causes Geo damage independently of Geo Husk (which in base form only causes physical damage), I I realized that Husk was in enhanced form even though my team lacks geo and shield (Furina, Neuvillette, Kazuha and Kuki).
Is not a geo mechanic, you need to hit it with blunt damage to break the shield. And since the shield is a geo shield it takes extra damage from geo sources, you can take someone like Zhongli whose hold skill deletes more than half the shield and burst the other half.

Well if you are not breaking the shield you required around 19 million equivalent damage to brute force through it resistances, so either you are a major whale or you are indeed breaking the shield, that or you are talking about another machine.
    I just break the shield with normal attacks
        You are breaking it with overload.
Not everyone can play like a TAS Speedrun, and you don’t really need to be faster than 3.00 minutes, so comfortable play is better than -5 sec.
Genuine question: what are the teams where he is considered a DPS increase? Because everytime I see someone even suggesting running him in any given team causes people to go wild claiming you'd be better off replacing him with someone else.
    He's very good in Tighnari teams, since swirl does nothing for Tighnari (>50% of the team dps) and only increases your electro unit's aggravate damage.
    Neuvilette furin Kazuha zhongli is neuvillettes highest dps team at any investment level
        That team SHREDS. Zhongli shield bot + Petra = chef kiss
    To expand on why Zhongli makes it into Neuvillette's best double hydro team even at C1+, it is because of 4pc archaic petra on top of the universal shred.
    Navia
Except a while ago people would constantly push replacing him with another character even in teams where he isn't that big a DPS loss. For instance people pushed Funernational replacing ZL with Xiangling in double hydro Hutao claiming a DPS increase, but teams like that never receive widespread adoption because it only takes a single reset to have lost any time saved by increasing DPS by a few thousand replacing him.
    Teams like that aren't popular because they took your XL from your aoe. At the time you had Ayaka, international and Raiden as aoe dps.


It's very clear why it wasn't popular.
    Depends on your level of investment. All the popular Hu Tao teams now don't use Zhongli for a reason - Furina requires a complementary healer and the extra damage through those two units is greater than the utility provided by Zhongli + Xingqiu.
        Thats not true hutao popular team is still with zhongli,its not with furina since she is generally on the other side and that she still has enormous damage without her
his ult kit is gated behind a lot of constellations and talent level scaling, simple screenwide 90k+ crit unbuffed at max while re-applying shield
His ult Seems to be useful against geo shield
    It can be, but in those cases it's not really a "DPS" option, it's just a shield shred option. Those cases are generally VERY rare.

You basically never build Zhongli for his own personal damage.

At the end of the day the actual damage output of his burst compared to the time the animation takes to cast is just bad. The only situation where you see people using his burst is usually if that person has C2, in which case it's NOT a huge DPS loss as you can easily use the instant swap/burst and you refresh his shield without ever having to hold his skill instead.
C2 Kazuha also buffs pretty much any dendro comp that has a flex slot, so a lot of people have him there
don't forget that in quickbloom he can cluster bomb by grabbing the seeds
Last patch has wenut and ruin serpent both and he still like high S (68% or something). I think with Navia around he also have a premier frontload DPS so he even got more options nowadays to deal with short windows enemies
    Also a mainstay in Tighnari-Yae spread because he plays the 12s rotations well. That team is a silver bullet for the Wenut.
I think most people don't realize that not everyone aim for 36 stars. Some people just like to be able to clear abyss and have fun and Zhongli allows them to comfortably clear it even though in some cases he can be dps lost and can't get you 36* but you can surely clear chambers and for some clearing it is already an achievement. This is also one of the reasons he is mostly used.
    This data is full star clears only though so it's exclusively people who used Zhongli *and* got 36 stars.
>Zhongli drops off for me whenever the Wenut/Ruin Serpent shows up or tag team consecrated beast floors

???

>learning how to dodge or healing through the damage is much more advisable.

The reality in genshin is that you CANNOT dodge everything. His shield is FAR superior to dodging and healing. And whatever loss your team gets by bringing him in is almost always so insignificant you most likely end up with better dps by never getting interrupted or be forced to play safe.
There was one c1r1 Wriothesley main solo on 2nd half. Idk how they do that but they did
    I think it was u/wriotheslycumdumpster
        I couldve lived without knowing about his existence, btw
        Hey its me! HAHAHA
            I'm wish i could get on your lvl one day... Abyss skill, I mean. Not the username lol
        That username definitely rings the bell lmao
Is that a fact or just your own assumption? Because you only needs C1 to be able to solo shit and that’s what I’ve been doing ever since he’s out
It's all right though since his built with em. Thats a nice burgeon dmg. 

On side note. Im using him for aggravate and that pyro infusion sucks. Fuck that second chamber.
bum bum bakudan at home
> Burgeon explosion nukes

If only there wasn't a 2 dmg instance per 0.5s rule
More passive stacks for Neuvillette then
    Burgeon won't trigger Neuvillette passive, it's not a hydro reaction.
        Oh I see
Yeah I just use zhongli instead of Baizhu, works fine. You can probably use fischl or something if you have Neuvilette c2
I wouldn't recommend Nahida in this combination. She would have more utility in another team. Else you can do Nahida Neuvillette, full EM raiden and zhongli. This team deletes everything as well. Xinqui and Yelan wouldn't do much but add hydro resonance. Do you have Fischl? You can add Fischl instead of Nahida.
    Yeah but i only have her at C0. Would that be alright?
Depends on if you use CW and Bennett C6 or not.  2pc2pc is pretty good, but CW is better.  CW rotation is a little more annoying IMO, cause without it you don't need to worry about not having VV and Bennett burst active on all his plunges.

If you use CW and Bennett C6, I do Furina EQ -> Bennet EQ (you may need to do short hold E on Bennett to make sure you keep pyro aura, I forgor) -> Xianyun EQ -> Diluc E plunge E plunge E plunge x6 - Q.  

Numbers wise I think the boost from his Q isn't worth losing uptime on either Bennett or VV, however if you don't have Bennett C6 (you should if you want to use Diluc Plunge tbh), you'll need to do EQ at the beginning of Diluc's rotation to get the pyro infusion.
    yep i have c6 and rocking a very strong CW set and ittos weapon . thanks for this i really appreciate it. gonna try it out tonight.
        One more thing, Xianyun has a long burst so if you have to rotate more than once what I sometimes do is just Q on her, no E, then I do her E and catch particles after Diluc is done.  Cause the E is gonna swirl pyro away, not the Q, so you lose a second or two of VV 💀
            my goat, ty
don't have furina or Benny 🥲 
but has xianyun
    You can play melt plunge but still need benny atleast c1 and play xingqui instead of furina
        i play diluc - xingqui - xiangling - zhongli and it's rather comfortable. depending on the enemies ill throw nahida in there instead
        don't have furina and xinqui and no Benny🥲
            Play with kaeya and whoever you have you seem like new player
                bro literally just got neuvelite 😱
                    Neat, build around him, he is incredibly good
Everyone laughed at me last year when I said baizhu had as much pull value as zhongli, that he was better than kokomi, now he is the meta support slot for the best characters
and if you have C3 Neuv you get to unlock the lvl14 talent which is cracked btw 
Yeah. You couldn't care less about them being 50% hp and Neuvilette stacks fanfare by himself. For c0 Neuv it's probably his best team if we take comfort into consideration.
Yes, net-net it trades a bit of Furina's damage for Neuv's. Baizhu's frontloading fanfare and Zhongli's Archaic Petra+res shred benefit them equally; the small difference comes from Baizhu giving Furina's pets more HP to drain vs Zhongli's buffs stacking on top of Furina and Kazuha for Neuv. 

It's just that Neuv is 2-3 times Furina's damage contribution, and his damage has greater AOE. So you tend to take the trade that favors Neuv.

^(This abyss of course, you're probably reserving Zhongli for shieldbreaking on second side, in which case you're likely picking Baizhu for Neuv into first side.)
You can, but plunging really eats into your time more then just running Zhongli/a Geo Based team if you have one. Especially since Cope isn't exactly the easiest to get fast clears against.
    It takes like 10s to break the shield with sword plunges, nahida can just save more time by adding dmg than saving 7s on the shield breaking with zhongli. It all just depends and geo is obviously favoured with the current abyss blessing 
Yeah but like... why bother when you can use other more suitable teams lol (the reason why he dropped)
Yeah that's how it be when chambers are more geared towards specific types of units. lol

But yeah, Ayaka is probably the unit who has been done most dirty overall. Because it's not even just Freeze, they're making her mono-cryo comp miserable to play too. And if the 4.6 abyss is anything to go by, it's not going to get any better.
Zhongli literally buffs the whole team unconditionally with his shred and ToTM and Kuki's personal damage is non existent in spread team.
zajeff is a smart guy
We might see that shift in 5.x seeing as they probably want to give Pyro the opportunity to shine.
    Buffing pyro will probably end up buffing hydro as well, as Hydro is crucial in one of Pyro’s most important reactions, vape. (Unless they single out not buffing vape) 

Same with Cryo with Freeze. So I can only see Hydro getting stronger as we move forward with the game.
        They could buff vape.

But they could also make an abyss with nothing but hydro heralds, spectres, mimics, slimes, eidolons, tulpa and the cube.

Imagine the only vape DPS they release in 5.x is a main dps so Neuv and Childe don't get benefits AND a mechanic that doesn't work with Furina. Like maybe, idk Bond of Life or something, ya know? /j

Realistically, yes, I do agree, hydro being a core reaction element will just remain the best. XQ had been strong and relevant since forever.
            If they focused on a vape DPS, that’s only going to make the Hydro supports shine even more. 

The only way to make hydro not broken is to force restrictions against it. Which we already see with Chevreuse (by not including Hydro), Lyney (by making him focus on Mono), and now with Arle (by making BOL anti-synergistic with Furina).

Adding hydro immune enemies is just a direct attack against Hydro.

But anyway, the point is, I agree, Hydro is such a core reaction element that the only way to not make it broken is to not include it (by forcing restrictions against it) in the buffs that the other elements get.
        Not necessarily. Lyney teams and Chevreuse teams can now nearly match the clear speeds of normal vape teams (I'm not saying that they beat Hu Tao and Childe, just that they aren't far behind them).   

We just need to have a little more variety in the type of pyro and cryo units launched to allow for different team styles.   

Also, the addition of good pyro and cryo off fielders will open up new possibilities for team compositions. For example, I tried out a burning team which I had decent success with. It turns out that the best pyro I could use for the job was.... Bennet, whose attack buff doesn't matter much for the team, and his healing is lacking as it caps to 70%. The best pyro applicator in that team was Kazuha.  

If a pyro off fielder existed who could heal/shield (and maybe CC enemies), it would allow me to on field Nahida. This is just an example, on how we're limited by the type of characters we have and that buffing an element by releasing different types of characters will not necessarily buff hydro.
            > If a pyro off fielder existed who could heal/shield (and maybe CC enemies), it would allow me to on field Nahida

thoma?
                Thoma and Dehya are sadly not good. It kinda gives the feeling that I'm using Barbara just because a character like Kokomi doesn't exist. I did say that I wanted the addition of good off fielders.
        They could focus on melt (both forward and reverse melt). Incredibly underutilized, and almost always is reliant on Bennet XL currently.
            Yeah that’s true, they could just focus on Melt, but Freeze is such an important part to Cryo’s identity. They can’t just leave it out to die. One way or the other, Hydro is going to shine once they revisit Freeze.
                Forward melt can incorporate freeze as that still triggers melts, so I don't think it will be left out entirely (unless we just get Tulpa every abyss). Besides, even in a nation of hydro, cryo units besides Wriothesley are not faring too well so it might be another year of freeze struggles.
        They probably won't be buffing vape but more of the underutilized reactions like melt, overload, burning, and burgeon. 
That means that hydro will only be enhanced in utility for burgeon which, while it buffs hydro, may not buff Neuvillette if it's basically a pyro Alhaitham of burgeon.
    Eww then I need to use Bennett & XL one side (hyperbloom should still work with hydro immunes) and I hate circle impact and even with high ER my XL always falls short. Or maybe the Natlan archon is like Bennett but without a circle.
Has there ever been an abyss where 2 sides is same element immune?
Doesn't even have to be immune on both sides. Just highly resistant boss on one side and abyss heralds on the other side would do it.

e.g. Hydro tulpa on one side and Suanni on the other and you'll see hydro dps stocks plummet. But I'm sure they'll just go with Icewind Suite again like every other 4.X abyss.
The Hydro DPS might be affected but the strongest reaction still needs hydro. Vape, Freeze, and all bloom related reactions still need a hydro applicator. 


People still used Neuvillette against Hydro Tulpa by having a hyperbloom team.
Tbf a lot was said during 1.0 that was veeeery questionable 😂
Ganyu for what it's worth can still compete she doesn't dominate like before but she is still decent. Her biggest issue is being so squishy.
Nahida wasn't a buff for Ganyu, more like a side grade. Burnmelt is just another option with it's own set of preferable circumstances
Wrio is good against single target which is every second half chamber and none of the enemies are actually cryo resistant like the first half is. All you need is a character that can plunge away the shield in 12-3. I've done both Wrio freeze and burn-melt second half and those are not even his best teams  which is probably the melt team at 15th place as seen above.
Ayaka has more raw usage number but Wrio has more usage rate.

&#x200B;

also people seems to run him on a reverse melt 15\* rather than the usual freeze.
Agreed 100%, because otherwise he does feel amazing to play. But that C1 being such a big bonus + his OG banner having poor release timing is a nasty combo.
They have been trying insanely hard to hard counter ayaka since 3.0. but because of that anemo DPS and cryo DPS have to go through 70 and 90% res almost every abyss
What’s the breakdown for the calculations? I’m curious. I can’t imagine that realistically Navia will have the same amount of shards in both teams especially if Zhongli’s pillar isn’t hitting.
Without the pillar, Zhongli does not proc tenacity or generate energy. The calcs that have Zhongli at just 5% below Chiori have both with fav. Without those he falls down a bit more below both Chiori and Albedo. Where are the calcs that say she is worse to begin with anyway? TGS, KQM’s Jaime, Jstern, etc. are all the other way using KQM standards.
I do wonder why people care about meta so much if they don't pull for abyss. Bc the meta characters are always the more desirable units, but barely anyone does abyss
She was in B tier in previous abyss though, but that abyss wasnt that good for her anyways

Unless you mean previous usage rate but thats still the same abyss as the current one
Breaking the boss's shield in third chamber second half, you can break it will plunge attacks but its comparatively much slower. The shield is easy asf if you have geo characters in your team
    Ah, makes sense.. I just pushed through with Xiao and didn't even consider that I needed something else XD
        Navia is also a claymore character, meaning even her physical Attacks deal blunt dmg (the thing you need against the shield)
            Well, yeah.. The question wasn't about navia tho, just about Geo in general
The same holds true in any abyss. Usage rate generally has very little correlation to character viability or performance.
Yes, he definitely has amazing cons for a standard character.
Nah the cons are pretty weak till c6, c1 looks ok but its a pretty small buff.
It did drop from early Sumeru but he's been hovering around the same spot for a while, but he's generally in a better spot than the drop atleast past 4.0. He used to be only be seen when he actually counters the floor and has recently maintained a steady appearance rate. 

It does makes sense he drops a bit given a recent double worm in abyss. And tbf, this team is his best team without much sidegrades to it bar Baizhu. The previous one had three of his teams, even forcing a Raiden variant specifically to handle the worms. 

But nontheless, ever since Sumeru, a lot of single target teams have been around and Hutao's usage spike is stabilizing a bit towards the center.
Out of those 84.7% of people who have Zhongli, 89%  are using him.  

That's certainly impressive.
    Ah, I see
I mean you got ask too, which character did the majority of people pull Xianyun for to use?

Western TCs definitely sung the praises of Xianyun's synergy with Furina opening the door for a lot of new team comps, which is true, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say most Xianyun pullers who are 36 starring ended up pulling her for Xiao teams.
    I pulled her for Navia amd skipped Xiao. Even my kind exists lmao.
Nice. Give a favonius weapon to either mc or Sucrose if you have one to help battery Beidou's burst. You need to build some crit on that character then tho, to proc the weapon's passive. Also prototype amber on Neuvi. It's his best f2p weapon, it's craftable, and will help a bit with survivability and charging Neuvi's burst.
    TYSM, im saving for Zhongli and i already have like 60 pulls.
        Great, he's a fantastic comfort character. He'll work great with Neuvillette as well
You neither need to play meta nor min max, you just need to be able to make reasonable teams and get everyone to a passable level when it comes to builds. Even launch players don't have min maxed teams with that artifact rng lol. If you want to give up, your choice, but it's quite a sum of primos to give up on. Also this tier list just shows usage rates, characters being lower doesn't mean they aren't good nor that they can't pass abyss.

Also you don't need to pass abyss 12 right away. If you can pass 11 it's already good enough for a newish player. I do abyss on my sister's 3 months old account and can consistently pass up to floor 11 with full stars and can finish 12 even (did that just for the achievement and the namecard for the sis) although just with 3 stars for now. I did recommend some characters to her but otherwise told her to get and build whoever the hell she wants, cause it's more important she has characters she likes, and leave worring about how to pass abyss to me. Her artifacts are horrendous btw. Abyss is more a team building check and knowledge about mechanics check than anything else. The so called meta characters just make some things easier. If you want, you can list what characters you have, maybe I can recommend some comps out of what you have. You can also visit mains subreddits of your favourites and check there.
it's really just to show which 5 stars (and popular 4 stars) are useful for the current abyss lineup, and to show the current trends; which characters are popular with the people who own them.

but people often misinterpret it as evidence to how strong characters are.

that said, the fact that a character like xiangling manages to be 52% despite 100% of players owning her is rather impressive. it literally means that 52% of players use xiangling in the abyss (though it should be noted that this is just people who submitted their data, not all players across all servers. still impressive though)

anyway, you can see the ownership rate in the last image, second to rightmost number. chiori for example, despite having a high usage rate, only has around a 12% ownership rate. only around 12% of players who submitted their data own chiori. but, the people who pulled for her are most likely going to use her, especially since geo is good this abyss. so, she gets a high usage rate.
Oh for sure. BeryL (DRX’s support) designed an Ashe skin to resemble [Elysia](https://www.oneesports.gg/league-of-legends/elysia-drx-worlds-2022-ashe/) from honkai impact 3rd after winning worlds. Obvi not genshin but same idea of player base crossover.

    What manner of sea creature is this?

I swear high constellation Genshin is practically another game.
    why are people always spamming the menu
        To pick up particles, I'm pretty sure. It pauses the timer but those still move. If not that, then I dunno.
            My favorite was this one video of an abyss speedrunner who was menu'ing after every action to collect particles, the actual video was like 3 minutes long or something but in-game it was like 15 seconds or something 💀
                it might have been against maguu kenki, you can skip his stalling invulnerable phase by constantly booking/opening the map every millisecond
                You mean something like this https://youtu.be/cxnvuTNyy3c?si=irH_l84ZGS9ZygLy ?
                    LOL yeah that was the video I was thinking of
        To pick up energy particles and reset character switching cooldown (I think)
        Menus Freeze time for everything except particles
    Hi, I'm Old and Dumb, so could someone please explain something to me:

* C6R5 characters are, according to Google, 1-1.2k$ on average, they have both Furina and Yelan C6R5
* Xianyun is C2R5, so I assume 600-700$ at least?

So that's what, 2.5-3k usd on average, which is fine, I'm not here to police what people spend their money on, and it's not like it's that absurd of a sum all things considered (depending on where you live in the world).

However, my question is this: why, in the name of all holy fucks in the world, would they then be playing the game on a phone??????????????
    Did I....do this by accident?

I technically had Zhongli so probably not I suppose.

Definitely just used Hu Tao / Zhongli / Xingqiu / Yelan though and just smashed Hu Tao vape plunge attacks into it until it died.
> he enemies won't get their buff if your shield breaks when they attack you

Instruction unclear. Itto's crystalize shield is way too beefy, it takes at least 4 simultaneous hits to break through it(Redhorn to good)


Altho truthfully, I'm careful with my crystalize placement.  I don't apply any elements when they spawn and just geo smack them.  I also know which attack is the shield steal so I can avoid it if I do still have a crystalize shield active.
    What does redhorn have to do with crystalize
        Defense reduces damage taken which also applies to shields. A Noelle using Layla’s shield for example can tank more hits with it compared to a different chara
            Ohhh yeah true
 It is possible that even if you do not use a shield on your team that the Husks' buff is activated because of the rumbling stone aura that causes Geo damage independently of Geo Husk (which in base form only causes physical damage), I I realized that Husk was in enhanced form even though my team lacks geo and shield (Furina, Neuvillette, Kazuha and Kuki).
I just break the shield with normal attacks

If a pyro off fielder existed who could heal/shield (and maybe CC enemies), it would allow me to on field Nahida. This is just an example, on how we're limited by the type of characters we have and that buffing an element by releasing different types of characters will not necessarily buff hydro.

thoma?
            Thoma and Dehya are sadly not good. It kinda gives the feeling that I'm using Barbara just because a character like Kokomi doesn't exist. I did say that I wanted the addition of good off fielders.
    They could focus on melt (both forward and reverse melt). Incredibly underutilized, and almost always is reliant on Bennet XL currently.
        Yeah that’s true, they could just focus on Melt, but Freeze is such an important part to Cryo’s identity. They can’t just leave it out to die. One way or the other, Hydro is going to shine once they revisit Freeze.
            Forward melt can incorporate freeze as that still triggers melts, so I don't think it will be left out entirely (unless we just get Tulpa every abyss). Besides, even in a nation of hydro, cryo units besides Wriothesley are not faring too well so it might be another year of freeze struggles.
    They probably won't be buffing vape but more of the underutilized reactions like melt, overload, burning, and burgeon. 
That means that hydro will only be enhanced in utility for burgeon which, while it buffs hydro, may not buff Neuvillette if it's basically a pyro Alhaitham of burgeon.
Eww then I need to use Bennett & XL one side (hyperbloom should still work with hydro immunes) and I hate circle impact and even with high ER my XL always falls short. Or maybe the Natlan archon is like Bennett but without a circle.
Ah, makes sense.. I just pushed through with Xiao and didn't even consider that I needed something else XD
    Navia is also a claymore character, meaning even her physical Attacks deal blunt dmg (the thing you need against the shield)
        Well, yeah.. The question wasn't about navia tho, just about Geo in general
Ah, I see
I pulled her for Navia amd skipped Xiao. Even my kind exists lmao.
TYSM, im saving for Zhongli and i already have like 60 pulls.
    Great, he's a fantastic comfort character. He'll work great with Neuvillette as well
What manner of sea creature is this?

I swear high constellation Genshin is practically another game.
why are people always spamming the menu
    To pick up particles, I'm pretty sure. It pauses the timer but those still move. If not that, then I dunno.
        My favorite was this one video of an abyss speedrunner who was menu'ing after every action to collect particles, the actual video was like 3 minutes long or something but in-game it was like 15 seconds or something 💀
            it might have been against maguu kenki, you can skip his stalling invulnerable phase by constantly booking/opening the map every millisecond
            You mean something like this https://youtu.be/cxnvuTNyy3c?si=irH_l84ZGS9ZygLy ?
                LOL yeah that was the video I was thinking of
    To pick up energy particles and reset character switching cooldown (I think)
    Menus Freeze time for everything except particles
Hi, I'm Old and Dumb, so could someone please explain something to me:

* C6R5 characters are, according to Google, 1-1.2k$ on average, they have both Furina and Yelan C6R5
* Xianyun is C2R5, so I assume 600-700$ at least?

So that's what, 2.5-3k usd on average, which is fine, I'm not here to police what people spend their money on, and it's not like it's that absurd of a sum all things considered (depending on where you live in the world).

However, my question is this: why, in the name of all holy fucks in the world, would they then be playing the game on a phone??????????????
Did I....do this by accident?

I technically had Zhongli so probably not I suppose.

Definitely just used Hu Tao / Zhongli / Xingqiu / Yelan though and just smashed Hu Tao vape plunge attacks into it until it died.
What does redhorn have to do with crystalize
    Defense reduces damage taken which also applies to shields. A Noelle using Layla’s shield for example can tank more hits with it compared to a different chara
        Ohhh yeah true
You are breaking it with overload.
That team SHREDS. Zhongli shield bot + Petra = chef kiss
Thats not true hutao popular team is still with zhongli,its not with furina since she is generally on the other side and that she still has enormous damage without her
I couldve lived without knowing about his existence, btw
Hey its me! HAHAHA
    I'm wish i could get on your lvl one day... Abyss skill, I mean. Not the username lol
That username definitely rings the bell lmao
Oh I see
One more thing, Xianyun has a long burst so if you have to rotate more than once what I sometimes do is just Q on her, no E, then I do her E and catch particles after Diluc is done.  Cause the E is gonna swirl pyro away, not the Q, so you lose a second or two of VV 💀
    my goat, ty
i play diluc - xingqui - xiangling - zhongli and it's rather comfortable. depending on the enemies ill throw nahida in there instead
don't have furina and xinqui and no Benny🥲
    Play with kaeya and whoever you have you seem like new player
        bro literally just got neuvelite 😱
            Neat, build around him, he is incredibly good
They could buff vape.

But they could also make an abyss with nothing but hydro heralds, spectres, mimics, slimes, eidolons, tulpa and the cube.

Imagine the only vape DPS they release in 5.x is a main dps so Neuv and Childe don't get benefits AND a mechanic that doesn't work with Furina. Like maybe, idk Bond of Life or something, ya know? /j

Realistically, yes, I do agree, hydro being a core reaction element will just remain the best. XQ had been strong and relevant since forever.
    If they focused on a vape DPS, that’s only going to make the Hydro supports shine even more. 

The only way to make hydro not broken is to force restrictions against it. Which we already see with Chevreuse (by not including Hydro), Lyney (by making him focus on Mono), and now with Arle (by making BOL anti-synergistic with Furina).

Adding hydro immune enemies is just a direct attack against Hydro.

But anyway, the point is, I agree, Hydro is such a core reaction element that the only way to not make it broken is to not include it (by forcing restrictions against it) in the buffs that the other elements get.
Not necessarily. Lyney teams and Chevreuse teams can now nearly match the clear speeds of normal vape teams (I'm not saying that they beat Hu Tao and Childe, just that they aren't far behind them).   

We just need to have a little more variety in the type of pyro and cryo units launched to allow for different team styles.   

Also, the addition of good pyro and cryo off fielders will open up new possibilities for team compositions. For example, I tried out a burning team which I had decent success with. It turns out that the best pyro I could use for the job was.... Bennet, whose attack buff doesn't matter much for the team, and his healing is lacking as it caps to 70%. The best pyro applicator in that team was Kazuha.
