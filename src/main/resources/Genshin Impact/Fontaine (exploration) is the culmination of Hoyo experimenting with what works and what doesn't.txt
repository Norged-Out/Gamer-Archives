[[Fontaine (exploration) is the culmination of Hoyo experimenting with what works and what doesn't]]


After making an alt account and re-exploring some older areas, it really stuck out to me how Fontaine improved upon the mistakes of prior regions, especially Inazuma and Sumeru. Here's all the issues I noticed they fixed in Fontaine:

- Exploration is no longer gatekept behind gadgets, or in the case of Inazuma, the Electrogranum level. Sumeru had a running gag of locking large portions of exploration behind a gadget that was obtained and upgraded through massive world quests. Inazuma similarly locked some chests behind the Electrogranum level, forcing you to backtrack to get these chests once you have reached the sufficient level. This was entirely done away with in Fontaine: Exploration is fully available without constantly impeding player progression through these arbitrary "features". This makes exploration non-linear again and avoids forcing the player into an overly lengthy, mandatory world quest.

- On the note of world quests, it felt to me like the general length was reduced, in favor of having multiple, inter-connected major world quests instead. The initial Fontaine release had 3 separate major world quests with that diver guy, Mamere and Ann the Oceanid, with this tend continuing into 4.2. These quests also end up being connected in some way, which is a better way of executing the overarching story of a region without overwhelming the player (hi, aranyaka).

- No timegates: This was largely present in Inazuma where some quests or even exploration (hi Tsurumi) was timegated and could only be progressed daily. Fontaine has no such timegating on exploration: Everything is available from day 1.

- No RNG commission quests: Self-explanatory. It took 3 years but they finally figured these were a horrible idea.

- Less excessive number of enemies. This was Sumeru's biggest mistake: The enemy density was simply too fucking high and most of these didn't even guard any treasure: It isn't an exaggeration to say you can't take two steps in Sumeru without the game spawning a trio of fungi or Eremites in your face. To put into perspective how absurd Sumeru's enemy density is, there are over 1000 fungi and 700 Eremites in Sumeru alone. Meanwhile, the *entire* Teyvat map contains 900~ hilichurls and 800~ slimes. There are as many Eremite and Fungi spawns in Sumeru alone as there are hilichurl and slime spawns in the entire game map. Needless to say, it *does* get tiring when you can't walk 5 meters without encountering a horde of enemies everywhere in Sumeru. Fontaine enemy density is far more balanced and well spread out, preventing it from getting overwhelming or aggravating.

- Less braindead puzzles. They seem to have found a sweetspot between Inazuma's more difficult puzzles vs. Sumeru's absolute joke ones. Additionally, they have chosen to reduce the number of chests, increasing the overall quality of chests instead. Exquisite chests or above are far more common in Fontaine than prior regions. This is helpful for less hardcore players who don't have as much time to explore, as you get more or less the same rewards for less effort. It is also just more satisfying to get higher quality chests over fighting 3 Lawachurls and a Constipated Beast for a common chest.

I believe these (and more) may be some of the reasons as to why Fontaine exploration has felt more enjoyable than prior regions. Hoyo seems to have weeded out some experimental ideas that haven't turned out so well (Such as railroading exploration with gadgets / world quests), and returned to the more open ended and free exploration that was available in Liyue and Mondstadt. It feels a lot less gimmicky or annoying to explore Fontaine which I believe contributed to making it more fun.


Mondstadt had elemental monuments of various types as an introduction to puzzles utilising elements. They were all typically elements given to you from the starter team: Cryo (Kaeya), Electro (Lisa), Anemo (A-Traveler), and Pyro (Amber).

But in Liyue a lot of puzzles required Geo and/or Anemo; a surprising amount of windmills and Anemo totems. We have one Geo freebie in Noelle who doesn't produce Constructs, which are required for heavy pressure plate puzzles which is something Geo Traveler can solve. If you didn't have another Construct-producing Geo or Anemo character by the time you got to Liyue, you had to go back to Mondstadt to swap back to Anemo Traveler, and back to Geo again in order to solve the related puzzles. This was tedious back in the day and was a known problem that they addressed with Inazuma; most elemental monuments required Electro so could be solved with just Electro Traveler or even Lisa, and making puzzles no longer an element check and more about using other mechanics.

Of course, we now have the freebie Lynette who is not only Anemo but also has the Ousia Arkhe to compliment Hydro Traveler's Pneuma Arkhe for Fontaine-related puzzles. Took three years to get a non-Traveler freebie Anemo character, lol.
    [deleted]
        It's just a neat little "I brought Lynette so I don't have to climb that huge tree to get it, lucky me!", and I appreciate it both when I do bring both Arkhes and get that relief, and when I want to play a specific team and don't have to switch it up all the time.
            There's you and there's my sister who dispite having Lyney in her team chose to grab the orb instead because, "I didn't want to cheat"
                I did the same but that’s cause I completely forgot Lyney/Lynette could do that
                Honestly same though, lol. I like seeing where the devs hide the Arkhe orbs in relation to their objectives so I always go for them, despite running around with a team of Traveler + the Fatui siblings. It's worked very well thus far, aside from a single seelie puzzle in one of the big floating water cubes. For the life of me I couldn't find the orb so I resorted to cheating--just once. :(
                Boy Wanderer in Fontaine is so good, need to fly over this canyon? Check.
Need to fly over this lake? Check
Need to fly up this mountain? Check
Need to get this thing for puzzle? Check
        Today i learned i could use characters for those puzzles and not hunt those orbs..
        How much I hate it when I have to change the character for one puzzle and then a few meters away again.
    IIRC Barron Bunny worked in these puzzles.
        To an extent, yes.

But there are two sizes of pressure plate, a smaller one and a larger one. Baron Bunny was insufficient for the large ones, would only light up the inner ring. You could stand on them but to the best of my memory some also deactivated when not held down, so *needed* a Geo Construct.

Edit: Slight wording change, I was tired.
            You could trigger the large plates by having both baron bunny and the active character stand on them, but you are correct in that it wouldn't matter for the ones which required constant pressure.
            Amber's C4 hype
                I have amber c3 after 3 years 🥲
                    Yall have cons on your Amber..?
            I've been dripping baron bunny AND then also stepping on the pressure plate and it works so I never though about using geo constructs 😐
            You can solve them with Klee, each bomb from her E counts as a full character so you just need to push two onto the center of the big ones and it still works, while also not requiring you to stand on it so timed ones can still be completed as well (though you have to spend time pushing them around and they're shorter duration than a typical geo construct so you kinda have to hustle).

It's not really a *good* way to solve them lol, it's just a fun little exploration hack
    > but also has the Ousia Arkhe to compliment Hydro Traveler's Pneuma Arkhe for Fontaine-related puzzles.

Which you don't even need because the puzzles can all be solved by finding the appropriate ousia and pneuma sources near the puzzle.  The characters just mean you can solve the puzzle even faster.
        Honestly makes me wonder how they'll handle Furina underwater. Like would she be stuck in whatever alignment you had before diving or would she be able to swap underwater?
            Give her both types on her attack ? Not like it'd matter a lot
        Getting Furina means I can get it it done without even changing teams.
    I think the solution to this and also just a dope addition all around would be to give the Traveler the ability to swap elements on the fly. This would be great for puzzles, would make the Traveler (who a ton of players consider to be a horrible unit) actually useful even for combat, and would just be a ton of fun (imagine having a character that can switch elements and abilities on the fly).

C’mon, Hoyo. It’s time. Give the Traveler an element wheel.
        [deleted]
            Well, the maps pins are coming. Not sure if it’s for 4.2, but they said they will be adding more (I think it’s going up to 200?). But I didn’t know you can do that in HSR. That’s pretty cool and also a good thing because I’ve noticed that Genshin has been adding somethings from HSR into Genshin like the option to complete dailies by just doing random stuff instead of the actual dailies themselves. Hopefully, they add the switching elements on the fly into Genshin.
                IIRC Traveler has been shown in a few cutscenes to switch elements on the fly. My theory is that once all seven nations are fully accessible we'll be able to unlock it via the extra -oculus of each region after fully upgrading that region's statue to 10.
        I still wish each element of Traveler counted as a separate character in the party select that just shared a health bar. Traveler's never gonna get a new ability to switch elements on the fly in combat, but if it cost a party slot to do so then it would be just like making any other team.
    I just assumed the weird circle things in Liyue didn't do anything. I forget that constructs exist in this game.
        So did Mihoyo 💀
        I remembered that they came in pairs or occasionally triplets, and that you could activate them by stepping on them, so I assumed they were coop puzzles.
        There are also a couple places where there are rock formations that are obviously missing a rock. Dropping a construct into position spawns a chest.
            what where, I remember exploding some rocks but not slotting a rock into place
    I actually didn't know traveller was pneuma until you said so. Was struggling with puzzle I was basically hold myself back from exploring Fontaine
        99% of the puzzles have pneuma or osia blocks right next to the puzzle somewhere. So you can solve all of it without needing to swap characters. 

Only a very small amount of puzzles, less than like 5, might require you to look around more for the penuma or osira blocks.
    Honestly the whole Liyue anemo/geo traveller conundrum could all be solved if we could change elements without the statue 💀 ofc we would still have to resonate with the statue to obtain the element but it would make it so much easier if we could switch the traveller’s element without the statue :’)
    Was Sucrose ever given away in an event? I vaguely remember getting one of her Constellations like that, though I could be wrong...
        Events are irrelevant because if you started playing after the event and you need a character from an event, you’re screwed.

I started playing at the end of 1.2 and every guide for Razor I saw said to use Fischl since everybody got her for free from an event. Well, the event had already ended when I started playing and it wasn’t until 2.2 that I got her.

That being said, I don’t think Sucrose was ever given away, since 1.1 was Fischl and we got Missive Windspear for the last Mondstadt event. We also got Cinnabar for Shadows Amidst Snowstorms and I don’t think Sucrose has played a major role in any events where we got a 4*.

We did get a free Faruzan so maybe you’re thinking of her
        Afaik they haven't given out Mondstadt characters that you could choose, that happened wice with Liyue though (iirc).
    We also got Faruzan from the 3.5 event if you count that
        Might not count since newer players can't get it
        Lynette is permanently free
    They've also seriously toned back the elemental totem "puzzles" in Fontaine. I'm not sure if any of them even require bringing the right element on your team as there's virtually always some sort of natural element you can use to solve the puzzle.

Imo, the elemental totem spam was another reason why Sumeru exploration sucked. There are a ton of totem (or similar) puzzles where you absolutely *must* have an exact party of at least three specific elements. Especially in the desert, if you aren't running around with a Dendro/Electro/Pyro comp then you're going to be swapping characters constantly. (And how many decent teams even use Dendro/Electro/Pyro all at once?) Plus, Fungi drops are based on what element you use to kill them, so you quickly just run into team comp issues no matter what you try to do in Sumeru. This results in lots of character swapping, which is just slow and frustrating.

Fontaine is way more flexible and lets you do pretty much whatever you want with your team compositions.
Legit. It is by far the only region I have gone out of my way to 100%. It's just fun to explore Fontaine. 

Plus the daily encounter system made it even better. I just explore and do daily simultaneously.

Those surveys were not wasted.
    And swimming is just so fun! And you don't have to climb anything, you can just dive and explore. No stamina problems because you can run through those schools of fish that restore diving stamina
        They really nailed the swimming control, which is weird because it's largely based on Sorush control and Sorush felt rigid as fuck.
            "Sorush flew so we could swim" as the proverb says.
            Sorush felt bad because she didn't use camera controls.

Swimming works based on your camera direction so it feels WAY smoother.
        i was legit so worried they'll make swimming like that drone control from sumeru where you need to press a button to go up or down. 

first thing I checked in fontaine and was overjoyed that swimming is completely organic. this is the only game ive played where swimming actually feels like swimming and not just reskinned flying
        Swimming in fontaine is like playing a remake of a ps1 or ps2 games I never played and feel that the control is good.

Or just GTA SA pilot school, played on PC
    Today I tested it and it took me 8 chests/challenges in total to do my dailies :D It's such a great feature.
        I have finally been doing story quests. Doing just 1 part is considered big enough to count as all 4 commissions.
        i'm using it to catch up on worldquests in other regions like inazuma, i'm halfway to getting my teapot style for inazuma and the daily amount of activities is perfect for me where i play for a good amount of time and am left wanting more for tomorrow

my burnout evaporated into nothing after this feature came out lolll, genshin went from daily chore simulator back to a chillaxing exploration story game. at the pace i'm going it'll take me around 2 and a half years just to clear the existing zones not including fontaine, aka i'll literally never run out of stuff for encounter points
    No joke on the daily encounter system! I dislike the ones where I have to fight things, so being able to open chests, collect oculi and do events in exchange for daily commissions is grand! 

It even gave me a reason to go back to Dragonspine and finish up there. I’ve made more progress on my frostbearing tree in the past week or two than I have since it came out.
    As someone who has done dailies nearly every day for around 3 years, since week one of Genshin, I love the daily encounter system. Quests and events also count, and it gives me a chance to catch up on a lot of content that I'm behind on, as someone who logs in for a small amount of time each day.
    I know! I can also just run around and 100% pretty easily. Everything is super fun and the underground areas are for once not very claustrophobic and same-y (talking to you Sumeru desert).
        i like the sumeru desert underground for the same reason you hate it lol
    bruuh daily encounter hting is the best thing they ever put in genshin deadass. 

so good, I'm actually playing the game again after it, as in I'm no longer just nuking commissions and dumping resin and logging out, i'm actually going out into the world to do shit and have been the past 2 months since this came out.
Yeah, except for that hydro ball travel function where you can't cancel and jump mid way unlike the ones in Enkanomiya or the doors in Inazuma.
    What if you're pressing F to pick up the loots, but Hydro ball says yeet to the other side of the beach.
        "Reality? Is pain."
        There's one in the middle of that boiling lake that got me and it goes *far* away lol
    I have a theory that they specifically do not let you cancel because you can use those hydro balls to transition between regular and underwater controls and exiting ball form midway probably resulted in bugs during testing.
    Honestly still baffled they didnt just copy how Enkanomiya's electro teleportations worked, and instead made it completely unable to cancel. Like why?
    I lost a few chest rewards due to the bad placement of these things
        I remember there was one day when I happened to get two different chests that spawned a hydro ball travel ring thingy when opened. The first one automatically deposited its contents into inventory, like some of the ones positioned right next to cliffs. The other one spilled its contents as objects, and my next button press activated the ring that had just spawned and dumped me two zipcodes away.
            Was it the one on the tiny island with the Hilichurl Rogue on it
                That one got me as well. But there's at least one more.
        Really? In my experience the chest rewards still stay where it spawned for a long time so you can actually go back and pick it up.
    The amount of times I have opened a chest and a fucking water teleporter appears and whisks me to the other side of the FUCKING universe while I'm trying to pick up loot has only happened twice but it's TEN THOUSAND times too many.
>No RNG commission quests: Self-explanatory. It took 3 years but they finally figured these were a horrible idea.

This was the worst. I finally completed Garcia's quest after more than a year of only doing Sumeru commissions with a few weeks of Fontaine on release. And the Gourmet Supremos progression being locked behind one of the Inazuma coms, but only if you did it after a certain patch. 

I'm fine with there being achievements, though Sumeru still had so many layers to many of those which was annoying. Having quests locked commissions that are both RNG and require getting it 10+ times while sometimes giving you previous steps is just bad design.
    Bro, I’m still in Inazuma trying to get the detective quest.
        there were so many in inazuma... fucking novel, cooking party, the combat guy by the beach etc
        I have still not completed gone in the wind from monstadt and that pirate commission from liyue...
        I'm still in Inazuma trying to get the Gourmet Achievement for that one Sumeru World Quest
    I haven't completed Anna from Mondstadt commissions and the one with Snezhnaya achievements (Never get these questlines) and it's been 3 years.
    They updated the commission system a few updates back to make it easier to complete storylines and have it be less rng based when and if they show up. There's guides on hoyolab and articles you can find that explain better, but the tldr is that it now works as a pool of all possible quests and it picks one npc commission per day for you to complete. Once completed it is removed from the pool. If you're missing achievements from commissions in past areas and you actively want to get them I would recommend looking it up.
        I've gotten Yurgan's "water the flower" quest like 20 times since finishing the line and killing the whopperflower for the achievement. 

It just randomly pulling 1 of the many NPC based comms in a region doesn't help much when there are so many. I still need to answer 6 questions for the one guy in Sumeru cause it keeps giving the same questions. I haven't gotten Doctor's Orders since giving the first patient the extra part. It still hasn't given me the last step of Farghani's measurement comms. I was on the last stage of Garcia's comm chain and then got the first stage twice instead of being able to finish it.

I'm very aware that it pulls one NPC comm per day, but it is so bloated with random shit that it might as well be fully RNG. It took a whole year to do Garcia's line. There are still people trying to do the Tales of Winter achievement that's been in since 1.0. This system is not good!
            > I still need to answer 6 questions for the one guy in Sumeru cause it keeps giving the same questions.

You can cheat here. Just answer 2 questions and then sever your connection to the internet.

Once you log in again the commission will start again from question 1 and the questions will be freshly randomized.

Rinse and repeat until you answered all six questions and only then answer a third to finish the commission.
            The big thing is commission rerolling tho, that's where the system has improved. They've also increased the number of 'rare' commissions in each cycle so people can finish the Glory achievement in around  a month now.
                WDYM commission rerolling?
                    Think of commission cycles as the list [A B C D...], with each letter corresponding to a certain NPC commission. Currently, when daily commissions are given, there is a chance for one commission from this list to be given at random. Obviously, the pool of commissions is larger in game and also houses multiple of the same commission ([A A A B B C D D E..], for example) which is why some commissions come up more than others, but to explain the concepts of commission cycles and rerolling let's just consider a list of 3 commissions [A B C]. 

When a commission is completed, it is removed from the list. So if you complete commission C, then the list now looks like [A B]. The next time daily commissions are given, you can only receive commissions A or B. You won't see commission C again until the list is *completely* emptied out upon which it refills and the cycle begins anew. This is the logic behind commission cycles.

Now, what if commission A has multiple outcomes needed for an achievement? (We will call these outcomes A-1, A-2, A-3.) When commission A is given, the outcome chosen is randomized. Say you need A-2, but have been given A-1. Completing A-1 will remove commission A from the list, but if you *don't* complete it at all, then commission A will return to the list and you will have another chance to get A-2. 

This is commission rerolling. By neglecting to finish specific commissions, eventually your list of NPC commissions will be reduced to just [A] and you can consistently 'reroll' it until you get the outcome you want without having to sit and suffer through the entire list again.

Before, we had to go to other people's worlds to do dailies to skip but with the encounter points system we can now skip in single-player, making this system much more relevant now.
                        That only works if the player has access to things that give encounter points. If they've fully explored and done all quests, then they either miss out on daily rewards or just have to hope they get the right step each time.

I also just had a set of comms that was No honour among thieves, Impregnable defense, Touring light show, and Hammer of the mushrooms. So the guaranteed NPC comm per day doesn't even work right.
                            * Yeah, you need encounter points, but for 90% of each patch you have events. By not immediately collecting rewards, you can 'save' them and use them at a later date. Encounter points are awarded when the rewards are claimed, not when the challenge is completed. Same goes for chests. If you care about getting the achievements you can complete a few chests, leave them unclaimed, and mark them on the map for future encounter points.

* NPC commissions are NOT guaranteed every day. As I said, "there is a chance for" an NPC commission to be given each day.
        I think that's what 'No RNG commission quests' is referring to - you can get all the Fontaine quest achievements in one cycle and there aren't branching variations, rather than Sumeru's waiting for the right version of the quest to turn up, sometimes having to progress the quest to discover which instead of being able to skip it and get a different version within the same cycle. Cycles themselves came in with Sumeru, this is how the cycle system and commissions interact in Fontaine.
            Pretty sure Fontaine has a comm where you need 3 diff versions
                Yeah I have isadora quest more than 5 times now without facing livre once.
                You can get the Their Childhood chain, Aesthetic Critique chain, and the Get a Drink At Least! chain achievements in the one cycle because all the quests appear in the one cycle. The only way you can miss Get a Drink at Least and What is the Meaning of Work is if you don't know the correct answers to proceed the chain or add the alternate version.

It is not like Sumeru where you don't know which version you get until you have proceeded the quest beyond being able to park it if it's not the one you need, or you can go several cycles without getting the version you need for the achievement, such as with the fertilizer quest and the fortune quest.
    I got that one Inazuma commission on the first day after patch, still no Gourmet Supremos. Now I thought maybe if I do it again it will be easier. Now the commissiion just refuses to pop up ...
I just appreciate how much effort they put into underwater exploration. They said in the live stream they struggled a lot, well the struggle was worth it underwater is so much fun 

The zip lines in Sumeru were amazing when they were implemented and made exploration a lot of fun. But the novelty wore off pretty quick for me. Underwater exploration though? Still not over it, all the speed and stamina boost you get make it feel so immersive and fun
    Yeah, underwater seriously feels like a dream. It's just so natural, it feels like flight. Only gripe is the low vertical camera speed on PlayStation (it's 4 times slower than horizontal camera and both horizontal/vertical aiming speeds at max sensitivity when using a controller) and some stiffness in controls when it comes to up/down movement, but these are easily the best swimming controls I've seen in a 3d video game.
        Hey, just wanted to say if your on pc you could use Raw Accel to modify your x/y ratio of your mouse to a ratio of 2.95 and it would cause vertical and horizontal movement to match up in game
            Oh, I meant to specify on console/using a controller! I edited my original comment. Yeah, it's fine on PC, no issues there with K+M.

Are you saying it's the same way with a mouse, though? I've never noticed if so. EDIT: Just checked and there's no speed/accel difference on PC. I think it's just an issue with controllers. I need to make a video on the subject, it's a huge difference.
                Played on PlayStation since launch (PS4 then PS5) and *hate* how slow the vertical camera is.

Also, the button layouts constantly changing is infuriating. I noticed in Spiral Abyss today that the "Check Enemies" button changes between floors. Wtf?
                    > the "Check Enemies" button changes between floors

This absolutely should cost the jobs of the programming leads/project managers. It doesn’t spark confidence at all if those kind of stuff get missed in the appraisal or testing phase.
        Yea the different x and y axis sensitivity on controller drives me insane. I thought we were finally save when they introduced separate sliders in the options, but at max on both it's just what the game usually is :(
        Subnautica says hello.

Both controls and feels are almost identical on PC.
    The underwater content feels refreshing. Different, and well-thought though simple combat mechanic. I’m glad they didn’t just lazingly copy and paste the existing combat system. Also in my opinion way better than the dreaded Sumeru’s desert exploration.
        I usually hate underwater areas of games but holy shit, is their underwater mechanisms/feel/aesthetic/control really blowing every other game out of the water (pun intended, lol)
            Genshin Impact is the only game I have ever played by to add underwater mechanics years after the game initially launched and actually be better for it. 

Looking at you FFXIV and Planetside 2
                And World of Warcraft. That one underwater zone from Cataclysm is legendary for how much hate it gets.
                    Unless you play Druid and enjoy moving FAST. The swimming speed buff you get there stacks multiplicatively with the speed buff from aquatic form, so you end up zooming around way faster than flying speed.
                ffxiv underwater is deadass just their shitty flying but under water with the bare minimum of animation changes even. 

so bad.
            Despite this, there are voices among the community which complain that elemental reactions are not utilized underwater 

I.e Kaeya freezing opponents under water using Elemental Burst.

How Hoyo has dropped the ball on perfecting Elemental Reaction so badly they need to introduce the light and dark energy in Fontaine and it's all a case of failure in game design and planning as it reduce the need to roll for new character. (Why would I roll if everyone's the same underwater)

The shifting of HP mechanics (Neavilette, Lyney, Lynette) is also called the outcome of Hoyo not smart enough to design better Elemental Reaction and had to resort to introduction of gimmicks, which will make artifact farming even more tedious because these character require different set, and Hoyo will bleed players as well as losing potential new players because the game is becoming more and more "new player unfriendly"

Some people are impossible to please.
                See, this makes me sad because that's a seperate feature from the underwater mechanics. Like, the focus should be on controls, colors, atmosphere, deco, landscaping, etc.

Because I have similar complaints too, but I see it as having nothing to do with discussing their underwater mechanics because it's only something that has to do with combat, not navigating and experiencing
    The ziplines made sense in the jungle but in the desert I felt like they were a very poor substitute for the lack of a Horse
        > lack of a Horse

I really hope mounts get implemented at some point. It'd give the game yet another refreshing feeling.
            I always thought sayu/yelan/wanderer serve as a form of mount (aka fast traversal), just not packaged in a way we expect.
                >yelan mount

😏

>sayu mount

🤨📸
            They could, but it'd have to be region locked yet again since the map was clearly designed with running in mind. 

Tower of Fantasy demonstrated the pitfall of designing the map around mounts and other quick traversal mechanics, being that it makes the map super empty and boring in opposition to genshin's current dense and controlled exploration design.

But Mihoyo's team could still probably pull it off as they did with underwater, so we'll probably see the explore the idea later.
                This is why WoW sucked when they introduced mounts apparently.
                    every mmo world zones goes to shit the moment flying gets introduced. 

wow, ffxiv both demonstrate this and they're the two most popular mmos

aion is based for actually making flying a gameplay mechanic and not just a faster sprint
            A dune buggy, or balloon that spawns at waverider points.
                gimme the horse, i hope after wave rider we no longer get a generic vehicle where your char disappears into. i know its easier to do but its not immersive
            PLS no. Whenever a generalist movement option gets introduced in a game, any future content is made with said movement option in mind.

If they give you a mount, exploration without a mount will be unbearable in all subsequent zones.

The perfect example is ToF. People praise all the movement gadgets and mounts, but the game is literally unplayable without them.

Honestly I thank whatever hoyo high execs for making sumeru zoom points sumeru-exclusive.
                I think a desert only horse would be great but like you said, not smth that's available outside. 

It's also mihoyo where they're insanely careful with any new major potentially game changing mechanic so even if they unlock the horse I think they could do a good job with it. 

free flying though, unless it's like aion, then yeah, that's a hard no from me coz ive seen zero mmos survive having flying added
            they're literally sitting on a cash cow I hope they add it sometime in the future too
            fr, i was anti mounts, but i think the way they designed the desert, a mount is the missing piece to make it an enjoyable experience, and not some goofy ahhh lookin horse like the clownshoe boat, just gimme an actual horse that looks like a horse lol
            Imagine we can rent sumpter beasts in the desert area—they can code the mount to only be able to walk within the desert regions if they have to
    While the trade-off was worth it, it is a shame how desynced the diving animation is from the dive movement. With wimming, sprinting, climbing etc. the movement was synced with the animation for all characters, it looks great compared to other gamea. For diving, they made them all have the same movement so larger characters look like they go too slow while smaller characters look like they go too fast.
    The combat underwater is what falling apart. It is boring & monochrome.

Sure I know creating 70 characters + 70 kind of diff atks/kits to work underwater is massive work. But They could have at least make underwater fight limited to 7 element. 7 kind of attacks that tied to the character vision type is not that much diff than now. At least if I want to switch atks, I just swap my character out base on his element. That at least much better than me swimming across half of the map to find that animal to re-tag the skill I just loss.  ughh

And then I hate how we forgot our skill when reach surface, then we need to find the animal to regain back again. (this could mean halfway across the map) Why they wanna make a clunky system like that?
        Halfway across the map? What are you talking about? Every area has a shit ton of animals to get skills from, especially near teleports. You can even teleport to one area, get a skill you want, then teleport to another area, and use said skill like from the new area Jellyfish. 

Every puzzle has the animal you need near it too.

Swimming half the map? You're part of the 1%
        Yeah I  love the underwater environment, but I really don't like the underwater combat either. It's way too simplistic and boring. I don't expect them to translate the above ground combat to underwater because that would be very hard, but I do wish it was a *little* bit more complex than: get animal ability, use on object/enemy, get reward. 

But I guess MHY is just trying to appeal to as many people as they can so it's to be expected.
        Meh i disagree I have no issues with the underwater combat. It isn’t groundbreaking or anything but it does what it needs to do
        Seems to be an unpopular opinion here, but the underwater parts of Fontaine are the absolute worst parts of the game.

The combat is braindead and dull, everything is very slow and unresponsive, and once you complete a couple of puzzles, you realize it's just a screensaver you're swimming through.
    genshin has the best swimming in any game ive played hands down. the animations, the speed, sound, the way the character is physically going through a material that has friction on their bodies and the way you control direction. i was insanely surprised to see so many different animation states and the chars actually rotating in the water depending on his tight youre turning and everything, its a genuine swimming exp

its all perfect. basically every mmo should look at how genshin does swimming because the swimming is gameplay itself whereas in those games mobility modes are just a generic way to go from point a to b

at first i was disappointed that they didn't add breath meter coz i thought it was anotehr sumeru desert thing where you go to the desert and theres zero sense of danger that a desert's environment should present like overheating and overcooling. but the moment i jumped in i understood swimming is goated

now give me fontaine chasm aka just a bottomless dark abyss underwater with scary sea monsters in it.
    I thought that every region would need ziplines to be fun but now I can't wait to see what Natlan's gimmick will be.
I also love the mini "quests" which focus on exploration and are triggered only if you venture into those areas. The hot steamy pond, the underwater boss (the tumor thingy), the mysterious ores, and so many more examples. They feel really rewarding and aren't locked behind quests.
    and local legends! which aren't really quests, but they're a fun challenge you can just stumble upon. i really hope they retroactively add them to old regions.
        I do really appreciate the local legends, just... would it have hurt anything to have them drop, like, 10 times the usual amount of materials or something? Maybe one or two purple artifacts, as a treat? I get that the difficulty is the point, and it is fun, just why not, right?

Also it's hilarious that one of the local legends is a Fatui operative who could probably wipe the floor with Childe, lol
            Right? They give the same XP as regular enemies, not even the elite enemies, but take more time because of their inflated HP. That should come with commensurate drops/XP.
            It's the eternal Hoyo dilemma.

Make difficult content rewarding (Especially difficult content in the overworld, which is expected to be very easy), then you have casuals complaining that they are being locked out of rewards because they can't clear it.

Make it unrewarding, then players who can clear it complain why there are no rewards.

It's the unfortunate side effect of having such a diverse playerbase.
            > Also it's hilarious that one of the local legends is a Fatui operative who could probably wipe the floor with Childe

I could solo her with Childe if I cared to.
            would’ve been nice if they dropped a chest too, but i understand why they don’t, would’ve been unfair to low ar players
                Isn't that what world level is for?
                    the world does scale, but low ar players have more difficulty killing ruin graders in their world than ar60 players
            Wait, which legend is a Fatui?
                Yseut - in the Liffey Region, west of the Statue of Seven.
        "ho ho! Look at this dumbass Fatui all by itself. I'm about to whoop its ass"

Famous last words
        The double mamtaray properly messed me up when I was too mesmerized to get the hydroculis. At least I got an achievement for it.
        They are a fun challenge  
\>hyperbloom
"the enemy density was too fucking high" sent me to the stratosphere, and I found seven fungi there
    Worse than that was the fact fungi dropped the wrong materials if you used certain elements on them. And the other materials you didn't want were barely used anyways so it was like...WHY EVEN HAVE THIS DUMB MECHANIC
        this part was mostly fine


it plays into how dendro interacts with other elements and adds a layer to farming, I did not mind it at all since it's mega rare to need all the types of mats at the same time.
            >this part was mostly fine

It's only fine when your mains aren't Klee and Fischl.

Seriously, most of my overworld-friendly characters are either pyro or electro. Everything else requires either a burst or an electro interaction to either do damage or have adequate damage projection. Doing a full party burst just to kill 3 shrooms is pain.
                maybe it's because my account is really old, I don't really have that kind of problem.


or hadnt since Liyue I think.
                    Nah, I play since 1.0. It's not about account age, more about character preference.

Basically the only real option for me to deal real non-burst non-pyro/electro damage is cryo swirl.
                        I mean, you can always build a bloom team
        that mechanic is fine, I want more mechanics like that imo, it's rare for games these days to not feel like waterslides where you never have to activate a single neuron to "play" them. 

having to take two secs to make a team that generates the kinds of mats you want isn't remotely an issue as youre making it out to be, once or twice, okay, after the third time that's on you fam

post that image where it's like "you have 100 chars yet you choose only pyro" or smth

tl;dr: in a game that's all about options in combat and mix and matching teammates, complaining about one of six elements messing up a result is silly af
I 100% all my regions. Fontaine was 100%’d faster than any other region and it felt way more fluid than previous areas. It didn’t feel like a grind at all.

And don’t get me started on the improved world quests. I absolutely do not miss the amount of stuff I had to do in Aranyaka just to unlock several regions of the map and a lot of puzzles in the overworld.
    >and it felt way more fluid than previous areas.

hah
        It's 100% true though
            He is probably laughing at the "fluid" pun
        *rimshot*
    Full Map 100%er here, too.

And I *hated* 100%ing Liyue. In my opinion, it had the tightest restrictions and is the only place that required the sigils (they were hidden in the sides of mountains and stuff). Ugh...
        Same liyue and mondstat have horrible world design for exploration (or atleast you can tell they lacked experience).

They really started improving quality of exploration in sumeru (but fucked up by not having underground map / locking half the map behind quests)
            Eeeh, I actually like Mond and Liyue. 

I like that many Mond puzzles are written into environment. It's some old ruins, churl camps, abyss mage mesas, chests hidden in bushes, some points that look off (like anemo slimes orbiting trees, suspiciously placed items e.t.c.). It's not like the new trend of treasure chests just sitting in the middle of an open field.

And I like Liyue level design. Specifically Jueyun Karst. It seems like climbing nightmare at the first glance, but there's a track that leads to the top taking you through all the puzzles and points of interests, and then you can explore by gliding around from the top.
        I have 95%+ in every location in the game, probably about 2/3 of them 100%, been playing since 2.0, got all chests/oculi etc. required for the achievements at least, and I'm still somehow missing 5 time trials in Liyue and I have no fucking clue where they are.
            > and I'm still somehow missing 5 time trials in Liyue and I have no fucking clue where they are.

Try the interactive map at that point.
            Yea it bugs me that "100%" doesn't actually mean 100%.
        The sigils on the side of mountains don't give exploration % though
    Tbh I've felt like all the regions have been pretty easy to 100% since Mondstadt and Liyue. If you just walk everywhere in the region you usually end up with 100%, as Inazuma, Enka, Chasm, Sumeru, and Fontaine don't have many chests that are just behind a wall or something, most of the chests are either puzzles which are hard to miss, or are being guarded by a horde of enemies in which case its even harder to miss. Mondstadt and Liyue were the hardest regions for me to 100% because like half the chests were just hidden somewhere without any giant red mark that says "chest here", and this is from someone who 100% every region. Like, without the treasure compass, I may have given up on Mondstadt and Liyue, but in the other regions I basically didn't use it at all.
I love Fontaine, it's becoming my second favorite region after Inazuma, so for the most part i agree with you. However, if there is one thing that i miss about Inazuma, it's that the exploration actually felt challenging. I liked how everyting in Inazuma tried to  kill you lol.
    I agree, Inazuma/Enka/Chasm was my favorite era of Genshin content, all the areas felt like you had to really watch where you were going.
There are many great things about Fontaine, but frankly, the things that were not great to me were things I identified as going backwards from what Inazuma had.

For example, those blue portals that shoot you across the distance. In Seirai Island, you could exit out of phase gates at any time, but in Fontaine you can't exit the portals. It's frustrating when you misclicked it and have to wait out the whole thing. The most noticeable incident to me was a portal directly next to a chest on Elynas near that arena thing.

I used to be very critical of Inazuma puzzles, but I actually enjoyed them aside from the cube puzzles. Many puzzles I found overly simple (most Arkhe, Jadewater fruit is just about hitting it with anything but dendro), or the main challenge is timing (some water jar puzzles or Stabilizers). Ones I thought were the right level of challenge were those puzzles where you put the ball in the ring.
    We might not be able to cancel the blue portals because they often transition from above and below water.  Someone else in this thread suggested it but it would make a lot of sense if this transition bugged out when canceled at at certain times, so they just locked it.
        yeah wasnt a big problem for me, maybe misclicked once or twice but normally ud want to ride it out til the end anyways
You're right. My biggest surprise is just how much the underwater stuff is fun, and this is coming from someone who has life long trauma of underwater levels due to having Ocarina of Time as my first videogame
    Idk dude underwater got boring so quick.
>Less excessive number of enemies.

Personally, this was never a problem, more available enemies makes grinding mats so much more pleasant when I don't have to do a complicated route to find the very few available. And hell, I build my characters to fight (albeit I am way too overpowered for overworld, but what can you do, they should to scale higher)
    But getting drops sucked ass because they were locked behind non-dps elements. Preventing players from using pyro or electro (despite being necessary for proper exploration in Sumeru) was some bullshite.
        This was a huge issue and a stupid design point. They wanted to do something different, tried it, and only found that it really limited team building.
    Yeah, exactly this sentiment. I love just roaming and cutting enemies to pieces, I have fun and passively farm at the same time
    I digress, this was one of the most annoying things about exploring Sumeru. I noticed that every objective will have a conveniently placed Fungi or Hilichurls nearby. Want to play the lyre to a gloomy path? Oops, you just aggroed that fungi nearby. 

The enemies weren't a big deal, but it becomes annoying once you experience it enough. Hyv knew what they were doing with the enemy placements
        This is probably the difference between a recent account and an old account.

For me, exploration enemies can be easily ignored with a shield and Yae Miko's turrets and Yae Miko's elemental skill has mobility so I don't even have to stop one bit.

I do appreciate more being able to farm more mats without having to join other ppl's worlds which is far more annoying imo.
            i dont think so. im an older player but i find it annoying because enemies with aggro limit you from doing things like switching your party or doing certain puzzles. because of that, i gotta stop and drop everything im doing to clear out any nearby enemies before i can even proceed with doing what i gotta. it still eats up more time than it should be imo
                Is that an issue of mob density or the fact that summer puzzles are sometimes guarded by enemies intentionally?

Anyway I don't think some small mushroms wandering around can stall more than a couple hits which is something that happens while I am still moving to the puzze itself.
                    it isn't even as though puzzles are guarded by enemies. sometimes they're just lurking nearby, you try to get by them without needing to fight and you still somehow aggro them. so you gotta kill them off first and foremost, even though they have no correlation with the puzzle you were heading toward other than just being on the way.
            >so I don't even have to stop one bit.

My FOMO is so strong that I am unable to ignore their drops. So I have to stop and pick up their crap all the time. Worst if a drop falls down a cliff and I just have to jump after it, no matter how long it delays me :(

I mean, I only have like 3k grey drops, I could desperately need the 3,001st mask and if I not pick it up now, I'll be sorry then! ;)
        The best way to get rid of an enemy is to make a friend.
    My problem with Sumeru enemies were less about the number and more about the character lockouts. All my most well-built and favorite characters and teams use electro and pyro, and to be restricted to not using those elements or the many reactions that they use specifically because it messes up the fungus drops was supremely frustrating. Basically only mono-geo, freeze, or freeze-swirl teams were viable, with bloom being weaker because you can't trigger it's sub-reactions. The whole fungus mat drop felt very restrictive.
    I think it's just that in fontaine you can ignore 95% of the wildlife and they will leave you alone unless you attack them first.
    > more available enemies makes grinding mats so much more pleasant 

But Fontaine enemies also drop more materials, don't they? At least it feels as if those water dudes and strange purple ball thingies drop more materials upon dead than any other enemy.
        Weapon material enemies are different, but yes, hydro phantasms have a fantastic droprate. Aberrants and mechs are more in line with fungi and eremites.
Sumeru enemy density is cause they knew how 🔥 the battle tracks are
Ngl i thought fontaine puzzles were trivial. You just click as you go and you should be able to solve it.

Sumeru was tedious because i had to solve the same puzzle many many times (e.g. telephone game). After a while, i don’t want to find the 3 stones that has symbols matching the corresponding 3 stones. The main pyramid puzzles had some difficulty.

Inazuma was the sweet spot for me because i actually had to think.
    Same for me. I like puzzles that make me think, not run around and find stuffs. Inazuma is the best so far.
        [deleted]
            They toned down the difficulty in Sumeru because a lot of casuals hated the difficulty of Inazuma’s (I know a lot of people). So they increased the amount of puzzles, but made them kids puzzles. They really should not have gone through with that, I expected Sumeru to be way more challenging.
    I still remember how good it felt figuring out the sudoku blocks and the light up tiles in Seirai. It provided great contrast to the combat. The chest rewards however, did not match the effort imo.
    Agree on fontaine puzzles. There's nothing puzzling about the Arhke or timing your hits on the up down ringy thingy. Not to mention we've done the light up totems in order where you just check the number of objects next to it too many times now. Not every puzzle should be 3D sudoku of course but at least few that make me scratch my head would be appreciated.
    I think it’s more dead brain than sumeru because at least the desert puzzles require me to look around and there are variations in the puzzles. We have the fontaine expansion this patch but the puzzles are still pretty much the same, hit the totems, get the droplets and that arkhe puzzles that require no brain cell to solve. 
Inazuma puzzles are still the best for me tho. Sudoku puzzle is just that great and my only complain i have there is the shitty rewards.
I thought Fontaine exploration was amazing, and it delivered in terms of surprises through exploration. I do have a few nitpicks though.

I do like the idea of superbosses, but I'd wish they would be more significant instead of just being there. Also altering their design to make them more unique would have been cool. >!the tumor was a nice surprise too but... well, it's a sphere!< the mara avatar also suffered a bit from being a gimmick pseudo boss with a very simple design.

While I loved the exploration, I feel like sometimes the payout ends up a bit disappointing. You feel like unraveling a terrible secret by >!collecting the pages, or by collecting arkhium to forge a key (that part was honestly really cool)!<, and you get... well, some area with a chest lr two, a note and that's all.

I understand they don't want to gate too important stuff behind optional bosses or optional exploration, but sometimes it felt like a bit underwhelming of a conclusion.
    I liked the idea in Inazuma where you had to do each major questline for the (unique) blueprint, but obviously the caveat is that you have to do every major questline for the blueprint. Lol.  


Made the Inazuma weapons a lot more personal though.
        Yeah weapon blueprints were pretty cool rewards for exploration, they did it in dragonspine too although the weapons themselves being questionable (especially the spear). Once again I believe they don't want to hide them into exploration, but let's be real, if you don't like exploration you probably didn't play the right game to begin with (plus we have on of the best craftable - the catch, and the pipe weapon also look very decent, locked behind fishing which is not exactly better.
    It did have an oculi, I wonder if they’ll gate another one behind that much effort too or if this is the one you can skip to still max the statue
        It was so annoying using the gadget to hunt oculi and it would just always go on that one, like, 'I marked it, I just haven't found the last rock yet and I don't want to go rock hunting now, I'm oculus hunting'.
There waa some  timegated quest though, the seal quest where you have to feed him,the one with fishing and multiple quest in the fortress requires you to wait until reset for the NPC to appear.
    Yeah but this are not important and very short. Lore quest and world quests are not locked anymore and those are the important ones. The rest are for the same as the dailies. Yo go for 3 minutes and that’s it, next.
    At least the blubberbeast one was only timegated by a few hours per stage of the quest and not a whole day. For me personally it’s not a quest I actively did, just whenever I remembered to, but if you did and you logged in 2-3 times a day you could finish it in like 2 days
        It’s about 7 hours of time gate per stage so not too bad yeah.
    can you inform me which quest in meropide is timegated? is it more than one?
        The quests after you did after game of the riches like art of negotiation,debt creditor and some others that i forgot
            Yeah but those are usually unlocked one reset after completing a prior quest.

Inazuma had multiple quests that were timegated across like 5-6 days. IIRC Tsurumi took around 4~ days and Xavier's Tatara Tales requires, what, 7-8 days? It was WAY more ridiculous than Fontaine or Sumeru making you wait one day after completing a quest.
When Inazuma released, the pandemic was raging and Genshin had yet to have its first MAJOR region expansion, as Dragonspine happened shortly after release and it was a sub-area of Mondstadt, so I ended up grinding everything Inazuma had to offer and eventually got to 100% the entire map without any major external aid in the form of guides and the interactive map, all that before Sumeru finally debuted.

Sumeru, as awesome as it was, couldn't keep the pace and hit a balance. While Inazuma's islands had mostly different themes when 2.0 came out and every subsequent island released was extremely unique, Sumeru's rainforest was over in a flash and three desert expansions in a row got people burnt out like crazy.

While Fontaine's environments thus far have been mostly repetitive, the navigation and the way Hoyo handled underwater exploration is fantastic. It also helps that the pace is nicely spread between the above-ground grassy hills that remind people of simpler landscapes like Mondstadt while also giving more complex areas with 3D movement underwater.

So far, Fontaine is easily my favourite area to explore. I hope this standard is held and improved upon for as long as Genshin is running.
    To me Inazuma still is the peak level design of all regions. Every island has its own theme, you can easily recognize what place it is just by looking at someone's picture. Great point of interest setup so when you expand your view to the landscape, you can mark your own destination and dont have to constantly search in the map. Good enemies design. Harder and fun puzzles for you to think a bit not just run around doing chores. 

About the rewards in inazuma each blueprint has an individual quest. You receive it right after the quest so it feels much more rewarding this way than sumeru's/fontain's design choice. The fontain's blueprints are the worst both in the way you get them and their actual usage. Also The Catch is by far the strongest permanent free weapon in the game
        > you can easily recognize what place it is just by looking at someone's picture  
  
To be honest I feel like that is true for most of the map. Case in point [Lost in Teyvat](https://lostinteyvat.app/)
Conversely, the entire Fortress of Meropide questline was a visual novel with zero real gameplay other than walking around and visiting the same locations over and over again, so I can't say the entire Fontaine experience has been a banger from start to finish.
    i’ve finished everything in fontaine except for the fortress, it’s just too boring
    Yeah and most of the things you can interact with only work within a quest so the exploration is really limited there, barring a few chests here and there (like in the abandoned production area). Meropide was mostly a disappointment to me outside of Wry's quest.
    the entirety of the Fontaine archon quest is a visual novel, not just ch 3-4 lol.
        I sure do prefer the trials to Meropide though. Confining 80% of 4.1's AQ to Meropide is not a decision I was the biggest fan of, even if the actual story was interesting.
    Sometimes I feel like the only person who likes Meropide
        Which is fine, it's not like it was badly written compared to any other story in Genshin, I just prefer actual game play with combat and puzzle solving. I'm not knocking people who are into the visual novel type of gameplay, but I just thought it was weird to completely cut people who like combat and actually *playing the game* out of consideration for the questline.
            I thought it was very atmospheric. The monotony of it was a good reflection of how life just vanished into routine in a place like that
i enjoyed every second of Sumeru exploration, i can't say the same with Fontaine, heck i havent even touch the new area in 4.1 because nothing feels exciting to me. The underwater got boring real quick, and the fact that you can't use your character abilities down there is a minus for me
Agreed apart from Tsurumi. I think Tsurumi's time gated quests really added to the storytelling and was what really pulled the region together. Blood fog exploration is still one of the most memorable experiences in Genshin for me
    Same here. Tsurumi was kinda impossible without timegating, and it was one of the best explorations in the game, especially the fog.

I also do a hot take and confess I really liked the Tatarasuna quest, and timegating was a big part of why.
        I fucking loathed the time gating. I forget things a lot...
Am I the only one who really thought Sumeru exploration was peak? Why does everyone hate it now. I like how because there’s so much in it, I still discover new stuff occasionally. I love fontaine though and your points makes sense but it’s really not that big of a deal breaker for me. Sumeru’s world building is insane.
    Same! Sumeru exploration was fun to me. The goals were set and so it was just “find the thing”, like for the obelisks and stone slates. It wasn’t just wandering aimlessly, there was a checklist. Find all the stone slates, find the aranara, go through the ruins in the sumeru desert, etc.
The new daily commission mechanics is also pretty great. I'm motivated to do more exploration to get dailies instead of the actual commissions since I get to unlock stuff and get dailies at the same time. I've been finishing my backlog of quests recently thanks to this.
The sad thing is that after finishing the story and side quest, you hardly go back to any of the regions. Which is a total waste of beautiful scenery and world building. I think instead of making the dailies a bunch of monster extermination quest, hoyoverse should really make them side story quests so the players get to revisit the regions again.
    I found the game so much more fun when my dailies were still set to random. I just can't do any more Ella quests.
    This is part of the reason I still do mining routes and artifact investigation routes because I get to explore all the previous areas.
Those beasts ate too many carbohydrates if they’re Constipated 💀💀💀
Was literally feeling so tired with this game, then Fontaine came with the best story yet as well as exploration that reminded me of the fun I had back in 1.0.
People thought sumeru had too much enemies??

I always thought there are lack of enemies, in fact I want huge group of enemies. we spend so long building our a characters, would be nice to use them.
I do agree on most of these but I still feel it had very little compared to Inazuma or Sumeru, primarily in world quests and "Ruins". The world quests for the most part were very uninteresting or incomplete which I will have to judge it when it is done, but the parts we explored where for the most part just landscapes (well and in water as well) but it was all very shallow, it didn't give me the "adventuring " vibe that Sumeru or Inazuma gave, and the few parts that did, were just like 20 minutes long or something.
I agree with everything you've said except for the stuff about the chests. I know there are some hidden common chests in Fontaine, but overall I wish there were more. It's a little boring when almost every chest you 'find' is right out in the open, visible from afar by its red ring, and then you just fight the monsters or do a puzzle to get it.

I wish there are more common chests tucked into little nooks and crannies like in Liyue.
I actually think the exploration in fontaine has suffered a lot from the diving, personally. Everything we've seen so far barring Elynas and the FRIKEE ruins are very samey and kinda boring. I understand they had to invest a lot of effort into getting the swimming stuff to work at all + the added verticality etc but Inazuma and Sumeru are MUCH more interesting environments to actually explore IMO. 

Thankfully, the areas they showcased for 4.2 look like a return to form, and of course now that they've cracked the code on the swimming moving forward they can start to get more ambitious with their environment design again (can't imagine they ditch swimming after 4.x, its too major). Looking forward to see what's on the other side of this like Chenyu Vale + Natlan and if there are any "dlc" areas for fontaine down the line like sunken remuria or something.
Fontaine seems empty. Especially the overworld exploration.
There are less chests in the overworld as well. I'd nearly rather have the common chests again in exchange for seeing more of them everywhere and actually running to them. Right now I just admire the scenery where I stand and do my daily commissions, then log off.
But it seems like everyone has different tastes. I, for one, love Sumeru and 100% on the first week after an area release. Fontaine, less so
    I’m still finding random common chests all over Sumeru and Liyue. They are just hidden in little spots and blend in with the environment, it’s so fun to find them! Like the ones that are on rooftops. It’s just so much more fun than one exquisite chest in the middle of an open field
        Exactly! It gives a reason to explore again! Also there's a nostalgia factor to it as an ar60 player and finding chests in liyue/mondstadt. 

On this note, I actually like puzzle locked areas/rooms etc because you have to explore the place later again to get to the puzzle (ex. Sumeru pyramid)
Reducing the number of specific enemy types suuuuucks, I need MORE fontemer aberrant materials, not LESS. Also, I like fighting enemies and running from them is always easy
    im pretty sure there is 100+ fontemer aberrant 😭
    Why would you need MORE fontemer aberrant 😭😭😭 there's already so many
I think I've become just instinctively disinclined towards playing world quests, but I think this post might've just convinced me to actually try the Fontaine world quests.
Yep, not gating exploration behind quests unless it makes sense (Elynas) is good.

While I liked the Aranara quests, it was annoying that in the beginning, 90% of the exploration doodads could not be interacted with and I needed a lot of backtracking.
Unpopular opinion: I enjoy backtracking in exploration. I like that sense of mystery when you find an obstacle you can't overcome, or a gate you can't open. I like slapping a marker on the map so I don't forget it, and I especially like coming back and revealing those secrets once I have the tools necessary.

I especially liked exploring the desert for that exact reasons. It was genuinely my favorite region so far, despite everybody seemingly hating it.

Without backtracking, exploration just feels like a monotone loops of see thing - get thing - see next thing - get that too. Repeat until you combed through the whole map once. Fontaine was still pretty neat though.
My experience with Sumeru was 300% better because I started playing Genshin again after a 1,5 year hiatus. When I came back, it was 3.4. All the Archon quest was unlocked, and I could just do the Aranara quests in my own time, so I didn't actually feel burnout or anything. Heck, I even 100% the whole region, even the desert (that I absolutely adored as well). I loved how Zelda-like the Aranara were, and I loved all puzzles and ruins of the desert like it was a totally different game.

Would I enjoy Sumeru this much if I didn't stop playing back in Inazuma? Probably not. Burnout is a real thing, and I do believe that in those cases it's just better to give yourself a break and play other things. No need to brute force your fun. After coming back from hiatus (since 1.8 I believe), I got enough primos to get Nahida, so it's not like you're losing everything by not playing. 

I still remember finding Sumeru after being a bit tired of exploring the Chasm. It was so fucking cool. I live in a rainforest place, so entering that cave and finding so many lush trees around me... it kinda felt like home.

With all that said, I'm loving Fontaine exploration a lot. Underwater is amazing and those landscapes with the dreamy ost just make everything better to me. Was a bit underwhelmed by Meropide and the giant cubes in the sky, though. It would be better for them to be like portals for another dimension than just water cubes.
Hey op I think you meant consecrated Beasts, not constipated. 

Ngl that made me laugh like crazy. Please don't change it.
    Did he stutter?
    I’m pretty sure they meant to say constipated haha. It’s a running joke in the community now.
        First time I've heard of it then
            I believe it came to be because of how frustratingly difficult they were to fight during a couple of abyss cycles especially since they came in pairs.

Not only were they tanky, hard hitting and had a short window to exploit their weakness but the way they were programmed to move would cause your character to get stun locked and pushed around so much that you couldn't switch characters or use skills/bursts properly.

It was pretty much, or at least felt like a broken enemy rather than something well designed and balanced.
Why would you want less enemies?  That one I really don't get.  I find fontaine too empty of enemies.
Sumeru has the most obnoxious time trial puzzles that requires so much effort for a mere common chest, thankfully in Fontaine they fixed it. I hated it so much when some of them were so long or tricky, and at the end you get almost nothing.
sumeru locking was even worse than inazuma imo. so many world quest that you need to do and all the aranara nonsense. i actually didn’t mind the electrogram since i was trying to level the tree fast anyways. but yea it was still pretty bad
Only thing lacking in Fontaine is the depth and vastness that Sumeru has. It’s still mindblowing just how massive it felt and how small you feel in all of it
Honestly everything you said seems right to me. I think what a large sum of what you said was that time-gated content and quest locked non-main story missions were the worst part of earlier regions and that definitely checks out.
I'm just happy about the general look and feel of Fonatine exploration. God I hate exploring the Sumeru desert
Can it be that we have way too many Fungi spawns because they drop different loot based on the element you use against it? The game gave you a warning yet many people were complaining they didn't get the right drop. Hell sometimes I went too unga bunga and fireworked the little shroombuddies while farming. With more enemies on the map it's easier to correct this mistake, granted you realize it.
I can understand why some people don’t like electrogranum and gadget dependent world exploration. But for my case, I really liked electrogranum and gadget dependent world quests and inazuma puzzles.
>No RNG commission quests: Self-explanatory. It took 3 years but they finally figured these were a horrible idea.

uh... yes there are. And I'm still waiting for mine to finally show up.
>No RNG commission quests: Self-explanatory. It took 3 years but they finally figured these were a horrible idea.

Dont know where you get this but there are RNG commissions in Fontaine. Overall I dont think theres a significant change honestly
-> No timegates: This was largely present in Inazuma where some quests or even exploration (hi Tsurumi) was timegated and could only be progressed daily. Fontaine has no such timegating on exploration: Everything is available from day 1.

what about the little fellow underwater that needed to be feeded over a few days?
While I do agree with a lot of the sentiments, I feel like they scaled back a bit on the "Grandness" from Sumeru. There really isn't anything that makes me say "holy shit" like the Pyramid, The sandstorm, The varuna machine, the three giant ruin golems or the oasis. It feels very tame so far.

Also, I know this is a very unpopular opinion but I fucking loved the Sumeru desert.
>I believe these (and more) may be some of the reasons as to why Fontaine exploration has felt more enjoyable than prior regions.

Except it hasn't. It might be the region I have the least fun exploring in out of all of them in fact. The stories are good and that's about it.
Heavy disagree on Fontaine puzzles not being brain dead. Vast majority of underwater is grab nearest Xenochromatic power, burst bulle fruit with it. Same thing with Jellyfish hat and the red flower things. Swim through rings, and/or collect blue dots. Occasionally grab nearest Xenochromatic power to get to something behind gate. Blocking water jets with crab bubble *sometimes* requires thought for multi-jet ones.

See an ousia/pneuma totem? Find its opposite energy nearby and smack totem.

Hydro challice things you fill with hydro? Put water in 'em and they move where they need to. A few exceptions but vast majority are stupid simple.

Arkhum forge, the 5 hrydro pillars with one movable Hydro chalice, basement gear room in Meropide, and pipe alightment in the cave where a guys locks you in the cage, and getting to Mary-Anne's room are the only things requiring some thought. The rest is stupid simple.

You'd make a better argument for it saying "they respect my time," or "I don't really care about puzzles, just want primos, and these are an easy get."
I 100% agree! I came back a bit before Fontaine, and have been going around trying to 100% every region that came out, and Fontaine definitely feels like they really mastered exactly what is fun in terms of exploration and progression

Shoutout to the lack of gadgets all my homies hate gadgets
Fontaine felt better to explore than any region before.  


one of the best parts was how well placed the teleport points were and how you never feel boxed in betwene huge cliffs that force to either climb them or take insanely long detours
sumeru felt like a chore. especially the Desert expansions.

fontaine is mondstadt but way better.
I may be an outlier but I'm finding fontaine exploration really boring to the point I don't even want to do it.
    It's kinda mid compared to other regions. It's wild to see that many upvotes for op. (And yes I've done all exploration except for a few quests up to 4.1). Underwater looks the same everywhere, the combat underwater gets boring real quick and the scenery is both on land and underwater quite repetetive. Fontaine feels pretty empty when it comes to puzzles/chests as well. Less enemies don't help with that feeling.

Stories (world quests and most of the archon quest) are good tbh, but without them Fontaine would've been one of my least liked regions. When it comes to exploration only it might just be my least liked region.
The Aranara and Jeht quest lines nearly made me quit genshin with their length and gatekeeping of exploration. Thank god they actually read the feedbacks
    I loved the Aranara and Jeht quests but the fact there were no 'breaks' in them besides Jeht's being forcibly split across patches because of unreleased regions, it was painful. Especially because you needed to progress pretty far into the Aranara quest to get to portions of Sumeru at all! (Not counting Old Aranara, I liked how it was locked off honestly) If they had simply put the progression for the lyre early on at the minimum, and had the Aranara quest properly broken up so you could take a breather and not accidentally stumble into the next portion that leads into a fight, it would have been better.
        Tbh the worst part of the aranara quest isn't that it locks stuff off, it's that it locks *parts* of everything off.  Like if you want to explore on your own, every time you find a treasure chest there's a lyre 'puzzle' nearby and then an aranara that you also can't interact with until you complete basically the entire quest so no matter how much you explore it doesn't matter because you will have to comb the entire region again later.

It's the first, and only, time in the game where I've actually felt *punished* for wanting to explore first and quest later and it left an incredibly bad taste in my mouth.
            Yeah it definitely felt like the forest was 'find out then fuck around' while the desert was very fuck around and find out. Forest wanted to hold your hand and show you against your will before you found it on your own while the desert threw you into hell without a map like genuinely I'm glad the desert wasn't utilized in the AQ because that was way too annoying to traverse.
    same man
I personally disagree with this take, other than the puzzles hitting a good sweet spot.

I find the exploration a lot more casual and brain dead, and so much less rewarding than Sumeru. I have a lot of time to play so I enjoyed going through world quests, and unlocking more secrets through them. It definitely made my exploration feel more connected to the living world of Teyvat.
Sumeru locking exploration behind quests was a big reason why I ended up taking a break during the 3.X patches. I prefer jumping right into exploration.
All these “qol” and I still consider liyue and mondstadt the most fun I’ve ever had in the game. Mostly becos it was honeymoon stage. Inazuma ain’t so bad too. Sumeru is where I fell off *reallllly* hard.

I salute the effort to reignite the magic in Fontaine tho, still failed for me but if it works for others, then happy for ‘em.
Respecting the player's time is what I am getting with the chest change.

Meanwhile, the guy at the event team did not get the memo at all.
    Nobody forces you to explore. Wth do you mean by respecting the player's time?
I think puzzles are absolutely a highlight. They were solid. And that's something I like, not dull but require some kind of thinking that puzzles should be about.

I think the enemy density was actually a highlight for Sumeru simply for material acquisition. I honestly dislike how devoid of certain enemies are tied to stuff like underwater just because I have my own issues with underwater content. 

I feel like that traversal in the game still feels miserable and Sumeru really spoiled us with the grapple point.  Stamina management is still utterly awful with work with because movement feels sluggish.

The swimming is okay, but it got tiring fast after the first week it released. More likely because the actual underwater combat is mind numbingly dull, just pressing one button half the region's combat is just outright boring. At least the actual movement isnt horrible like above water swimming  so that's a net positive at least.
Well this is a topic de serve reading.

By Hoyo, specially 

👏👏👏👏 

Monstadt is good, Inazuma is terrible( currently doing it), haven't done Sumeru, Fontaine is actually perfect.

Give us more Fontaine kind of exploration.
Sorry I feel the complete opposite. to sum it up pun intended...some the new content feels 'watered down''

Exploration is no longer gate-kept behind gadgets...I enjoyed region specific gadgets

On the note of world quests...I cleared all the quests way too fast and I wasn't even paying attention or doing quests back to back, map was so small I just found them all I guess. I used the new commission system as my time gate so I didnt compete the content too quickly and they still wasn't enough.

No RNG commission quests...gives little reason to do commissions there sadly..how many underwater light chasing and bubble popping can one do before getting sick of it.

Less excessive number of enemies....now I have nothing to battle in the new areas. But it does make sense form a lore point of view.

Less brain-dead puzzles...Those security camera's require zero brain cells and the 'hit the stick when the light is blue'' also is the same. Pneumosia  related 'puzzles' The only 2 times I needed to think (not much though) has been in Wriothesley quest with the gate opening and Meropide at the bottom that gear puzzle

In some way sure, quality over quantity has been achieved...but in terms of difficulty and brain power required, it has become too simple sadly.
Yeah but its fucking france so it doesnt work at all
BS. MHY doesn't take feedback from players. What copium are you taking in? Reddit and X users told me that MHY doesn't care about GI and does not take player feedback EVER. So this is just a coincidence. 

&#x200B;

~~^(/s in-case some smartass need it.)~~
Spot on. My favorite regions, in order, are Fontaine-Mond-Liyue 

Fontaine is really balanced between exploration rewards puzzles and fights. Mond is basically walk and enjoy the view, Liyue is kinda pain with the mountains and peaks but is fun anyway.

I dislike Inazuma. I love the desing and the story quests but exploring while EVERYFUCKINGTHING IS HAZARD it was just stupid as fuck. Didnt make the game fun or interesting it was just a pain to do something.

And Sumeru?  Is the worst region of all. It's so big and so DUMB.  The desert having that inverted pyramid FLOATING in the sky  was just so dumb ... the 1st time I saw it I was not impressed or excited to explore it, "what the fuck is that thing? Why there's 0 mention anywhere in the world about this shit?"   The caves are awfull the exploration is boring. Aranana quest is just ... not again.

The only good thing about Sumeru is Nahida and dendro element
But I loved the area specific gadgets,it was fun to try something new on every new area.
I really want to copy this post to any comment that said "Genshin don't have QOL update"
Not a fan of lower enemy density tbh- I like fighting. But all the other things are great.
Your comment about the enemy density  in Sumeru reminded me off an oddly frustrating part of the exploration for me: I LOVE the Sumeru soundtrack and wanted to enjoy it while exploring, but every 5 seconds it would be interrupted by the damn battle music. 
Which slaps too, don't get me wrong! But sometimes I want to listen to peaceful music while exploring a rainforest, please n thank you.
Only counterpoint, I liked the enemy density in Sumeru. Imagine how much longer it would have taken to farm Sumeru characters if there were half of the enemies available. Especially early on when we had to control which elements we used to fight the fungi.
Unironically would prefer it if all of your points were present in Fontaine (except RNG commissions, fuck them).
I like how some of the oculi were just hard enough you had to look and be like “where is it?!” But not all of them were stupid easy. This is the first region where I’m actually caught up with my fountain and statue of the seven.
Seeing the game progress, you can tell Genshin devs are definitely learning from the feedback and improve every release.
Constipated Beasts 😂
Also underground Maps and oculi/waypoint markers telling you if what youre looking for is underground made things a bit more welcoming when It comes to caves
Any thoughts on enkanomiya exploration its still 50% progress to me and Im planning to 100% it before 4.2 update lol
Actually i like the enemy density :(
Constipated beast..Yeah,I had a problem calming that one.
One thing I haven't seen anyone talk about is the way they've used the hydroculi.

In previous regions, particularly Inazuma and Sumeru, the oculi were often hidden away in awkward places which made finding them a chore.

In Fontaine they've essentially used them as breadcrumbs to lead players to points of interest. Most of them are out in the open and easy to spot, but they'll be positioned near a cave entrance or a pizzle or atop a good vantage point.
I reinstalled Genshin about two weeks ago, and coming from someone who did OoT's Water Temple and MH3's water combat, this is the first time I've enjoyed underwater exploration.

Would love more Inazuma level puzzles any day of the week, Fontaine was a step up, but I really want them to be a bit more complex.
“Constipated Beast”
Lmao


As someone who enjoys 100%ing every region, I honestly found Fontaine to be underwhelming.
 Electrogranum was so bad! Those cube puzzles! I just used Kuki and hoped for the best. The fungi in Sumeru everywhere! 

&#x200B;

 I love everything underwater, I hope we get more of those!
Took them a bit too long to avoid most of these (obvious) issues imo.

I'm on the slightly conspiracy side that genshin is just treated like a training product for most of hoyo's team and not a game with which they want to do well.

The amount of obvious stuff missing from the game is way too big.
So I don't have to do Fontaine dailies? Or are they dailies that are unique and they just all appear at once?
Speaking of RNG commissions, did they update the monstadt and liyue ones? I have achievements I can't complete from there. The dandellion one and the love fortune telling..
Yeah, the overall *amount* of World Quests is higher than in Sumeru, they are just much less linear and funneled, so instead of completing the second zone of the Aranara quest and feeling like you haven't actually "completed" anything and are just moving on to the next phase of it, while in Fontaine, you'll fully complete the "story" of a certain quest, and it just opens up new potential quests elsewhere. 

It's a bit like a "movie vs TV series" thing.
imo i wish for it to be bigger
Lmao, one Zhongli Meteor and the mobs are dead, for me, unto the next camp. No issues with “too many enemies” I’d rather have more enemies than the amount Mond or Liyue have. We don’t have our characters for nothing.
Puzzles still aren't hard enough imo
I honestly fear the next map will be a nightmare
The Fontaine exploration is more interesting i felt, but one thing that kinda is a peeve is the pneuma-ousia mechanism. As good as it is that we are not forced to use either reactions to defeat clockwork meka, it seems rather useless in that case as enemies don’t seem to care much and regain the aura pretty soon
Fontaine is definitely the best region by far. I burned out really badly on the Sumeru and Inazuma regions with the quest and gadget locking, I quit the game for 4 months in favor of Star Rail. I grew to hate the "Genshin has more currency you just have to explore!" argument because of how much time it took to even unlock these so-called features in Sumeru and Inazuma that gate of a few hundred currency. Came back and was presently surprised with Fontaine and its level of freedom, this is how the open world should feel! Not some curvy railroad dictated by long questlines and artificial progression systems.
THERE ARE RNG NPC COMMISSIONS IN FONTAINE TO GET SOME ACHIEVEMENTS
>Less braindead puzzles. They seem to have found a sweetspot between Inazuma's more difficult puzzles

Uhh, no? I think these new puzzles are even more difficult than Inazuma's, at least in my opinion, they were pretty easy
[deleted]
    It's just a neat little "I brought Lynette so I don't have to climb that huge tree to get it, lucky me!", and I appreciate it both when I do bring both Arkhes and get that relief, and when I want to play a specific team and don't have to switch it up all the time.
        There's you and there's my sister who dispite having Lyney in her team chose to grab the orb instead because, "I didn't want to cheat"
            I did the same but that’s cause I completely forgot Lyney/Lynette could do that
            Honestly same though, lol. I like seeing where the devs hide the Arkhe orbs in relation to their objectives so I always go for them, despite running around with a team of Traveler + the Fatui siblings. It's worked very well thus far, aside from a single seelie puzzle in one of the big floating water cubes. For the life of me I couldn't find the orb so I resorted to cheating--just once. :(
            Boy Wanderer in Fontaine is so good, need to fly over this canyon? Check.
Need to fly over this lake? Check
Need to fly up this mountain? Check
Need to get this thing for puzzle? Check
    Today i learned i could use characters for those puzzles and not hunt those orbs..
    How much I hate it when I have to change the character for one puzzle and then a few meters away again.
IIRC Barron Bunny worked in these puzzles.
    To an extent, yes.

But there are two sizes of pressure plate, a smaller one and a larger one. Baron Bunny was insufficient for the large ones, would only light up the inner ring. You could stand on them but to the best of my memory some also deactivated when not held down, so *needed* a Geo Construct.

Edit: Slight wording change, I was tired.
        You could trigger the large plates by having both baron bunny and the active character stand on them, but you are correct in that it wouldn't matter for the ones which required constant pressure.
        Amber's C4 hype
            I have amber c3 after 3 years 🥲
                Yall have cons on your Amber..?
        I've been dripping baron bunny AND then also stepping on the pressure plate and it works so I never though about using geo constructs 😐
        You can solve them with Klee, each bomb from her E counts as a full character so you just need to push two onto the center of the big ones and it still works, while also not requiring you to stand on it so timed ones can still be completed as well (though you have to spend time pushing them around and they're shorter duration than a typical geo construct so you kinda have to hustle).

It's not really a *good* way to solve them lol, it's just a fun little exploration hack
> but also has the Ousia Arkhe to compliment Hydro Traveler's Pneuma Arkhe for Fontaine-related puzzles.

Which you don't even need because the puzzles can all be solved by finding the appropriate ousia and pneuma sources near the puzzle.  The characters just mean you can solve the puzzle even faster.
    Honestly makes me wonder how they'll handle Furina underwater. Like would she be stuck in whatever alignment you had before diving or would she be able to swap underwater?
        Give her both types on her attack ? Not like it'd matter a lot
    Getting Furina means I can get it it done without even changing teams.
I think the solution to this and also just a dope addition all around would be to give the Traveler the ability to swap elements on the fly. This would be great for puzzles, would make the Traveler (who a ton of players consider to be a horrible unit) actually useful even for combat, and would just be a ton of fun (imagine having a character that can switch elements and abilities on the fly).

C’mon, Hoyo. It’s time. Give the Traveler an element wheel.
    [deleted]
        Well, the maps pins are coming. Not sure if it’s for 4.2, but they said they will be adding more (I think it’s going up to 200?). But I didn’t know you can do that in HSR. That’s pretty cool and also a good thing because I’ve noticed that Genshin has been adding somethings from HSR into Genshin like the option to complete dailies by just doing random stuff instead of the actual dailies themselves. Hopefully, they add the switching elements on the fly into Genshin.
            IIRC Traveler has been shown in a few cutscenes to switch elements on the fly. My theory is that once all seven nations are fully accessible we'll be able to unlock it via the extra -oculus of each region after fully upgrading that region's statue to 10.
    I still wish each element of Traveler counted as a separate character in the party select that just shared a health bar. Traveler's never gonna get a new ability to switch elements on the fly in combat, but if it cost a party slot to do so then it would be just like making any other team.
I just assumed the weird circle things in Liyue didn't do anything. I forget that constructs exist in this game.
    So did Mihoyo 💀
    I remembered that they came in pairs or occasionally triplets, and that you could activate them by stepping on them, so I assumed they were coop puzzles.
    There are also a couple places where there are rock formations that are obviously missing a rock. Dropping a construct into position spawns a chest.
        what where, I remember exploding some rocks but not slotting a rock into place
I actually didn't know traveller was pneuma until you said so. Was struggling with puzzle I was basically hold myself back from exploring Fontaine
    99% of the puzzles have pneuma or osia blocks right next to the puzzle somewhere. So you can solve all of it without needing to swap characters. 

Only a very small amount of puzzles, less than like 5, might require you to look around more for the penuma or osira blocks.
Honestly the whole Liyue anemo/geo traveller conundrum could all be solved if we could change elements without the statue 💀 ofc we would still have to resonate with the statue to obtain the element but it would make it so much easier if we could switch the traveller’s element without the statue :’)
Was Sucrose ever given away in an event? I vaguely remember getting one of her Constellations like that, though I could be wrong...
    Events are irrelevant because if you started playing after the event and you need a character from an event, you’re screwed.

I started playing at the end of 1.2 and every guide for Razor I saw said to use Fischl since everybody got her for free from an event. Well, the event had already ended when I started playing and it wasn’t until 2.2 that I got her.

That being said, I don’t think Sucrose was ever given away, since 1.1 was Fischl and we got Missive Windspear for the last Mondstadt event. We also got Cinnabar for Shadows Amidst Snowstorms and I don’t think Sucrose has played a major role in any events where we got a 4*.

We did get a free Faruzan so maybe you’re thinking of her
    Afaik they haven't given out Mondstadt characters that you could choose, that happened wice with Liyue though (iirc).
We also got Faruzan from the 3.5 event if you count that
    Might not count since newer players can't get it
    Lynette is permanently free
They've also seriously toned back the elemental totem "puzzles" in Fontaine. I'm not sure if any of them even require bringing the right element on your team as there's virtually always some sort of natural element you can use to solve the puzzle.

Imo, the elemental totem spam was another reason why Sumeru exploration sucked. There are a ton of totem (or similar) puzzles where you absolutely *must* have an exact party of at least three specific elements. Especially in the desert, if you aren't running around with a Dendro/Electro/Pyro comp then you're going to be swapping characters constantly. (And how many decent teams even use Dendro/Electro/Pyro all at once?) Plus, Fungi drops are based on what element you use to kill them, so you quickly just run into team comp issues no matter what you try to do in Sumeru. This results in lots of character swapping, which is just slow and frustrating.

Fontaine is way more flexible and lets you do pretty much whatever you want with your team compositions.
And swimming is just so fun! And you don't have to climb anything, you can just dive and explore. No stamina problems because you can run through those schools of fish that restore diving stamina
    They really nailed the swimming control, which is weird because it's largely based on Sorush control and Sorush felt rigid as fuck.
        "Sorush flew so we could swim" as the proverb says.
        Sorush felt bad because she didn't use camera controls.

Swimming works based on your camera direction so it feels WAY smoother.
    i was legit so worried they'll make swimming like that drone control from sumeru where you need to press a button to go up or down. 

first thing I checked in fontaine and was overjoyed that swimming is completely organic. this is the only game ive played where swimming actually feels like swimming and not just reskinned flying
    Swimming in fontaine is like playing a remake of a ps1 or ps2 games I never played and feel that the control is good.

Or just GTA SA pilot school, played on PC
Today I tested it and it took me 8 chests/challenges in total to do my dailies :D It's such a great feature.
    I have finally been doing story quests. Doing just 1 part is considered big enough to count as all 4 commissions.
    i'm using it to catch up on worldquests in other regions like inazuma, i'm halfway to getting my teapot style for inazuma and the daily amount of activities is perfect for me where i play for a good amount of time and am left wanting more for tomorrow

my burnout evaporated into nothing after this feature came out lolll, genshin went from daily chore simulator back to a chillaxing exploration story game. at the pace i'm going it'll take me around 2 and a half years just to clear the existing zones not including fontaine, aka i'll literally never run out of stuff for encounter points
No joke on the daily encounter system! I dislike the ones where I have to fight things, so being able to open chests, collect oculi and do events in exchange for daily commissions is grand! 

It even gave me a reason to go back to Dragonspine and finish up there. I’ve made more progress on my frostbearing tree in the past week or two than I have since it came out.
As someone who has done dailies nearly every day for around 3 years, since week one of Genshin, I love the daily encounter system. Quests and events also count, and it gives me a chance to catch up on a lot of content that I'm behind on, as someone who logs in for a small amount of time each day.
I know! I can also just run around and 100% pretty easily. Everything is super fun and the underground areas are for once not very claustrophobic and same-y (talking to you Sumeru desert).
    i like the sumeru desert underground for the same reason you hate it lol
bruuh daily encounter hting is the best thing they ever put in genshin deadass. 

so good, I'm actually playing the game again after it, as in I'm no longer just nuking commissions and dumping resin and logging out, i'm actually going out into the world to do shit and have been the past 2 months since this came out.
What if you're pressing F to pick up the loots, but Hydro ball says yeet to the other side of the beach.
    "Reality? Is pain."
    There's one in the middle of that boiling lake that got me and it goes *far* away lol
I have a theory that they specifically do not let you cancel because you can use those hydro balls to transition between regular and underwater controls and exiting ball form midway probably resulted in bugs during testing.
Honestly still baffled they didnt just copy how Enkanomiya's electro teleportations worked, and instead made it completely unable to cancel. Like why?
I lost a few chest rewards due to the bad placement of these things
    I remember there was one day when I happened to get two different chests that spawned a hydro ball travel ring thingy when opened. The first one automatically deposited its contents into inventory, like some of the ones positioned right next to cliffs. The other one spilled its contents as objects, and my next button press activated the ring that had just spawned and dumped me two zipcodes away.
        Was it the one on the tiny island with the Hilichurl Rogue on it
            That one got me as well. But there's at least one more.
    Really? In my experience the chest rewards still stay where it spawned for a long time so you can actually go back and pick it up.
The amount of times I have opened a chest and a fucking water teleporter appears and whisks me to the other side of the FUCKING universe while I'm trying to pick up loot has only happened twice but it's TEN THOUSAND times too many.
Bro, I’m still in Inazuma trying to get the detective quest.
    there were so many in inazuma... fucking novel, cooking party, the combat guy by the beach etc
    I have still not completed gone in the wind from monstadt and that pirate commission from liyue...
    I'm still in Inazuma trying to get the Gourmet Achievement for that one Sumeru World Quest
I haven't completed Anna from Mondstadt commissions and the one with Snezhnaya achievements (Never get these questlines) and it's been 3 years.
They updated the commission system a few updates back to make it easier to complete storylines and have it be less rng based when and if they show up. There's guides on hoyolab and articles you can find that explain better, but the tldr is that it now works as a pool of all possible quests and it picks one npc commission per day for you to complete. Once completed it is removed from the pool. If you're missing achievements from commissions in past areas and you actively want to get them I would recommend looking it up.
    I've gotten Yurgan's "water the flower" quest like 20 times since finishing the line and killing the whopperflower for the achievement. 

It just randomly pulling 1 of the many NPC based comms in a region doesn't help much when there are so many. I still need to answer 6 questions for the one guy in Sumeru cause it keeps giving the same questions. I haven't gotten Doctor's Orders since giving the first patient the extra part. It still hasn't given me the last step of Farghani's measurement comms. I was on the last stage of Garcia's comm chain and then got the first stage twice instead of being able to finish it.

I'm very aware that it pulls one NPC comm per day, but it is so bloated with random shit that it might as well be fully RNG. It took a whole year to do Garcia's line. There are still people trying to do the Tales of Winter achievement that's been in since 1.0. This system is not good!
        > I still need to answer 6 questions for the one guy in Sumeru cause it keeps giving the same questions.

You can cheat here. Just answer 2 questions and then sever your connection to the internet.

Once you log in again the commission will start again from question 1 and the questions will be freshly randomized.

Rinse and repeat until you answered all six questions and only then answer a third to finish the commission.
        The big thing is commission rerolling tho, that's where the system has improved. They've also increased the number of 'rare' commissions in each cycle so people can finish the Glory achievement in around  a month now.
            WDYM commission rerolling?
                Think of commission cycles as the list [A B C D...], with each letter corresponding to a certain NPC commission. Currently, when daily commissions are given, there is a chance for one commission from this list to be given at random. Obviously, the pool of commissions is larger in game and also houses multiple of the same commission ([A A A B B C D D E..], for example) which is why some commissions come up more than others, but to explain the concepts of commission cycles and rerolling let's just consider a list of 3 commissions [A B C]. 

When a commission is completed, it is removed from the list. So if you complete commission C, then the list now looks like [A B]. The next time daily commissions are given, you can only receive commissions A or B. You won't see commission C again until the list is *completely* emptied out upon which it refills and the cycle begins anew. This is the logic behind commission cycles.

Now, what if commission A has multiple outcomes needed for an achievement? (We will call these outcomes A-1, A-2, A-3.) When commission A is given, the outcome chosen is randomized. Say you need A-2, but have been given A-1. Completing A-1 will remove commission A from the list, but if you *don't* complete it at all, then commission A will return to the list and you will have another chance to get A-2. 

This is commission rerolling. By neglecting to finish specific commissions, eventually your list of NPC commissions will be reduced to just [A] and you can consistently 'reroll' it until you get the outcome you want without having to sit and suffer through the entire list again.

Before, we had to go to other people's worlds to do dailies to skip but with the encounter points system we can now skip in single-player, making this system much more relevant now.
                    That only works if the player has access to things that give encounter points. If they've fully explored and done all quests, then they either miss out on daily rewards or just have to hope they get the right step each time.

I also just had a set of comms that was No honour among thieves, Impregnable defense, Touring light show, and Hammer of the mushrooms. So the guaranteed NPC comm per day doesn't even work right.
                        * Yeah, you need encounter points, but for 90% of each patch you have events. By not immediately collecting rewards, you can 'save' them and use them at a later date. Encounter points are awarded when the rewards are claimed, not when the challenge is completed. Same goes for chests. If you care about getting the achievements you can complete a few chests, leave them unclaimed, and mark them on the map for future encounter points.

* NPC commissions are NOT guaranteed every day. As I said, "there is a chance for" an NPC commission to be given each day.
    I think that's what 'No RNG commission quests' is referring to - you can get all the Fontaine quest achievements in one cycle and there aren't branching variations, rather than Sumeru's waiting for the right version of the quest to turn up, sometimes having to progress the quest to discover which instead of being able to skip it and get a different version within the same cycle. Cycles themselves came in with Sumeru, this is how the cycle system and commissions interact in Fontaine.
        Pretty sure Fontaine has a comm where you need 3 diff versions
            Yeah I have isadora quest more than 5 times now without facing livre once.
            You can get the Their Childhood chain, Aesthetic Critique chain, and the Get a Drink At Least! chain achievements in the one cycle because all the quests appear in the one cycle. The only way you can miss Get a Drink at Least and What is the Meaning of Work is if you don't know the correct answers to proceed the chain or add the alternate version.

It is not like Sumeru where you don't know which version you get until you have proceeded the quest beyond being able to park it if it's not the one you need, or you can go several cycles without getting the version you need for the achievement, such as with the fertilizer quest and the fortune quest.
I got that one Inazuma commission on the first day after patch, still no Gourmet Supremos. Now I thought maybe if I do it again it will be easier. Now the commissiion just refuses to pop up ...
Yeah, underwater seriously feels like a dream. It's just so natural, it feels like flight. Only gripe is the low vertical camera speed on PlayStation (it's 4 times slower than horizontal camera and both horizontal/vertical aiming speeds at max sensitivity when using a controller) and some stiffness in controls when it comes to up/down movement, but these are easily the best swimming controls I've seen in a 3d video game.
    Hey, just wanted to say if your on pc you could use Raw Accel to modify your x/y ratio of your mouse to a ratio of 2.95 and it would cause vertical and horizontal movement to match up in game
        Oh, I meant to specify on console/using a controller! I edited my original comment. Yeah, it's fine on PC, no issues there with K+M.

Are you saying it's the same way with a mouse, though? I've never noticed if so. EDIT: Just checked and there's no speed/accel difference on PC. I think it's just an issue with controllers. I need to make a video on the subject, it's a huge difference.
            Played on PlayStation since launch (PS4 then PS5) and *hate* how slow the vertical camera is.

Also, the button layouts constantly changing is infuriating. I noticed in Spiral Abyss today that the "Check Enemies" button changes between floors. Wtf?
                > the "Check Enemies" button changes between floors

This absolutely should cost the jobs of the programming leads/project managers. It doesn’t spark confidence at all if those kind of stuff get missed in the appraisal or testing phase.
    Yea the different x and y axis sensitivity on controller drives me insane. I thought we were finally save when they introduced separate sliders in the options, but at max on both it's just what the game usually is :(
    Subnautica says hello.

Both controls and feels are almost identical on PC.
The underwater content feels refreshing. Different, and well-thought though simple combat mechanic. I’m glad they didn’t just lazingly copy and paste the existing combat system. Also in my opinion way better than the dreaded Sumeru’s desert exploration.
    I usually hate underwater areas of games but holy shit, is their underwater mechanisms/feel/aesthetic/control really blowing every other game out of the water (pun intended, lol)
        Genshin Impact is the only game I have ever played by to add underwater mechanics years after the game initially launched and actually be better for it. 

Looking at you FFXIV and Planetside 2
            And World of Warcraft. That one underwater zone from Cataclysm is legendary for how much hate it gets.
                Unless you play Druid and enjoy moving FAST. The swimming speed buff you get there stacks multiplicatively with the speed buff from aquatic form, so you end up zooming around way faster than flying speed.
            ffxiv underwater is deadass just their shitty flying but under water with the bare minimum of animation changes even. 

so bad.
        Despite this, there are voices among the community which complain that elemental reactions are not utilized underwater 

I.e Kaeya freezing opponents under water using Elemental Burst.

How Hoyo has dropped the ball on perfecting Elemental Reaction so badly they need to introduce the light and dark energy in Fontaine and it's all a case of failure in game design and planning as it reduce the need to roll for new character. (Why would I roll if everyone's the same underwater)

The shifting of HP mechanics (Neavilette, Lyney, Lynette) is also called the outcome of Hoyo not smart enough to design better Elemental Reaction and had to resort to introduction of gimmicks, which will make artifact farming even more tedious because these character require different set, and Hoyo will bleed players as well as losing potential new players because the game is becoming more and more "new player unfriendly"

Some people are impossible to please.
            See, this makes me sad because that's a seperate feature from the underwater mechanics. Like, the focus should be on controls, colors, atmosphere, deco, landscaping, etc.

Because I have similar complaints too, but I see it as having nothing to do with discussing their underwater mechanics because it's only something that has to do with combat, not navigating and experiencing
The ziplines made sense in the jungle but in the desert I felt like they were a very poor substitute for the lack of a Horse
    > lack of a Horse

I really hope mounts get implemented at some point. It'd give the game yet another refreshing feeling.
        I always thought sayu/yelan/wanderer serve as a form of mount (aka fast traversal), just not packaged in a way we expect.
            >yelan mount

😏

>sayu mount

🤨📸
        They could, but it'd have to be region locked yet again since the map was clearly designed with running in mind. 

Tower of Fantasy demonstrated the pitfall of designing the map around mounts and other quick traversal mechanics, being that it makes the map super empty and boring in opposition to genshin's current dense and controlled exploration design.

But Mihoyo's team could still probably pull it off as they did with underwater, so we'll probably see the explore the idea later.
            This is why WoW sucked when they introduced mounts apparently.
                every mmo world zones goes to shit the moment flying gets introduced. 

wow, ffxiv both demonstrate this and they're the two most popular mmos

aion is based for actually making flying a gameplay mechanic and not just a faster sprint
        A dune buggy, or balloon that spawns at waverider points.
            gimme the horse, i hope after wave rider we no longer get a generic vehicle where your char disappears into. i know its easier to do but its not immersive
        PLS no. Whenever a generalist movement option gets introduced in a game, any future content is made with said movement option in mind.

If they give you a mount, exploration without a mount will be unbearable in all subsequent zones.

The perfect example is ToF. People praise all the movement gadgets and mounts, but the game is literally unplayable without them.

Honestly I thank whatever hoyo high execs for making sumeru zoom points sumeru-exclusive.
            I think a desert only horse would be great but like you said, not smth that's available outside. 

It's also mihoyo where they're insanely careful with any new major potentially game changing mechanic so even if they unlock the horse I think they could do a good job with it. 

free flying though, unless it's like aion, then yeah, that's a hard no from me coz ive seen zero mmos survive having flying added
        they're literally sitting on a cash cow I hope they add it sometime in the future too
        fr, i was anti mounts, but i think the way they designed the desert, a mount is the missing piece to make it an enjoyable experience, and not some goofy ahhh lookin horse like the clownshoe boat, just gimme an actual horse that looks like a horse lol
        Imagine we can rent sumpter beasts in the desert area—they can code the mount to only be able to walk within the desert regions if they have to
While the trade-off was worth it, it is a shame how desynced the diving animation is from the dive movement. With wimming, sprinting, climbing etc. the movement was synced with the animation for all characters, it looks great compared to other gamea. For diving, they made them all have the same movement so larger characters look like they go too slow while smaller characters look like they go too fast.
The combat underwater is what falling apart. It is boring & monochrome.

Sure I know creating 70 characters + 70 kind of diff atks/kits to work underwater is massive work. But They could have at least make underwater fight limited to 7 element. 7 kind of attacks that tied to the character vision type is not that much diff than now. At least if I want to switch atks, I just swap my character out base on his element. That at least much better than me swimming across half of the map to find that animal to re-tag the skill I just loss.  ughh

And then I hate how we forgot our skill when reach surface, then we need to find the animal to regain back again. (this could mean halfway across the map) Why they wanna make a clunky system like that?
    Halfway across the map? What are you talking about? Every area has a shit ton of animals to get skills from, especially near teleports. You can even teleport to one area, get a skill you want, then teleport to another area, and use said skill like from the new area Jellyfish. 

Every puzzle has the animal you need near it too.

Swimming half the map? You're part of the 1%
    Yeah I  love the underwater environment, but I really don't like the underwater combat either. It's way too simplistic and boring. I don't expect them to translate the above ground combat to underwater because that would be very hard, but I do wish it was a *little* bit more complex than: get animal ability, use on object/enemy, get reward. 

But I guess MHY is just trying to appeal to as many people as they can so it's to be expected.
    Meh i disagree I have no issues with the underwater combat. It isn’t groundbreaking or anything but it does what it needs to do
    Seems to be an unpopular opinion here, but the underwater parts of Fontaine are the absolute worst parts of the game.

The combat is braindead and dull, everything is very slow and unresponsive, and once you complete a couple of puzzles, you realize it's just a screensaver you're swimming through.
genshin has the best swimming in any game ive played hands down. the animations, the speed, sound, the way the character is physically going through a material that has friction on their bodies and the way you control direction. i was insanely surprised to see so many different animation states and the chars actually rotating in the water depending on his tight youre turning and everything, its a genuine swimming exp

its all perfect. basically every mmo should look at how genshin does swimming because the swimming is gameplay itself whereas in those games mobility modes are just a generic way to go from point a to b

at first i was disappointed that they didn't add breath meter coz i thought it was anotehr sumeru desert thing where you go to the desert and theres zero sense of danger that a desert's environment should present like overheating and overcooling. but the moment i jumped in i understood swimming is goated

now give me fontaine chasm aka just a bottomless dark abyss underwater with scary sea monsters in it.
I thought that every region would need ziplines to be fun but now I can't wait to see what Natlan's gimmick will be.
and local legends! which aren't really quests, but they're a fun challenge you can just stumble upon. i really hope they retroactively add them to old regions.
    I do really appreciate the local legends, just... would it have hurt anything to have them drop, like, 10 times the usual amount of materials or something? Maybe one or two purple artifacts, as a treat? I get that the difficulty is the point, and it is fun, just why not, right?

Also it's hilarious that one of the local legends is a Fatui operative who could probably wipe the floor with Childe, lol
        Right? They give the same XP as regular enemies, not even the elite enemies, but take more time because of their inflated HP. That should come with commensurate drops/XP.
        It's the eternal Hoyo dilemma.

Make difficult content rewarding (Especially difficult content in the overworld, which is expected to be very easy), then you have casuals complaining that they are being locked out of rewards because they can't clear it.

Make it unrewarding, then players who can clear it complain why there are no rewards.

It's the unfortunate side effect of having such a diverse playerbase.
        > Also it's hilarious that one of the local legends is a Fatui operative who could probably wipe the floor with Childe

I could solo her with Childe if I cared to.
        would’ve been nice if they dropped a chest too, but i understand why they don’t, would’ve been unfair to low ar players
            Isn't that what world level is for?
                the world does scale, but low ar players have more difficulty killing ruin graders in their world than ar60 players
        Wait, which legend is a Fatui?
            Yseut - in the Liffey Region, west of the Statue of Seven.
    "ho ho! Look at this dumbass Fatui all by itself. I'm about to whoop its ass"

Famous last words
    The double mamtaray properly messed me up when I was too mesmerized to get the hydroculis. At least I got an achievement for it.
    They are a fun challenge  
\>hyperbloom
Worse than that was the fact fungi dropped the wrong materials if you used certain elements on them. And the other materials you didn't want were barely used anyways so it was like...WHY EVEN HAVE THIS DUMB MECHANIC
    this part was mostly fine


it plays into how dendro interacts with other elements and adds a layer to farming, I did not mind it at all since it's mega rare to need all the types of mats at the same time.
        >this part was mostly fine

It's only fine when your mains aren't Klee and Fischl.

Seriously, most of my overworld-friendly characters are either pyro or electro. Everything else requires either a burst or an electro interaction to either do damage or have adequate damage projection. Doing a full party burst just to kill 3 shrooms is pain.
            maybe it's because my account is really old, I don't really have that kind of problem.


or hadnt since Liyue I think.
                Nah, I play since 1.0. It's not about account age, more about character preference.

Basically the only real option for me to deal real non-burst non-pyro/electro damage is cryo swirl.
                    I mean, you can always build a bloom team
    that mechanic is fine, I want more mechanics like that imo, it's rare for games these days to not feel like waterslides where you never have to activate a single neuron to "play" them. 

having to take two secs to make a team that generates the kinds of mats you want isn't remotely an issue as youre making it out to be, once or twice, okay, after the third time that's on you fam

post that image where it's like "you have 100 chars yet you choose only pyro" or smth

tl;dr: in a game that's all about options in combat and mix and matching teammates, complaining about one of six elements messing up a result is silly af
>and it felt way more fluid than previous areas.

hah
    It's 100% true though
        He is probably laughing at the "fluid" pun
    *rimshot*
Full Map 100%er here, too.

And I *hated* 100%ing Liyue. In my opinion, it had the tightest restrictions and is the only place that required the sigils (they were hidden in the sides of mountains and stuff). Ugh...
    Same liyue and mondstat have horrible world design for exploration (or atleast you can tell they lacked experience).

They really started improving quality of exploration in sumeru (but fucked up by not having underground map / locking half the map behind quests)
        Eeeh, I actually like Mond and Liyue. 

I like that many Mond puzzles are written into environment. It's some old ruins, churl camps, abyss mage mesas, chests hidden in bushes, some points that look off (like anemo slimes orbiting trees, suspiciously placed items e.t.c.). It's not like the new trend of treasure chests just sitting in the middle of an open field.

And I like Liyue level design. Specifically Jueyun Karst. It seems like climbing nightmare at the first glance, but there's a track that leads to the top taking you through all the puzzles and points of interests, and then you can explore by gliding around from the top.
    I have 95%+ in every location in the game, probably about 2/3 of them 100%, been playing since 2.0, got all chests/oculi etc. required for the achievements at least, and I'm still somehow missing 5 time trials in Liyue and I have no fucking clue where they are.
        > and I'm still somehow missing 5 time trials in Liyue and I have no fucking clue where they are.

Try the interactive map at that point.
        Yea it bugs me that "100%" doesn't actually mean 100%.
    The sigils on the side of mountains don't give exploration % though
Tbh I've felt like all the regions have been pretty easy to 100% since Mondstadt and Liyue. If you just walk everywhere in the region you usually end up with 100%, as Inazuma, Enka, Chasm, Sumeru, and Fontaine don't have many chests that are just behind a wall or something, most of the chests are either puzzles which are hard to miss, or are being guarded by a horde of enemies in which case its even harder to miss. Mondstadt and Liyue were the hardest regions for me to 100% because like half the chests were just hidden somewhere without any giant red mark that says "chest here", and this is from someone who 100% every region. Like, without the treasure compass, I may have given up on Mondstadt and Liyue, but in the other regions I basically didn't use it at all.
I agree, Inazuma/Enka/Chasm was my favorite era of Genshin content, all the areas felt like you had to really watch where you were going.
We might not be able to cancel the blue portals because they often transition from above and below water.  Someone else in this thread suggested it but it would make a lot of sense if this transition bugged out when canceled at at certain times, so they just locked it.
    yeah wasnt a big problem for me, maybe misclicked once or twice but normally ud want to ride it out til the end anyways
Idk dude underwater got boring so quick.
But getting drops sucked ass because they were locked behind non-dps elements. Preventing players from using pyro or electro (despite being necessary for proper exploration in Sumeru) was some bullshite.
    This was a huge issue and a stupid design point. They wanted to do something different, tried it, and only found that it really limited team building.
Yeah, exactly this sentiment. I love just roaming and cutting enemies to pieces, I have fun and passively farm at the same time
I digress, this was one of the most annoying things about exploring Sumeru. I noticed that every objective will have a conveniently placed Fungi or Hilichurls nearby. Want to play the lyre to a gloomy path? Oops, you just aggroed that fungi nearby. 

The enemies weren't a big deal, but it becomes annoying once you experience it enough. Hyv knew what they were doing with the enemy placements
    This is probably the difference between a recent account and an old account.

For me, exploration enemies can be easily ignored with a shield and Yae Miko's turrets and Yae Miko's elemental skill has mobility so I don't even have to stop one bit.

I do appreciate more being able to farm more mats without having to join other ppl's worlds which is far more annoying imo.
        i dont think so. im an older player but i find it annoying because enemies with aggro limit you from doing things like switching your party or doing certain puzzles. because of that, i gotta stop and drop everything im doing to clear out any nearby enemies before i can even proceed with doing what i gotta. it still eats up more time than it should be imo
            Is that an issue of mob density or the fact that summer puzzles are sometimes guarded by enemies intentionally?

Anyway I don't think some small mushroms wandering around can stall more than a couple hits which is something that happens while I am still moving to the puzze itself.
                it isn't even as though puzzles are guarded by enemies. sometimes they're just lurking nearby, you try to get by them without needing to fight and you still somehow aggro them. so you gotta kill them off first and foremost, even though they have no correlation with the puzzle you were heading toward other than just being on the way.
        >so I don't even have to stop one bit.

My FOMO is so strong that I am unable to ignore their drops. So I have to stop and pick up their crap all the time. Worst if a drop falls down a cliff and I just have to jump after it, no matter how long it delays me :(

I mean, I only have like 3k grey drops, I could desperately need the 3,001st mask and if I not pick it up now, I'll be sorry then! ;)
    The best way to get rid of an enemy is to make a friend.
My problem with Sumeru enemies were less about the number and more about the character lockouts. All my most well-built and favorite characters and teams use electro and pyro, and to be restricted to not using those elements or the many reactions that they use specifically because it messes up the fungus drops was supremely frustrating. Basically only mono-geo, freeze, or freeze-swirl teams were viable, with bloom being weaker because you can't trigger it's sub-reactions. The whole fungus mat drop felt very restrictive.
I think it's just that in fontaine you can ignore 95% of the wildlife and they will leave you alone unless you attack them first.
> more available enemies makes grinding mats so much more pleasant 

But Fontaine enemies also drop more materials, don't they? At least it feels as if those water dudes and strange purple ball thingies drop more materials upon dead than any other enemy.
    Weapon material enemies are different, but yes, hydro phantasms have a fantastic droprate. Aberrants and mechs are more in line with fungi and eremites.
Same for me. I like puzzles that make me think, not run around and find stuffs. Inazuma is the best so far.
    [deleted]
        They toned down the difficulty in Sumeru because a lot of casuals hated the difficulty of Inazuma’s (I know a lot of people). So they increased the amount of puzzles, but made them kids puzzles. They really should not have gone through with that, I expected Sumeru to be way more challenging.
I still remember how good it felt figuring out the sudoku blocks and the light up tiles in Seirai. It provided great contrast to the combat. The chest rewards however, did not match the effort imo.
Agree on fontaine puzzles. There's nothing puzzling about the Arhke or timing your hits on the up down ringy thingy. Not to mention we've done the light up totems in order where you just check the number of objects next to it too many times now. Not every puzzle should be 3D sudoku of course but at least few that make me scratch my head would be appreciated.
I think it’s more dead brain than sumeru because at least the desert puzzles require me to look around and there are variations in the puzzles. We have the fontaine expansion this patch but the puzzles are still pretty much the same, hit the totems, get the droplets and that arkhe puzzles that require no brain cell to solve. 
Inazuma puzzles are still the best for me tho. Sudoku puzzle is just that great and my only complain i have there is the shitty rewards.
I liked the idea in Inazuma where you had to do each major questline for the (unique) blueprint, but obviously the caveat is that you have to do every major questline for the blueprint. Lol.  


Made the Inazuma weapons a lot more personal though.
    Yeah weapon blueprints were pretty cool rewards for exploration, they did it in dragonspine too although the weapons themselves being questionable (especially the spear). Once again I believe they don't want to hide them into exploration, but let's be real, if you don't like exploration you probably didn't play the right game to begin with (plus we have on of the best craftable - the catch, and the pipe weapon also look very decent, locked behind fishing which is not exactly better.
It did have an oculi, I wonder if they’ll gate another one behind that much effort too or if this is the one you can skip to still max the statue
    It was so annoying using the gadget to hunt oculi and it would just always go on that one, like, 'I marked it, I just haven't found the last rock yet and I don't want to go rock hunting now, I'm oculus hunting'.
Yeah but this are not important and very short. Lore quest and world quests are not locked anymore and those are the important ones. The rest are for the same as the dailies. Yo go for 3 minutes and that’s it, next.
At least the blubberbeast one was only timegated by a few hours per stage of the quest and not a whole day. For me personally it’s not a quest I actively did, just whenever I remembered to, but if you did and you logged in 2-3 times a day you could finish it in like 2 days
    It’s about 7 hours of time gate per stage so not too bad yeah.
can you inform me which quest in meropide is timegated? is it more than one?
    The quests after you did after game of the riches like art of negotiation,debt creditor and some others that i forgot
        Yeah but those are usually unlocked one reset after completing a prior quest.

Inazuma had multiple quests that were timegated across like 5-6 days. IIRC Tsurumi took around 4~ days and Xavier's Tatara Tales requires, what, 7-8 days? It was WAY more ridiculous than Fontaine or Sumeru making you wait one day after completing a quest.
To me Inazuma still is the peak level design of all regions. Every island has its own theme, you can easily recognize what place it is just by looking at someone's picture. Great point of interest setup so when you expand your view to the landscape, you can mark your own destination and dont have to constantly search in the map. Good enemies design. Harder and fun puzzles for you to think a bit not just run around doing chores. 

About the rewards in inazuma each blueprint has an individual quest. You receive it right after the quest so it feels much more rewarding this way than sumeru's/fontain's design choice. The fontain's blueprints are the worst both in the way you get them and their actual usage. Also The Catch is by far the strongest permanent free weapon in the game
    > you can easily recognize what place it is just by looking at someone's picture  
  
To be honest I feel like that is true for most of the map. Case in point [Lost in Teyvat](https://lostinteyvat.app/)
i’ve finished everything in fontaine except for the fortress, it’s just too boring
Yeah and most of the things you can interact with only work within a quest so the exploration is really limited there, barring a few chests here and there (like in the abandoned production area). Meropide was mostly a disappointment to me outside of Wry's quest.
the entirety of the Fontaine archon quest is a visual novel, not just ch 3-4 lol.
    I sure do prefer the trials to Meropide though. Confining 80% of 4.1's AQ to Meropide is not a decision I was the biggest fan of, even if the actual story was interesting.
Sometimes I feel like the only person who likes Meropide
    Which is fine, it's not like it was badly written compared to any other story in Genshin, I just prefer actual game play with combat and puzzle solving. I'm not knocking people who are into the visual novel type of gameplay, but I just thought it was weird to completely cut people who like combat and actually *playing the game* out of consideration for the questline.
        I thought it was very atmospheric. The monotony of it was a good reflection of how life just vanished into routine in a place like that
Same here. Tsurumi was kinda impossible without timegating, and it was one of the best explorations in the game, especially the fog.

I also do a hot take and confess I really liked the Tatarasuna quest, and timegating was a big part of why.
    I fucking loathed the time gating. I forget things a lot...
Same! Sumeru exploration was fun to me. The goals were set and so it was just “find the thing”, like for the obelisks and stone slates. It wasn’t just wandering aimlessly, there was a checklist. Find all the stone slates, find the aranara, go through the ruins in the sumeru desert, etc.
I found the game so much more fun when my dailies were still set to random. I just can't do any more Ella quests.
This is part of the reason I still do mining routes and artifact investigation routes because I get to explore all the previous areas.
I’m still finding random common chests all over Sumeru and Liyue. They are just hidden in little spots and blend in with the environment, it’s so fun to find them! Like the ones that are on rooftops. It’s just so much more fun than one exquisite chest in the middle of an open field
    Exactly! It gives a reason to explore again! Also there's a nostalgia factor to it as an ar60 player and finding chests in liyue/mondstadt. 

On this note, I actually like puzzle locked areas/rooms etc because you have to explore the place later again to get to the puzzle (ex. Sumeru pyramid)
im pretty sure there is 100+ fontemer aberrant 😭
Why would you need MORE fontemer aberrant 😭😭😭 there's already so many
Did he stutter?
I’m pretty sure they meant to say constipated haha. It’s a running joke in the community now.
    First time I've heard of it then
        I believe it came to be because of how frustratingly difficult they were to fight during a couple of abyss cycles especially since they came in pairs.

Not only were they tanky, hard hitting and had a short window to exploit their weakness but the way they were programmed to move would cause your character to get stun locked and pushed around so much that you couldn't switch characters or use skills/bursts properly.

It was pretty much, or at least felt like a broken enemy rather than something well designed and balanced.
It's kinda mid compared to other regions. It's wild to see that many upvotes for op. (And yes I've done all exploration except for a few quests up to 4.1). Underwater looks the same everywhere, the combat underwater gets boring real quick and the scenery is both on land and underwater quite repetetive. Fontaine feels pretty empty when it comes to puzzles/chests as well. Less enemies don't help with that feeling.

Stories (world quests and most of the archon quest) are good tbh, but without them Fontaine would've been one of my least liked regions. When it comes to exploration only it might just be my least liked region.
I loved the Aranara and Jeht quests but the fact there were no 'breaks' in them besides Jeht's being forcibly split across patches because of unreleased regions, it was painful. Especially because you needed to progress pretty far into the Aranara quest to get to portions of Sumeru at all! (Not counting Old Aranara, I liked how it was locked off honestly) If they had simply put the progression for the lyre early on at the minimum, and had the Aranara quest properly broken up so you could take a breather and not accidentally stumble into the next portion that leads into a fight, it would have been better.
    Tbh the worst part of the aranara quest isn't that it locks stuff off, it's that it locks *parts* of everything off.  Like if you want to explore on your own, every time you find a treasure chest there's a lyre 'puzzle' nearby and then an aranara that you also can't interact with until you complete basically the entire quest so no matter how much you explore it doesn't matter because you will have to comb the entire region again later.

It's the first, and only, time in the game where I've actually felt *punished* for wanting to explore first and quest later and it left an incredibly bad taste in my mouth.
        Yeah it definitely felt like the forest was 'find out then fuck around' while the desert was very fuck around and find out. Forest wanted to hold your hand and show you against your will before you found it on your own while the desert threw you into hell without a map like genuinely I'm glad the desert wasn't utilized in the AQ because that was way too annoying to traverse.
same man
Nobody forces you to explore. Wth do you mean by respecting the player's time?

It's just a neat little "I brought Lynette so I don't have to climb that huge tree to get it, lucky me!", and I appreciate it both when I do bring both Arkhes and get that relief, and when I want to play a specific team and don't have to switch it up all the time.
    There's you and there's my sister who dispite having Lyney in her team chose to grab the orb instead because, "I didn't want to cheat"
        I did the same but that’s cause I completely forgot Lyney/Lynette could do that
        Honestly same though, lol. I like seeing where the devs hide the Arkhe orbs in relation to their objectives so I always go for them, despite running around with a team of Traveler + the Fatui siblings. It's worked very well thus far, aside from a single seelie puzzle in one of the big floating water cubes. For the life of me I couldn't find the orb so I resorted to cheating--just once. :(
        Boy Wanderer in Fontaine is so good, need to fly over this canyon? Check.
Need to fly over this lake? Check
Need to fly up this mountain? Check
Need to get this thing for puzzle? Check
Today i learned i could use characters for those puzzles and not hunt those orbs..
How much I hate it when I have to change the character for one puzzle and then a few meters away again.
To an extent, yes.

But there are two sizes of pressure plate, a smaller one and a larger one. Baron Bunny was insufficient for the large ones, would only light up the inner ring. You could stand on them but to the best of my memory some also deactivated when not held down, so *needed* a Geo Construct.

Edit: Slight wording change, I was tired.
    You could trigger the large plates by having both baron bunny and the active character stand on them, but you are correct in that it wouldn't matter for the ones which required constant pressure.
    Amber's C4 hype
        I have amber c3 after 3 years 🥲
            Yall have cons on your Amber..?
    I've been dripping baron bunny AND then also stepping on the pressure plate and it works so I never though about using geo constructs 😐
    You can solve them with Klee, each bomb from her E counts as a full character so you just need to push two onto the center of the big ones and it still works, while also not requiring you to stand on it so timed ones can still be completed as well (though you have to spend time pushing them around and they're shorter duration than a typical geo construct so you kinda have to hustle).

It's not really a *good* way to solve them lol, it's just a fun little exploration hack
Honestly makes me wonder how they'll handle Furina underwater. Like would she be stuck in whatever alignment you had before diving or would she be able to swap underwater?
    Give her both types on her attack ? Not like it'd matter a lot
Getting Furina means I can get it it done without even changing teams.
[deleted]
    Well, the maps pins are coming. Not sure if it’s for 4.2, but they said they will be adding more (I think it’s going up to 200?). But I didn’t know you can do that in HSR. That’s pretty cool and also a good thing because I’ve noticed that Genshin has been adding somethings from HSR into Genshin like the option to complete dailies by just doing random stuff instead of the actual dailies themselves. Hopefully, they add the switching elements on the fly into Genshin.
        IIRC Traveler has been shown in a few cutscenes to switch elements on the fly. My theory is that once all seven nations are fully accessible we'll be able to unlock it via the extra -oculus of each region after fully upgrading that region's statue to 10.
I still wish each element of Traveler counted as a separate character in the party select that just shared a health bar. Traveler's never gonna get a new ability to switch elements on the fly in combat, but if it cost a party slot to do so then it would be just like making any other team.
So did Mihoyo 💀
I remembered that they came in pairs or occasionally triplets, and that you could activate them by stepping on them, so I assumed they were coop puzzles.
There are also a couple places where there are rock formations that are obviously missing a rock. Dropping a construct into position spawns a chest.
    what where, I remember exploding some rocks but not slotting a rock into place
99% of the puzzles have pneuma or osia blocks right next to the puzzle somewhere. So you can solve all of it without needing to swap characters. 

Only a very small amount of puzzles, less than like 5, might require you to look around more for the penuma or osira blocks.
Events are irrelevant because if you started playing after the event and you need a character from an event, you’re screwed.

I started playing at the end of 1.2 and every guide for Razor I saw said to use Fischl since everybody got her for free from an event. Well, the event had already ended when I started playing and it wasn’t until 2.2 that I got her.

That being said, I don’t think Sucrose was ever given away, since 1.1 was Fischl and we got Missive Windspear for the last Mondstadt event. We also got Cinnabar for Shadows Amidst Snowstorms and I don’t think Sucrose has played a major role in any events where we got a 4*.

We did get a free Faruzan so maybe you’re thinking of her
Afaik they haven't given out Mondstadt characters that you could choose, that happened wice with Liyue though (iirc).
Might not count since newer players can't get it
Lynette is permanently free
They really nailed the swimming control, which is weird because it's largely based on Sorush control and Sorush felt rigid as fuck.
    "Sorush flew so we could swim" as the proverb says.
    Sorush felt bad because she didn't use camera controls.

Swimming works based on your camera direction so it feels WAY smoother.
i was legit so worried they'll make swimming like that drone control from sumeru where you need to press a button to go up or down. 

first thing I checked in fontaine and was overjoyed that swimming is completely organic. this is the only game ive played where swimming actually feels like swimming and not just reskinned flying
Swimming in fontaine is like playing a remake of a ps1 or ps2 games I never played and feel that the control is good.

Or just GTA SA pilot school, played on PC
I have finally been doing story quests. Doing just 1 part is considered big enough to count as all 4 commissions.
i'm using it to catch up on worldquests in other regions like inazuma, i'm halfway to getting my teapot style for inazuma and the daily amount of activities is perfect for me where i play for a good amount of time and am left wanting more for tomorrow

my burnout evaporated into nothing after this feature came out lolll, genshin went from daily chore simulator back to a chillaxing exploration story game. at the pace i'm going it'll take me around 2 and a half years just to clear the existing zones not including fontaine, aka i'll literally never run out of stuff for encounter points
i like the sumeru desert underground for the same reason you hate it lol
"Reality? Is pain."
There's one in the middle of that boiling lake that got me and it goes *far* away lol
I remember there was one day when I happened to get two different chests that spawned a hydro ball travel ring thingy when opened. The first one automatically deposited its contents into inventory, like some of the ones positioned right next to cliffs. The other one spilled its contents as objects, and my next button press activated the ring that had just spawned and dumped me two zipcodes away.
    Was it the one on the tiny island with the Hilichurl Rogue on it
        That one got me as well. But there's at least one more.
Really? In my experience the chest rewards still stay where it spawned for a long time so you can actually go back and pick it up.
there were so many in inazuma... fucking novel, cooking party, the combat guy by the beach etc
I have still not completed gone in the wind from monstadt and that pirate commission from liyue...
I'm still in Inazuma trying to get the Gourmet Achievement for that one Sumeru World Quest
I've gotten Yurgan's "water the flower" quest like 20 times since finishing the line and killing the whopperflower for the achievement. 

It just randomly pulling 1 of the many NPC based comms in a region doesn't help much when there are so many. I still need to answer 6 questions for the one guy in Sumeru cause it keeps giving the same questions. I haven't gotten Doctor's Orders since giving the first patient the extra part. It still hasn't given me the last step of Farghani's measurement comms. I was on the last stage of Garcia's comm chain and then got the first stage twice instead of being able to finish it.

I'm very aware that it pulls one NPC comm per day, but it is so bloated with random shit that it might as well be fully RNG. It took a whole year to do Garcia's line. There are still people trying to do the Tales of Winter achievement that's been in since 1.0. This system is not good!
    > I still need to answer 6 questions for the one guy in Sumeru cause it keeps giving the same questions.

You can cheat here. Just answer 2 questions and then sever your connection to the internet.

Once you log in again the commission will start again from question 1 and the questions will be freshly randomized.

Rinse and repeat until you answered all six questions and only then answer a third to finish the commission.
    The big thing is commission rerolling tho, that's where the system has improved. They've also increased the number of 'rare' commissions in each cycle so people can finish the Glory achievement in around  a month now.
        WDYM commission rerolling?
            Think of commission cycles as the list [A B C D...], with each letter corresponding to a certain NPC commission. Currently, when daily commissions are given, there is a chance for one commission from this list to be given at random. Obviously, the pool of commissions is larger in game and also houses multiple of the same commission ([A A A B B C D D E..], for example) which is why some commissions come up more than others, but to explain the concepts of commission cycles and rerolling let's just consider a list of 3 commissions [A B C]. 

When a commission is completed, it is removed from the list. So if you complete commission C, then the list now looks like [A B]. The next time daily commissions are given, you can only receive commissions A or B. You won't see commission C again until the list is *completely* emptied out upon which it refills and the cycle begins anew. This is the logic behind commission cycles.

Now, what if commission A has multiple outcomes needed for an achievement? (We will call these outcomes A-1, A-2, A-3.) When commission A is given, the outcome chosen is randomized. Say you need A-2, but have been given A-1. Completing A-1 will remove commission A from the list, but if you *don't* complete it at all, then commission A will return to the list and you will have another chance to get A-2. 

This is commission rerolling. By neglecting to finish specific commissions, eventually your list of NPC commissions will be reduced to just [A] and you can consistently 'reroll' it until you get the outcome you want without having to sit and suffer through the entire list again.

Before, we had to go to other people's worlds to do dailies to skip but with the encounter points system we can now skip in single-player, making this system much more relevant now.
                That only works if the player has access to things that give encounter points. If they've fully explored and done all quests, then they either miss out on daily rewards or just have to hope they get the right step each time.

I also just had a set of comms that was No honour among thieves, Impregnable defense, Touring light show, and Hammer of the mushrooms. So the guaranteed NPC comm per day doesn't even work right.
                    * Yeah, you need encounter points, but for 90% of each patch you have events. By not immediately collecting rewards, you can 'save' them and use them at a later date. Encounter points are awarded when the rewards are claimed, not when the challenge is completed. Same goes for chests. If you care about getting the achievements you can complete a few chests, leave them unclaimed, and mark them on the map for future encounter points.

* NPC commissions are NOT guaranteed every day. As I said, "there is a chance for" an NPC commission to be given each day.
I think that's what 'No RNG commission quests' is referring to - you can get all the Fontaine quest achievements in one cycle and there aren't branching variations, rather than Sumeru's waiting for the right version of the quest to turn up, sometimes having to progress the quest to discover which instead of being able to skip it and get a different version within the same cycle. Cycles themselves came in with Sumeru, this is how the cycle system and commissions interact in Fontaine.
    Pretty sure Fontaine has a comm where you need 3 diff versions
        Yeah I have isadora quest more than 5 times now without facing livre once.
        You can get the Their Childhood chain, Aesthetic Critique chain, and the Get a Drink At Least! chain achievements in the one cycle because all the quests appear in the one cycle. The only way you can miss Get a Drink at Least and What is the Meaning of Work is if you don't know the correct answers to proceed the chain or add the alternate version.

It is not like Sumeru where you don't know which version you get until you have proceeded the quest beyond being able to park it if it's not the one you need, or you can go several cycles without getting the version you need for the achievement, such as with the fertilizer quest and the fortune quest.
Hey, just wanted to say if your on pc you could use Raw Accel to modify your x/y ratio of your mouse to a ratio of 2.95 and it would cause vertical and horizontal movement to match up in game
    Oh, I meant to specify on console/using a controller! I edited my original comment. Yeah, it's fine on PC, no issues there with K+M.

Are you saying it's the same way with a mouse, though? I've never noticed if so. EDIT: Just checked and there's no speed/accel difference on PC. I think it's just an issue with controllers. I need to make a video on the subject, it's a huge difference.
        Played on PlayStation since launch (PS4 then PS5) and *hate* how slow the vertical camera is.

Also, the button layouts constantly changing is infuriating. I noticed in Spiral Abyss today that the "Check Enemies" button changes between floors. Wtf?
            > the "Check Enemies" button changes between floors

This absolutely should cost the jobs of the programming leads/project managers. It doesn’t spark confidence at all if those kind of stuff get missed in the appraisal or testing phase.
Yea the different x and y axis sensitivity on controller drives me insane. I thought we were finally save when they introduced separate sliders in the options, but at max on both it's just what the game usually is :(
Subnautica says hello.

Both controls and feels are almost identical on PC.
I usually hate underwater areas of games but holy shit, is their underwater mechanisms/feel/aesthetic/control really blowing every other game out of the water (pun intended, lol)
    Genshin Impact is the only game I have ever played by to add underwater mechanics years after the game initially launched and actually be better for it. 

Looking at you FFXIV and Planetside 2
        And World of Warcraft. That one underwater zone from Cataclysm is legendary for how much hate it gets.
            Unless you play Druid and enjoy moving FAST. The swimming speed buff you get there stacks multiplicatively with the speed buff from aquatic form, so you end up zooming around way faster than flying speed.
        ffxiv underwater is deadass just their shitty flying but under water with the bare minimum of animation changes even. 

so bad.
    Despite this, there are voices among the community which complain that elemental reactions are not utilized underwater 

I.e Kaeya freezing opponents under water using Elemental Burst.

How Hoyo has dropped the ball on perfecting Elemental Reaction so badly they need to introduce the light and dark energy in Fontaine and it's all a case of failure in game design and planning as it reduce the need to roll for new character. (Why would I roll if everyone's the same underwater)

The shifting of HP mechanics (Neavilette, Lyney, Lynette) is also called the outcome of Hoyo not smart enough to design better Elemental Reaction and had to resort to introduction of gimmicks, which will make artifact farming even more tedious because these character require different set, and Hoyo will bleed players as well as losing potential new players because the game is becoming more and more "new player unfriendly"

Some people are impossible to please.
        See, this makes me sad because that's a seperate feature from the underwater mechanics. Like, the focus should be on controls, colors, atmosphere, deco, landscaping, etc.

Because I have similar complaints too, but I see it as having nothing to do with discussing their underwater mechanics because it's only something that has to do with combat, not navigating and experiencing
> lack of a Horse

I really hope mounts get implemented at some point. It'd give the game yet another refreshing feeling.
    I always thought sayu/yelan/wanderer serve as a form of mount (aka fast traversal), just not packaged in a way we expect.
        >yelan mount

😏

>sayu mount

🤨📸
    They could, but it'd have to be region locked yet again since the map was clearly designed with running in mind. 

Tower of Fantasy demonstrated the pitfall of designing the map around mounts and other quick traversal mechanics, being that it makes the map super empty and boring in opposition to genshin's current dense and controlled exploration design.

But Mihoyo's team could still probably pull it off as they did with underwater, so we'll probably see the explore the idea later.
        This is why WoW sucked when they introduced mounts apparently.
            every mmo world zones goes to shit the moment flying gets introduced. 

wow, ffxiv both demonstrate this and they're the two most popular mmos

aion is based for actually making flying a gameplay mechanic and not just a faster sprint
    A dune buggy, or balloon that spawns at waverider points.
        gimme the horse, i hope after wave rider we no longer get a generic vehicle where your char disappears into. i know its easier to do but its not immersive
    PLS no. Whenever a generalist movement option gets introduced in a game, any future content is made with said movement option in mind.

If they give you a mount, exploration without a mount will be unbearable in all subsequent zones.

The perfect example is ToF. People praise all the movement gadgets and mounts, but the game is literally unplayable without them.

Honestly I thank whatever hoyo high execs for making sumeru zoom points sumeru-exclusive.
        I think a desert only horse would be great but like you said, not smth that's available outside. 

It's also mihoyo where they're insanely careful with any new major potentially game changing mechanic so even if they unlock the horse I think they could do a good job with it. 

free flying though, unless it's like aion, then yeah, that's a hard no from me coz ive seen zero mmos survive having flying added
    they're literally sitting on a cash cow I hope they add it sometime in the future too
    fr, i was anti mounts, but i think the way they designed the desert, a mount is the missing piece to make it an enjoyable experience, and not some goofy ahhh lookin horse like the clownshoe boat, just gimme an actual horse that looks like a horse lol
    Imagine we can rent sumpter beasts in the desert area—they can code the mount to only be able to walk within the desert regions if they have to
Halfway across the map? What are you talking about? Every area has a shit ton of animals to get skills from, especially near teleports. You can even teleport to one area, get a skill you want, then teleport to another area, and use said skill like from the new area Jellyfish. 

Every puzzle has the animal you need near it too.

Swimming half the map? You're part of the 1%
Yeah I  love the underwater environment, but I really don't like the underwater combat either. It's way too simplistic and boring. I don't expect them to translate the above ground combat to underwater because that would be very hard, but I do wish it was a *little* bit more complex than: get animal ability, use on object/enemy, get reward. 

But I guess MHY is just trying to appeal to as many people as they can so it's to be expected.
Meh i disagree I have no issues with the underwater combat. It isn’t groundbreaking or anything but it does what it needs to do
Seems to be an unpopular opinion here, but the underwater parts of Fontaine are the absolute worst parts of the game.

The combat is braindead and dull, everything is very slow and unresponsive, and once you complete a couple of puzzles, you realize it's just a screensaver you're swimming through.
I do really appreciate the local legends, just... would it have hurt anything to have them drop, like, 10 times the usual amount of materials or something? Maybe one or two purple artifacts, as a treat? I get that the difficulty is the point, and it is fun, just why not, right?

Also it's hilarious that one of the local legends is a Fatui operative who could probably wipe the floor with Childe, lol
    Right? They give the same XP as regular enemies, not even the elite enemies, but take more time because of their inflated HP. That should come with commensurate drops/XP.
    It's the eternal Hoyo dilemma.

Make difficult content rewarding (Especially difficult content in the overworld, which is expected to be very easy), then you have casuals complaining that they are being locked out of rewards because they can't clear it.

Make it unrewarding, then players who can clear it complain why there are no rewards.

It's the unfortunate side effect of having such a diverse playerbase.
    > Also it's hilarious that one of the local legends is a Fatui operative who could probably wipe the floor with Childe

I could solo her with Childe if I cared to.
    would’ve been nice if they dropped a chest too, but i understand why they don’t, would’ve been unfair to low ar players
        Isn't that what world level is for?
            the world does scale, but low ar players have more difficulty killing ruin graders in their world than ar60 players
    Wait, which legend is a Fatui?

The double mamtaray properly messed me up when I was too mesmerized to get the hydroculis. At least I got an achievement for it.
They are a fun challenge  
\>hyperbloom
this part was mostly fine


it plays into how dendro interacts with other elements and adds a layer to farming, I did not mind it at all since it's mega rare to need all the types of mats at the same time.
    >this part was mostly fine

It's only fine when your mains aren't Klee and Fischl.

Seriously, most of my overworld-friendly characters are either pyro or electro. Everything else requires either a burst or an electro interaction to either do damage or have adequate damage projection. Doing a full party burst just to kill 3 shrooms is pain.
        maybe it's because my account is really old, I don't really have that kind of problem.


or hadnt since Liyue I think.
            Nah, I play since 1.0. It's not about account age, more about character preference.

Basically the only real option for me to deal real non-burst non-pyro/electro damage is cryo swirl.
                I mean, you can always build a bloom team
that mechanic is fine, I want more mechanics like that imo, it's rare for games these days to not feel like waterslides where you never have to activate a single neuron to "play" them. 

having to take two secs to make a team that generates the kinds of mats you want isn't remotely an issue as youre making it out to be, once or twice, okay, after the third time that's on you fam

post that image where it's like "you have 100 chars yet you choose only pyro" or smth

tl;dr: in a game that's all about options in combat and mix and matching teammates, complaining about one of six elements messing up a result is silly af
It's 100% true though
    He is probably laughing at the "fluid" pun
*rimshot*
Same liyue and mondstat have horrible world design for exploration (or atleast you can tell they lacked experience).

They really started improving quality of exploration in sumeru (but fucked up by not having underground map / locking half the map behind quests)
    Eeeh, I actually like Mond and Liyue. 

I like that many Mond puzzles are written into environment. It's some old ruins, churl camps, abyss mage mesas, chests hidden in bushes, some points that look off (like anemo slimes orbiting trees, suspiciously placed items e.t.c.). It's not like the new trend of treasure chests just sitting in the middle of an open field.

And I like Liyue level design. Specifically Jueyun Karst. It seems like climbing nightmare at the first glance, but there's a track that leads to the top taking you through all the puzzles and points of interests, and then you can explore by gliding around from the top.
I have 95%+ in every location in the game, probably about 2/3 of them 100%, been playing since 2.0, got all chests/oculi etc. required for the achievements at least, and I'm still somehow missing 5 time trials in Liyue and I have no fucking clue where they are.
    > and I'm still somehow missing 5 time trials in Liyue and I have no fucking clue where they are.

Try the interactive map at that point.
    Yea it bugs me that "100%" doesn't actually mean 100%.
The sigils on the side of mountains don't give exploration % though
yeah wasnt a big problem for me, maybe misclicked once or twice but normally ud want to ride it out til the end anyways
This was a huge issue and a stupid design point. They wanted to do something different, tried it, and only found that it really limited team building.
This is probably the difference between a recent account and an old account.

For me, exploration enemies can be easily ignored with a shield and Yae Miko's turrets and Yae Miko's elemental skill has mobility so I don't even have to stop one bit.

I do appreciate more being able to farm more mats without having to join other ppl's worlds which is far more annoying imo.
    i dont think so. im an older player but i find it annoying because enemies with aggro limit you from doing things like switching your party or doing certain puzzles. because of that, i gotta stop and drop everything im doing to clear out any nearby enemies before i can even proceed with doing what i gotta. it still eats up more time than it should be imo
        Is that an issue of mob density or the fact that summer puzzles are sometimes guarded by enemies intentionally?

Anyway I don't think some small mushroms wandering around can stall more than a couple hits which is something that happens while I am still moving to the puzze itself.
            it isn't even as though puzzles are guarded by enemies. sometimes they're just lurking nearby, you try to get by them without needing to fight and you still somehow aggro them. so you gotta kill them off first and foremost, even though they have no correlation with the puzzle you were heading toward other than just being on the way.
    >so I don't even have to stop one bit.

My FOMO is so strong that I am unable to ignore their drops. So I have to stop and pick up their crap all the time. Worst if a drop falls down a cliff and I just have to jump after it, no matter how long it delays me :(

I mean, I only have like 3k grey drops, I could desperately need the 3,001st mask and if I not pick it up now, I'll be sorry then! ;)
The best way to get rid of an enemy is to make a friend.
Weapon material enemies are different, but yes, hydro phantasms have a fantastic droprate. Aberrants and mechs are more in line with fungi and eremites.

    They toned down the difficulty in Sumeru because a lot of casuals hated the difficulty of Inazuma’s (I know a lot of people). So they increased the amount of puzzles, but made them kids puzzles. They really should not have gone through with that, I expected Sumeru to be way more challenging.
Yeah weapon blueprints were pretty cool rewards for exploration, they did it in dragonspine too although the weapons themselves being questionable (especially the spear). Once again I believe they don't want to hide them into exploration, but let's be real, if you don't like exploration you probably didn't play the right game to begin with (plus we have on of the best craftable - the catch, and the pipe weapon also look very decent, locked behind fishing which is not exactly better.
It was so annoying using the gadget to hunt oculi and it would just always go on that one, like, 'I marked it, I just haven't found the last rock yet and I don't want to go rock hunting now, I'm oculus hunting'.
It’s about 7 hours of time gate per stage so not too bad yeah.
The quests after you did after game of the riches like art of negotiation,debt creditor and some others that i forgot
    Yeah but those are usually unlocked one reset after completing a prior quest.

Inazuma had multiple quests that were timegated across like 5-6 days. IIRC Tsurumi took around 4~ days and Xavier's Tatara Tales requires, what, 7-8 days? It was WAY more ridiculous than Fontaine or Sumeru making you wait one day after completing a quest.
> you can easily recognize what place it is just by looking at someone's picture  
  
To be honest I feel like that is true for most of the map. Case in point [Lost in Teyvat](https://lostinteyvat.app/)
I sure do prefer the trials to Meropide though. Confining 80% of 4.1's AQ to Meropide is not a decision I was the biggest fan of, even if the actual story was interesting.
Which is fine, it's not like it was badly written compared to any other story in Genshin, I just prefer actual game play with combat and puzzle solving. I'm not knocking people who are into the visual novel type of gameplay, but I just thought it was weird to completely cut people who like combat and actually *playing the game* out of consideration for the questline.
    I thought it was very atmospheric. The monotony of it was a good reflection of how life just vanished into routine in a place like that
I fucking loathed the time gating. I forget things a lot...
Exactly! It gives a reason to explore again! Also there's a nostalgia factor to it as an ar60 player and finding chests in liyue/mondstadt. 

On this note, I actually like puzzle locked areas/rooms etc because you have to explore the place later again to get to the puzzle (ex. Sumeru pyramid)
First time I've heard of it then
    I believe it came to be because of how frustratingly difficult they were to fight during a couple of abyss cycles especially since they came in pairs.

Not only were they tanky, hard hitting and had a short window to exploit their weakness but the way they were programmed to move would cause your character to get stun locked and pushed around so much that you couldn't switch characters or use skills/bursts properly.

It was pretty much, or at least felt like a broken enemy rather than something well designed and balanced.
Tbh the worst part of the aranara quest isn't that it locks stuff off, it's that it locks *parts* of everything off.  Like if you want to explore on your own, every time you find a treasure chest there's a lyre 'puzzle' nearby and then an aranara that you also can't interact with until you complete basically the entire quest so no matter how much you explore it doesn't matter because you will have to comb the entire region again later.

It's the first, and only, time in the game where I've actually felt *punished* for wanting to explore first and quest later and it left an incredibly bad taste in my mouth.
    Yeah it definitely felt like the forest was 'find out then fuck around' while the desert was very fuck around and find out. Forest wanted to hold your hand and show you against your will before you found it on your own while the desert threw you into hell without a map like genuinely I'm glad the desert wasn't utilized in the AQ because that was way too annoying to traverse.
There's you and there's my sister who dispite having Lyney in her team chose to grab the orb instead because, "I didn't want to cheat"
    I did the same but that’s cause I completely forgot Lyney/Lynette could do that
    Honestly same though, lol. I like seeing where the devs hide the Arkhe orbs in relation to their objectives so I always go for them, despite running around with a team of Traveler + the Fatui siblings. It's worked very well thus far, aside from a single seelie puzzle in one of the big floating water cubes. For the life of me I couldn't find the orb so I resorted to cheating--just once. :(
    Boy Wanderer in Fontaine is so good, need to fly over this canyon? Check.
Need to fly over this lake? Check
Need to fly up this mountain? Check
Need to get this thing for puzzle? Check
You could trigger the large plates by having both baron bunny and the active character stand on them, but you are correct in that it wouldn't matter for the ones which required constant pressure.
Amber's C4 hype
    I have amber c3 after 3 years 🥲
        Yall have cons on your Amber..?
I've been dripping baron bunny AND then also stepping on the pressure plate and it works so I never though about using geo constructs 😐
You can solve them with Klee, each bomb from her E counts as a full character so you just need to push two onto the center of the big ones and it still works, while also not requiring you to stand on it so timed ones can still be completed as well (though you have to spend time pushing them around and they're shorter duration than a typical geo construct so you kinda have to hustle).

It's not really a *good* way to solve them lol, it's just a fun little exploration hack
Give her both types on her attack ? Not like it'd matter a lot
Well, the maps pins are coming. Not sure if it’s for 4.2, but they said they will be adding more (I think it’s going up to 200?). But I didn’t know you can do that in HSR. That’s pretty cool and also a good thing because I’ve noticed that Genshin has been adding somethings from HSR into Genshin like the option to complete dailies by just doing random stuff instead of the actual dailies themselves. Hopefully, they add the switching elements on the fly into Genshin.
    IIRC Traveler has been shown in a few cutscenes to switch elements on the fly. My theory is that once all seven nations are fully accessible we'll be able to unlock it via the extra -oculus of each region after fully upgrading that region's statue to 10.
what where, I remember exploding some rocks but not slotting a rock into place
"Sorush flew so we could swim" as the proverb says.
Sorush felt bad because she didn't use camera controls.

Swimming works based on your camera direction so it feels WAY smoother.
Was it the one on the tiny island with the Hilichurl Rogue on it
    That one got me as well. But there's at least one more.
> I still need to answer 6 questions for the one guy in Sumeru cause it keeps giving the same questions.

You can cheat here. Just answer 2 questions and then sever your connection to the internet.

Once you log in again the commission will start again from question 1 and the questions will be freshly randomized.

Rinse and repeat until you answered all six questions and only then answer a third to finish the commission.
The big thing is commission rerolling tho, that's where the system has improved. They've also increased the number of 'rare' commissions in each cycle so people can finish the Glory achievement in around  a month now.
    WDYM commission rerolling?
        Think of commission cycles as the list [A B C D...], with each letter corresponding to a certain NPC commission. Currently, when daily commissions are given, there is a chance for one commission from this list to be given at random. Obviously, the pool of commissions is larger in game and also houses multiple of the same commission ([A A A B B C D D E..], for example) which is why some commissions come up more than others, but to explain the concepts of commission cycles and rerolling let's just consider a list of 3 commissions [A B C]. 

When a commission is completed, it is removed from the list. So if you complete commission C, then the list now looks like [A B]. The next time daily commissions are given, you can only receive commissions A or B. You won't see commission C again until the list is *completely* emptied out upon which it refills and the cycle begins anew. This is the logic behind commission cycles.

Now, what if commission A has multiple outcomes needed for an achievement? (We will call these outcomes A-1, A-2, A-3.) When commission A is given, the outcome chosen is randomized. Say you need A-2, but have been given A-1. Completing A-1 will remove commission A from the list, but if you *don't* complete it at all, then commission A will return to the list and you will have another chance to get A-2. 

This is commission rerolling. By neglecting to finish specific commissions, eventually your list of NPC commissions will be reduced to just [A] and you can consistently 'reroll' it until you get the outcome you want without having to sit and suffer through the entire list again.

Before, we had to go to other people's worlds to do dailies to skip but with the encounter points system we can now skip in single-player, making this system much more relevant now.
            That only works if the player has access to things that give encounter points. If they've fully explored and done all quests, then they either miss out on daily rewards or just have to hope they get the right step each time.

I also just had a set of comms that was No honour among thieves, Impregnable defense, Touring light show, and Hammer of the mushrooms. So the guaranteed NPC comm per day doesn't even work right.
                * Yeah, you need encounter points, but for 90% of each patch you have events. By not immediately collecting rewards, you can 'save' them and use them at a later date. Encounter points are awarded when the rewards are claimed, not when the challenge is completed. Same goes for chests. If you care about getting the achievements you can complete a few chests, leave them unclaimed, and mark them on the map for future encounter points.

* NPC commissions are NOT guaranteed every day. As I said, "there is a chance for" an NPC commission to be given each day.
Pretty sure Fontaine has a comm where you need 3 diff versions
    Yeah I have isadora quest more than 5 times now without facing livre once.
    You can get the Their Childhood chain, Aesthetic Critique chain, and the Get a Drink At Least! chain achievements in the one cycle because all the quests appear in the one cycle. The only way you can miss Get a Drink at Least and What is the Meaning of Work is if you don't know the correct answers to proceed the chain or add the alternate version.

It is not like Sumeru where you don't know which version you get until you have proceeded the quest beyond being able to park it if it's not the one you need, or you can go several cycles without getting the version you need for the achievement, such as with the fertilizer quest and the fortune quest.
Oh, I meant to specify on console/using a controller! I edited my original comment. Yeah, it's fine on PC, no issues there with K+M.

Are you saying it's the same way with a mouse, though? I've never noticed if so. EDIT: Just checked and there's no speed/accel difference on PC. I think it's just an issue with controllers. I need to make a video on the subject, it's a huge difference.
    Played on PlayStation since launch (PS4 then PS5) and *hate* how slow the vertical camera is.

Also, the button layouts constantly changing is infuriating. I noticed in Spiral Abyss today that the "Check Enemies" button changes between floors. Wtf?
        > the "Check Enemies" button changes between floors

This absolutely should cost the jobs of the programming leads/project managers. It doesn’t spark confidence at all if those kind of stuff get missed in the appraisal or testing phase.
Genshin Impact is the only game I have ever played by to add underwater mechanics years after the game initially launched and actually be better for it. 

Looking at you FFXIV and Planetside 2
    And World of Warcraft. That one underwater zone from Cataclysm is legendary for how much hate it gets.
        Unless you play Druid and enjoy moving FAST. The swimming speed buff you get there stacks multiplicatively with the speed buff from aquatic form, so you end up zooming around way faster than flying speed.
    ffxiv underwater is deadass just their shitty flying but under water with the bare minimum of animation changes even. 

so bad.
Despite this, there are voices among the community which complain that elemental reactions are not utilized underwater 

I.e Kaeya freezing opponents under water using Elemental Burst.

How Hoyo has dropped the ball on perfecting Elemental Reaction so badly they need to introduce the light and dark energy in Fontaine and it's all a case of failure in game design and planning as it reduce the need to roll for new character. (Why would I roll if everyone's the same underwater)

The shifting of HP mechanics (Neavilette, Lyney, Lynette) is also called the outcome of Hoyo not smart enough to design better Elemental Reaction and had to resort to introduction of gimmicks, which will make artifact farming even more tedious because these character require different set, and Hoyo will bleed players as well as losing potential new players because the game is becoming more and more "new player unfriendly"

Some people are impossible to please.
    See, this makes me sad because that's a seperate feature from the underwater mechanics. Like, the focus should be on controls, colors, atmosphere, deco, landscaping, etc.

Because I have similar complaints too, but I see it as having nothing to do with discussing their underwater mechanics because it's only something that has to do with combat, not navigating and experiencing
I always thought sayu/yelan/wanderer serve as a form of mount (aka fast traversal), just not packaged in a way we expect.
    >yelan mount

😏

>sayu mount

🤨📸
They could, but it'd have to be region locked yet again since the map was clearly designed with running in mind. 

Tower of Fantasy demonstrated the pitfall of designing the map around mounts and other quick traversal mechanics, being that it makes the map super empty and boring in opposition to genshin's current dense and controlled exploration design.

But Mihoyo's team could still probably pull it off as they did with underwater, so we'll probably see the explore the idea later.
    This is why WoW sucked when they introduced mounts apparently.
        every mmo world zones goes to shit the moment flying gets introduced. 

wow, ffxiv both demonstrate this and they're the two most popular mmos

aion is based for actually making flying a gameplay mechanic and not just a faster sprint
A dune buggy, or balloon that spawns at waverider points.
    gimme the horse, i hope after wave rider we no longer get a generic vehicle where your char disappears into. i know its easier to do but its not immersive
PLS no. Whenever a generalist movement option gets introduced in a game, any future content is made with said movement option in mind.

If they give you a mount, exploration without a mount will be unbearable in all subsequent zones.

The perfect example is ToF. People praise all the movement gadgets and mounts, but the game is literally unplayable without them.

Honestly I thank whatever hoyo high execs for making sumeru zoom points sumeru-exclusive.
    I think a desert only horse would be great but like you said, not smth that's available outside. 

It's also mihoyo where they're insanely careful with any new major potentially game changing mechanic so even if they unlock the horse I think they could do a good job with it. 

free flying though, unless it's like aion, then yeah, that's a hard no from me coz ive seen zero mmos survive having flying added
they're literally sitting on a cash cow I hope they add it sometime in the future too
fr, i was anti mounts, but i think the way they designed the desert, a mount is the missing piece to make it an enjoyable experience, and not some goofy ahhh lookin horse like the clownshoe boat, just gimme an actual horse that looks like a horse lol
Imagine we can rent sumpter beasts in the desert area—they can code the mount to only be able to walk within the desert regions if they have to
Right? They give the same XP as regular enemies, not even the elite enemies, but take more time because of their inflated HP. That should come with commensurate drops/XP.
It's the eternal Hoyo dilemma.

Make difficult content rewarding (Especially difficult content in the overworld, which is expected to be very easy), then you have casuals complaining that they are being locked out of rewards because they can't clear it.

Make it unrewarding, then players who can clear it complain why there are no rewards.

It's the unfortunate side effect of having such a diverse playerbase.
> Also it's hilarious that one of the local legends is a Fatui operative who could probably wipe the floor with Childe

I could solo her with Childe if I cared to.
would’ve been nice if they dropped a chest too, but i understand why they don’t, would’ve been unfair to low ar players
    Isn't that what world level is for?
        the world does scale, but low ar players have more difficulty killing ruin graders in their world than ar60 players
Wait, which legend is a Fatui?

And World of Warcraft. That one underwater zone from Cataclysm is legendary for how much hate it gets.
    Unless you play Druid and enjoy moving FAST. The swimming speed buff you get there stacks multiplicatively with the speed buff from aquatic form, so you end up zooming around way faster than flying speed.
ffxiv underwater is deadass just their shitty flying but under water with the bare minimum of animation changes even. 

so bad.
See, this makes me sad because that's a seperate feature from the underwater mechanics. Like, the focus should be on controls, colors, atmosphere, deco, landscaping, etc.

Because I have similar complaints too, but I see it as having nothing to do with discussing their underwater mechanics because it's only something that has to do with combat, not navigating and experiencing
>yelan mount

😏

>sayu mount

🤨📸
This is why WoW sucked when they introduced mounts apparently.
    every mmo world zones goes to shit the moment flying gets introduced. 

wow, ffxiv both demonstrate this and they're the two most popular mmos

aion is based for actually making flying a gameplay mechanic and not just a faster sprint
gimme the horse, i hope after wave rider we no longer get a generic vehicle where your char disappears into. i know its easier to do but its not immersive
I think a desert only horse would be great but like you said, not smth that's available outside. 

It's also mihoyo where they're insanely careful with any new major potentially game changing mechanic so even if they unlock the horse I think they could do a good job with it. 

free flying though, unless it's like aion, then yeah, that's a hard no from me coz ive seen zero mmos survive having flying added
Isn't that what world level is for?
    the world does scale, but low ar players have more difficulty killing ruin graders in their world than ar60 players
Yseut - in the Liffey Region, west of the Statue of Seven.
maybe it's because my account is really old, I don't really have that kind of problem.


or hadnt since Liyue I think.
    Nah, I play since 1.0. It's not about account age, more about character preference.

Basically the only real option for me to deal real non-burst non-pyro/electro damage is cryo swirl.
        I mean, you can always build a bloom team
Is that an issue of mob density or the fact that summer puzzles are sometimes guarded by enemies intentionally?

Anyway I don't think some small mushroms wandering around can stall more than a couple hits which is something that happens while I am still moving to the puzze itself.
    it isn't even as though puzzles are guarded by enemies. sometimes they're just lurking nearby, you try to get by them without needing to fight and you still somehow aggro them. so you gotta kill them off first and foremost, even though they have no correlation with the puzzle you were heading toward other than just being on the way.
Yall have cons on your Amber..?
Think of commission cycles as the list [A B C D...], with each letter corresponding to a certain NPC commission. Currently, when daily commissions are given, there is a chance for one commission from this list to be given at random. Obviously, the pool of commissions is larger in game and also houses multiple of the same commission ([A A A B B C D D E..], for example) which is why some commissions come up more than others, but to explain the concepts of commission cycles and rerolling let's just consider a list of 3 commissions [A B C]. 

When a commission is completed, it is removed from the list. So if you complete commission C, then the list now looks like [A B]. The next time daily commissions are given, you can only receive commissions A or B. You won't see commission C again until the list is *completely* emptied out upon which it refills and the cycle begins anew. This is the logic behind commission cycles.

Now, what if commission A has multiple outcomes needed for an achievement? (We will call these outcomes A-1, A-2, A-3.) When commission A is given, the outcome chosen is randomized. Say you need A-2, but have been given A-1. Completing A-1 will remove commission A from the list, but if you *don't* complete it at all, then commission A will return to the list and you will have another chance to get A-2. 

This is commission rerolling. By neglecting to finish specific commissions, eventually your list of NPC commissions will be reduced to just [A] and you can consistently 'reroll' it until you get the outcome you want without having to sit and suffer through the entire list again.

Before, we had to go to other people's worlds to do dailies to skip but with the encounter points system we can now skip in single-player, making this system much more relevant now.
    That only works if the player has access to things that give encounter points. If they've fully explored and done all quests, then they either miss out on daily rewards or just have to hope they get the right step each time.

I also just had a set of comms that was No honour among thieves, Impregnable defense, Touring light show, and Hammer of the mushrooms. So the guaranteed NPC comm per day doesn't even work right.
        * Yeah, you need encounter points, but for 90% of each patch you have events. By not immediately collecting rewards, you can 'save' them and use them at a later date. Encounter points are awarded when the rewards are claimed, not when the challenge is completed. Same goes for chests. If you care about getting the achievements you can complete a few chests, leave them unclaimed, and mark them on the map for future encounter points.

* NPC commissions are NOT guaranteed every day. As I said, "there is a chance for" an NPC commission to be given each day.
