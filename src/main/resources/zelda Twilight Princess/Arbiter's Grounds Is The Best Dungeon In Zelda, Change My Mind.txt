[[Arbiter's Grounds Is The Best Dungeon In Zelda, Change My Mind]]





*TO BE FAIR,* if you want your mind changed, posting this on the Twilight Princess subreddit might skew your results. LOL
This and Snowpeak are tied for me. The one I prefer varies so much I can't choose
    Iâ€™m on my first ever play through of twilight princess and Iâ€™m on snowpeak and Iâ€™m miserable. I think I just despise ice dungeons lol
        Forget the puzzles and look at the atmosphere. I found the puzzles to be average. I thought the atmosphere was one of the best I've ever seen.

A huge abandoned mansion with suspiciously Hyrulian origins, inhabited by Yeti and monsters, at the very top of an icey peak you snowboarded to? Perfection.

If you don't like the sound of that maybe you just don't like ice dungeons. Let me know what you think of the atmosphere in and throughout Arbiter's Grounds. 

I will note, you still have quite a few dungeons left and they are some of the best in the series in my opinion. Get to the next few dungeons (won't spoil) and let me know what you think. If you don't like at least one of them maybe TP isn't your kind of game. If you've played Ocarina you'll love the next dungeon.

Feel free to update me (as long as you have a positive experience in some form), I love talking about this game.
            Oh yeah the atmosphere and the characters are definitely great in the mansion, so I will admit that. Damn yeti is making food for his sick wife. Loved arbiters grounds a lot too because of that and the dungeon was cool in my opinion. Yeah I think I just hate ice type environments. Itâ€™s really weird because I really liked this games water temple compared to others
                Report back after checking out the next couple dungeons. If you've gotten to the water temple or further in OOT, the run up to the next dungeon and the dungeon itself will be very cool. 

Definitely one of my favorites in terms of lore and cool factor.
                    Yeah I think I like the dungeon better after getting that ball and chain. Those little ice enemies were driving me crazy
                    Is the temple of time in twilight princess the same as the one in ocarina of time? Just got there
                        I believe so, one of my favorite dungeons in terms of lore and getting to it although the dungeon itself is very linear
There is no mind to change, you are right
    Good point! This will always be my favorite dungeon in Zelda, truth be told I haven't played all of the temples in TOTK but I doubt any of them will be as good as Arbiter's Grounds
        Nothing compares to the grounds. First dungeon to use the free change mechanic, the new gadget puzzles, the boss fight... it's all amazing. Plus the lore that they tried killing Ganon just added to the fun
        They aren't.
It's certainly up there. It's my favorite in the game, but in the series I might go with the OoT Forest Temple
    Came here to say this. Forest Temple is peak dungeon
    Best atmosphere and music in my opinion, need to replay the game to feel that feeling again
You FIGHT a dragon skeleton on top of a beyblade of course it's one of the best!

EDIT: autocorrect somehow changed fight to find...
What do you like most about it?  I killed two Poes and now I am lost and stuck, but I don't want to look it up.
    I played the game so many times and can do every dungeon without problems but I still get always lost finding these poes
        First time playing, I feel like I've looked everywhere possible.  It's so frustrating and time consuming.
I loved Arbiterâ€™s Ground and the aesthetic of it! Death Sword had a great design and gimmick, same with Stallord :> so glad they brought back the Dinosaur battle theme from Ocarina of Time :>

Stallord looks a lot like King Dodongo from HW Definitive Edition, I think heâ€™s cute!
    Do you.. have a crush on King Dodongo?
        Wtf ðŸ˜­ I jus think heâ€™s friend shaped
            Dude.. you totally have a crush on King Dodongo. Just ask him out! Thereâ€™s no harm in trying
I graduated high school when I played that game. Death sword traumatized me. You are correct. It's the shit
Why would I try to change somebodyâ€™s mind who is obviously correct?
Hot take, but you spelled City in the Sky wrong
For me, it has got to be Ancient Cistern. The contrast between the beautiful bright main room and the terrifying underground is the coolest dungeon atmosphere in the series. But I can't change your mind because Arbiters Grounds in undeniably amazing.
    Itâ€™s a really fantastic dungeon, definitely the best in Skyward Sword if not one of the best in the series. For me itâ€™s kind of bogged down by the fact that itâ€™s in Skyward Sword, which has just always left a weird taste in my mouth for some reason. Something about that game *tonally* just feels off, like it only ever scratches the surface of things without ever fully handing you the reigns.
Mine is Stone Tower Temple from Majoras Maskâ€¦ but Arbiters Grounds is definitely in the top 5!
I donâ€™t know what I think the best one is in the series but I do think itâ€™s the best one in Twilight Princess.

But posting this in the Twilight Princess subreddit is probably going to give you a lot more agreement lol
My favorite is probably the ice mansion, the yeti couple are so funny lol. TP probably has the best Zelda dungeons imo. I've been meaning to replay tphd for a while now, I just finished skyward sword switch & it kicked ass, honestly one of my favorite Zeldas. Also skyward sword > ocarina of time even though I've never beat oot :3
Iâ€™m not 100% sure if itâ€™s THE best, but itâ€™s definitely one of the best.
I love it
Nah. But, I doubt that Iâ€™ll change your mind.
    Good point. One thing I love about Zelda is there's so much variety that one person loves one thing and another person loves another.
        A very non-combative response. I like it, so Iâ€™ll entertain you.

I like Arbiterâ€™s Grounds, but itâ€™s not even my favorite TP dungeon, mainly because it retreads a lot of prior OoT DNA and the dungeon item is silly. Iâ€™m more of a fan of City in the Sky.

But my favorite Zelda dungeons are all found in Skyward Sword. I adore Lanayru Mining Facility, Ancient Cistern, The Sandship, and Sky Keep, to the point where I find it hard to call any one a favorite.
            Mining Facility is elevated a lot by its music. As a dungeon design it's not super unique imo
Definitely one of the tops for sure. I love the 2 tone nature of it (first half about the ghosts, second was in the dungeon proper).

But if you want me to change your mind: halve you ever played Forest Temple or Spirit Temple from OoT, Ancient Cistern from SS, or Misery Mire from ALttP? I do t really have an argument here except to say those all have excellent dungeon design layouts and great boss fights (except Misery Mire. I do t care for that fight as much as the others). Given that Arbiter Grounds also has great design and boss fight Iâ€™ll leave those as alternatives to being the best or at least equals.
    I've played all Zelda games. Out of alm of the dungeons you've listed my favorite is definitely the Forest Temple from OOT. In my personal opinion it is a little lower love the music and the phantom Ganon fight. Also love the inverted part of the dungeon its been a while since I replayed OOT maybe I should dust off my 3ds
        Forest Temple is top 3 for me. Iâ€™m glad you mentioned the music because thatâ€™s actually for me one of the most memorable pieces of music from OoT (and thereâ€™s a ton of great music in that game). But I also loved the boss fight and really enjoyed the 4 poes, which is interesting as Arbiter Grounds has their own 4 poes lol.
Change your mind?

*why?*
Hahaha the best? You don't even make soup
Forest Temple in OoT.  Spooky music, spooky atmosphere, great layout.
Best boss OST for sure. That with the fidget spinner thing was so cool as a kid.
Definitely top three for me. But my favorite will always be Stone Tower from Majora's Mask. Second place is Forest Temple in Ocarina of Time. Third is our boy here.
Phh, you clearly haven't played the OoT water temples enough. How could you not rate them as the be- I can't even type it. Boy do they just suck!!
Was the best dungeon. It is buried under the desert of its former self.
"What would you have your Arbiter do?"
Why the fuck would I do that. It is the best dungeon
i find it so hard to rank TP dungeons. this one is definitely up there, but so many of them are great itâ€™s hard to rank. 

snowpeak, arbiters ground, city in the sky are all top tier imo. 

mid tier is lakebed temple, hyrule castle, forest temple

goron mines and twilight realm are my least favorites for sure tho
Hereâ€™s something I wrote about it previously:

The Arbiterâ€™s Grounds is inspired by 2 dungeons from ocarina of time in specific ways, some obvious, some more subtle, and for very specific reasons. Firstly, four poes very clearly inspired by the forest temple in ocarina of time â€“ for a reason. In ocarina of time, you complete three baby temples as a child, then you get the master sword and youâ€™re an adult and the forest temple is the first â€˜properâ€™ temple you complete â€“ a real step up. Similar story for the arbiters grounds. The first three dungeons require help from someone else, less so each time. In the forest temple, the main mechanic is the monkeys swinging, couldnâ€™t complete the dungeon without them. In the goron mines, you get the parts of the big key from the goron elders, after being let into the dungeon in the first place by gor coron (I think â€“ double check his name). in lakebed temple, you wouldnâ€™t be able to swim at all if queen rutela hadnâ€™t given you the zora tunic. This is the first temple in the game in which you are truly on your own. This also develops on the reason Link becomes a wolf when in twilight. Up until now, he was a â€˜lone wolfâ€™ because he was alone, the only being from the light world who doesnâ€™t become a ghost in twilight, thanks to his triforce of courage. But now it takes on a slightly different meaning. As the first dungeon in which you and Midna are truly left to your own devices, it makes sense that this is really the only dungeon (other than the Palace of Twilight and Hyrule Castle) in which you have to become your lone wolf form and solve puzzles as such. The other dungeon itâ€™s inspired by is the Spirit Temple, for a much more simple reason, their setting of the Gerudo Desert, but in a much more intelligent way. As previously touched on, other than the Palace of Twilight and Hyrule Castle, both dungeons are the only dungeon in their respective game that makes use of their respective central game mechanic, to transform into a different version of yourself, whether it be a child or a wolf. In the Spirit Temple, you first need to complete the first half of the dungeon on one side as a child, and come back after pulling the Master Sword out of its pedestal for the 60th time to complete the other half and fight the boss, once you have obtained the silver gauntlets, opening the path for the adult side. In the Arbiterâ€™s Grounds, you are able to navigate and solve most of the puzzles in the first half of the dungeon as either your wolf or human form, apart from using your hookshot here or there, but you are specifically required to use your wolf form to be able to sense the poes to open the pathway to the second half of the dungeon, in which you have to use your human form in order to use the spinner, like how you have to use your adult form in order to fit into the silver gauntlets in the Spirit Templeâ€™s second half. If this profound inspiration from Ocarina of Time was the extent of the Arbiterâ€™s Groundsâ€™ genius, it would already be brilliant. But it goes further. Immediately previously to this, plot-wise, were 2 moments where we get to see midnaâ€™s imperfections at play. First was midnaâ€™s desperate hour, one of the few times in any Zelda game in which you realise your sidekick isnâ€™t some immortal god who can do what you want, but is actually fallible and there are stakes for her too. Secondly was the cutscene upon arrival in the Gerudo Desert, in which Midna explains that she is a descendant of the tribe of interlopers who were banished to the Twilight Realm after trying to take advantage of the power of the triforce. And suddenly youâ€™re thrown into this terrifying dungeon knowing that there are very real stakes and itâ€™s seriously dangerous for both of you. Not to mention the excellent fourth encounter with the recurring miniboss King Bulblin in the lead up to the dungeon itself. Combine all of this with excellent puzzles for both forms, which make use of a brilliant (yet underused) item and one of the best bosses in Zelda history and you have the best dungeon in the zelda series.
Easily my favorite dungeon in Twilight Princess, I always love going through it when I play through the game. I am hesitant to call it the best dungeon in the series though.
Second best only to the stone temple tower from Majoraâ€™s Mask
Why would I want to change your mind? We live in a world where it's ok to be wrong.
But also, but also, but but but also- Snowpeak? Shadow Temple? Stone Tower? Ancient Cistern? ðŸ‘€
Yah know, I was gonna say its a solid dungeon, but I can only say that figuratively.
Also the biggest whiplash in tone. The spinner is the funniest item for the most serious looking Zelda entry, in a dungeon full of undead lol.
No. I canâ€™t change your mind, it is the best.
Arbiter's Ground is a true "Ohh shit this game is getting real".. The 1st three dungeons are spectacular but by the time you get to Arbiter's Ground the dungeons start to take it to a whole new level going forward, this was like a blend of the Spirit, Shadow, & Forest temple from OOT! Arbiter's Ground is the GOAT haha ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤§
the atmosphere is nearly unmatched. definitely one of the best dungeons
Not my favorite, but i won't argue.

I also really don't think anyone would agree with my fav Zelda dungeon tbh
    What's your favorite Zelda dungeon?
        Lakebed Temple. It just has amazing vibes.

Also obviously it's really well designed too, but the atmosphere really does it for me.
My favourite is the Stone Tower temple from MM, using all the transformation masks really felt like a test the whole game prepared you for.  Arbiters Grounds is a great pick though
Dunno, it is for shure not a bad dungeon, but to me it feels a bit underwhelming. Other ones stand out more like the mansion on the snow(don't remember the name) or even the twilight dungeon, which to be fair gameplay wise it's rather lacking, i just love the twilight style being implemented on the dungeon
The only problem I can point out on this dungeon is that I never really felt in danger against the boss, it's either static or just a flying head that'll never hit you.
Iâ€™m on my first ever play through of twilight princess and Iâ€™m on snowpeak and Iâ€™m miserable. I think I just despise ice dungeons lol
    Forget the puzzles and look at the atmosphere. I found the puzzles to be average. I thought the atmosphere was one of the best I've ever seen.

        Oh yeah the atmosphere and the characters are definitely great in the mansion, so I will admit that. Damn yeti is making food for his sick wife.
