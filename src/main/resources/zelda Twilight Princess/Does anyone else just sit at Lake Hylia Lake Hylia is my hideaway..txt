[[Does anyone else just sit at Lake Hylia Lake Hylia is my hideaway.]]


Thereâ€™s nothing more soothing than sitting at Lake Hylia and waiting for it to be morning again, then when itâ€™s morning you see that morning humid, and the music in the background. What a fantastic experience this game is. 


My favorite place is the fishing hole! Watching the seasons pass, listening to the soothing music, itâ€™s amazing. 

My favorite place, however, is probably Kakariko Village. The theme, the music, and the villages overall importance throughout the game all make it my favorite place to shop at.

My most nostalgic place? Ordon village. My brothers and I spent months in the tutorial just running around, messing with the goats, shooting targets, and destroying pumpkins before we found out how to progress. (We were caught on the missing cradle part. Didnâ€™t know the hawk could grab it. Also, I was probably 8 at the time- with both my brothers being even younger than me. We were pretty dumb back then, lol.
    Pretty rad for 3 kids to be handed.
        Yea, my Nana game it to my younger brother as a b-day gift. Iâ€™m not completely sure if she even checked with my parents about the rating or anything. We all had a blast though.
            ðŸ˜‚ that's sick
                My family started playing it when I was 5 or 6 and it changed everything for me
                    Definitely an S-tier game

                            And doing it pretty dang well!
                                Man thank you lol
Extreme originality imo
                                    There's nothing like the twilight. Only frauds
    We've all tried to get into that special boat, amiright?/j

I agree with Kakariko, that theme is phenomenal, and deserts-type places are always my favorite video game locations!
As a kid I spent three hours walking Link at the bottom of Lake Hylia with the boots and the zora tunic.
Mine would have to be the snow mound next to the bridge to Snowpeak Ruins. Something about the serene silence as the snow falls is just beautiful.
    Your first time going through snowpeak, climbing out of the blizzard and suddenly reaching the quiet top of the mountain, with the distant sounds of whistling from the nearby howling stone... All of hyrule and beyond in your view... It's a great feeling. Something TOTK's wind temple \*almost\* replicated.
I go and stare at the waterfall in the sacred grove and listen to the music there. When twilight hits its gorgeous.
I used to do this in Ocarina when I was a kid and played it. Now I feel like I should try it in Twilight Princess.
Ordon Village is easily my favorite place. So serene and quaint especially when you first enter it and itâ€™s about twilight and thereâ€™s this magical warmth to it. Watching time pass in the game at Lake Hylia or Zoraâ€™s domain is also so soothing
the music is the best lake hylia rendition ever i think. its a shame botw/totk doesnt have any special music for its lake hylia. im terrified of the lakebed temple but i could just lay in the grass near the shore and take a 4h nap no problem :)
Yeah the lake is my place man
The Lake Hylia soundtrack alone is so comforting, I fall asleep to it some nights lol. Iâ€™d always go back there after having a tough time with a dungeon or boss
    I play it on a repeat on YouTube
I remember at around the same time I was getting into this game my parents were setting up their Apple accounts and either bought a lot of music or were able to implement their own (was able at the time).

I eventually got my first iPod nano and fell in love with listening to RÃ¶yksopp - Remind me (thanks to a Geico commercial), Steve Miller Band - Into the future, and Owl City - Fireflies. Playing these three songs in the background as I traveled around in Hyrule, and especially when I made to The City in the Sky.

Not long after I learned of Daft Punkâ€™s Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, upon watching a YouTube video of Link from some other LoZ game opening a chest to find a dancing ninja.

The Legend of Zelda was _the_ game to hop back onto after a family trip to the neighborhood pool. Normally it would put my parents out for a while, leaving the den TV open to me and my siblings.

Fun Times.
My hideaway would be the desert trials. Most hate it but I gone through 2x without losing any health
Actual farm boy here. Ordon Ranch theme, with your back to the mountains, might be the psychologically safest area in any game ever. Tranquility, equanimity, calm.
Oh absolutely.  Lake Hylia is why this is my favorite Zelda game, itâ€™s just magical to me.  Even though thereâ€™s a giant canonâ€¦and eventually two giant canons run by clowns in the middle of it all.
Im a Simple Person. I like to chill with my Goron homies at the local Hot Spring.
Nothing strikes up my childhood nostalgia more than the Twilight Princess Lake Hylia theme ðŸ¥²
Twilight Princess Is honestly just goated, currently thinking about getting a steam deck so I can play GameCube TP on it. Or maybe getting a Wii U, but I don't know if I'll find one of those.
