[[So apparently you can hookshot the hive and it is BIG]]





Either link is tiny or they have some super bees
    I think both lol
I had no idea!
    Me neither (I think). Idk it's been 7 years since I've played haha
Serious bee problems.
    Yo I watch your videos, they're great!

God I'm being such a fanboy.

Keep up the good work!
        Ha ha, thanks Snoo!  
And I totally get it. I become a fanboy everytime I meet a creator I watch.   
It never gets old.
            That's funny because that means there's now fanboying on 2 levels going on iykwim
                I often wonder how far the fanboy inception goes.

Like... does it ever stop?
                    No, NEVEEEEEER. WE ARE ALL JUST A SMALL PART OF AN INFINITE LOOP OF FANBOYING!!!
What the hell. Can you also lift it and carry it around?
    Yeah you can even place it but if you hookshot it a second time it'll explode
Why it so fckn big thoðŸ˜³
    Could ask the same about the castle town guards haha
So thatâ€™s the hive of the murder beesâ€¦ terrifying
That's amazing
I never wouldâ€™ve thought of that
Woah, i've played this game like 10 times and I didnt know this!
