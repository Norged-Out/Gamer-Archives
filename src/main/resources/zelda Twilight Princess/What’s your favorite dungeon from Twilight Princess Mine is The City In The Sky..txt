[[What‚Äôs your favorite dungeon from Twilight Princess Mine is The City In The Sky.]]





I‚Äôd say snow peak ruins. The shield surfing was so fun to get to the dungeon, along with the very eerie vibe and overall environment. Also, the ball and chain dude I struggled to beat him for such a long time. Arbiters grounds and City in the sky are also really awesome, I don‚Äôt think there was a mediocre dungeon in this game
    Top 3 temple in the series, imho.
        for me i‚Äôd say top 5, spirit and forest temple might squeeze somewhere within that 5 for me
    The water temple is probably the most forgettable one, but it's not bad by any means.
        agreed
arbiters grounds
    The Arbiters Grounds was super fun for me because I had to think of different ways to solve the puzzles with the spinner
        the spinner is fun, the boss is fun, and its a very lore/theory rich dungeon
        That dungeon is insane bro, and is my second favorite.
    Definitely my favorite in all aspects that make a complete dungeon. Death sword was my favorite mini boss, stallord was an awesome boss. I loved the spinner. Just an overall really fun and atmospheric dungeon.
    Same, just... try not to softlock the dungeon.
        never heard of any kind of softlock there
            If you used the spinner to get to the boss door without the key, you can't get it anymore without glitches
                Are you sure that's an actual softlock? I thought you could clawshot overtop of the wall which will allow you into the rooms to go get the boss key if you missed it before using the spinner on the floor.
                Im not sure about that. I remember in my first playthrough I went to the door without the boss key but eventually went back and got it without problem
Either Snowpeak Ruins or Arbiter‚Äôs Grounds
    Snowpeaks Ruins was super fun, I loved the Yetis and I absolutely loved it the ball and chain. The Artbiters Grounds was super fun too, I loved how the spinner makes you rethink the puzzles.
    Same, these are the best two in the whole game
For some reason the city in the sky music unsettles me so badly I basically speedran it. My favorites are the forest temple and arbiter's grounds, the easiest is the temple of time I think.
    That‚Äôs probably why I absolutely loved the city in the sky, I love everything creepy
        Normally I do too! But somehow I guess it triggered some subconscious fear.
    That's the whole point, to me. A city of chickens under duress with a giant dragon roaming around. 

I felt the music was quaint and pleasant with flutters of anxiety and to me suited the aesthetic perfectly.
        It isn't like I didn't appreciate it objectively or that I think the music is *bad,* but listening to it throughout the course of the level made me physically uncomfortable. Goosebumps, tense and kind of sweaty, etc.
    For me it's because my wiiu crashed during the argarok fight and I lost the entire sky book quest and my progress in the temple
    I found the city in the sky to be so tedious. Too many slowly rotating objects for me. The concept was definitely awesome and the boss was one of my favorites in the game, but yeah the dungeon itself annoyed me.
        I liked the concept of the boss too! But the Wii targeting system was a bit janky and it made the battle frustrating. Maybe it was better on GameCube.
TP has imo the best set of dungeons in the series! Its hard to choose, but I also pick City in the Sky. Love the atmosphere, music, lore, level of difficulty, boss (who is also part of the dungeon not just the end), and overall design. Also nice thread with the Oocca and of course, double clawshots!!
arbiters grounds, snowpeak, city in the sky, goron mines (for the aesthetic)

Truly my favorite Zelda game, even though I loved Ocarina. I just wish they could make more games like ocarina, skyward sword (for the dungeon design) and twilight princess, side quests like majora. A semirealistic epic adventure with frozen mansions, spooky ancient prisons and lava mines underground.

I had high hopes for ToTK and although it appears to be an incredible open world game it really just doesn't tickle my Zelda bone. Puzzles are excellent but really haven't enjoyed the aesthetics.
    I think TOTK took a big step in the right direction, but I still wanted more dungeons, with more aesthetic variety between them and how they're solved.   They look a more unique now, but still sticking closely to the "activate these switches and come back to activate the boss" formula used in BOTW.

For me it's less about a specific dungeon in TP being amazing, it's that there were so many of them, and each one was so wildly different, with unique styles and gimmicks.   It made the journey a lot more special for me.
        I don‚Äôt get it though.  How is it a step in the right direction?  They‚Äôve already made amazing dungeons time after time!  Why can‚Äôt they do it again?
            Absolutely step in the right direction. But enough for me. Botw 2 with major improvements is still a botw style game

I understand the botw style is what sells, but why can't they throw in the epic dungeons? They're optional anyway...

Before anyone asks, I thought the themed dungeons were solid improvements but they shouldve been in botw in the first place. To me, they lack proper themed music (its too subtle) and big central rooms. They felt small and empty, more like an afterthought to me. It needed large scale dungeons
Snowpeak!!
    Ah Snowpeaks was super fun, I loved the Yetis because they‚Äôre so cute, I also loved the boss
Goron Mines is fantastic. The fact that they turned a Fire temple into ‚Äúwalking on the ceiling with magnetized Iron Boots‚Äù was so creative, it‚Äôs one of the few dungeons I actually look forward to upon a replay.
    personally i found it tedious
Forest Temple or Arbiter's Grounds for atmosphere
Temple of Time. Really made the feeling you were alone very real and almost ominous. Great BGM for the dungeon itself, the puzzles in and leading up to the dungeon and great mini boss & boss battles.
    God they did the darknuts so much justice in this game. Very cool miniboss. And the dominion rod was a really creative item. Definitely the under appreciated gem dungeon of the game. Only thing bringing it down is probably the boss. Just a little too straight forward and easy
Snowpeak Ruins. I love the haunted mansion vibes, the yetis, the boss fight... returning to the kitchen to get better soup... overall a great change of pace!
yes üíØ
I loved this dungeon but i hate the chicken demons that live there
Not to hate but city in the sky was my LEAST favorite dungeon!!! Arbiter's Grounds was amazing to me
    Ooo I really liked Arbiters Ground, but City in the Sky just kinda gave me that creepy kind of vibe, and as a fan of creepy stuff that‚Äôs probably why it‚Äôs my favorite
    SAME. I hate city in the sky. That and the lakebed dungeon are my least fav
Arbiter‚Äôs Grounds. Best dungeon and boss in the series. This is a hill I will die on. But City in the Sky is also a good choice. Very solid.
Arbiter's Grounds is one of the best Zelda dungeons with one of the best boss battles.

The Water Temple is actually pretty good too even though it's hard. Love that boss fight as well, very Shadow of the Colossus vibes
Lakebed
Arbiters Grounds. I loved the spooky horror theme of the enemies, the spinner item was fun to use, and and the dungeon boss was cool.
Temple of Time was my favorite dungeon in that game. I did really like clearing out the Hidden Village. I went through it and never exited my bow aiming thing. Same with clearing the way to the Arbiter‚Äôs Grounds.
Arbiter grounds I'm a wh0re when it comes to creepy things like ghosts n curses
I loved the temple of time. It was such an interesting concept and who doesn‚Äôt love controlling a giant statue?
The temple of time. It‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous and the music actually made me feel like I was almost in a shopping mall which was very odd but kind of cool in a weird way. It sounds just like music you‚Äôd here in a modern one to me. Facing a darknut for the first time was very memorable and really satisfying to succeed in also and the dominion rod was very fun to obtain and use.
    Makes me wish for a zelda with grim setting again
Is hard to say because all the dungeons are god, but I whould say the Snowpeak Ruins.
Arbiters Grounds or Snowpeak
Mine's a toss-up between Zora's Domain and the City in the Sky.
Love city in the sky and temple of time dungeon. Especially that statue puzzle to open the temple of time. Took me a while to figure it out too.
Arbiter‚Äôs Grounds
I'm not there yet, but that looks cool AF. Just finished Arbiter's Grounds in the dessert, using the Spinner was pretty cool. I'm off to the Snow Peak now.
    Best of luck!!
Arbiter‚Äôs grounds. It was the most unique dungeon to me
Twilight realm üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§
    Ngl, the Twilight Realm is amazing! It had a lot of potential and felt smaller than it deserved to be though‚Ä¶
        SOOO much potential!! if a Nintendo switch remake ever happens, it needs to be BADASS
Arbiter‚Äôs Grounds and Temple of Time will always be my favorites. The first couple of dungeons are good, but the late-game ones are amazing.
Watch SAO if you like a city in the sky
    I‚Äôve already watched SAO! üòä
Arbiter's Grounds
Little late. I just love the atmosphere and setting in Arbiter's Grounds. The fact its an abondened prision overcrowded with ReDeads and other monsters just increases the setting for me. Love the miniboss and Stalord just wish he was harder and longer. His style I fell in love with
Arbiter Grounds. Reminds me of forest temple  and after beating the boss in unique way that resembles pinball, you went inside colloseum to see a key part of the story.
You poor thing.  City in the Sky may be my least favorite Zelda Dungeon ever.

That "music" is straight up terrible.
    That‚Äôs mainly what I liked about city in the sky, the music was just the vibe of mysterious and unexpected rift for it be entertaining
    different strokes. city in the sky music is unsettling but it slaps
Water temple
They're all amazing (except Goron Mines and the final one that I won't spoil) but my favorite is probably either Snowpeak Ruins or the Forest Temple, with Lakebed at third place.
City in the sky is nice but the buildup is way too long and is all about warping back and forth in kakariko village and going many times at random spots on the whole map. But it‚Äôs true that it‚Äôs one of the only dungeons with an actual buildup in TP
I really love Snowpeak. I think my least favorite is the Twilight temple. It‚Äôs just really hard for some reason and I rage quit nearly every time I play it, lol.
see and that's my least favorite for how confusing the puzzles are
Snowpack is right behind the Ancient Cistern in terms of favorite dungeons in the series.
Temple of Time. I just love the atmosphere and music, and i also really like the cool quirk of going through a dungeon twice in pretty different ways.
Temple of Time and Goron Mines.
I'm saying arbators grounds because the boss fight is amazing, the Lore is great, and after the boss fight I would just play around with the spiner.
The beyblade dungeon :)
    Ah, the Arbiters Grounds, a classic
        I call it beyblade dungeon because I find it funny but yes the arbiters grounds is my favourite 

Least favourite is lakebed because when I first played the game I got stuck and it annoyed the crap out of me
            The Lakebed Temple was embarrassingly hard the first time I played it, the water flowing through the different doors really confused me
                Good to know I wasn‚Äôt alone in my struggles
                    Yeah it was super difficult
1. Arbiter's Grounds
2. Snowpeak Ruin
3. City in the Sky
4. Lakebed temple
5. Goron Mines
6. Hyrule Castle
7. Palace of Twilight
8. Temple of Time
9. Forest temple

Love everything about Arbiter's Grounds, from set of enemies, mini boss, boss, music, item, difficulty, tmosphere, way to the dungeon (optional stealth part and fight with King Bulbin), just everything hits so perfect, no wonder it's my favourite dungeon in the series.

Snowpeak is a close second, a dungeon that is actually a mansion where someone actually lives is an amazing twist.

Even if forest temple is my least favourite, it is still great and my favourite 1st dungeon in the series. This just says how TP really has a strong set of amazing dungeons.
I can hear this picture üò≠ Gonna have to go with Arbiter‚Äôs Grounds. I‚Äôve always loved the vibes and graphics
Snowpeak is always, hands down, my favorite. Yeta and Yeto are adorable, and the snowboarding segment to get there is fun. All the music is astounding, and the dungeon item is unique and cool. The whole esthetic of an abandoned mansion/fortress is cool, and finally, you also get to shoot canons.
Snowpeak Ruins...... It didn't even feel like a dungeon because it was Yeti's and Blizzeta's house. When she walked up the stairs to lead me to the next room, it was immediately clear to me who the boss was. And that scary moment was so nice
Mine is Hyrule Castle. I know it's kinda clich√©, but it feels so epic just being anywhere in there
Temple of Time sits well with me and also the Lakebed Temple, hard to choose between the two. Goron Mine is the next best, a mix of fresh new features and after you have done a lot of interesting overworld quests to really make the world feel special. In general, I prefer early game dungeons to late game because you are more limited with items and they usually make up for it with interesting features.
Top 3 temple in the series, imho.
    for me i‚Äôd say top 5, spirit and forest temple might squeeze somewhere within that 5 for me
The water temple is probably the most forgettable one, but it's not bad by any means.
