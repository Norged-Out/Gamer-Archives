[[in your opinion, whats the most badass scene from the game]]


for me, its when link defeats king bulblin and saves colin at the bridge of eldin, infact i like it so much that its in my profile picture


When Zant "finishes" Ganon. He'd stated previously that he could be revived by his master upon Link's defeat, I'm almost tempted to think that Zant had a kind of pact with Ganon, but of course, Ganon was the one defeated so you just know that Zant was so pissed in that moment
    For me it's that Ganondorf refuses to fall to the ground, even in death. His eyes glaze over and his body relaxes a little, but he stays standing, his cape being gently ruffled by the breeze. Iconic
        So same, I love his design in TP. What's more, his eyes seem to glaze over after he loses his triforce of power, as though, without the triforce, he has no reason to go on
    It's indeed badass but the only thing bothering me is that Zant was killed before that, and as far as I know wasn't resurrected because Ganondorf doesn't  care, so did he had any power to revive Ganondorf while in the purgatory ?

The best explanation I have that make Zant having a choice is ganondorf tried to bring him back so he can do the same for him but Zant refuse and break the link , pissed that he only try to resurrect him when he needs him and he lied.


This or the scene is more symbolic and show that he can't be revived by Zant because he didn't revived him first.
        I'd say that if Zant and Ganon did have a pact and if resurrection from Ganon was a known option to him should he be killed, then Zant could of been in some kind of afterlife limbo while Ganon was still capable of defeating Link because of that pact.
    I thought that Zant's neck snapped when Link killed Ganon to show that Ganon was truly dead. Zant mentioned that he could be revived for as long as his master lived, but with Ganon dead Zant is really dead
Link pulling the Master Sword

Iâ€™m probably being biased but I think itâ€™s the best obtaining the master sword scene in the whole series
For me it's when Link tames Epona. It's sweet and epic at the same time.
"That" cutscene ðŸ”ªðŸ˜±ðŸ’€
    Hero chosen by the goddesses, bewareâ€¦
    That scene scared the shit out of me as a kid
        Uuh, which one, specifically?
            The vision Link has when Lanayru shows him how tempting the power is.
                **oh god**
    With like the strummy guitars pulls fucking eerie as shit and then the laughs ðŸ˜«.
Either the Fyrus fight intro cutscene or the one where you defeat King bulblin the first time and Epona rears back with link holding his sword. I also like the Lanayru spirit cutscene when you finish Lanayru twilight.
Maybe itâ€™s not the most badass scene, but my favorite has always been the end of the boss fight at Snowpeak Ruins
    Hey green boy. Do you wanna build a snowman?
I still look up the midna destroying hyrule castle barrier scene from time to time.
Same here with the eldin bridge scene, that moment as fenomenal.  
Honorable mention: everytime you put your sword away right after killing an enemy and doing that amazing move
    The signature sheath - yeah can't argue with that, in Smash Bros Brawl that sheath is one of his taunts haha
    This is for sure. I absolutely love the bridge scene and him rearing up on his horse with sword in hand. So dope
When king bulbin speaks to you that he follows the strongest
That scene is definitely one of the best for sure, but I think my favorite one is when Link transforms back into a human and is wearing the heroâ€™s tunic. When the light spirit tells Link his destiny, and the triple zoom-in effect happens, and the soundtrack swells, chills down my spine EVERY TIME
Ganondorf dying standing up is pretty badass
For me it's after Link defeats King Bulbin for the first time, after saving Colin. 
It's just so badass with Link raising his sword and Epona rising into the air with that awesome music
Oh yeah thatâ€™s probably the best example
Idk about most, but I'm always in awe when Midna transforms into the huge octopus-like form and climbs the barrier.
End credits midna and the mirror. It's not a traditional "badass" scene, but I would say it's badass
    Or the other mirror sceneâ€¦

##NOT TAKE MIRROR
        Bros face did a 180
Every time Link twirls his sword and sheathes it after learning a master skillâ€¦ I would kill for that kind of swag.
    I WISH he would do the twirly thing in BOTW too
Eldin Bridge duel, link holding up his sword on Epona
When Link wins the respect of the Bokoblin King while storming Hyrule Castle.

"I follow the strongest side...that is all ive ever known."

"Link...he...he spoke."



Honorable mention to the Hyrule Defense Force following Link into the castle and using a Bazooka to assist Link.
I agree so much! The way how Link raises his sword in victory- it always gave me chills. Either that, or when Ganondorf dies standing. It just shows how much of a badass he is.
What op just said. Itâ€™s the scene where I feel the storyâ€™s theme and Links characterization shines the most.
Back answer but for me itâ€™s also the scene with link on epona after devoting king bulblin
How about the scene from the start of the second phase of Argorokâ€™s fight?

With the stormy clouds surrounding the arena, lightning flashing in the sky, and a pissed off dragon bearing down on Link. It all makes for a awesome image.
For me it's the finale of the Ganondorf fight
Ganondorf challenging you for one last duel, creating a barrier to precent any interference from Zelda, a fair one on one fight, then the music starts with a beat that prepares you and hype you up to a fight to death (although a pretty easy one, still a cool setpiece) and the way Link just jump into the air and strike Ganon with the very first move his ancestor taught him is just the cherry on top
When Link gets the master sword
Defeating ganon- he dies standing up with a fucking sword in his chest. And when Zant twists his neck to the side to finish him - *chefs kiss* It's so fucking cool
Midna absolutely wrecking zant.
For me itâ€™s when you get the true butter sword, finally can make salami sandwiches
Right after Link defeats King Bublin the first time on Eldin Bridge.

The way him and Epona pose on the bridge with this setting after this fight, just fantastic.

Edit: Yep, it's your profile picture I was talking about.
I haven't finished it yet
    yeah neither have i...
        I've only gotten pastt the first dungeon haha
Midna destroying the mirror with her tear.
When you first start howling the old songs from the OoT hero and then he appears. I instantly knew it was him grown up teaching the new one how to be link. Like some avatar type shit. It was so cool
I really like the scene where after you beat the water temple Zant shows up and turns you back into a wolf, and uses midna as a shield as the light guardian attacks her.
Either the start of the ToT darknut fight, the scene where the darknut chucks his fucking sword or the armoghoma fake-out
For me it's that Ganondorf refuses to fall to the ground, even in death. His eyes glaze over and his body relaxes a little, but he stays standing, his cape being gently ruffled by the breeze. Iconic
