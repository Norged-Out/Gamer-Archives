[[I made the biggest falling sand art in Minecraft]]





Something about that classic image of Steve sitting in the field that captures the essence of 2010-2012-era Minecraft. Great job!
    No game has ever captured the magic of the first time I played Minecraft during the beta or alpha (not sure). I didn't know anything about the game. It was still owned by Notch. It was just a niche survival game and I had to figure everything out myself. 

I miss that.
        I was legit scared of the zombie noises outside my dirt box.
            I was SO happy when I found out what the peaceful difficulty did. God. I hated the monsters
                My friend was over at my house once and turned peaceful mode off while I was in the bathroom, only found out when a spider dropped on my head lmfao I about didn't talk to him for days
                    But after those few days the spider had some interesting tales to tell I bet.
                        He can spin a good yarn :)
                            More like a web of lies.
                All those nights hiding in a 1x2 tall dirt hole waiting for the sun to rise.
Well before learning about beds
                    I remember the exact moment I asked my mom what “peaceful” meant (I was an 8 year old Dutch kid so my English wasn’t great). When she told me the translation, I watched the skeleton that was attacking me disappear. A whole new world opened up for little me.
                    The worst part was losing that 1x2 dirt hole. If you accidentally left stuff in it, you're never finding it again. All I wanted was a map in 2010.
                    Oh my gosh yes, I actually turned on peaceful mode at nights until I discovered how to make beds
                From the first day I have no fear from the zombies, never died or lost my head. I love creative mode!

            The first time I saw what a creeper did was sad.  The second time made me jump out of my skin.
             And not understanding how spawning worked (light-based for hostiles). "I sealed off this room -- how did a skeleton get in here?!?!?"
            I hadn't ever played and went in last year completely blind and the first few worlds I made where I got lost and couldn't find my base and kept dying because I didn't realize the Endermen attacked me because I kept looking at them, I was scared of every noise, etc. were the best... It was an amazing experience. I was 26 by the way.
            I literally screamed the first time a spider jumped over my fortress wall. (I played on peaceful for quite a bit at first)
            I didn't dare to leave my house after my very first night in Minecraft because i heard something on the roof. I spent a good three days inside being terrified of the spider and when I finally ventured outside to gather food I discovered they were peaceful during the day


I still can barely believe that was a decade ago
            My very first night I dug a 3x1 pit  and waited because I was scared
            I thought pigs and sheep were zombies too so I always avoided them (I played pocket edition lite)
            The enderman sounds creeped me the hell out while I was mining. I didn't know what was even making the noises.
            And you had to be, until sprinting came along. Now you can run past every mob no prob. Kinda disappointing even if I see why they added sprinting
                Also, no beds. I kinda feel like the beds removed a lot of the aspect, there isn't really a "surviving the night" feel anymore.

Although useful af and sheep being the first thing I look for in a new world a lot of the vibe and how tough the game used to be kinda dwindled. Walked too far with no plan? Well, your fault, git gud or light up the place better. I liked that tbh
        I thought that, then I played Valheim.
            Does Valheim give that same feeling?  I will buy it today if so.
                For me it did, I have a couple of buddies that didn't love it, but they also didn't get grabbed by Minecraft in the same way I did
                    Man I think you just talked me into Valheim

Edit: 2 hours in so far... no idea what I'm doing, but NOT regretting it
                        Valheim definitely managed to capture that Minecraft feel for me. Highly recommended.
                        Dude do it, it's magical and try not to spoil things for yourself.
                Yeah man, it's the same sort of feeling. It's different and does things differently but I've never felt super chilled and had mass rushes of adrenaline when things like Draugr or Trolls show up like Minecraft's creepers for example. Cruising around Valheims world on a longboat with the music playing is awesome.

Try it, see what it's like for 2 hours and if you don't like it, refund.

It is only 3rd person and can be difficult sometimes but the progression system is so nice. Fighting the bosses can be exhilarating.

The building system I would say is superior but frustrating at first due to its semi realistic physics for buildings. It can be really rewarding to build large structures without the roof caving in.

It's also best with a small group of friends on a server. No official servers and it's peer to peer right now unless you rent one yourself though.
                    Huh, thanks for taking the time to type that out, I’ll have to look into it.
                Just dont look things up if you want that same experience :). Ive played who knows how many hours and never have i looked at a Valheim wiki page and i fucking love playing it like that. The unknown is so amazing. Not everyone wants to play it like that, but i enjoyed it. Also, play with some friends if possible
            Sea of Thieves does that for me randomly. Just staring at a sunset with your homies after a long haul, playing some music. Beautiful.
                Until those wannabe reapers come and try to sink you but fail.
        I love Minecraft and what it's become but I kinda miss not knowing much about the game and just meandering around my world without much of a goal in mind.
            Every once in a while I will load up my original world and just fiddle around.  I tend to not stay up to date with all of the new stuff, so I just walk around and discover new things they've added.  It sometimes brings back that feeling of mystery.
        Subnautica had a similar feeling to me if you haven't played that yet. Slowly learning and adapting to the environment as you learn of new creatures and progress in the game was probably one of best video game experiences I had. Subnautica Below Zero is the second game and isn't as good but is still pretty solid.
            I will check it out!  Thanks!
        I remember seeing the on of the first version of minecraft PE on a family members phone and loving it, later on started renting out the DvD and watching DanTDM never really realizing what a mod was and trying to recreate all the structures in their (DanTdm,Popularmmos,Stampy,etc) videos. Would head over to my friends house and play on their worlds. Good times, build megastructures and mals now but theres always something I'll miss about the chaos of just building
        [deleted]
            I remember paying $15 for a "lifetime license" or some other such named thing.
        Ahh the googling of recipes. No wikis yet. Just random blogs.
            The first time you didn't have to punch a tree down. Bliss.
        I’ll never forget looking up YouTube videos for how to craft specific things.
        Facts
        For me it was astroneer that felt the same
        Botw came close for me. Oh the feels …
        I can’t fucking believe my first world was a little over decade ago. So many vivid memories of all the discoveries, triumphs, and terrifying moments I had. Damn I miss those simpler times.
        I had a world with a big box house which I made in creative (only basic deco) then I went to survival, turned on peaceful and just walked in the house, outside the house and I played that world so much idk why, I even had a secret base but put nothing in it (it was single player)
        It's been so amazing watching minecraft grow over the last decade. I'm envious of the generation of kids that got to grow up playing it. It's like legos on steroids!
        Alpha back when Yogscast was good
        Same. My son was on the beta test and we all joined in to play. It was so fun and exhilarating finding new blocks for the first time
        Try Rimworld. Just trust me on this.
        I remember the first time I played as well. My husband (then boyfriend) was with me in the room and had played a little so I had a small cave house and some coal and all of a sudden I found some stone with brown lines in them. I asked boyfriend what it was and he had no idea so we had to look it up. Turned out we had found iron. 

Also, some time before that (I think couple of weeks), we saw this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/LnjSWPxJxNs
            Lol. Just that casual"crap."
        The book of recipes was sad for me
        I agree 100%, any time I play these days I just end up wishing I could capture that feeling again.
        I wish I understood the appeal of Minecraft. (I don’t say that sarcastically. It seems beloved, but I have ADHD and have always assumed it’s too tedious. I usually only like mission-based and old “2d” fighting games. What draws you to it?)
            Now, this is coming from a veteran player. So, most of the things I love about are from the beta. I don't have much experience with the bulk of the "new" things and most new things to me are post redstone. 

The thing I enjoy the most is it is like a  digital Lego set. Anything I can think of, I can build and see it in 3D. I can put secret doors and weird mechanisms wherever. So, anyone just browsing my base would never even know that stuff was there. It's just an open creativity box.
            Hi! Fellow ADHDer! I have gotten into Minecraft since version 1.14, and it took me a little while to really get into it. I didn't like not knowing anything at all, and the game not telling you anything. It felt frustrating at first. Also, the building felt so tedious, having to place dirt everywhere to reach your build. 

But now, I cannot put the game down anymore. I love how I  can spend hours just building and designing, and on other days go world exploring, or farming and taming animals, or just mine for resources when I've got little headspace. Also even after so many hours of playing, there's still so much left to learn and discover in the game. And with the constant new updates that will stay that way for a long time!
        Discovering minecraft for the first time was magical
        Back when it still costs 5€
        [removed]
            I remember when I wasn't sure if the world had an end and I walked for a long ass time. This was before compasses and maps. I didn't think I would ever find my base again.
        My first world started with me going down a hole leading into a cave. Then I came across monsters and tried to escape back, without realizing the cave wasn't actually built to allow me to walk outside the same way I came and had an unclimbable section. The monsters murdered me and by the time that was done it was already night. I then got murdered by basically everything and restarted after a few misguided attempts at (barefist) revenge, not realizing death is only as meaningful as your inventory at a given time.
        Try muck.

        I always fucking cry when I hear the music. I don’t ever fucking cry, only that music can do that to me. Greatest game ever, times changes tho can’t look back
    Somewhere before the youtubers REALLY blew up, but well after the game established a modding community and stuff like SEUS shaders made the rounds and gained infamy for making toasters melt
        How did they make toasters melt?
            Lava pockets. Never underestimate them.
    This, or the Windows wallpaper with the Creeper peering through. Man, I miss the old days of Minecraft. My mom got me my first account as a Valentine’s Day gift in 2013 because I couldn’t wait till my birthday to join my friends in the game. So much nostalgia.
    Alpha and Beta days were the best. Lava and water survival lobbies were the shit.
    It's the music.

:)
    You wanna cry from nostalgia?

        That was fantastic!
I imagine you expanded the height limit?
    Yep, this stretched over 1000 blocks into the sky
        It's beautiful. My day just begun and I doubt I'll see anything as cool as this for a while. 

Thank you for sharing.
            Why am I crying? my god amazing art demonstration 👏🏻👏🏻
        Did you draw the picture in different "brushes" instead of expanding from the middle to all sides to avoid performance strains or just for the visuals?
            It was kinda both. If it expanded from the middle evenly to all sides it would just make a boring upside down pyramid shape. I also had it start from the side and go in branches to create less lag since there were less entities falling at once
                Do you have the code for it somewhere? You should put it on github
        How did you expand the height limit?
            One way is to use a world generation datapack to set the maximum y to some integer up to 1023
                I’m guessing you can only do this in the experimental snapshots or the pre-1.17 snapshots where you can increase the build height
                    It's still possible in the releases (eg 1.17.1) as well since the experimental Caves & Cliffs world generation datapack works in those versions, I believe
        Excuse me, Mister,
How is it posible to expand the built height limit?
        Wow
            How long did it take?
        Amazing work!
        You made me cry
    How did you increase the height limit?
        1.17 datapacks
            Or cubic chunks mod
    WHATTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!????????????
    Doing things like this just takes away from the game imo. There's a height limit for a reason and by changing this without mojangs consent you are in essence pirating your own bootleg games
        "Mods are pirating the game"
        We've found it folks, the worst take.
        People aren't reading your username lmao
            Lmao he's really good at pissing people off.
            I did. There is absolutely nothing snide about his comment. It is just a shit take.
        I agree. One time I saw my little cousin switch Minecraft skins on the 360. I immediately reported him to the FBI and I hope he rots in prison.
            I modded my 3ds and changed some textures and added a custom skin to the 3ds version of minecraft, currently on the run from the fbi
        Its just modded minecraft
        how many times have mojang changed the world height?
        I used a data pack to modify the height limit, which mojang implemented themselves

            My favourite copypasta
        What? Minecraft is an open source game. Much like L4D2 which should be supported because it not only gives you more bang for your buck. It increases the longevity of your game by giving the users some power. The only reason L4D2 still has hundreds of thousands of players is the insane mod support.
            They are not open source. There is a very big deference between open source and moddable.

It is true that both games highly support and encourage modding. But the code itself is not open and available.
            Its "open source" in a way that you can get the source but you arent supposed to have it legally
                >Its "open source" in a way that you can get the source but you arent supposed to have it legally

And there's no comments and it's missing developer tools that would make life a lot easier to work with it.  It barely meets the definition for "source available" even with Mojang publishing deobf remappings.
            And because even vanilla L4D2 is one of the best FPS games ever made.
                I’ll give u that. Straight masterpiece
        What in the actual fuck are you going on about, mate?
        I see the name now
        Yeah that’s just dumb
        this just in, the upper build limit is a core game mechanic that shouldn't, nay, can't be changed
        what?
        Currently the tallest building in the world is 2,717 feet tall. The block limit in Minecraft converted into feet is only about 839-1100 feet. The build limit is from bedrock and not from the ground remember too.

The tallest mountain, Mount Everest, is 29,000 feet. The game doesn’t come to being close to real heights we can achieve, and for a game that’s meant to be creative there shouldn’t be any limitations to creativity
            For the rest of the world, the tallest building in the world is 828m tall compared to minecraft's default 256m, 320m in 1.18. Mount Everest is 8,849m tall.

256m is also 839 feet, not 920 or 1100, and the future 320 block height limit is 1049 feet so I'm not sure where those conversions came from
satisfying
    expected rickroll, unexpected great vibes, thanks op
        Idk why but I was expecting dick butt
            With the yellow and brown color scheme I saw at first, I was expecting surprised Pikachu.

            This one image shows more emotions then any of Billie eilish's songs
                not typically a Billie eilish fan but her song listen before I go is *very* emotional
                    I never said her songs weren't emotional, I just said this image had more
                *oh, but apparently she can "see colours" or something so it's so "artistic"*

Edit: hol up it's hear colours (now I just sound like a fool)
                    >*oh, but apparently she can "see colours" or something so it's so "artistic"*

What? I can see colors...

        I braved for rickroll impact as well and was delighted instead

        It all filled in
Does anyone know who originally made that image? 2010 - 2013 Minercraft was very fun and nostalgic
Yes, Artwork involving Steve, ill rate it stack of stack (64/64)

        3 inventories of full shulker boxes out of stack
Computer, softly '*don't*'
    that computer watched him build this for hours
        At that size, I'd bet it was at least partially computer generated.
            I think it was all computer generated, but he did put up each block piece by piece, just a thought
I like sand.  Its cool, and neat and imaginative.  And it gets everywhere.

Now that I think about it, where the hell does that image come from
    Not sure, I'd love to know too.
    It has that same energy of the one where steve is knocking a creeper into a ravine while striking the mega man pose

Edit: might not be the same image but it's actually a skeleton

Hope you made a copy of the world
    ***world corrupted.***
Not a rick roll. Amazing.
    Not a dickbutt either
        I was expecting a dickbutt
    u/KevinJNguy01 you know what to do next.
I was thinking how this could be done - and my best guess is that you build the image out up in the sky and then would have to move the blocks up further vertically from the left to the right, so that it falls in sequence.
    I bet you could code some sort of tool to generate this automatically
        bingo
            Idk why, but I read this in the voice of Hans Landa from Inglorious Basterds.
                That's a bingo!
                    It's just bingo
        Yup. This is the only answer.

You could learn to code from zero knowledge and do this faster than manually
Nice

I expected dickbutt. Good job!
 I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
    Not like here. Here everything is soft and smooth
        I don’t know why people give that line so much shit. That’s exactly the kind of cringy shit a teenage boy would say to his crush.
            That’s a good point. Name one teenager who’s like bloody Shakespeare when speaking bro their crush
                The character is irritant because he is supposed to be, he is a whiny teenager made into a child soldier, he is also extremely gifted, so his frustration is understandable. He wanted to convey to someone, who barely stayed a couple of days in the hellhole that is Tattooine, how mind numbingly bothersome is having sand everywhere. Visualise the feeling you get when you go to the beach and you get some sand in your private parts, between your legs and in your shoes, now imagine living like this 24/7, for your first 10 years of your life, also being a slave to some guy, that although he doesn't treats you badly he isn't nice. And after you get out of that place the people that take you away leave your mother to rot there...      
I think Anakin went too softly against the Jedi... Perhaps the younglings were a bit to much
Something about that track makes me think, Huh, this game is great, it's so nostalgic. Heck, I felt emotional when techno put that track in his skyblock video
At first i thought it was gonna be the scene of the outside world in Undertale but it turned out to be our "Steve"!
THIS IS INCREDIBLE OMG
Nice!
holy shit
amazing. my brain is trying to figure out how you were able to plan that out in the sky
I was prepaired to get rick rolled
Not only one of the biggest, but also one of the best
This uses the new 1.17 world height, right? Seems like a hella lot of verticality there.
I 100% expected Rick Astley
Are people actually this crazy good at making art and sculptures in minecraft, or is there like a computer generated component too it. I've always been blown away by the time and effort people would have to put into this
God💯🔥
For sure not downloaded
    Source? Where is the download? Where is the OG creator if not OP? Where are other videos of this “download”?
Holyshit! Now that's impressive! I haven't been impressive Minecraft a long time. Damn fine job!
That should officially be an art piece in the game, beautiful.
The amount of time that was put in this.
That's really sick that must have took a long time
That sick🔥🔥🔥
Holy crap! This is amazing! How'd you do it?! Would love to do something like this with my nephew who just started playing minecraft.
Gold
How does this work? Was it under the height limit or did you mod/comman block to raise it?
Dude…
The nostalgia that this overused render of Steve gives me, man...
    It’s fucking insane
Such satisfaction, many wow 🤩 take a ⬆️
HOW LONG DID THIS TAKE TO MAKE?!?!?!
I really thought it was going to pikachu for a minute

Holy shit. That's THE image
Shit man, this art makes me feel things.
That is just… beautiful
This dude said no to the build limit
Awesome job OP
That’s a classic image
As the 69,900th upvote, I agree with passion. Absolutely remarkable!
This is amazing!! How long did it take to make and get right?
i thought it was the german flag for a second

Never played minecraft but im always seeing creative shit done in the game. This is my favorite I've ever seen by far. Awesome job.
wow, thats awesome
Good thing I waited to claim my free award
this deserves an award, sadly I dont have one.

    Sir this is not Twitter
        Ratio sadly
            I'm sorry, I think you misunderstood my message, let me explain in a way you may understand:

This is not the other social media which mascot is a bird where half of the community tries to use mathematical equations to get more likes than the reply/post above them, just to accomplish something that is not worth anything at all, often leading to a failure
                Ah I see
                    Glad we came to a peaceful conclusion
so disappointing. considering this is reddit, it should have been either rick astley or dickbutt.
0/10 no Rick roll try again
/reposts

I made this.

EDIT: The joke fell on this one. I was imagining the comic where someone makes something, shows someone else, and then they say they made it.

Expected dickbutt
Basically they took the minecraft music ten hours thumbnail and deep fried it, noice
I'm so disappointed this wasn't dickbutt
    Kinda same.

It has been so long since I caught a dickbutt in the wild that I was hoping it would be a dickbutt.
Although I applaud all the work you put into this, the first thing that comes through my mind is that this is the reason why there's so much variation between the rich and the poor. Seriously dude, this must have taken a hundred hours. Don't get me wrong, it's great, but isn't there something better you could have done with your time? I know I sound like a jerk, but this looks seriously like it took you a long time.
    It seems strange to me that this was the first thing that came to your mind. Max this would have taken is probably 10 hours, and how did you get a variation between rich and poor exactly?
    this didn't take nearly as long as you think it did(20 hours MAX), and do you think this way about all hobbies? drawing, athletics, gaming, being on Reddit at all, - fuck; watching tv, reading, etc. 

Fairly shit take, honestly. If you think not spending any time to enjoy yourself is the correct way to live you're going to be in for a rude awakening later on in life.

Also there's no way to distinguish this person's financial status from this outside of "has computer". Someone who is poor could do this if they really wanted to. The "working class has no time to themselves" thought is heavily overstated. It's simply a matter of time allocation where they value certain other ways to spend their excess time others. If someone really *wanted* to do this they could do it regardless of their financial situation provided ofc that they had electricity, a computer, etc outside of very niche situations that make up WAY LESS of a percentage than you obviously think if it's your first thought.

Unless you're arguing "the reason people are poor is because they spend 2-3 hours a day doing something they enjoy after working" then that's an even more shit take. All while being on Reddit.
Beautiful
 Amazing
These are the moments I live for.
It's incredible!
Oh my. This is incredibly impressive
That’s amazing
I thought it said failing sand art and I was super confused
Whoa!
Mmm satisfaction lvls rising

What a wonderful visual. I feel like this would work to explain to someone how "he who remains" maintained the sacred timeline. So many branches all to create a single outcome.
Looks like a ecosystem
This should be a minecraft world record.
Nice work bet that took you forever didn't it
I had to clear my schedule to watch this one
Wow
epic
Oh damn. This looks so good-
Tik tokers: are you challenging me?
When you go up it kinda looks like you’re pissing blocks
I thought it was Howard the Duck at first.
I was really expecting Rick Astley ngl
Amazing...
Very cool

/u/GifReversingBot
I really thought it would be a Rick roll
sand yes
The talent on this man
Holy shit what the hell?
At the beginning it kind of looked like a dip
How do you know where it's going to land?
Man that looks beautiful!!!!!
You should put that in the Louvre!!
WOW just WOW
It's so big!
Minecraft really is a great game, even the music
Seeds Pro: “Image not found” picture
That's awesome. I was waiting for it to be dickbutt.
Cool. but would be even cooler if the painting order would be more linked to the image content.
THIS is delicious as fuck
Oh god that... that is beautiful..

Also, can i ask what mod that is?
You call that art ?? ART IS AN EXPLOOOSION 💥💥
This music tho... good vibes
THE MEMORIES... THEY'RE TOO MUCH
now this is a real r/nextfuckinglevel
wow
At first I expected the falling sand to create dickbutt.. I probably spend too much time on here..
That’s fricking amazing!!
looking nice🔥🔥
This is sick. Good sht
That’s impressive! Well done!
Beautiful
This would've made a really good rick roll
bro's build height is longer than the distance from sun's surface to moon's surface
Take my upvote
When I've thought I've seen it all on Minecraft, this pops up. This is the quality shit I love! Share this to Minecraft's Twitter page.
got goosebumps the moment I saw Steve ;-;
Looks fantastic 🔥🔥
Wow you are so talented
This is by far the coolest Minecraft video I've ever seen. Great work!
That’s so cool!!! Thanks for making this and sharing it! r/nextfuckinglevel
I thought van Gogh already passed away.
I’ve got so many questions I can’t actually articulate them.
Was 100% sure it was going to be a rickroll
I the internet has ruined me, i expected dickbutt.
That’s amazing
Now put it on maps to make it a custom painting
Jesus
Aaaww
Love the way you filled it in! I find the spiral/diagonal pattern get kind of boring.
Anybody else thought it was gonna be a rickroll?
What's the soundtrack name? Sorry if it's a silly question but I've followed Minecraft for years but not played it since SOI
"*Now this does put a smile on my face.*"
Beautiful! And falling sand too omg!!
How do you even know what it will look like while placing blocks? Amazing art btw
I was truly expecting/hoping for dickbutt so I guess this is fine
Hearing endgame soundtrack to this gives it a completely new vibe

Also bei prepared to see this on TikTok and then YouTube shorts
Where is the person telling me that “actually this has been generated using code and not built by hand“?
Someone should make a map art with falling sand and the map being updated as the sand falls.
kind of was expecting it to be a picture of rick astley.
This is what I call dedication!!!

Good job.
This is really fantastic! How long did this take you? (Sorry if already asked)
Yo speeding up the sand but not the music is pro strat! That was awesome!
I was expecting to be Rick rolled
whoa. this is incredible! (and nostalgic) good work
What's a brown falling block?
Nice
When I heard the soundtrack I immediately knew it’s something nostalgic, amazing job!
I thought that was bob ross at first glance lol
dope plugin
Whoa! That’s really awesome. How long did it take to do all that?
Dude, this picture always gets me nostalgic. This was my background in the school computer lab. Back in the windows 7 days. Just laughing at random websites with my friends. Please take me back.
How the hell I thought the build limit was 256 this dude made an art and not break the 256 build limit that’s impressive
Next do the Zac Galifinakis nod of approval meme
This should be at the end of minecraft after beating the dragon
This was absolutely beautiful... take my wholesome seal award
Wow! This is sick! I wonder how much time it took.
The last picture of Steve ever taken, seconds before he is incinerated by an atomic bomb
Holyyyyy  
so cOOL
BRUH WHY THE MUSIC AND THIS IMAGE STOP MAKING ME FEEL SAD DAMN IT
I consider the things I build to be pretty frigging impressive, then I see people do this and it makes me want to go crawl in a hole and hide from the face of God lol. That's awesome work dude.
"Oh shit, i didn't press 'Start Recording'"
I like how the sand sorta falls in a fractal-like manner
You Striked me with the nostaliga!
If this guy spent his time as an activist, we'd be somewhere lol
Bro i loterly have this photo franed on my wall
This thing has to be in a museum
I LOVE THAT AWW
Somebody give this man a solid gold medal. This is amazing!
I was anticipating dickbutt
You should've water marked it. Now some asshole on instagram is gonna repost this and take credit for it or just say  
Credit: Unknown
    I would but then my post would be taken down for self-promotion
Epic. Just epic.
Dude!!!!! Op
Thats amazing!!!!! So freaking cool
Holy fuck the second I saw Steve I got hit with the biggest wave of nostalgia. Man this is image, god it takes me back
Ok that’s pretty incredible
its that old wallpaper I always saw. Brings back memories. I remember watching this initially thinking its a Charizard or a volcano but it was something even better
How long this take?
Did you tell the sand they are a good boy?
Dear god
If you think about it, the sand that fell looks like mars mixed in with a farm field. Not gonna lie, better than any of my builds in minecraft.
A nostalgic picture, who has not seen it, but not who.
r/oddlysatisfying
That’s so cool!
This was sooo cool! Thanks for sharing 😊
Needs to be a painting in the actual game
That music just triggers the serotonin
Was expecting for a rickroll
Yes, this is art

No game has ever captured the magic of the first time I played Minecraft during the beta or alpha (not sure). I didn't know anything about the game. It was still owned by Notch. It was just a niche survival game and I had to figure everything out myself. 

I miss that.
    I was legit scared of the zombie noises outside my dirt box.
        I was SO happy when I found out what the peaceful difficulty did. God. I hated the monsters
            My friend was over at my house once and turned peaceful mode off while I was in the bathroom, only found out when a spider dropped on my head lmfao I about didn't talk to him for days
                But after those few days the spider had some interesting tales to tell I bet.
                    He can spin a good yarn :)
                        More like a web of lies.
            All those nights hiding in a 1x2 tall dirt hole waiting for the sun to rise.
Well before learning about beds
                I remember the exact moment I asked my mom what “peaceful” meant (I was an 8 year old Dutch kid so my English wasn’t great). When she told me the translation, I watched the skeleton that was attacking me disappear. A whole new world opened up for little me.
                The worst part was losing that 1x2 dirt hole. If you accidentally left stuff in it, you're never finding it again. All I wanted was a map in 2010.
                Oh my gosh yes, I actually turned on peaceful mode at nights until I discovered how to make beds
            From the first day I have no fear from the zombies, never died or lost my head. I love creative mode!
            [removed]
                [removed]
        The first time I saw what a creeper did was sad.  The second time made me jump out of my skin.
         And not understanding how spawning worked (light-based for hostiles). "I sealed off this room -- how did a skeleton get in here?!?!?"
        I hadn't ever played and went in last year completely blind and the first few worlds I made where I got lost and couldn't find my base and kept dying because I didn't realize the Endermen attacked me because I kept looking at them, I was scared of every noise, etc. were the best... It was an amazing experience. I was 26 by the way.
        I literally screamed the first time a spider jumped over my fortress wall. (I played on peaceful for quite a bit at first)
        I didn't dare to leave my house after my very first night in Minecraft because i heard something on the roof. I spent a good three days inside being terrified of the spider and when I finally ventured outside to gather food I discovered they were peaceful during the day


I still can barely believe that was a decade ago
        My very first night I dug a 3x1 pit  and waited because I was scared
        I thought pigs and sheep were zombies too so I always avoided them (I played pocket edition lite)
        The enderman sounds creeped me the hell out while I was mining. I didn't know what was even making the noises.
        And you had to be, until sprinting came along. Now you can run past every mob no prob. Kinda disappointing even if I see why they added sprinting
            Also, no beds. I kinda feel like the beds removed a lot of the aspect, there isn't really a "surviving the night" feel anymore.

Although useful af and sheep being the first thing I look for in a new world a lot of the vibe and how tough the game used to be kinda dwindled. Walked too far with no plan? Well, your fault, git gud or light up the place better. I liked that tbh
    I thought that, then I played Valheim.
        Does Valheim give that same feeling?  I will buy it today if so.
            For me it did, I have a couple of buddies that didn't love it, but they also didn't get grabbed by Minecraft in the same way I did
                Man I think you just talked me into Valheim

Edit: 2 hours in so far... no idea what I'm doing, but NOT regretting it
                    Valheim definitely managed to capture that Minecraft feel for me. Highly recommended.
                    Dude do it, it's magical and try not to spoil things for yourself.
            Yeah man, it's the same sort of feeling. It's different and does things differently but I've never felt super chilled and had mass rushes of adrenaline when things like Draugr or Trolls show up like Minecraft's creepers for example. Cruising around Valheims world on a longboat with the music playing is awesome.

Try it, see what it's like for 2 hours and if you don't like it, refund.

It is only 3rd person and can be difficult sometimes but the progression system is so nice. Fighting the bosses can be exhilarating.

The building system I would say is superior but frustrating at first due to its semi realistic physics for buildings. It can be really rewarding to build large structures without the roof caving in.

It's also best with a small group of friends on a server. No official servers and it's peer to peer right now unless you rent one yourself though.
                Huh, thanks for taking the time to type that out, I’ll have to look into it.
            Just dont look things up if you want that same experience :). Ive played who knows how many hours and never have i looked at a Valheim wiki page and i fucking love playing it like that. The unknown is so amazing. Not everyone wants to play it like that, but i enjoyed it. Also, play with some friends if possible
        Sea of Thieves does that for me randomly. Just staring at a sunset with your homies after a long haul, playing some music. Beautiful.
            Until those wannabe reapers come and try to sink you but fail.
    I love Minecraft and what it's become but I kinda miss not knowing much about the game and just meandering around my world without much of a goal in mind.
        Every once in a while I will load up my original world and just fiddle around.  I tend to not stay up to date with all of the new stuff, so I just walk around and discover new things they've added.  It sometimes brings back that feeling of mystery.
    Subnautica had a similar feeling to me if you haven't played that yet. Slowly learning and adapting to the environment as you learn of new creatures and progress in the game was probably one of best video game experiences I had. Subnautica Below Zero is the second game and isn't as good but is still pretty solid.
        I will check it out!  Thanks!
    I remember seeing the on of the first version of minecraft PE on a family members phone and loving it, later on started renting out the DvD and watching DanTDM never really realizing what a mod was and trying to recreate all the structures in their (DanTdm,Popularmmos,Stampy,etc) videos. Would head over to my friends house and play on their worlds. Good times, build megastructures and mals now but theres always something I'll miss about the chaos of just building
    [deleted]
        I remember paying $15 for a "lifetime license" or some other such named thing.
    Ahh the googling of recipes. No wikis yet. Just random blogs.
        The first time you didn't have to punch a tree down. Bliss.
    I’ll never forget looking up YouTube videos for how to craft specific things.
    Facts
    For me it was astroneer that felt the same
    Botw came close for me. Oh the feels …
    I can’t fucking believe my first world was a little over decade ago. So many vivid memories of all the discoveries, triumphs, and terrifying moments I had. Damn I miss those simpler times.
    I had a world with a big box house which I made in creative (only basic deco) then I went to survival, turned on peaceful and just walked in the house, outside the house and I played that world so much idk why, I even had a secret base but put nothing in it (it was single player)
    It's been so amazing watching minecraft grow over the last decade. I'm envious of the generation of kids that got to grow up playing it. It's like legos on steroids!
    Alpha back when Yogscast was good
    Same. My son was on the beta test and we all joined in to play. It was so fun and exhilarating finding new blocks for the first time
    Try Rimworld. Just trust me on this.
    I remember the first time I played as well. My husband (then boyfriend) was with me in the room and had played a little so I had a small cave house and some coal and all of a sudden I found some stone with brown lines in them. I asked boyfriend what it was and he had no idea so we had to look it up. Turned out we had found iron. 

Also, some time before that (I think couple of weeks), we saw this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/LnjSWPxJxNs
        Lol. Just that casual"crap."
    The book of recipes was sad for me
    I agree 100%, any time I play these days I just end up wishing I could capture that feeling again.
    I wish I understood the appeal of Minecraft. (I don’t say that sarcastically. It seems beloved, but I have ADHD and have always assumed it’s too tedious. I usually only like mission-based and old “2d” fighting games. What draws you to it?)
        Now, this is coming from a veteran player. So, most of the things I love about are from the beta. I don't have much experience with the bulk of the "new" things and most new things to me are post redstone. 

The thing I enjoy the most is it is like a  digital Lego set. Anything I can think of, I can build and see it in 3D. I can put secret doors and weird mechanisms wherever. So, anyone just browsing my base would never even know that stuff was there. It's just an open creativity box.
        Hi! Fellow ADHDer! I have gotten into Minecraft since version 1.14, and it took me a little while to really get into it. I didn't like not knowing anything at all, and the game not telling you anything. It felt frustrating at first. Also, the building felt so tedious, having to place dirt everywhere to reach your build. 

But now, I cannot put the game down anymore. I love how I  can spend hours just building and designing, and on other days go world exploring, or farming and taming animals, or just mine for resources when I've got little headspace. Also even after so many hours of playing, there's still so much left to learn and discover in the game. And with the constant new updates that will stay that way for a long time!
    Discovering minecraft for the first time was magical
    Back when it still costs 5€
    [removed]
        I remember when I wasn't sure if the world had an end and I walked for a long ass time. This was before compasses and maps. I didn't think I would ever find my base again.
    My first world started with me going down a hole leading into a cave. Then I came across monsters and tried to escape back, without realizing the cave wasn't actually built to allow me to walk outside the same way I came and had an unclimbable section. The monsters murdered me and by the time that was done it was already night. I then got murdered by basically everything and restarted after a few misguided attempts at (barefist) revenge, not realizing death is only as meaningful as your inventory at a given time.
    Try muck.

    I always fucking cry when I hear the music. I don’t ever fucking cry, only that music can do that to me. Greatest game ever, times changes tho can’t look back
Somewhere before the youtubers REALLY blew up, but well after the game established a modding community and stuff like SEUS shaders made the rounds and gained infamy for making toasters melt
    How did they make toasters melt?
        Lava pockets. Never underestimate them.
This, or the Windows wallpaper with the Creeper peering through. Man, I miss the old days of Minecraft. My mom got me my first account as a Valentine’s Day gift in 2013 because I couldn’t wait till my birthday to join my friends in the game. So much nostalgia.
Alpha and Beta days were the best. Lava and water survival lobbies were the shit.
It's the music.

:)
You wanna cry from nostalgia?

[They wake up on a beach!!!](https://youtu.be/MLKFtIC2Idw)
    That was fantastic!
Yep, this stretched over 1000 blocks into the sky
    It's beautiful. My day just begun and I doubt I'll see anything as cool as this for a while. 

Thank you for sharing.
        Why am I crying? my god amazing art demonstration 👏🏻👏🏻
    Did you draw the picture in different "brushes" instead of expanding from the middle to all sides to avoid performance strains or just for the visuals?
        It was kinda both. If it expanded from the middle evenly to all sides it would just make a boring upside down pyramid shape. I also had it start from the side and go in branches to create less lag since there were less entities falling at once
            Do you have the code for it somewhere? You should put it on github
    How did you expand the height limit?
        One way is to use a world generation datapack to set the maximum y to some integer up to 1023
            I’m guessing you can only do this in the experimental snapshots or the pre-1.17 snapshots where you can increase the build height
                It's still possible in the releases (eg 1.17.1) as well since the experimental Caves & Cliffs world generation datapack works in those versions, I believe
    Excuse me, Mister,
How is it posible to expand the built height limit?
    Wow
        How long did it take?
    Amazing work!
    You made me cry
How did you increase the height limit?
    1.17 datapacks
        Or cubic chunks mod
WHATTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!????????????
Doing things like this just takes away from the game imo. There's a height limit for a reason and by changing this without mojangs consent you are in essence pirating your own bootleg games
    "Mods are pirating the game"
    We've found it folks, the worst take.
    People aren't reading your username lmao
        Lmao he's really good at pissing people off.
        I did. There is absolutely nothing snide about his comment. It is just a shit take.
    I agree. One time I saw my little cousin switch Minecraft skins on the 360. I immediately reported him to the FBI and I hope he rots in prison.
        I modded my 3ds and changed some textures and added a custom skin to the 3ds version of minecraft, currently on the run from the fbi
    Its just modded minecraft
    how many times have mojang changed the world height?
    I used a data pack to modify the height limit, which mojang implemented themselves

        My favourite copypasta
    What? Minecraft is an open source game. Much like L4D2 which should be supported because it not only gives you more bang for your buck. It increases the longevity of your game by giving the users some power. The only reason L4D2 still has hundreds of thousands of players is the insane mod support.
        They are not open source. There is a very big deference between open source and moddable.

It is true that both games highly support and encourage modding. But the code itself is not open and available.
        Its "open source" in a way that you can get the source but you arent supposed to have it legally
            >Its "open source" in a way that you can get the source but you arent supposed to have it legally

And there's no comments and it's missing developer tools that would make life a lot easier to work with it.  It barely meets the definition for "source available" even with Mojang publishing deobf remappings.
        And because even vanilla L4D2 is one of the best FPS games ever made.
            I’ll give u that. Straight masterpiece
    What in the actual fuck are you going on about, mate?
    I see the name now
    Yeah that’s just dumb
    this just in, the upper build limit is a core game mechanic that shouldn't, nay, can't be changed
    what?
    Currently the tallest building in the world is 2,717 feet tall. The block limit in Minecraft converted into feet is only about 839-1100 feet. The build limit is from bedrock and not from the ground remember too.

The tallest mountain, Mount Everest, is 29,000 feet. The game doesn’t come to being close to real heights we can achieve, and for a game that’s meant to be creative there shouldn’t be any limitations to creativity
        For the rest of the world, the tallest building in the world is 828m tall compared to minecraft's default 256m, 320m in 1.18. Mount Everest is 8,849m tall.

256m is also 839 feet, not 920 or 1100, and the future 320 block height limit is 1049 feet so I'm not sure where those conversions came from
expected rickroll, unexpected great vibes, thanks op
    Idk why but I was expecting dick butt

    I don’t know why people give that line so much shit. That’s exactly the kind of cringy shit a teenage boy would say to his crush.
        That’s a good point. Name one teenager who’s like bloody Shakespeare when speaking bro their crush
            The character is irritant because he is supposed to be, he is a whiny teenager made into a child soldier, he is also extremely gifted, so his frustration is understandable. He wanted to convey to someone, who barely stayed a couple of days in the hellhole that is Tattooine, how mind numbingly bothersome is having sand everywhere. Visualise the feeling you get when you go to the beach and you get some sand in your private parts, between your legs and in your shoes, now imagine living like this 24/7, for your first 10 years of your life, also being a slave to some guy, that although he doesn't treats you badly he isn't nice.

Kinda same.

It has been so long since I caught a dickbutt in the wild that I was hoping it would be a dickbutt.
It seems strange to me that this was the first thing that came to your mind. Max this would have taken is probably 10 hours, and how did you get a variation between rich and poor exactly?
this didn't take nearly as long as you think it did(20 hours MAX), and do you think this way about all hobbies? drawing, athletics, gaming, being on Reddit at all, - fuck; watching tv, reading, etc. 

Fairly shit take, honestly. If you think not spending any time to enjoy yourself is the correct way to live you're going to be in for a rude awakening later on in life.

Also there's no way to distinguish this person's financial status from this outside of "has computer". Someone who is poor could do this if they really wanted to. The "working class has no time to themselves" thought is heavily overstated. It's simply a matter of time allocation where they value certain other ways to spend their excess time others. If someone really *wanted* to do this they could do it regardless of their financial situation provided ofc that they had electricity, a computer, etc outside of very niche situations that make up WAY LESS of a percentage than you obviously think if it's your first thought.

Unless you're arguing "the reason people are poor is because they spend 2-3 hours a day doing something they enjoy after working" then that's an even more shit take. All while being on Reddit.
I would but then my post would be taken down for self-promotion
I was legit scared of the zombie noises outside my dirt box.
    I was SO happy when I found out what the peaceful difficulty did. God. I hated the monsters
        My friend was over at my house once and turned peaceful mode off while I was in the bathroom, only found out when a spider dropped on my head lmfao I about didn't talk to him for days
            But after those few days the spider had some interesting tales to tell I bet.
                He can spin a good yarn :)
                    More like a web of lies.
        All those nights hiding in a 1x2 tall dirt hole waiting for the sun to rise.
Well before learning about beds
            I remember the exact moment I asked my mom what “peaceful” meant (I was an 8 year old Dutch kid so my English wasn’t great). When she told me the translation, I watched the skeleton that was attacking me disappear. A whole new world opened up for little me.
            The worst part was losing that 1x2 dirt hole. If you accidentally left stuff in it, you're never finding it again. All I wanted was a map in 2010.
            Oh my gosh yes, I actually turned on peaceful mode at nights until I discovered how to make beds
        From the first day I have no fear from the zombies, never died or lost my head. I love creative mode!
        [removed]
            [removed]
    The first time I saw what a creeper did was sad.  The second time made me jump out of my skin.
     And not understanding how spawning worked (light-based for hostiles). "I sealed off this room -- how did a skeleton get in here?!?!?"
    I hadn't ever played and went in last year completely blind and the first few worlds I made where I got lost and couldn't find my base and kept dying because I didn't realize the Endermen attacked me because I kept looking at them, I was scared of every noise, etc. were the best... It was an amazing experience. I was 26 by the way.
    I literally screamed the first time a spider jumped over my fortress wall. (I played on peaceful for quite a bit at first)
    I didn't dare to leave my house after my very first night in Minecraft because i heard something on the roof. I spent a good three days inside being terrified of the spider and when I finally ventured outside to gather food I discovered they were peaceful during the day


I still can barely believe that was a decade ago
    My very first night I dug a 3x1 pit  and waited because I was scared
    I thought pigs and sheep were zombies too so I always avoided them (I played pocket edition lite)
    The enderman sounds creeped me the hell out while I was mining. I didn't know what was even making the noises.
    And you had to be, until sprinting came along. Now you can run past every mob no prob. Kinda disappointing even if I see why they added sprinting
        Also, no beds. I kinda feel like the beds removed a lot of the aspect, there isn't really a "surviving the night" feel anymore.

Although useful af and sheep being the first thing I look for in a new world a lot of the vibe and how tough the game used to be kinda dwindled. Walked too far with no plan? Well, your fault, git gud or light up the place better. I liked that tbh
I thought that, then I played Valheim.
    Does Valheim give that same feeling?  I will buy it today if so.
        For me it did, I have a couple of buddies that didn't love it, but they also didn't get grabbed by Minecraft in the same way I did
            Man I think you just talked me into Valheim

Edit: 2 hours in so far... no idea what I'm doing, but NOT regretting it
                Valheim definitely managed to capture that Minecraft feel for me. Highly recommended.
                Dude do it, it's magical and try not to spoil things for yourself.
        Yeah man, it's the same sort of feeling. It's different and does things differently but I've never felt super chilled and had mass rushes of adrenaline when things like Draugr or Trolls show up like Minecraft's creepers for example. Cruising around Valheims world on a longboat with the music playing is awesome.

Try it, see what it's like for 2 hours and if you don't like it, refund.

It is only 3rd person and can be difficult sometimes but the progression system is so nice. Fighting the bosses can be exhilarating.

The building system I would say is superior but frustrating at first due to its semi realistic physics for buildings. It can be really rewarding to build large structures without the roof caving in.

It's also best with a small group of friends on a server. No official servers and it's peer to peer right now unless you rent one yourself though.
            Huh, thanks for taking the time to type that out, I’ll have to look into it.
        Just dont look things up if you want that same experience :). Ive played who knows how many hours and never have i looked at a Valheim wiki page and i fucking love playing it like that. The unknown is so amazing. Not everyone wants to play it like that, but i enjoyed it. Also, play with some friends if possible
    Sea of Thieves does that for me randomly. Just staring at a sunset with your homies after a long haul, playing some music. Beautiful.
        Until those wannabe reapers come and try to sink you but fail.
I love Minecraft and what it's become but I kinda miss not knowing much about the game and just meandering around my world without much of a goal in mind.
    Every once in a while I will load up my original world and just fiddle around.  I tend to not stay up to date with all of the new stuff, so I just walk around and discover new things they've added.  It sometimes brings back that feeling of mystery.
Subnautica had a similar feeling to me if you haven't played that yet. Slowly learning and adapting to the environment as you learn of new creatures and progress in the game was probably one of best video game experiences I had. Subnautica Below Zero is the second game and isn't as good but is still pretty solid.
    I will check it out!  Thanks!
I remember seeing the on of the first version of minecraft PE on a family members phone and loving it, later on started renting out the DvD and watching DanTDM never really realizing what a mod was and trying to recreate all the structures in their (DanTdm,Popularmmos,Stampy,etc) videos. Would head over to my friends house and play on their worlds. Good times, build megastructures and mals now but theres always something I'll miss about the chaos of just building

    I remember paying $15 for a "lifetime license" or some other such named thing.
Ahh the googling of recipes. No wikis yet. Just random blogs.
    The first time you didn't have to punch a tree down. Bliss.
I’ll never forget looking up YouTube videos for how to craft specific things.
Facts
For me it was astroneer that felt the same
Botw came close for me. Oh the feels …
I can’t fucking believe my first world was a little over decade ago. So many vivid memories of all the discoveries, triumphs, and terrifying moments I had. Damn I miss those simpler times.
I had a world with a big box house which I made in creative (only basic deco) then I went to survival, turned on peaceful and just walked in the house, outside the house and I played that world so much idk why, I even had a secret base but put nothing in it (it was single player)
It's been so amazing watching minecraft grow over the last decade. I'm envious of the generation of kids that got to grow up playing it. It's like legos on steroids!
Alpha back when Yogscast was good
Same. My son was on the beta test and we all joined in to play. It was so fun and exhilarating finding new blocks for the first time
Try Rimworld. Just trust me on this.
I remember the first time I played as well. My husband (then boyfriend) was with me in the room and had played a little so I had a small cave house and some coal and all of a sudden I found some stone with brown lines in them. I asked boyfriend what it was and he had no idea so we had to look it up. Turned out we had found iron. 

Also, some time before that (I think couple of weeks), we saw this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/LnjSWPxJxNs
    Lol. Just that casual"crap."
The book of recipes was sad for me
I agree 100%, any time I play these days I just end up wishing I could capture that feeling again.
I wish I understood the appeal of Minecraft. (I don’t say that sarcastically. It seems beloved, but I have ADHD and have always assumed it’s too tedious. I usually only like mission-based and old “2d” fighting games. What draws you to it?)
    Now, this is coming from a veteran player. So, most of the things I love about are from the beta. I don't have much experience with the bulk of the "new" things and most new things to me are post redstone. 

The thing I enjoy the most is it is like a  digital Lego set. Anything I can think of, I can build and see it in 3D. I can put secret doors and weird mechanisms wherever. So, anyone just browsing my base would never even know that stuff was there. It's just an open creativity box.
    Hi! Fellow ADHDer! I have gotten into Minecraft since version 1.14, and it took me a little while to really get into it. I didn't like not knowing anything at all, and the game not telling you anything. It felt frustrating at first. Also, the building felt so tedious, having to place dirt everywhere to reach your build. 

But now, I cannot put the game down anymore. I love how I  can spend hours just building and designing, and on other days go world exploring, or farming and taming animals, or just mine for resources when I've got little headspace. Also even after so many hours of playing, there's still so much left to learn and discover in the game. And with the constant new updates that will stay that way for a long time!
Discovering minecraft for the first time was magical
Back when it still costs 5€
[removed]
    I remember when I wasn't sure if the world had an end and I walked for a long ass time. This was before compasses and maps. I didn't think I would ever find my base again.
My first world started with me going down a hole leading into a cave. Then I came across monsters and tried to escape back, without realizing the cave wasn't actually built to allow me to walk outside the same way I came and had an unclimbable section. The monsters murdered me and by the time that was done it was already night. I then got murdered by basically everything and restarted after a few misguided attempts at (barefist) revenge, not realizing death is only as meaningful as your inventory at a given time.
Try muck.
I always fucking cry when I hear the music. I don’t ever fucking cry, only that music can do that to me. Greatest game ever, times changes tho can’t look back
How did they make toasters melt?
    Lava pockets. Never underestimate them.

Thank you for sharing.
    Why am I crying? my god amazing art demonstration 👏🏻👏🏻
Did you draw the picture in different "brushes" instead of expanding from the middle to all sides to avoid performance strains or just for the visuals?
    It was kinda both. If it expanded from the middle evenly to all sides it would just make a boring upside down pyramid shape. I also had it start from the side and go in branches to create less lag since there were less entities falling at once
        Do you have the code for it somewhere? You should put it on github
How did you expand the height limit?
    One way is to use a world generation datapack to set the maximum y to some integer up to 1023
        I’m guessing you can only do this in the experimental snapshots or the pre-1.17 snapshots where you can increase the build height
            It's still possible in the releases (eg 1.17.1) as well since the experimental Caves & Cliffs world generation datapack works in those versions, I believe
Excuse me, Mister,
How is it posible to expand the built height limit?
Wow
    How long did it take?
Amazing work!
You made me cry
1.17 datapacks
    Or cubic chunks mod

    I did. There is absolutely nothing snide about his comment. It is just a shit take.
I agree. One time I saw my little cousin switch Minecraft skins on the 360. I immediately reported him to the FBI and I hope he rots in prison.
    I modded my 3ds and changed some textures and added a custom skin to the 3ds version of minecraft, currently on the run from the fbi
Its just modded minecraft
how many times have mojang changed the world height?
I used a data pack to modify the height limit, which mojang implemented themselves
Guys, remember rule number one:

Don't feed the troll.
Judging by your name and account age this is probably a bait
I just downvoted your comment.

# FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

# Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

# Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

# I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

# How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.
    My favourite copypasta
What? Minecraft is an open source game. Much like L4D2 which should be supported because it not only gives you more bang for your buck. It increases the longevity of your game by giving the users some power. The only reason L4D2 still has hundreds of thousands of players is the insane mod support.
    They are not open source. There is a very big deference between open source and moddable.

It is true that both games highly support and encourage modding. But the code itself is not open and available.
    Its "open source" in a way that you can get the source but you arent supposed to have it legally
        >Its "open source" in a way that you can get the source but you arent supposed to have it legally

And there's no comments and it's missing developer tools that would make life a lot easier to work with it.  It barely meets the definition for "source available" even with Mojang publishing deobf remappings.
    And because even vanilla L4D2 is one of the best FPS games ever made.
        I’ll give u that. Straight masterpiece
What in the actual fuck are you going on about, mate?
I see the name now
Yeah that’s just dumb
this just in, the upper build limit is a core game mechanic that shouldn't, nay, can't be changed
what?
Currently the tallest building in the world is 2,717 feet tall. The block limit in Minecraft converted into feet is only about 839-1100 feet. The build limit is from bedrock and not from the ground remember too.

The tallest mountain, Mount Everest, is 29,000 feet. The game doesn’t come to being close to real heights we can achieve, and for a game that’s meant to be creative there shouldn’t be any limitations to creativity
    For the rest of the world, the tallest building in the world is 828m tall compared to minecraft's default 256m, 320m in 1.18. Mount Everest is 8,849m tall.

256m is also 839 feet, not 920 or 1100, and the future 320 block height limit is 1049 feet so I'm not sure where those conversions came from

It is only 3rd person and can be difficult sometimes but the progression system is so nice. Fighting the bosses can be exhilarating.

The building system I would say is superior but frustrating at first due to its semi realistic physics for buildings. It can be really rewarding to build large structures without the roof caving in.

It's also best with a small group of friends on a server. No official servers and it's peer to peer right now unless you rent one yourself though.
        Huh, thanks for taking the time to type that out, I’ll have to look into it.
    Just dont look things up if you want that same experience :). Ive played who knows how many hours and never have i looked at a Valheim wiki page and i fucking love playing it like that. The unknown is so amazing. Not everyone wants to play it like that, but i enjoyed it. Also, play with some friends if possible
Sea of Thieves does that for me randomly. Just staring at a sunset with your homies after a long haul, playing some music. Beautiful.
    Until those wannabe reapers come and try to sink you but fail.
Every once in a while I will load up my original world and just fiddle around.  I tend to not stay up to date with all of the new stuff, so I just walk around and discover new things they've added.  It sometimes brings back that feeling of mystery.
I will check it out!  Thanks!
I remember paying $15 for a "lifetime license" or some other such named thing.
The first time you didn't have to punch a tree down. Bliss.
Lol. Just that casual"crap."
Now, this is coming from a veteran player. So, most of the things I love about are from the beta. I don't have much experience with the bulk of the "new" things and most new things to me are post redstone. 

The thing I enjoy the most is it is like a  digital Lego set. Anything I can think of, I can build and see it in 3D. I can put secret doors and weird mechanisms wherever. So, anyone just browsing my base would never even know that stuff was there. It's just an open creativity box.
Hi! Fellow ADHDer! I have gotten into Minecraft since version 1.14, and it took me a little while to really get into it. I didn't like not knowing anything at all, and the game not telling you anything. It felt frustrating at first. Also, the building felt so tedious, having to place dirt everywhere to reach your build. 

But now, I cannot put the game down anymore. I love how I  can spend hours just building and designing, and on other days go world exploring, or farming and taming animals, or just mine for resources when I've got little headspace. Also even after so many hours of playing, there's still so much left to learn and discover in the game. And with the constant new updates that will stay that way for a long time!
I remember when I wasn't sure if the world had an end and I walked for a long ass time. This was before compasses and maps. I didn't think I would ever find my base again.
Lava pockets. Never underestimate them.
Why am I crying? my god amazing art demonstration 👏🏻👏🏻
It was kinda both. If it expanded from the middle evenly to all sides it would just make a boring upside down pyramid shape. I also had it start from the side and go in branches to create less lag since there were less entities falling at once
    Do you have the code for it somewhere? You should put it on github
One way is to use a world generation datapack to set the maximum y to some integer up to 1023
    I’m guessing you can only do this in the experimental snapshots or the pre-1.17 snapshots where you can increase the build height
        It's still possible in the releases (eg 1.17.1) as well since the experimental Caves & Cliffs world generation datapack works in those versions, I believe
How long did it take?
Or cubic chunks mod
Lmao he's really good at pissing people off.
I did. There is absolutely nothing snide about his comment. It is just a shit take.
I modded my 3ds and changed some textures and added a custom skin to the 3ds version of minecraft, currently on the run from the fbi
My favourite copypasta
They are not open source. There is a very big deference between open source and moddable.

It is true that both games highly support and encourage modding. But the code itself is not open and available.
Its "open source" in a way that you can get the source but you arent supposed to have it legally
    >Its "open source" in a way that you can get the source but you arent supposed to have it legally

And there's no comments and it's missing developer tools that would make life a lot easier to work with it.  It barely meets the definition for "source available" even with Mojang publishing deobf remappings.
And because even vanilla L4D2 is one of the best FPS games ever made.
    I’ll give u that. Straight masterpiece
For the rest of the world, the tallest building in the world is 828m tall compared to minecraft's default 256m, 320m in 1.18. Mount Everest is 8,849m tall.

256m is also 839 feet, not 920 or 1100, and the future 320 block height limit is 1049 feet so I'm not sure where those conversions came from
With the yellow and brown color scheme I saw at first, I was expecting surprised Pikachu.

Disappointed by the lack of dickbutt
This one image shows more emotions then any of Billie eilish's songs
    not typically a Billie eilish fan but her song listen before I go is *very* emotional
        I never said her songs weren't emotional, I just said this image had more
    *oh, but apparently she can "see colours" or something so it's so "artistic"*

Edit: hol up it's hear colours (now I just sound like a fool)
        >*oh, but apparently she can "see colours" or something so it's so "artistic"*

What? I can see colors...

I feel like through the course of 2015 or so we were all irrevocable conditioned to expect it
I think it was all computer generated, but he did put up each block piece by piece, just a thought
I’m missing something here…

        Thank you!
Idk why, but I read this in the voice of Hans Landa from Inglorious Basterds.
    That's a bingo!
        It's just bingo
That’s a good point. Name one teenager who’s like bloody Shakespeare when speaking bro their crush
    The character is irritant because he is supposed to be, he is a whiny teenager made into a child soldier, he is also extremely gifted, so his frustration is understandable. He wanted to convey to someone, who barely stayed a couple of days in the hellhole that is Tattooine, how mind numbingly bothersome is having sand everywhere. Visualise the feeling you get when you go to the beach and you get some sand in your private parts, between your legs and in your shoes, now imagine living like this 24/7, for your first 10 years of your life, also being a slave to some guy, that although he doesn't treats you badly he isn't nice. And after you get out of that place the people that take you away leave your mother to rot there...      
I think Anakin went too softly against the Jedi... Perhaps the younglings were a bit to much
no, any posts
I'm sorry, I think you misunderstood my message, let me explain in a way you may understand:

This is not the other social media which mascot is a bird where half of the community tries to use mathematical equations to get more likes than the reply/post above them, just to accomplish something that is not worth anything at all, often leading to a failure
    Ah I see
        Glad we came to a peaceful conclusion
My friend was over at my house once and turned peaceful mode off while I was in the bathroom, only found out when a spider dropped on my head lmfao I about didn't talk to him for days
    But after those few days the spider had some interesting tales to tell I bet.
        He can spin a good yarn :)
            More like a web of lies.
All those nights hiding in a 1x2 tall dirt hole waiting for the sun to rise.
Well before learning about beds
    I remember the exact moment I asked my mom what “peaceful” meant (I was an 8 year old Dutch kid so my English wasn’t great). When she told me the translation, I watched the skeleton that was attacking me disappear. A whole new world opened up for little me.
    The worst part was losing that 1x2 dirt hole. If you accidentally left stuff in it, you're never finding it again. All I wanted was a map in 2010.
    Oh my gosh yes, I actually turned on peaceful mode at nights until I discovered how to make beds
From the first day I have no fear from the zombies, never died or lost my head. I love creative mode!

Also, no beds. I kinda feel like the beds removed a lot of the aspect, there isn't really a "surviving the night" feel anymore.

Although useful af and sheep being the first thing I look for in a new world a lot of the vibe and how tough the game used to be kinda dwindled. Walked too far with no plan? Well, your fault, git gud or light up the place better. I liked that tbh
For me it did, I have a couple of buddies that didn't love it, but they also didn't get grabbed by Minecraft in the same way I did
    Man I think you just talked me into Valheim

Edit: 2 hours in so far... no idea what I'm doing, but NOT regretting it
        Valheim definitely managed to capture that Minecraft feel for me. Highly recommended.
        Dude do it, it's magical and try not to spoil things for yourself.
Yeah man, it's the same sort of feeling. It's different and does things differently but I've never felt super chilled and had mass rushes of adrenaline when things like Draugr or Trolls show up like Minecraft's creepers for example. Cruising around Valheims world on a longboat with the music playing is awesome.
