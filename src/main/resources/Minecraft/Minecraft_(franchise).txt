''Minecraft'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Survival game|survival]] [[sandbox game]] developed and published by [[Mojang]], spanning multiple platforms. It was originally created by the independent video game designer [[Markus Persson]] in 2009, before giving the development to [[Jens Bergensten]] in 2011. The game has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game. Gameplay is in the [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]], with the core gameplay modes being [[survival mode|survival]], in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health (optionally with a "hardcore" limit, which deletes the world after the player dies); and creative, in which players have unlimited resources, no hunger and are able to fly. The game world is composed of [[voxel]]s—cubes, commonly called "blocks"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava, which are arranged in a 3-dimensional grid. Gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects as the player pleases, while being able to move freely around the world.

== Film ==
{{main|Minecraft (film)}}
In 2012, Mojang received offers from Hollywood producers who wanted to produce ''Minecraft''-related TV shows; however, Mojang stated they would only engage in such projects when "the right idea comes along".
Two years later, in February 2014, an attempt to [[crowdfund]] a [[fan film]] through [[Kickstarter]] was shut down after [[Markus Persson|Markus 'Notch' Persson]] declined to let the filmmakers use the license, the given reason being that the Kickstarter was set up before any agreement with Mojang had been made. That same month, Persson revealed that Mojang was in talks with [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] to develop an official ''Minecraft'' film to be produced by [[Roy Lee]] and [[Jill Messick]]. In October 2014, Mojang COO Vu Bui stated that the movie was "in its early days of development", saying that it was a "large-budget" production, and also said that it might not be released until 2018. That same month, Warner Bros. hired [[Shawn Levy]] to direct the film, while in December, it was confirmed that Levy and writers [[Kieran Mulroney|Kieran]] and Michele Mulroney, who were developing the film together had left the project.
In July 2015, it was announced that Warner Bros. had hired [[Rob McElhenney]] to direct the film. According to McElhenney, he had been drawn to the film based on the open-world nature of the game, an idea Warner Bros. had initially agreed with and for which they had provided him with a preliminary US$150 million budget. In 2016, early production started on the film, including in June assigning a release date of 24 May 2019, in October setting [[Jason Fuchs]] to write the script, and in November contracting [[Steve Carell]] to star as the voice of an unknown character. McElhenney's ''Minecraft'' film "slowly died on the vine," and due to scheduling conflicts, he left the film in August 2018, [[Aaron and Adam Nee]] were tapped to rewrite the script, and the film was delayed as a result. No new director was announced at that time.
In January 2019, [[Peter Sollett]] was announced to write and direct the film, featuring an entirely different story from McElhenney's version. Messick, who died in 2018, will be posthumously credited as producer. In April 2019, Warner Bros. scheduled the new film to be released in theaters on 4 March 2022. In June 2019, [[Allison Schroeder]] was hired to write the script and co-write the film with Sollett. In October 2020, the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] prompted Warner Bros. to adjust its release schedule, including removing the ''Minecraft'' film from its planned release date.
Sollett instead directed ''[[Metal Lords]]'', which was released exclusively on [[Netflix]] in April 2022. That same month, production on the ''Minecraft'' film was announced to be moving forward without Sollett and Schroeder, now with [[Jared and Jerusha Hess|Jared Hess]] set to direct and [[Jason Momoa]] in early talks to star. The film was also confirmed to be [[live action]]. Some sources also said that Chris Bowman and [[Hubbel Palmer]] would rewrite the script. In early April 2023, it was reported that the film would release on 4 April 2025. In May, [[Matt Berry]] entered negotiations to join the cast. On 19 June 2023, it was reported that [[principal photography]] on the film would start on 7 August in [[New Zealand]], before filming was delayed in July due to the [[2023 SAG-AFTRA strike]]. Following the conclusion of the strike in early November 2023, filming was reported to be aiming for an early 2024 start. Later that month, [[Danielle Brooks]] and Sebastian Eugene Hansen joined the cast as Dawn and Henry, respectively, and filming was scheduled to begin in late December 2023. In early December, [[Emma Myers]] also joined the cast. In early January 2024, [[Jack Black]] was cast as Steve, teasing his casting in the film via his official [[Instagram]] account.
