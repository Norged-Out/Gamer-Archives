[[Minecraft mobs as cute girls! üíñ [OC]]]





That blazes smug ass aura haunts me
    It feels like the blaze chases you around and smugly makes fun of you
        Holy shit can you imagine that you're in nether fortest and just hear smug laughing and see her coming with her friends
            Lmao is that a bane of arthropods? What a stupid enchantment. Frost walker boots looool....
                Not even looting? Lol never heard of GOOD enchantments?
    I think it's more like really energetic
    Just imagine her laughing at you and calling you "gross~" and telling you to go run an errand for her.  

I'm having flashes of "Ijiranaide Nagatoro-san!" all over again...
>Minecraft mobs as cute girls!

*[Vietnam flashbacks to the "mob talker" mod]*
    Did they ever update it to 1.14
        Haven't checked it.I will go look.

Edit: Only looks like up to 1.12
    the what
        https://mobtalker.fandom.com/wiki/Mob_Talker_Wiki
            why though
                I wanna say Rule 34.
                    I don't think it was originally made for Rule 34 but there is definitely a lot of Rule 34 of it.
                        Where can I find this. It's for research
                            There are at least two websites that I know that are called rule 34 where you can find this. Just put 'Minecraft' into the search bar and you might find it alongside art that is more faithful to the source material. Hope this helps you research and make that thesis for your classes.
                                Wait, there are two websites called that?
                            watafak
                        sure why not?
    Welp, that's a memory I preferred repressed
    That's exactly what I was thinking of lol. Couldn't remember the name though
    Gosh,i remember having a crush on the creeper girl...
    Oh boy look out rule 34 here comes the neckbeards
This is frigging adorable , I have a question are you planning on making more mobs into cute girls??
    thank u so much! possibly!! if its highly requested i may do another 9! ^__^
        I'd love to see a bunch of passive mobs.
            Mooshroom! üêÑüçÑ
                Just a tip, a lot of people dislike emojis on reddit except üÖ±Ô∏è and üóø
                    The dude's been here for more than 9 years I'm sure they know
                        Yo, i just gave him a heads up no need to be rude
                            I'm so sorry if I came off as rude, I didn't meant to sound like that :(
                                It's ok, you are forgiven ( 'v') (happy penguin noises)
        Please please please!!! These are too fucking cute. I have to see more! If you feel so inspired, how about a silverfish or endermite?
        U should totally do it they're so cute!
        Requesting highly
        Yes please! I'd love to see magma cube, wither skeleton, witch and shulkers to name a few! Really amazing art work! Keep it up!
        Yes please, these are great :D
        [deleted]
            I believe that is known as a ghast. Bearing the distinct trait of crying
    A shulker would be really cool
my dumbass doesn't know what the middle bottom one is
    It's a spider
        Oh.
    [deleted]
        nope its a spider
        ohhhh
Piggirl and endergirl are to die for

Edit: add blaze to that list
    nah its spidergirl cause she has f a n g s
        huh, would've bet you'd pick zombie
            Why do you say- *sees username* ... Oh.
                *Oh.*
                    ^*Oh.*

        Hell na, that endergirl is bad
            I respect ur opinion and taste but I disagree
                I respect that
                Woosh
                    F in the chat
            Different taste
    [***Ah...***](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/414/033/43d.gif)
Who‚Äôs the sixth one?
    Ghast
        Ohhh. I see it now. Thanks.
this needs to be an anime
    {Dr. Stone}
Blaze will probably be that one girl who is absolute jerk to you for no reason and ender that silent girl who gets mad for no reason. Creeper is the hugger who makes you feel like you are dying(this time actually, she will kill you, don‚Äôt hug her in hardcore)
    Based off of the depictions:

Blaze = tsundere

Enderman = dandere

Creeper = yandere (or similar)

Skeleton = kuudere

Zombie = bakadere

Spider = mayadere

Ghast = shundere

The rest are either normal or don't really have a term to describe them.
        Great, now I have the mental image of a spider girl dressed in amerindian clothes that sacrifices Steve's heart to Quetzalcoatl stuck in my head.
        Translate pls
            Google is your friend.  
However, since I'm such a nice guy n' all, here you go: https://the-dere-types.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dere_Types_Wiki
                That's also true
        Nah, Blaze is a Sadodere
        Why are there this many different deres. This is madness.
            Plenty more than that. There's a full list on Fandom.
they are BABY
    This sounds like something my brother would say
These are adorable and I love them
Ghast-chan looks like she needs a hug
WHO is 8?
    The Spider
    Ooooo ok
        Cool
I want to give them all hugs and headpats but I also don't want to die.

What a conundrum.
Naa the ender girl is the best
More pls
no
Omg the goth enderman has me dying. Great work
Skeleton: I reject my humanity jojo
Never thought I‚Äôd say this.
























Make more
Great now I feel bad for mass slautering them
I have killed so many...     '_'
The skeleton and slime are my favorites!
    I'm pretty sure the skeleton is actually a ghast
        I thought the ghast was the right middle one.
            Oh yeah I got confused my bad -__-
                No way! I thought it was a ghast too.
So you lolified minecraft? Impressive
    Oh dear god no
        Oh dear God Yes
*rule 34 intensifies*
I respect it
Is the 7th one a bee?
    Skeleton Pig Blaze

Zombie Creeper Ghast

Slime Spider Enderman
        The top center one is probably a zombie pigman, fits the theme better.
            Good point!
    Slime
        Ahh that makes more sense, thanks!
*Mob talker, AT-2 and MC visual novels flashbacks*

Was the spider inspired by Muffet?
Why isn't creeper Cupa :(
I feel like Skeleton girl is a Kuudere while the Crepper girl is a Tsundere.
one of these ladies is explosive you know, blowing my mind and that.
BONERATER 3000
I really like the zombie pigman
The slime should be hopping, not walking.
[removed]
Enderman is a tsundere
i wanna see the bosses as them or at least add a wither again i like the art style and i find it very cool that people can draw
All the undead mobs look tired as hell, very cute

I also love the enderpearl as a hair accesory
Endergirl just looks done with everyone's shit
This reminds me of a certain site I go everynight
What‚Äôs the 6th girl???
What is no.6
Yo this is lit
Can you please make the skeleton girl in a picture only and send it to me? i would like to make it to my profile picture :D

Zombie Pigman looks sad :(
That was a mod once
Could I make a comic using these *fabulous* girls? I will give credit of course, if you allow me to make it.; (I won't make it if you don't want your designs to be used)
Big pp
From now on I‚Äôm just gonna imagine all endermen as goth girls who steal things when they are upset like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk to me and my dirt block ever again‚Äù and then storms off
i feel stupid because i dont get the lower middle one
i love this

and creeper is my favorite mob in minecraft
Who is sixth mob?
reminds me of that one minecraft mod...
that ghast is adorable ngl
How old are they
Who remembers being 12 and lusting over the mob-talker mod girls? I sure do mmmmm the skeleton and blaze girls were hot
What are they all? I can't tell some of them x
Parents prepare to be disappointed
I like the spider and slime
Now that's something I can get behind with!
Endergirl is best girl
Whats the 8th one?
Reddit assemble
"A shit, here we go again..."
The spider looks like it‚Äôs about to break my nico nico kneecaps
God, forgive me for what I am about to do.
Could i still defend myself at night?

    Spider

Spider and endergirl is my fav
I didnt know how badly I needed this
Kawaii

Not my proudest fap
    FBI open up
    Hi, my name is Chris Hansen...
Ok so I'm pretty sure people know about the OG cute minecraft girl mobs right? Like this isn't the first time its happened.
    Ah yes, you wish to invoke the ancient rule that no two beings may ever have the same idea ever - this law, as we all know, is literally written in stone.

Pray tell us where OP may appeal this decision so the Keepers of the Gate may decide if they are worthy of exception to the Laws of old.
        No--I--What? I was just saying there where cute anime girl mobs already. I never said they can't exist at the same time.
            In that case I honestly don't see the point of making that comment.

Look at it from OP's perspective, they make a cool drawing and you're like, "this has been done already you know". Like what is the point of saying that, if not to suggest that you think it's lame OP made their drawing after someone else had the idea first?

I'm not even ripping into you here. I'm genuinely asking.
                Well my question for you is why attack me? 

I said the because everyone in the comments thought that this is the first time it's never happened before, and I'm not dissing on the art either. It's good art and cute as well.

And personally, someone can steal the artist ideas but if they just copy and paste the art as their own. Then that's when I have a problem with it. I only diss on cringy edgy oc art.
                    > Well my question for you is why attack me? 

Because you were gatekeeping.

> I said the because everyone in the comments thought that this is the first time it's never happened before

I don't remember any comments like that, so I just looked through all of the comments to be sure, and it turns there are *zero* comments where people think nobody did this before.

> And personally, someone can steal the artist ideas but if they just copy and paste the art as their own. Then that's when I have a problem with it. I only diss on cringy edgy oc art.

I have trouble understanding this because it's not clear whether you think this is OC or not.
                        Nahh, I think these are oc's. And if they where then nice.

Edit: Also what do you mean by gatekeeping?
*hears loud clapping noise from comment above*
Wish this was a mod so I could kill cute girls
#im getting flashbacks and something's rising but it's not the shield hero
Unsub

Fuckin anime lookin ass monster shit *jk it's fine good job*

I don't remember any comments like that, so I just looked through all of the comments to be sure, and it turns there are *zero* comments where people think nobody did this before.

> And personally, someone can steal the artist ideas but if they just copy and paste the art as their own. Then that's when I have a problem with it. I only diss on cringy edgy oc art.

I have trouble understanding this because it's not clear whether you think this is OC or not.
                    Nahh, I think these are oc's. And if they where then nice.

Edit: Also what do you mean by gatekeeping?
_If you find anything just report back!_
This.
Were discouraging art now here? Alright.
Holy shit can you imagine that you're in nether fortest and just hear smug laughing and see her coming with her friends
    Lmao is that a bane of arthropods? What a stupid enchantment. Frost walker boots looool....
        Not even looting? Lol never heard of GOOD enchantments?
Haven't checked it.I will go look.

Edit: Only looks like up to 1.12

    why though
        I wanna say Rule 34.
            I don't think it was originally made for Rule 34 but there is definitely a lot of Rule 34 of it.
                Where can I find this. It's for research
                    There are at least two websites that I know that are called rule 34 where you can find this. Just put 'Minecraft' into the search bar and you might find it alongside art that is more faithful to the source material. Hope this helps you research and make that thesis for your classes.
                        Wait, there are two websites called that?

I'd love to see a bunch of passive mobs.

                Yo, i just gave him a heads up no need to be rude
                    I'm so sorry if I came off as rude, I didn't meant to sound like that :(
                        It's ok, you are forgiven ( 'v') (happy penguin noises)
Please please please!!! These are too fucking cute. I have to see more! If you feel so inspired, how about a silverfish or endermite?
U should totally do it they're so cute!
Requesting highly
Yes please! I'd love to see magma cube, wither skeleton, witch and shulkers to name a few! Really amazing art work! Keep it up!
Yes please, these are great :D

    I believe that is known as a ghast. Bearing the distinct trait of crying
Oh.
nope its a spider
ohhhh
huh, would've bet you'd pick zombie
    Why do you say- *sees username* ... Oh.
        *Oh.*
            ^*Oh.*
                Oh.

Hell na, that endergirl is bad
    I respect ur opinion and taste but I disagree
        I respect that
        Woosh
            F in the chat

Ohhh. I see it now. Thanks.
Great, now I have the mental image of a spider girl dressed in amerindian clothes that sacrifices Steve's heart to Quetzalcoatl stuck in my head.

        That's also true
Nah, Blaze is a Sadodere
Why are there this many different deres. This is madness.
    Plenty more than that. There's a full list on Fandom.
Cool
I thought the ghast was the right middle one.
    Oh yeah I got confused my bad -__-
        No way! I thought it was a ghast too.
Oh dear God Yes
The top center one is probably a zombie pigman, fits the theme better.
    Good point!
Ahh that makes more sense, thanks!
oh wow thats adorable spider
Ok thanks
Oh! That makes sense

No--I--What? I was just saying there where cute anime girl mobs already. I never said they can't exist at the same time.
    In that case I honestly don't see the point of making that comment.

Look at it from OP's perspective, they make a cool drawing and you're like, "this has been done already you know". Like what is the point of saying that, if not to suggest that you think it's lame OP made their drawing after someone else had the idea first?

I'm not even ripping into you here. I'm genuinely asking.
        Well my question for you is why attack me? 

I said the because everyone in the comments thought that this is the first time it's never happened before, and I'm not dissing on the art either. It's good art and cute as well.

And personally, someone can steal the artist ideas but if they just copy and paste the art as their own. Then that's when I have a problem with it. I only diss on cringy edgy oc art.
