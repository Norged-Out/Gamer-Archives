[[Minecraft + Lego = Love (making my own texturepack!)]]





Does it make like a logo clicking sound when you place blocks
    The man in lego city is proud
        Thank you
            you were visited by the man in lego city... what an honor!
                I'm honestly crying, it's the best thing that's ever happened to me
                    he’s fake, he didn’t say HEY
                        Thats the line of my friend, the rescue man, bob.
                            brick rigs bob?!?!
                                Yes
                                    Epic 😎
                            Are you ok after the river incident?
                Plot twist: He didn't fall into the river on accident, he was going to visit it.
            The Professor of Lego ist proud too
        [Everything has Fallen Into the River in Lego City](https://youtube.com/watch?v=HCYHRHPyOUg)
            The river has fallen into Lego City!
        Oh you know the quote: HEY!
        *HEY*
             *HEY*
        Hey!
        The one who has fallen into a river in lego city?
        Great to see he is doing good after that tragic river accident
        No. He already passed away in the river during the failed mission
        That's the splashing sound  
"A man" "A man" "A man" "A man"-
        HEY!
        #H E Y
        I still cannot believe that the guy who plays Agent 47 is the Lego City commercial announcer
    If it doesn't than someone should should make an add-on pack that does.
        Then
        [deleted]
            No it’s a texture pack with shaders separately says in pictures lol
    You can’t walk unless you jump
    Dude, you should make that magma blocks are a bunch of mini lego pieces
    That would be very easy to implement with a resource pack. It would be a shame if it doesn’t release with one
    Probably a separate sound pack or a sound addon
    *lego And hopefully it does my friend.
        Yeah idk why my autocorrect didn't recognise lego
            Because logo is a word.
                And Lego isn't? Autocorrect just sucks sometimes. Like, half the time I try typing "bot", it Autocorrects to "not"
                    All I was saying is that it didn't need to correct anything because logo is a word.
                        > Yeah idk why my autocorrect didn't recognise Lego



This implies that they typed "Lego" and it autocorrected to "logo"
                            Oh ok, I got you. Sorry for the trouble.
    Damn you got 5000 IQ!
        Tyty
    Godtfred Chistensen (creator of modern lego) is really proud of you
We will watch your career with great interest.
    I am his career

                    Now the “incident” with the younglings makes more sense.

    Or maybe we'll watch Lego go after an indie dev and sue him.
        Lego hasn't sued people for selling instructions for their own MOCs, so they probably won't sue someone for a Minecraft texture pack.
            Theyre suing a lego vendor who makes lego yt videos.
            Unless ofc those MOCs contain non-Lego-bricks not marked as non-Lego-bricks.
    [removed]
some people seem kinda rude about it, but it might legitimately be a good idea to take the logo off so this doesn't get taken down bc it looks so cool. Maybe call it "lego-inspired"? Whatever you do, we'll all be very interested
    I will not use official lego logos in this pack but I don't know if I can make any money from it because of this:[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dk9LZt4rCBoeMUCIeYlu38gzDfekGk6B/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dk9LZt4rCBoeMUCIeYlu38gzDfekGk6B/view)
        def not, and that logo on the bricks could be copyrighted. I'm not an expert, but I'd be wary.

I def think you should keep this up tho even if you remove the branding for 2 reasons:

1) this is beautiful and you've captured the simple beauty of the lego building blocks exceptionally well here

2) This, when combined with mods to import other bricks, make designing custom lego builds more accessible and easier than ever before (yes you can use LDD but I feel this would work better, maybe it's just me)

edit: wary not weary
            It's definitely trademarked which has much stricter restrictions than copyright, including the stipulation that the owning company *is required* to fight violations or risk losing the trademark.
                And this looks like it could be an official product from Lego so shaky territory- plus they have lego games so the market confusion argument seems easy
                    I thought it was an official thing at first until I saw the "u/ ”

Lego would absolutely be willing to make something like this as an official product, they absolutely would be willing to brand it and advertise it with a picture like this, and someone would absolutely throw it up on this sub.
                        Iirc lego already has put out several minecraft kits in the past. They tried making their own minecraft style game too. It's been years since I looked into it but it was kinda disappointing back then. It was supposed to be getting more content and idk if it ever did. 

Point being, this texture pack could potentially fall into the territory of affecting Lego's ability to sell their own products, which is usually one of the defining points used in trademark lawsuits.
                            Oh yeah that game was bad. I think I didn't make it an hour because the UI was so bad
                                it also got filled with wangs pretty quickly, https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-06-01-lego-mmo-development-dogged-by-dong-detection-software
                    Also LEGO is well known for being happy to lawsuit their fans.
                > including the stipulation that the owning company *is required* to fight violations or risk losing the trademark

This is often repeated, and indeed mostly true to the letter of the law, but also misunderstood many times. The mark owner has *many* ways to respond besides C&D and lawsuits, there is no requirement for a company to be a dick about it, contrary to popular opinion. Secondly, it's a *lot* harder for world-famous marks to be diluted or lost than the law makes it seem; nobody's losing the trademarks Oreo, Xerox or Kleenex to competitors even though they're rife with misuse by non-competitors.

                    This is the first time I've actually understood why people misspell wary as weary so often. Goddammit, English.
            I use Bricklink Stud.io 2. It's like LDD but with way more brick shapes and color options, as well as the ability to check pricing of pieces in the program, and export part lists for your designs to Brickljnk for easy buying.
            There’s also another program that is leagues better than LDD which is called BrickLink Studio.
            It’s just the logo though. The reason why there are so many rip off legos on the market is bc Lego can’t legally patent the lego parts or shapes bc it’s such simple desine. So you can make anything just like a lego just don’t use the brand name lego
                [The brick were patented but the patent have expired.](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-11302614)
        Everybody in this thread seems to be an ignorant doomsayer. Here's lego's own rules about using their name in fan created entities: http://aboutus.lego.com/en-us/corporate/fairplay.aspx

TL;DR: you're free to use the Lego logo on the studs and can call it a lego resource pack, but you can't make money, you can't use the red square logo. Always capitalize LEGO, make sure the first time the word Lego is presented it has a (R) symbol so people know it's registered.

                Nah, just know how to Google, and happen to have worked on a lego fan project in the past.

            As someone who has had a lot of LEGO sets and also some “construction brick” sets as well, they are not identical. 

I have never had LEGO bricks that do not fit together properly or have extraneous pieces of plastic from the molding process. Only once (out of probably 250+ sets) has a piece been missing (they actually had the wrong piece). 

All of those are common issues with “construction bricks.”  LEGO’s quality control is second to none.
                [deleted]
                I second this comment - all other construction bricks are inferior. I have a little microbrick kit on my shelf and its so cheap in comparison to the Lego around it.
        Change the order of the letters but keep the same typeface?
            L O G E, I love it!
                LOGE, SUCH BRICK!  WOW!  *CLICK*
                    Such wow
                Or make it something like:
MINE or CRAFT
                    Alternate since the blocms look like they have 2 studs each.
                    BLOC
        Idea: change the logo on the bricks to "Logo".
            Definitely not a solution. Its too close to the original and 'there is a risk of confusion'. There could also be a copyright problem, because using the logo on the 'pimple' could be protected by a patent.
        lego generally does not care as long as you don't make money off it, thats why bionicle quest for mata nui was not canceled
        if you take a look at what happened to the german lego youtuber "held der Steine", I'd remove any reference to the word lego, and also remove the brick as an image from the logo. he got sued for having a lego type brick in his logo, and now again for referencing a different manufacturers brick as lego. they have nothing left as a company and have now resolved to sueing everyone into the ground, at least in germany.
        You will receive a cease and desist letter based on the picture you uploaded here alone. 

Lego doesn't fuck around, and now that you mentioned you even considered making money from their IP you're fucked.
            >Lego doesn't fuck around, and now that you mentioned you even considered making money from their IP you're fucked.

People sell their own Lego instructions, and Lego hasn't gone after any of those people.
                MOC's don't usually use LEGO branding tho, do they?

And that's technically still profitable for LEGO themselves, given that the parts, in the end, have to come from them, and it still promotes their core product in a way.

&#x200B;

I would have just assumed they strike anything down that might have any connection with their brand while being deemed "not worth it".

I might be a bit biased here though. Slight (or, realistically, longer) tangent: There is an actually quite big German YouTuber who has a small brick shop and makes videos about LEGO and, for a while now, alternatives. He is fairly critical of LEGO as of late, on a very factual basis though. He compares new LEGO models to older models and especially products of their direct competitors. It is pretty clear that, objectively, the quality and simply the size of LEGO models has gone down, while the prices exploded. The competition, on the other hand, offers a way better deal almost across the board (the best comparison to me, so far, was between a 180€ LEGO technic car model that looked like shit and had absolutely no technic features while you could get a good-looking remote controlled (including a remote controlled transmission) competitor model with double the pieces for the same price).

To get to the point: That guy has a decent influence on the market. (That competitor model mentioned above actually sold out for a while after he presented it) So LEGO got winds of his videos. They skimmed through and found a moment in the video where he referred to the competitors model or some of its parts as "LEGO" and used that as grounds to demand the takedown of said video for "violating their IP". Not only is that bullshit on its own, but they fucked themselves in more than one way, because he rerecorded that video fixing that "flaw", pointing out even more problems with the model and making a bit of a mockery out of their bullshit. Reaching even more people than before, mind you.

So, basically, I trust LEGO to be overly protective of anything they consider their IP AND to make the worst possible decisions in terms of what to do legally, so I'd be careful.
                Probably because instructions don’t come with legos themselves, right? So you gotta go purchase your own anyway.
                    There are fan games that Lego hasn't taken down.
                        I’m not saying it’s like a 100% sure thing Lego goes after every single infringement, but just offered an explanation to why they may ignore certain ones.

Also, instructions may be something they’ve decided isn’t actually up to their infringement standard since you can’t copyright instruction manuals (very over generalizing here). The trademarks though, could be different.
                            You actually can copyright manuals. You can't copyright the instructions themselves, or recipes or anything, but you can copyright an instruction book.
            [deleted]
                >I can confirm people use brand names in their maps a lot and companies don’t bother cracking down if you’re not making a profit from it.

Only because a brand have the right to take you down, doesn't mean that they do it. In most cases this isn't worth the effort and also brings bad publicity.

But this doesn't count for Lego. They even sue people that make free advertising for them... they totally lost every connection to reality.
        Just use something stupidly similar but still different. IEGO, LEQO, IEQO, etc.
        As others are saying, fantastic job, but please remove the logo, it's not worth getting into legal trouble over a free community project.
        Lego on the studs is probably a bad idea. Even in Lego clubs that receive direct acknowledgement and support from Lego, who are not selling or doing anything other than Lego, still are extremely wary of using the name "Lego" in the name of anything.

Take the name off the studs, don't use the name Lego in anything, just call it "bricks" etc etc etc. You don't want any Lego reference anywhere.

The actual brick design is no longer copyright so anyone can use it (hence mega Bloks etc) but the branding is a whole different game and they will come at you.
        MINE
        Should have just dropped it when it was ready. Teasing it will give them time for a cease and desist. Releasing it suddenly makes it impossible to remove it from the internet.  
Or, as suggested, call it 'construction blocks pack' or something similar.
    This is actually a good point so OP doesnt get copyrighted.. either way sick as hell B)
    Mega Blocks texture pack it is
        Generic brand building block texture pack just to be safe!
            Block is probably ™d. Better go with Generic Brand Erection Rectangular Prism Texture Pack just to be safe!
    yeah lego is like nintendo. strict af
        In Germany we now call it Klemmbausteine and I think that‘s just beautiful

        Aren't they generally the opposite? There's a whole Bionicle fan game being made right now with Lego's blessing
            Lego sued a German YouTuber because he called other non Lego bricks Lego
                Oh that one's news to me.

How are you gonna do water?
    A metric ton of blue studs
        transparent ones
    When you jump in, it says "hey!".

    Probably have just transparent blue lego blocks as the texture, or go the lego world's route and just have normal water
    It could be based off those transparent legos but something about the sky makes me think it'll just be that jarring hyper-realistic GPU melting shiny water instead.
    You know what i really want? For diamonds to be those purple studs!
        They need to be! Either diamonds or netherite

If you don’t walk with boots on you take damage, right?
    Yes and not little damage
        Lmao you take 9.5 hearts of damage
            Per block
                Per second on the block you standing on like magma blocks
                    And crouching only makes the pain worse.
                        And if you jump you instantly die
    It's ok, Steve is Lego in this too. Lego people can walk on Lego without harm.
    Or put flat slabs on everything
    Walk on lego enough and you become lego yourself (with appropriate holes in your feet, that is)
Definitely needs to have POM for the tops... that would be cool.
    Looks like it does, you can see it in the bottom left image
Reminds me of Lego Worlds
    this is going to be lego worlds, but it doesn’t get boring after 12 minutes
        Eh i enjoyed lego worlds
            I really want to enjoy LEGO Worlds but Adventure Mode is kinda 50/50 for me and Sandbox feels limited since it’s missing certain pieces.

Unfortunately it didn’t live up to the hype, kinda bummed out about it. I do quite enjoy it a lot though whenever I can think of something up to build, it’s just difficult when it’s a bit limited.
                despite my big gamer time gamer brain I cannot for the life of me answer why we don't have a satisfying lego building video game to date, or rather why Lego World just isn't that satisfying to play
                    To be fair if they made a whole ass lego game where you could build what ever you want- you wouldn't wanna buy lego lol, why buy lego when you have an infinite amount in a videogame? My conspiracy theory is that lego purposely didn't make a full game so they are still able to sell physical lego
                        This used to be my theory until I learned about [Lego Digital Designer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH9xoFC8CCM&ab_channel=JosephDepalma) aka LDD. I mean it's...legit official lego with infinite pieces. But...will it scratch that itch?

Edit: you can import [official sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6HpfRAdUKQ&t=745s&ab_channel=BrickSystemBrothers) too
                            Hmm- tbh I still think that technically does it? Like that's designed so that people can design their own lego sets. However it only goes far enough so that your more likely to buy lego- because with that not only does it look sorta stale in terms of rendering, but obviously ya can't do much with it except look at it. A far more fledged designer would have a better looking render engine- and you could play with it virtually if you wanted. However lego wont do that, cuz that'd take away sales from physical lego
                            The thing is, when I played with lego, I didnt because I enjoyed building, because I loved to play out numerous weird scenarios, from space battles to robot uprising etc etc.  


No digital lego game to date can scratch the itch that is flying a lego plane with your hand into the wall, only to have lego robots kill all your little lego people to have one lego man survive and kill all the lego robots to become lego king
                        That's actually... a pretty decent theory. Have you seen Lego prices? That shit's worth more than gold
                            Exactly- lego used to cost me an arm and a leg when I was super into it lol
                    I would say Blockland, as I played that game RELIGIOUSLY when I was younger, but the community is pretty dead. Nonetheless, it’s building mechanics is amazing, and there’s a spiritual successor being developed right now called Brickadia.

reminds me of the old OLD Lego minecraft texture pack from years ago
    The old one didn't get the ratios right. A 2x2 Lego brick isn't a cube; the height/width ratio is 3/5, which means you need to add 2 plates to get a cube. That pack didn't do that, but OPs does.
    I have it too
    Me too, wish i could find it again. Made my minecraft 1.4 worlds amazing.
        i think i have it on my old hardrive, i'll update in hour
            Any update?
                no, i'm still looking...
                    Rip
                        ok, so pack in question wasn't on the hard drive, but i did some digging, the pack in question was called legopak

http://legopak.kladd.nu/ here is the link i found
                        Hey, it's only been 7 years since my last update :).
        Since they didn’t respond directly to you, they pack is called legopak
    That was the first thing i thought of when seeing this, legopak was my life
Well fuck...  Now I'm even more excited to finally build my own gaming pc!!
    Is it out of Legos?
That's cool and all bro, but when/where could I download?
    "Coming soon"
        “when”
            the day after next week
            Welcome to Blizzard
    I don't think it's at that point yet lol
        “when”
            when someone doesn't announce any sort of release date it's probably because they don't know, so my point still stands lol
                when

        N\*\*\*\* g\*\*\*\* g\*\*\* y\*\* u\*!
I've seen plenty of resource packs that try to emulate Legos, but this looks like the best one by far.
here's a question, how come mojang hasn't made an offical Lego texture pack yet? You'd think that would have been on of the frist texture pack they made for minecraft.
    Honestly, I'm kinda surprised by it too. Like, there's Minecraft Lego sets even.

I did start to think "oh wait, 3d textures are new".. and then realized I'm thinking of back in, like, 2013. Which makes me feel old.
    The reason is performance. Making a resource pack that makes every single block a 3D model (so that you can have Lego tops) would barely run on any kind of computer. You can already notice a high performance impact when using any 3D resource pack that only has 3D models for certain blocks. Using PBR textures to give every block a Lego top (which I assume is what's being done here) is much more efficient, but requires Optifine shaders obviously, which isn't an official mod.
Welt seid mir gegrüßt, ich bin der Held der Steine in Frankfurt am Main im Herzen von Europa in meinem wunderbaren kleinen Lädchen an einem fantastischen Tag. Und schaut Mal was ich euch mitgebracht hab: eine kleine einstweilige Verfügung von Lego. Ganz genau, nichts wovor man sich fürchten müsste.
    Nach so einem Kommentar hab ich gesucht
    Klemmbaustein Texturenpacket
    ¿Qué?
        It's a phrase a famous german youtuber, who focuses on Lego and Lego-like products, always uses as an intro. 


He had some legal run-ins with Lego over things most people would probably call benign. One example is calling a brick of a competitior "Lego brick" instead of "interlocking bricks".


OC ended the comment with a small alteration to the intro insinuating that OP might get a nice letter from Legos lawyers on his own, since he is quite obviously using a protected trademark.


Hope you like your dissected frog.
            I was on mobile, and didn't have the opportunity to go to Google Translate to figure it out, and was just being silly.

But genuinely homie: thanks for the explanation.  That was way more informative than Google Translate would have been.  You actually provided context.

I will eat frog legs with you any day bro.
Cool! I can't wait to try this pack out.
Ohhhhh cool,you gonna use normal Maps to make them even more lego?
When you level up it should be the minikit collected sound effect or the max studs achievement in a level
Reminds me of Roblox back in like 2006 when I found it googling “online lego game”.
This is sick as fuck
FinalIy don’t have to drop $70 to make a godlike base out of legos 🥲🙏🏼
*sees texture pack*

*reads SEUS PTGI requirement*

*looks at computer*

Computer (softly): Don’t.
its cool to see this done well, back in the day many tried to make it but they were mostly terrible, this looks awesome
Remove the logo, call it inspired. Looks great!
this looks fire cant wait to see this when its done
Please let exp be studs form the Lego games
I feel like the grass would kill you in 6 steps.
You're probably going to receive a cease and desist letter. You can't just slap the Lego logo on your texture pack and think that Lego is going to be okay with it.
    Dude, the texture pack is not being monetized, also, why would they sue this one guy for slapping lego textures on a game that they don’t even care about. There are plenty of mods that use copyrighted stuff like the marvel mod and stuff...
        It doesn't matter if it's monetized or not (and OP didn't say it was going to be free), and I didn't say they'd sue him. Sending a cease and desist is different than suing someone. Perhaps I should have said, "be prepared to potentially receive a C&D", instead of saying "probably". But a C&D means OP gets a letter saying, "You're infringing on our trademarked logo. Take it down, or we'll sue you." It could even say, "Remove all download links, and delete the texture pack from your computer, and if we somehow find out you haven't done that, we'll sue you."

At that point, it wouldn't matter if OP just changed the name, he'd have to stop the project entirely or risk being sued. I'm suggesting to OP that it's probably not worth the risk. OP should probably delete this post, and call the texture pack something else, and in the post title say, "I made this texture pack inspired by Lego". That's probably a lot less risky.
            Lego seems pretty chill with their copyright to the point of letting a whole team work on a Bionicle game with the condition that they don't make any money off of it. They even have a guy from the original commercials doing some video promos for them as well.
                >Lego seems pretty chill with their copyright

Haha, no. There are e.g. some smaller companies in Germany that have to fight some ridiculous lawsuits
                Part of having a trademark requires companies to actively defend it. Unless they sign an agreement with him to use their trademark, they risk losing it, because it sets precedent for other possible future infringements.
                    > Part of having a trademark requires companies to actively defend it.

Isn't this a Reddit law that isn't actually true?
                        I was originally amazed that the next comment in the chain wasn't "lol thats not true".

Trademarks and copyrights are just property of intelligence. If Lego^TM decided to be chill for someone being inspired by the brand, no government agency could force them to be upset. If Lego sued someone for making counterfeit sets, and branding them as Lego, it would not be diminished because someone made a texture pack.
                        Yes, it's a reddit law. Have renewed TMs myself and gone over the documentation. To say that a company needs to be policing every potential infringement possible is nonsense. It would never hold up in or out of court to say that because you weren't dealt with for infringement, you're free to do it or that the trademark holder can no longer claim ownership. What has to be proven is that the infringing party knowingly used the property in ways that violate its accepted use. What's worse, the sort of regulation that requires constant policing would drastically undermine small businesses and give all of the power to large companies that can afford teams of lawyers working on this full time.  

Check out [this article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/trademark-law-does-not-require-companies-tirelessly-censor-internet) on the subject.
                        I don’t what what Reddit Law is, but it is true. Done a bit of work with game development and seen both sides, companies defending and companies receiving cease and desist.

Also, trademark laws aren’t universal, different countries operate differently. One of the biggest complaints about the TPP was how much more power it gave those companies in enforcing their IP.
                            > I don’t what what Reddit Law is

Something that is parroted on Reddit that isn't actually true.

Seems this is the case and companies don't need to "defend" their trademarks.
                                Except that precedent and corporate lawyers have them doing it. So sure, and idealistic interpretation of the law would be they don’t have to, but they all operate as if they do have to. By their very own page on the topic Lego believes in defending their trademark around the world.
                    I mean I will be real, it's a minecraft texture pack on the internet. It is plenty valid for companies to have a blind eye to trademark offenders because it really isn't worth their time to pursue it, and it generally doesn't mean much in the long run.

If this developed into one of the most popular minecraft texture packs and pretty much everyone and their mother used it? I'm pretty sure Lego would step in due to obligations to defend their trademark.
                        That’s not how obligations work unfortunately. They weaken their trademark for all future infringements so it does mean a lot in the long run. 

This is a corporation, they can’t afford to be soft or turn a blind eye and they don’t care about making people feel good when it comes to infringing on their IP. 

There’s a reason why these companies have giant law firms on retainer, or even large internal legal teams.

But hey, time will tell if this kid gets a cease and desist letter.
                    >Part of having a trademark requires companies to actively defend it.

[This is a myth.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/trademark-law-does-not-require-companies-tirelessly-censor-internet) You do not lose a trademark if you choose not to sue someone. In fact it's the opposite. You have to regularly renew your trademark and note how it's being used - so you using it is what's important, not someone else. Companies sue/C&D people for infringing on IPs because it prevents their brand from becoming diluted and prevents other people from profiting off of their properties. Which, like, fair enough, but still. I think it's harmful to keep perpetuating this idea that companies are somehow mitigating regulatory risk. It paints them as "hey, lady, I'm just followin' da rules" when really they're just protecting a bottom line that honestly isn't really threatened.
                        https://www.justia.com/intellectual-property/trademarks/enforcement/

“However, a failure to enforce a trademark by monitoring the mark for misuses will result in a weakening of the mark and loss of distinctiveness, which can lead to a loss of the trademark.”

Edit; Also claiming it’s a myth because of a 2013 opinion article about how current enforcement is overzealous doesn’t make it a myth. Sure, in a perfect world if they didn’t already operate like this that would be how it could work, but as that article even says, lawyers wanna get paid.
        They do care, there are even Minecraft sets sold by Lego. A German Youtuber recently got into mild trouble for using the word “Lego” for the bricks of other companies. Everyone does so, but I guess they kind of have to sue to keep their brand name and competitors from being allowed to say that they produce “Lego bricks”.

Finnaly, a man Can fall in the river of legocraft peacefully
Finally, lego worlds in minecraft
Do you take damage from walking on the ground?
Can you make it so every time you go in water it makes the “a man has fallen in the river in Lego City” sound?
    technically yes
Whoa! This looks incredible... my boy Keralis would love it!
    Hey, why are people downvoting your comment
    I have no idea why you are getting downvoted, but also, is Keralis a lego type person? I didnt really know
Yooo TAKE THOSE LOGOS OFF ASAP!!! lego scan the internet for other people using legos name and brick style this will get you a cease and desist in the mail!!! Its a lockable brick style texture pack!
Oufff must be a pain to walk around
1: Define soon please
2: That's not nearly soon enough
3: This legitimately might be worth trying to contact Lego company and maybe even Mojang about. If you could license it and keep it legit, this could be a massive achievement.
4: How does this not already exist anyways
would you mind sending me the link once you are done with it? it would also be nice if you made the tools lego themed too.
    Good idea
Is there a way I can be notified when this releases? So good looking!
Are those 3d? Or is it just a texture
    if you look closely st the tree i thonk they are 3d
        Thank you!
It's like Lego Worlds but actually good. My son will be very excited.
the plastic reflectivity...
Texturepack will be called MineBricks for SEUS PTGI. Screenshots:

    What platforms will this be available for and when?
        1. It will ba available for java.
2. Upcoming weeks
Ima need a 1.8 version
Make it a Lepin texturepack maybe?
is it just me or does it look like that game my brother plays, "Brick Rigs" or something?
I want it.
Can’t wait
A man has fallen into the river in Lego City.
Yes! Whenever I gotta explain Minecraft to other mums, I always go 'it's lego, but on a computer'!
Dieses wunderbare Resourcenpaket darf aber nur Lego heißen wenn auch Lego drin ist, sonst gibt's ne Abmahnung! Sonst sind die Spieler verwirrt!!!
Kind of looks like Roblox back in 2010.
Lego Yoda death noises!?
Isn’t there already several lego packs with plastic looking textures and block connectors.
This looks so cool.
Please release a download for this ** AMAZING ** pack when it is finished? Or make a pattern and sell it because it’s beautiful
cant wait!
Player takes damage every time they walk.
few questions... will we need the shader and what versions? (do 1.8.9 idk why)
this is awesome!, hope it will be released soon. I am so excited.
Dude, this looks INCREDIBLE. If I tried it, I feel like my computer might explode, though
Every time you step: *O U C H*
better not step ANYWHERE!!!!!
every step you take, you'll take damage
We needed something like this for awhile
I need this!!!!!
If I were you I'd remove the LEGO logo, their company is really trigger happy with their lawsuits
The xp orbs should be Lego studs
Ein Klemmbaustein Texturenpaket wäre eine grandiose Idee.
Be careful, dont get yourself sued!

Edit: It looks sick though
This is great. A long time coming.
Please make one for bedrock. PLEASE! I NEED IT.
Dont call it lego if its not real lego. They will take it down.
Cool texture pack, but Lego will probably sue the creator if it's fanmade. They've become a shit company. Best idea would be to make it look like lego, but don't call it that.
HOLY JESUS. YES!
#YEEEESS!!
My feet shall have ‘oof’ whenever i step on a surface

    Isn't Minecraft just virtual Lego?
I would advise you to remove the Lego logo.
They tend to get very angry at such stuff. And I really want to see this released.
r/lego_minecraft
Can I get it for bedrock edition
    >bedrock

Better be on Bedrock! Otherwise just use a converter
        Can you tell me more about this converter?
*really* tired of people using heavy shaders+raytracing to showcase their creations and texture packs.

It adds a little bit of dishonesty I feel like
    It’s a pbr resource pack, it’s literally designed to be used with shaders.
Are carpets/snow gonna be the plate tile things with no studs on top?
When you get hurt, it makes a “HEY” sound, and when you die, it’s just a bunch of legos falling noises
Send me the files when it's done
at this point, why not just play lego worlds?

man that game is so under rated!
Its not bad, its very well made BUT IT ANGERS ME
Hey, is it cool if I make a video with this pack once you release it?
Anyway to follow its progress?
You have any idea when do you release it?
I haven't played Minecraft in like a decade. Back then making textures packs was editing an image all the different blocks in a grid, with like.. MS paint.

How is it changed compared to present day?
Sick
that looks soo sick! the blocks look and feel like actual legos which is something i haven't gotten from previous lego resource packs.
How has this not been done before! Everything is awesome
Blockland
If this is on bedrock I would 100% buy it
I see alot of comments about copyright and trademark, but why not just dm them on Instagram or contact customer support? Then you'll definitely know what you can and can't do :)
    It’s only the lego brand name. The lego brick is not patented from some law suit can’t remember the name of saying that lego can’t patent the lego brick bc of it being a universal concept
Please make the dying sound like when you drop studs in the Lego games.
Be careful calling it lego, they are known for being quite strict with their name usage
AWESOME
I want this
I won't step on this
A VILLAGER HAS FALLEN INTO A RIVER IN LEGO CITY

Please use lego sound effects when you interact with blocks!
    And replace the water splash sound with "Hey!"
Epic
Ill take ur entire stock
My feet already hurt. I can just imagine those bricks trying to click into your square feet, uh, like a parasite
Looks sick! Any release date?
I need this
Omg this looks epic
I am waiting.
You were right! I love you!
Oh my god this looks awesome
Man that's gonna hurt to walk on
Will it be available for bedrock?
This looks amazing
This is delightful
This looks really cool, reminds me of Lego worlds.
Will this be on bedrock? If so I'd probably get this it looks great.
they had me at legos and minecraft
The idea is GREAT. I'd watch out for a C&D, though
This is epic

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH
100% giving this an upvote and a download.
Bedrock?
When is this coming out
this looks amazing, any chance of a bedrock RTX version?
You should make an alternate version based off of the block designs from the actual sets.

Also download when?
Thats Pretty Cool!
A man has fallen in the river, in your world!
That is awesome dude!!! I wish I could use this.
Keep us updated!!

No offense... this looks like one of those Minecraft rip-offs🤣🤣🤣
I wish I could get this on my switch
Sweet!
bro i want this
Out of all of the other Lego Texture pack that I've seen over the years this one actually looks like Lego and not some weird lego/realistic survival look like the others. Looks great so far!
what a great idea lol
honestly i'm surprised it took this long for anyone to come up with this idea
My man, this is amazing. It will be like finally playing a LEGO sandbox game.
If its not you should add this to bedrock
Will this be available for Bedrock?
I want a link for this
yup, a $3000 pc is finally worthy
Lego worlds is neat
YES, ive seen people make recource packs like this but arent true to real minecraft lego style, thank you, cant wait for this
I CANT WAIT
Finally, a man can ACTUALLY fall into the Lego City River.

&#x200B;

Also, did you get Lego's permission beforehand?
A German YouTuber who produces Videos about lego is in trouble because lego sued him for stupid reasons.
I would really watch out and not call them Legos, maybe sth like bricks.
Sounds stupid I know but just be careful.
sorry for being nitpicky, but nowadays it's called a "Resourcepack" instead of "Texturepack", as it can change a lot more than just texture.

and with "nowadays" i mean since 8 years....
I NEED this! there will be a download right?
Lego-Pack
Now, Minecraft is literally Virtual Lego!

As much as I like Lego, a Lego set including infinite pieces of so many kinds(Minecraft) is brilliant.
Just a quick info : LEGO are one of the most litigious company out there . If they so much as see that logo they'll sue
Me sitting here waiting and crying till that day comes.
i really want this!
Duuuudeeeee that's awesome
Oh no, a Lego man is drowning, quick build a rescue helicopter!
WOW THAT LOOKS AMAZING! it looks exactly like legos 👀✨
Careful, Lego are hot with cease and desist letters.
Watch out with copyright infringement. Lego sues everyone and everybody in the ground over the smallest copyright claims.
Question: It could be, somehow, available for Bedrock?
This is actually a sick idea and I have no idea how it wasn’t thought of earlier. Props man!
java or bedrock?
    Pretty sure its java, I dont think SEUS is on bedrock
        u can download shaders on mc bedrock so u know
            not good ones like SEUS
            yeah but they’re terrible lol
Pls say it’ll available for bedrock 🥺
Do you have any plans for adding surface imperfections?
    There are already subtle surface imperfections to make the blocks look more realistic
        That’s amazing
Could you make it for bedrock too
Copy strike also coming soon 1 min after its release
Do we lose hp when we step on a block? Or instantly die
    why did this get downvotes
        lol no idea, im looking forward to that texture pack actually
Oh gawd the pain...
It looks awsome ngl but where we can download it?
    “Coming soon”
    Why the fuck did this get more downvotes than "Lol it looks terrible".
Wouldn’t it hurt to walk?
Now that is amazing
Ouch
Oooh I have a really old lego texture pack but this looks way better than it so I’m excited
YES this is gonna be the shit. Can't wait to download this
Make it available for bedrock please
"We will watch your career with great intrest"
You're gonna have a hard time walking
How do I know when this is finished
1 word.

YES!!
I need this
I will watch your career with great interest
"Pain in every step"
This is genius. Why has no one thought of this earlier?
this is so good, you could put it up on the console edition marketplace and people would buy it
need this
Ngl... It looks like roblox xD
I’ll pay for this pack if you ever post this
Pleas send me a private message when it's finished. This would look so great!!
Where will this be released onto? Kinda hoping the marketplace
When are you expecting a release? Is there some "thing" I can follow to get updates.

Sorry. I'm not very deep in the scene.
Any chance of being able to use this on console? me and my brother play coop and i know we would both love this.
This reminds me of the old Roblox times lol...
This is awesome. Can someone remind me when this releases? I love SEUS PTGI
YES!!!!!
Holy shit! I need this in my life! Will it only be usable with SEUS?
This is 'awesome'
A man has fallen into the river in lego Minecraft!
You're gonna get double-sued.
Pls post this when it’s made
Ok this looks sooooo unbelievably cool
With this we finally can recreate the " a man has fallen into the river in lego city" scene in minecraft.

If it doesn't than someone should should make an add-on pack that does.
    Then

        No it’s a texture pack with shaders separately says in pictures lol
You can’t walk unless you jump
Dude, you should make that magma blocks are a bunch of mini lego pieces
That would be very easy to implement with a resource pack. It would be a shame if it doesn’t release with one
Probably a separate sound pack or a sound addon
*lego And hopefully it does my friend.
    Yeah idk why my autocorrect didn't recognise lego
        Because logo is a word.
            And Lego isn't? Autocorrect just sucks sometimes. Like, half the time I try typing "bot", it Autocorrects to "not"
                All I was saying is that it didn't need to correct anything because logo is a word.
                    > Yeah idk why my autocorrect didn't recognise Lego



This implies that they typed "Lego" and it autocorrected to "logo"
                        Oh ok, I got you. Sorry for the trouble.
Damn you got 5000 IQ!

Or maybe we'll watch Lego go after an indie dev and sue him.
    Lego hasn't sued people for selling instructions for their own MOCs, so they probably won't sue someone for a Minecraft texture pack.
        Theyre suing a lego vendor who makes lego yt videos.
        Unless ofc those MOCs contain non-Lego-bricks not marked as non-Lego-bricks.
[removed]
I will not use official lego logos in this pack but I don't know if I can make any money from it because of this:[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dk9LZt4rCBoeMUCIeYlu38gzDfekGk6B/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dk9LZt4rCBoeMUCIeYlu38gzDfekGk6B/view)
    def not, and that logo on the bricks could be copyrighted. I'm not an expert, but I'd be wary.

I def think you should keep this up tho even if you remove the branding for 2 reasons:

1) this is beautiful and you've captured the simple beauty of the lego building blocks exceptionally well here

2) This, when combined with mods to import other bricks, make designing custom lego builds more accessible and easier than ever before (yes you can use LDD but I feel this would work better, maybe it's just me)

edit: wary not weary
        It's definitely trademarked which has much stricter restrictions than copyright, including the stipulation that the owning company *is required* to fight violations or risk losing the trademark.
            And this looks like it could be an official product from Lego so shaky territory- plus they have lego games so the market confusion argument seems easy
                I thought it was an official thing at first until I saw the "u/ ”

Lego would absolutely be willing to make something like this as an official product, they absolutely would be willing to brand it and advertise it with a picture like this, and someone would absolutely throw it up on this sub.
                    Iirc lego already has put out several minecraft kits in the past. They tried making their own minecraft style game too. It's been years since I looked into it but it was kinda disappointing back then. It was supposed to be getting more content and idk if it ever did. 

Point being, this texture pack could potentially fall into the territory of affecting Lego's ability to sell their own products, which is usually one of the defining points used in trademark lawsuits.
                        Oh yeah that game was bad. I think I didn't make it an hour because the UI was so bad
                            it also got filled with wangs pretty quickly, https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-06-01-lego-mmo-development-dogged-by-dong-detection-software
                Also LEGO is well known for being happy to lawsuit their fans.
            > including the stipulation that the owning company *is required* to fight violations or risk losing the trademark

This is often repeated, and indeed mostly true to the letter of the law, but also misunderstood many times. The mark owner has *many* ways to respond besides C&D and lawsuits, there is no requirement for a company to be a dick about it, contrary to popular opinion. Secondly, it's a *lot* harder for world-famous marks to be diluted or lost than the law makes it seem; nobody's losing the trademarks Oreo, Xerox or Kleenex to competitors even though they're rife with misuse by non-competitors.

        I use Bricklink Stud.io 2. It's like LDD but with way more brick shapes and color options, as well as the ability to check pricing of pieces in the program, and export part lists for your designs to Brickljnk for easy buying.
        There’s also another program that is leagues better than LDD which is called BrickLink Studio.
        It’s just the logo though. The reason why there are so many rip off legos on the market is bc Lego can’t legally patent the lego parts or shapes bc it’s such simple desine. So you can make anything just like a lego just don’t use the brand name lego
            [The brick were patented but the patent have expired.](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-11302614)
    Everybody in this thread seems to be an ignorant doomsayer. Here's lego's own rules about using their name in fan created entities: http://aboutus.lego.com/en-us/corporate/fairplay.aspx

TL;DR: you're free to use the Lego logo on the studs and can call it a lego resource pack, but you can't make money, you can't use the red square logo. Always capitalize LEGO, make sure the first time the word Lego is presented it has a (R) symbol so people know it's registered.

        As someone who has had a lot of LEGO sets and also some “construction brick” sets as well, they are not identical. 

I have never had LEGO bricks that do not fit together properly or have extraneous pieces of plastic from the molding process. Only once (out of probably 250+ sets) has a piece been missing (they actually had the wrong piece). 

All of those are common issues with “construction bricks.”  LEGO’s quality control is second to none.
            [deleted]
            I second this comment - all other construction bricks are inferior. I have a little microbrick kit on my shelf and its so cheap in comparison to the Lego around it.
    Change the order of the letters but keep the same typeface?
        L O G E, I love it!
            LOGE, SUCH BRICK!  WOW!  *CLICK*
                Such wow
            Or make it something like:
MINE or CRAFT
                Alternate since the blocms look like they have 2 studs each.
                BLOC
    Idea: change the logo on the bricks to "Logo".
        Definitely not a solution. Its too close to the original and 'there is a risk of confusion'. There could also be a copyright problem, because using the logo on the 'pimple' could be protected by a patent.
    lego generally does not care as long as you don't make money off it, thats why bionicle quest for mata nui was not canceled
    if you take a look at what happened to the german lego youtuber "held der Steine", I'd remove any reference to the word lego, and also remove the brick as an image from the logo. he got sued for having a lego type brick in his logo, and now again for referencing a different manufacturers brick as lego. they have nothing left as a company and have now resolved to sueing everyone into the ground, at least in germany.
    You will receive a cease and desist letter based on the picture you uploaded here alone. 

Lego doesn't fuck around, and now that you mentioned you even considered making money from their IP you're fucked.
        >Lego doesn't fuck around, and now that you mentioned you even considered making money from their IP you're fucked.

People sell their own Lego instructions, and Lego hasn't gone after any of those people.
            MOC's don't usually use LEGO branding tho, do they?

And that's technically still profitable for LEGO themselves, given that the parts, in the end, have to come from them, and it still promotes their core product in a way.

&#x200B;

I would have just assumed they strike anything down that might have any connection with their brand while being deemed "not worth it".

I might be a bit biased here though. Slight (or, realistically, longer) tangent: There is an actually quite big German YouTuber who has a small brick shop and makes videos about LEGO and, for a while now, alternatives. He is fairly critical of LEGO as of late, on a very factual basis though. He compares new LEGO models to older models and especially products of their direct competitors. It is pretty clear that, objectively, the quality and simply the size of LEGO models has gone down, while the prices exploded. The competition, on the other hand, offers a way better deal almost across the board (the best comparison to me, so far, was between a 180€ LEGO technic car model that looked like shit and had absolutely no technic features while you could get a good-looking remote controlled (including a remote controlled transmission) competitor model with double the pieces for the same price).

To get to the point: That guy has a decent influence on the market. (That competitor model mentioned above actually sold out for a while after he presented it) So LEGO got winds of his videos. They skimmed through and found a moment in the video where he referred to the competitors model or some of its parts as "LEGO" and used that as grounds to demand the takedown of said video for "violating their IP". Not only is that bullshit on its own, but they fucked themselves in more than one way, because he rerecorded that video fixing that "flaw", pointing out even more problems with the model and making a bit of a mockery out of their bullshit. Reaching even more people than before, mind you.

So, basically, I trust LEGO to be overly protective of anything they consider their IP AND to make the worst possible decisions in terms of what to do legally, so I'd be careful.
            Probably because instructions don’t come with legos themselves, right? So you gotta go purchase your own anyway.
                There are fan games that Lego hasn't taken down.
                    I’m not saying it’s like a 100% sure thing Lego goes after every single infringement, but just offered an explanation to why they may ignore certain ones.

Also, instructions may be something they’ve decided isn’t actually up to their infringement standard since you can’t copyright instruction manuals (very over generalizing here). The trademarks though, could be different.
                        You actually can copyright manuals. You can't copyright the instructions themselves, or recipes or anything, but you can copyright an instruction book.

            >I can confirm people use brand names in their maps a lot and companies don’t bother cracking down if you’re not making a profit from it.

Only because a brand have the right to take you down, doesn't mean that they do it. In most cases this isn't worth the effort and also brings bad publicity.

But this doesn't count for Lego. They even sue people that make free advertising for them... they totally lost every connection to reality.
    Just use something stupidly similar but still different. IEGO, LEQO, IEQO, etc.
    As others are saying, fantastic job, but please remove the logo, it's not worth getting into legal trouble over a free community project.
    Lego on the studs is probably a bad idea. Even in Lego clubs that receive direct acknowledgement and support from Lego, who are not selling or doing anything other than Lego, still are extremely wary of using the name "Lego" in the name of anything.

Take the name off the studs, don't use the name Lego in anything, just call it "bricks" etc etc etc. You don't want any Lego reference anywhere.

The actual brick design is no longer copyright so anyone can use it (hence mega Bloks etc) but the branding is a whole different game and they will come at you.
    MINE
    Should have just dropped it when it was ready. Teasing it will give them time for a cease and desist. Releasing it suddenly makes it impossible to remove it from the internet.  
Or, as suggested, call it 'construction blocks pack' or something similar.
This is actually a good point so OP doesnt get copyrighted.. either way sick as hell B)

It's ok, Steve is Lego in this too. Lego people can walk on Lego without harm.

this is going to be lego worlds, but it doesn’t get boring after 12 minutes
    Eh i enjoyed lego worlds
        I really want to enjoy LEGO Worlds but Adventure Mode is kinda 50/50 for me and Sandbox feels limited since it’s missing certain pieces.

Unfortunately it didn’t live up to the hype, kinda bummed out about it. I do quite enjoy it a lot though whenever I can think of something up to build, it’s just difficult when it’s a bit limited.
            despite my big gamer time gamer brain I cannot for the life of me answer why we don't have a satisfying lego building video game to date, or rather why Lego World just isn't that satisfying to play
                To be fair if they made a whole ass lego game where you could build what ever you want- you wouldn't wanna buy lego lol, why buy lego when you have an infinite amount in a videogame? My conspiracy theory is that lego purposely didn't make a full game so they are still able to sell physical lego
                    This used to be my theory until I learned about [Lego Digital Designer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH9xoFC8CCM&ab_channel=JosephDepalma) aka LDD. I mean it's...legit official lego with infinite pieces. But...will it scratch that itch?

Edit: you can import [official sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6HpfRAdUKQ&t=745s&ab_channel=BrickSystemBrothers) too
                        Hmm- tbh I still think that technically does it? Like that's designed so that people can design their own lego sets. However it only goes far enough so that your more likely to buy lego- because with that not only does it look sorta stale in terms of rendering, but obviously ya can't do much with it except look at it. A far more fledged designer would have a better looking render engine- and you could play with it virtually if you wanted. However lego wont do that, cuz that'd take away sales from physical lego
                        The thing is, when I played with lego, I didnt because I enjoyed building, because I loved to play out numerous weird scenarios, from space battles to robot uprising etc etc.  


No digital lego game to date can scratch the itch that is flying a lego plane with your hand into the wall, only to have lego robots kill all your little lego people to have one lego man survive and kill all the lego robots to become lego king
                    That's actually... a pretty decent theory. Have you seen Lego prices? That shit's worth more than gold
                        Exactly- lego used to cost me an arm and a leg when I was super into it lol
                I would say Blockland, as I played that game RELIGIOUSLY when I was younger, but the community is pretty dead. Nonetheless, it’s building mechanics is amazing, and there’s a spiritual successor being developed right now called Brickadia.

The old one didn't get the ratios right. A 2x2 Lego brick isn't a cube; the height/width ratio is 3/5, which means you need to add 2 plates to get a cube. That pack didn't do that, but OPs does.
I have it too
Me too, wish i could find it again. Made my minecraft 1.4 worlds amazing.
    i think i have it on my old hardrive, i'll update in hour
        Any update?
            no, i'm still looking...
                Rip
                    ok, so pack in question wasn't on the hard drive, but i did some digging, the pack in question was called legopak

                    Hey, it's only been 7 years since my last update :).
    Since they didn’t respond directly to you, they pack is called legopak

Honestly, I'm kinda surprised by it too. Like, there's Minecraft Lego sets even.

I did start to think "oh wait, 3d textures are new".. and then realized I'm thinking of back in, like, 2013. Which makes me feel old.
The reason is performance. Making a resource pack that makes every single block a 3D model (so that you can have Lego tops) would barely run on any kind of computer. You can already notice a high performance impact when using any 3D resource pack that only has 3D models for certain blocks. Using PBR textures to give every block a Lego top (which I assume is what's being done here) is much more efficient, but requires Optifine shaders obviously, which isn't an official mod.
Nach so einem Kommentar hab ich gesucht
Klemmbaustein Texturenpacket
¿Qué?
    It's a phrase a famous german youtuber, who focuses on Lego and Lego-like products, always uses as an intro. 


He had some legal run-ins with Lego over things most people would probably call benign. One example is calling a brick of a competitior "Lego brick" instead of "interlocking bricks".


OC ended the comment with a small alteration to the intro insinuating that OP might get a nice letter from Legos lawyers on his own, since he is quite obviously using a protected trademark.


Hope you like your dissected frog.
        I was on mobile, and didn't have the opportunity to go to Google Translate to figure it out, and was just being silly.

But genuinely homie: thanks for the explanation.  That was way more informative than Google Translate would have been.  You actually provided context.

I will eat frog legs with you any day bro.
Dude, the texture pack is not being monetized, also, why would they sue this one guy for slapping lego textures on a game that they don’t even care about. There are plenty of mods that use copyrighted stuff like the marvel mod and stuff...
    It doesn't matter if it's monetized or not (and OP didn't say it was going to be free), and I didn't say they'd sue him. Sending a cease and desist is different than suing someone. Perhaps I should have said, "be prepared to potentially receive a C&D", instead of saying "probably". But a C&D means OP gets a letter saying, "You're infringing on our trademarked logo. Take it down, or we'll sue you." It could even say, "Remove all download links, and delete the texture pack from your computer, and if we somehow find out you haven't done that, we'll sue you."

At that point, it wouldn't matter if OP just changed the name, he'd have to stop the project entirely or risk being sued. I'm suggesting to OP that it's probably not worth the risk. OP should probably delete this post, and call the texture pack something else, and in the post title say, "I made this texture pack inspired by Lego". That's probably a lot less risky.
        Lego seems pretty chill with their copyright to the point of letting a whole team work on a Bionicle game with the condition that they don't make any money off of it. They even have a guy from the original commercials doing some video promos for them as well.
            >Lego seems pretty chill with their copyright

Haha, no. There are e.g. some smaller companies in Germany that have to fight some ridiculous lawsuits
            Part of having a trademark requires companies to actively defend it. Unless they sign an agreement with him to use their trademark, they risk losing it, because it sets precedent for other possible future infringements.
                > Part of having a trademark requires companies to actively defend it.

Isn't this a Reddit law that isn't actually true?
                    I was originally amazed that the next comment in the chain wasn't "lol thats not true".

Trademarks and copyrights are just property of intelligence. If Lego^TM decided to be chill for someone being inspired by the brand, no government agency could force them to be upset. If Lego sued someone for making counterfeit sets, and branding them as Lego, it would not be diminished because someone made a texture pack.
                    Yes, it's a reddit law. Have renewed TMs myself and gone over the documentation. To say that a company needs to be policing every potential infringement possible is nonsense. It would never hold up in or out of court to say that because you weren't dealt with for infringement, you're free to do it or that the trademark holder can no longer claim ownership. What has to be proven is that the infringing party knowingly used the property in ways that violate its accepted use. What's worse, the sort of regulation that requires constant policing would drastically undermine small businesses and give all of the power to large companies that can afford teams of lawyers working on this full time.  

Check out [this article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/trademark-law-does-not-require-companies-tirelessly-censor-internet) on the subject.
                    I don’t what what Reddit Law is, but it is true. Done a bit of work with game development and seen both sides, companies defending and companies receiving cease and desist.

Also, trademark laws aren’t universal, different countries operate differently. One of the biggest complaints about the TPP was how much more power it gave those companies in enforcing their IP.
                        > I don’t what what Reddit Law is

Something that is parroted on Reddit that isn't actually true.

Seems this is the case and companies don't need to "defend" their trademarks.
                            Except that precedent and corporate lawyers have them doing it. So sure, and idealistic interpretation of the law would be they don’t have to, but they all operate as if they do have to. By their very own page on the topic Lego believes in defending their trademark around the world.
                I mean I will be real, it's a minecraft texture pack on the internet. It is plenty valid for companies to have a blind eye to trademark offenders because it really isn't worth their time to pursue it, and it generally doesn't mean much in the long run.

If this developed into one of the most popular minecraft texture packs and pretty much everyone and their mother used it? I'm pretty sure Lego would step in due to obligations to defend their trademark.
                    That’s not how obligations work unfortunately. They weaken their trademark for all future infringements so it does mean a lot in the long run. 

This is a corporation, they can’t afford to be soft or turn a blind eye and they don’t care about making people feel good when it comes to infringing on their IP. 

There’s a reason why these companies have giant law firms on retainer, or even large internal legal teams.

But hey, time will tell if this kid gets a cease and desist letter.
                >Part of having a trademark requires companies to actively defend it.

[This is a myth.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/trademark-law-does-not-require-companies-tirelessly-censor-internet) You do not lose a trademark if you choose not to sue someone. In fact it's the opposite. You have to regularly renew your trademark and note how it's being used - so you using it is what's important, not someone else. Companies sue/C&D people for infringing on IPs because it prevents their brand from becoming diluted and prevents other people from profiting off of their properties. Which, like, fair enough, but still. I think it's harmful to keep perpetuating this idea that companies are somehow mitigating regulatory risk. It paints them as "hey, lady, I'm just followin' da rules" when really they're just protecting a bottom line that honestly isn't really threatened.
                    https://www.justia.com/intellectual-property/trademarks/enforcement/

“However, a failure to enforce a trademark by monitoring the mark for misuses will result in a weakening of the mark and loss of distinctiveness, which can lead to a loss of the trademark.”

Edit; Also claiming it’s a myth because of a 2013 opinion article about how current enforcement is overzealous doesn’t make it a myth. Sure, in a perfect world if they didn’t already operate like this that would be how it could work, but as that article even says, lawyers wanna get paid.
    They do care, there are even Minecraft sets sold by Lego. A German Youtuber recently got into mild trouble for using the word “Lego” for the bricks of other companies. Everyone does so, but I guess they kind of have to sue to keep their brand name and competitors from being allowed to say that they produce “Lego bricks”.
technically yes
Hey, why are people downvoting your comment
I have no idea why you are getting downvoted, but also, is Keralis a lego type person? I didnt really know
Good idea

    1. It will ba available for java.
2. Upcoming weeks
Isn't Minecraft just virtual Lego?
>bedrock

Better be on Bedrock! Otherwise just use a converter
    Can you tell me more about this converter?
It’s a pbr resource pack, it’s literally designed to be used with shaders.
It’s only the lego brand name. The lego brick is not patented from some law suit can’t remember the name of saying that lego can’t patent the lego brick bc of it being a universal concept
So excited can’t wait to use this!
And replace the water splash sound with "Hey!"
Pretty sure its java, I dont think SEUS is on bedrock
    u can download shaders on mc bedrock so u know
        not good ones like SEUS
        yeah but they’re terrible lol
There are already subtle surface imperfections to make the blocks look more realistic
    That’s amazing
why did this get downvotes
    lol no idea, im looking forward to that texture pack actually
“Coming soon”
Why the fuck did this get more downvotes than "Lol it looks terrible".

The one who has fallen into a river in lego city?
Great to see he is doing good after that tragic river accident
No. He already passed away in the river during the failed mission

    No it’s a texture pack with shaders separately says in pictures lol
Yeah idk why my autocorrect didn't recognise lego
    Because logo is a word.
        And Lego isn't? Autocorrect just sucks sometimes. Like, half the time I try typing "bot", it Autocorrects to "not"
            All I was saying is that it didn't need to correct anything because logo is a word.
                > Yeah idk why my autocorrect didn't recognise Lego



This implies that they typed "Lego" and it autocorrected to "logo"
                    Oh ok, I got you. Sorry for the trouble.

Lego hasn't sued people for selling instructions for their own MOCs, so they probably won't sue someone for a Minecraft texture pack.
    Theyre suing a lego vendor who makes lego yt videos.
    Unless ofc those MOCs contain non-Lego-bricks not marked as non-Lego-bricks.
def not, and that logo on the bricks could be copyrighted. I'm not an expert, but I'd be wary.

I def think you should keep this up tho even if you remove the branding for 2 reasons:

1) this is beautiful and you've captured the simple beauty of the lego building blocks exceptionally well here

2) This, when combined with mods to import other bricks, make designing custom lego builds more accessible and easier than ever before (yes you can use LDD but I feel this would work better, maybe it's just me)

edit: wary not weary
    It's definitely trademarked which has much stricter restrictions than copyright, including the stipulation that the owning company *is required* to fight violations or risk losing the trademark.
        And this looks like it could be an official product from Lego so shaky territory- plus they have lego games so the market confusion argument seems easy
            I thought it was an official thing at first until I saw the "u/ ”

Lego would absolutely be willing to make something like this as an official product, they absolutely would be willing to brand it and advertise it with a picture like this, and someone would absolutely throw it up on this sub.
                Iirc lego already has put out several minecraft kits in the past. They tried making their own minecraft style game too. It's been years since I looked into it but it was kinda disappointing back then. It was supposed to be getting more content and idk if it ever did. 

Point being, this texture pack could potentially fall into the territory of affecting Lego's ability to sell their own products, which is usually one of the defining points used in trademark lawsuits.
                    Oh yeah that game was bad. I think I didn't make it an hour because the UI was so bad
                        it also got filled with wangs pretty quickly, https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-06-01-lego-mmo-development-dogged-by-dong-detection-software
            Also LEGO is well known for being happy to lawsuit their fans.
        > including the stipulation that the owning company *is required* to fight violations or risk losing the trademark

This is often repeated, and indeed mostly true to the letter of the law, but also misunderstood many times. The mark owner has *many* ways to respond besides C&D and lawsuits, there is no requirement for a company to be a dick about it, contrary to popular opinion. Secondly, it's a *lot* harder for world-famous marks to be diluted or lost than the law makes it seem; nobody's losing the trademarks Oreo, Xerox or Kleenex to competitors even though they're rife with misuse by non-competitors.

            This is the first time I've actually understood why people misspell wary as weary so often. Goddammit, English.
    I use Bricklink Stud.io 2. It's like LDD but with way more brick shapes and color options, as well as the ability to check pricing of pieces in the program, and export part lists for your designs to Brickljnk for easy buying.
    There’s also another program that is leagues better than LDD which is called BrickLink Studio.
    It’s just the logo though. The reason why there are so many rip off legos on the market is bc Lego can’t legally patent the lego parts or shapes bc it’s such simple desine. So you can make anything just like a lego just don’t use the brand name lego
        [The brick were patented but the patent have expired.](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-11302614)
Everybody in this thread seems to be an ignorant doomsayer. Here's lego's own rules about using their name in fan created entities: http://aboutus.lego.com/en-us/corporate/fairplay.aspx

TL;DR: you're free to use the Lego logo on the studs and can call it a lego resource pack, but you can't make money, you can't use the red square logo. Always capitalize LEGO, make sure the first time the word Lego is presented it has a (R) symbol so people know it's registered. Source: worked on a lego fan project that communicated with lego legla to make sure we stayed above legal water.

    As someone who has had a lot of LEGO sets and also some “construction brick” sets as well, they are not identical. 

I have never had LEGO bricks that do not fit together properly or have extraneous pieces of plastic from the molding process. Only once (out of probably 250+ sets) has a piece been missing (they actually had the wrong piece). 

All of those are common issues with “construction bricks.”  LEGO’s quality control is second to none.
        [deleted]
        I second this comment - all other construction bricks are inferior. I have a little microbrick kit on my shelf and its so cheap in comparison to the Lego around it.
Change the order of the letters but keep the same typeface?
    L O G E, I love it!
        LOGE, SUCH BRICK!  WOW!  *CLICK*
            Such wow
        Or make it something like:
MINE or CRAFT
            Alternate since the blocms look like they have 2 studs each.
            BLOC
Idea: change the logo on the bricks to "Logo".
    Definitely not a solution. Its too close to the original and 'there is a risk of confusion'. There could also be a copyright problem, because using the logo on the 'pimple' could be protected by a patent.
lego generally does not care as long as you don't make money off it, thats why bionicle quest for mata nui was not canceled
if you take a look at what happened to the german lego youtuber "held der Steine", I'd remove any reference to the word lego, and also remove the brick as an image from the logo. he got sued for having a lego type brick in his logo, and now again for referencing a different manufacturers brick as lego. they have nothing left as a company and have now resolved to sueing everyone into the ground, at least in germany.
You will receive a cease and desist letter based on the picture you uploaded here alone. 

Lego doesn't fuck around, and now that you mentioned you even considered making money from their IP you're fucked.
    >Lego doesn't fuck around, and now that you mentioned you even considered making money from their IP you're fucked.

People sell their own Lego instructions, and Lego hasn't gone after any of those people.
        MOC's don't usually use LEGO branding tho, do they?

And that's technically still profitable for LEGO themselves, given that the parts, in the end, have to come from them, and it still promotes their core product in a way.

&#x200B;

I would have just assumed they strike anything down that might have any connection with their brand while being deemed "not worth it".

I might be a bit biased here though. Slight (or, realistically, longer) tangent: There is an actually quite big German YouTuber who has a small brick shop and makes videos about LEGO and, for a while now, alternatives. He is fairly critical of LEGO as of late, on a very factual basis though. He compares new LEGO models to older models and especially products of their direct competitors. It is pretty clear that, objectively, the quality and simply the size of LEGO models has gone down, while the prices exploded. The competition, on the other hand, offers a way better deal almost across the board (the best comparison to me, so far, was between a 180€ LEGO technic car model that looked like shit and had absolutely no technic features while you could get a good-looking remote controlled (including a remote controlled transmission) competitor model with double the pieces for the same price).

To get to the point: That guy has a decent influence on the market. (That competitor model mentioned above actually sold out for a while after he presented it) So LEGO got winds of his videos. They skimmed through and found a moment in the video where he referred to the competitors model or some of its parts as "LEGO" and used that as grounds to demand the takedown of said video for "violating their IP". Not only is that bullshit on its own, but they fucked themselves in more than one way, because he rerecorded that video fixing that "flaw", pointing out even more problems with the model and making a bit of a mockery out of their bullshit. Reaching even more people than before, mind you.

So, basically, I trust LEGO to be overly protective of anything they consider their IP AND to make the worst possible decisions in terms of what to do legally, so I'd be careful.
        Probably because instructions don’t come with legos themselves, right? So you gotta go purchase your own anyway.
            There are fan games that Lego hasn't taken down.
                I’m not saying it’s like a 100% sure thing Lego goes after every single infringement, but just offered an explanation to why they may ignore certain ones.

Also, instructions may be something they’ve decided isn’t actually up to their infringement standard since you can’t copyright instruction manuals (very over generalizing here). The trademarks though, could be different.
                    You actually can copyright manuals. You can't copyright the instructions themselves, or recipes or anything, but you can copyright an instruction book.
    [deleted]
        >I can confirm people use brand names in their maps a lot and companies don’t bother cracking down if you’re not making a profit from it.

Only because a brand have the right to take you down, doesn't mean that they do it. In most cases this isn't worth the effort and also brings bad publicity.

But this doesn't count for Lego. They even sue people that make free advertising for them... they totally lost every connection to reality.
Just use something stupidly similar but still different. IEGO, LEQO, IEQO, etc.
As others are saying, fantastic job, but please remove the logo, it's not worth getting into legal trouble over a free community project.
Lego on the studs is probably a bad idea. Even in Lego clubs that receive direct acknowledgement and support from Lego, who are not selling or doing anything other than Lego, still are extremely wary of using the name "Lego" in the name of anything.

Take the name off the studs, don't use the name Lego in anything, just call it "bricks" etc etc etc. You don't want any Lego reference anywhere.

The actual brick design is no longer copyright so anyone can use it (hence mega Bloks etc) but the branding is a whole different game and they will come at you.
MINE
Should have just dropped it when it was ready. Teasing it will give them time for a cease and desist. Releasing it suddenly makes it impossible to remove it from the internet.  
Or, as suggested, call it 'construction blocks pack' or something similar.

Eh i enjoyed lego worlds
    I really want to enjoy LEGO Worlds but Adventure Mode is kinda 50/50 for me and Sandbox feels limited since it’s missing certain pieces.

Unfortunately it didn’t live up to the hype, kinda bummed out about it. I do quite enjoy it a lot though whenever I can think of something up to build, it’s just difficult when it’s a bit limited.
        despite my big gamer time gamer brain I cannot for the life of me answer why we don't have a satisfying lego building video game to date, or rather why Lego World just isn't that satisfying to play
            To be fair if they made a whole ass lego game where you could build what ever you want- you wouldn't wanna buy lego lol, why buy lego when you have an infinite amount in a videogame? My conspiracy theory is that lego purposely didn't make a full game so they are still able to sell physical lego
                This used to be my theory until I learned about [Lego Digital Designer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH9xoFC8CCM&ab_channel=JosephDepalma) aka LDD. I mean it's...legit official lego with infinite pieces. But...will it scratch that itch?

Edit: you can import [official sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6HpfRAdUKQ&t=745s&ab_channel=BrickSystemBrothers) too
                    Hmm- tbh I still think that technically does it? Like that's designed so that people can design their own lego sets. However it only goes far enough so that your more likely to buy lego- because with that not only does it look sorta stale in terms of rendering, but obviously ya can't do much with it except look at it. A far more fledged designer would have a better looking render engine- and you could play with it virtually if you wanted. However lego wont do that, cuz that'd take away sales from physical lego
                    The thing is, when I played with lego, I didnt because I enjoyed building, because I loved to play out numerous weird scenarios, from space battles to robot uprising etc etc.  


No digital lego game to date can scratch the itch that is flying a lego plane with your hand into the wall, only to have lego robots kill all your little lego people to have one lego man survive and kill all the lego robots to become lego king
                That's actually... a pretty decent theory. Have you seen Lego prices? That shit's worth more than gold
                    Exactly- lego used to cost me an arm and a leg when I was super into it lol
            I would say Blockland, as I played that game RELIGIOUSLY when I was younger, but the community is pretty dead. Nonetheless, it’s building mechanics is amazing, and there’s a spiritual successor being developed right now called Brickadia.

It's a phrase a famous german youtuber, who focuses on Lego and Lego-like products, always uses as an intro. 


He had some legal run-ins with Lego over things most people would probably call benign. One example is calling a brick of a competitior "Lego brick" instead of "interlocking bricks".


OC ended the comment with a small alteration to the intro insinuating that OP might get a nice letter from Legos lawyers on his own, since he is quite obviously using a protected trademark.


Hope you like your dissected frog.
    I was on mobile, and didn't have the opportunity to go to Google Translate to figure it out, and was just being silly.

But genuinely homie: thanks for the explanation.  That was way more informative than Google Translate would have been.  You actually provided context.

I will eat frog legs with you any day bro.
It doesn't matter if it's monetized or not (and OP didn't say it was going to be free), and I didn't say they'd sue him. Sending a cease and desist is different than suing someone. Perhaps I should have said, "be prepared to potentially receive a C&D", instead of saying "probably". But a C&D means OP gets a letter saying, "You're infringing on our trademarked logo. Take it down, or we'll sue you." It could even say, "Remove all download links, and delete the texture pack from your computer, and if we somehow find out you haven't done that, we'll sue you."

At that point, it wouldn't matter if OP just changed the name, he'd have to stop the project entirely or risk being sued. I'm suggesting to OP that it's probably not worth the risk. OP should probably delete this post, and call the texture pack something else, and in the post title say, "I made this texture pack inspired by Lego". That's probably a lot less risky.
    Lego seems pretty chill with their copyright to the point of letting a whole team work on a Bionicle game with the condition that they don't make any money off of it. They even have a guy from the original commercials doing some video promos for them as well.
        >Lego seems pretty chill with their copyright

Haha, no. There are e.g. some smaller companies in Germany that have to fight some ridiculous lawsuits
        Part of having a trademark requires companies to actively defend it. Unless they sign an agreement with him to use their trademark, they risk losing it, because it sets precedent for other possible future infringements.
            > Part of having a trademark requires companies to actively defend it.

Isn't this a Reddit law that isn't actually true?
                I was originally amazed that the next comment in the chain wasn't "lol thats not true".

Trademarks and copyrights are just property of intelligence. If Lego^TM decided to be chill for someone being inspired by the brand, no government agency could force them to be upset. If Lego sued someone for making counterfeit sets, and branding them as Lego, it would not be diminished because someone made a texture pack.
                Yes, it's a reddit law. Have renewed TMs myself and gone over the documentation. To say that a company needs to be policing every potential infringement possible is nonsense. It would never hold up in or out of court to say that because you weren't dealt with for infringement, you're free to do it or that the trademark holder can no longer claim ownership. What has to be proven is that the infringing party knowingly used the property in ways that violate its accepted use. What's worse, the sort of regulation that requires constant policing would drastically undermine small businesses and give all of the power to large companies that can afford teams of lawyers working on this full time.  

Check out [this article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/trademark-law-does-not-require-companies-tirelessly-censor-internet) on the subject.
                I don’t what what Reddit Law is, but it is true. Done a bit of work with game development and seen both sides, companies defending and companies receiving cease and desist.

Also, trademark laws aren’t universal, different countries operate differently. One of the biggest complaints about the TPP was how much more power it gave those companies in enforcing their IP.
                    > I don’t what what Reddit Law is

Something that is parroted on Reddit that isn't actually true.

Seems this is the case and companies don't need to "defend" their trademarks.
                        Except that precedent and corporate lawyers have them doing it. So sure, and idealistic interpretation of the law would be they don’t have to, but they all operate as if they do have to. By their very own page on the topic Lego believes in defending their trademark around the world.
            I mean I will be real, it's a minecraft texture pack on the internet. It is plenty valid for companies to have a blind eye to trademark offenders because it really isn't worth their time to pursue it, and it generally doesn't mean much in the long run.

If this developed into one of the most popular minecraft texture packs and pretty much everyone and their mother used it? I'm pretty sure Lego would step in due to obligations to defend their trademark.
                That’s not how obligations work unfortunately. They weaken their trademark for all future infringements so it does mean a lot in the long run. 

This is a corporation, they can’t afford to be soft or turn a blind eye and they don’t care about making people feel good when it comes to infringing on their IP. 

There’s a reason why these companies have giant law firms on retainer, or even large internal legal teams.

But hey, time will tell if this kid gets a cease and desist letter.
            >Part of having a trademark requires companies to actively defend it.

[This is a myth.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/trademark-law-does-not-require-companies-tirelessly-censor-internet) You do not lose a trademark if you choose not to sue someone. In fact it's the opposite. You have to regularly renew your trademark and note how it's being used - so you using it is what's important, not someone else. Companies sue/C&D people for infringing on IPs because it prevents their brand from becoming diluted and prevents other people from profiting off of their properties. Which, like, fair enough, but still. I think it's harmful to keep perpetuating this idea that companies are somehow mitigating regulatory risk. It paints them as "hey, lady, I'm just followin' da rules" when really they're just protecting a bottom line that honestly isn't really threatened.
                https://www.justia.com/intellectual-property/trademarks/enforcement/

“However, a failure to enforce a trademark by monitoring the mark for misuses will result in a weakening of the mark and loss of distinctiveness, which can lead to a loss of the trademark.”

Edit; Also claiming it’s a myth because of a 2013 opinion article about how current enforcement is overzealous doesn’t make it a myth. Sure, in a perfect world if they didn’t already operate like this that would be how it could work, but as that article even says, lawyers wanna get paid.
They do care, there are even Minecraft sets sold by Lego. A German Youtuber recently got into mild trouble for using the word “Lego” for the bricks of other companies. Everyone does so, but I guess they kind of have to sue to keep their brand name and competitors from being allowed to say that they produce “Lego bricks”.
Thank you!

                    it also got filled with wangs pretty quickly, https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-06-01-lego-mmo-development-dogged-by-dong-detection-software
        Also LEGO is well known for being happy to lawsuit their fans.
    > including the stipulation that the owning company *is required* to fight violations or risk losing the trademark

This is often repeated, and indeed mostly true to the letter of the law, but also misunderstood many times. The mark owner has *many* ways to respond besides C&D and lawsuits, there is no requirement for a company to be a dick about it, contrary to popular opinion. Secondly, it's a *lot* harder for world-famous marks to be diluted or lost than the law makes it seem; nobody's losing the trademarks Oreo, Xerox or Kleenex to competitors even though they're rife with misuse by non-competitors.

I use Bricklink Stud.io 2. It's like LDD but with way more brick shapes and color options, as well as the ability to check pricing of pieces in the program, and export part lists for your designs to Brickljnk for easy buying.
There’s also another program that is leagues better than LDD which is called BrickLink Studio.
It’s just the logo though. The reason why there are so many rip off legos on the market is bc Lego can’t legally patent the lego parts or shapes bc it’s such simple desine. So you can make anything just like a lego just don’t use the brand name lego

As someone who has had a lot of LEGO sets and also some “construction brick” sets as well, they are not identical. 

I have never had LEGO bricks that do not fit together properly or have extraneous pieces of plastic from the molding process. Only once (out of probably 250+ sets) has a piece been missing (they actually had the wrong piece). 

All of those are common issues with “construction bricks.”  LEGO’s quality control is second to none.
    [deleted]
    I second this comment - all other construction bricks are inferior. I have a little microbrick kit on my shelf and its so cheap in comparison to the Lego around it.
L O G E, I love it!
    LOGE, SUCH BRICK!  WOW!  *CLICK*
        Such wow
    Or make it something like:
MINE or CRAFT
        Alternate since the blocms look like they have 2 studs each.
        BLOC
Definitely not a solution. Its too close to the original and 'there is a risk of confusion'. There could also be a copyright problem, because using the logo on the 'pimple' could be protected by a patent.
>Lego doesn't fuck around, and now that you mentioned you even considered making money from their IP you're fucked.

People sell their own Lego instructions, and Lego hasn't gone after any of those people.
    MOC's don't usually use LEGO branding tho, do they?

And that's technically still profitable for LEGO themselves, given that the parts, in the end, have to come from them, and it still promotes their core product in a way.

&#x200B;

I would have just assumed they strike anything down that might have any connection with their brand while being deemed "not worth it".

I might be a bit biased here though. Slight (or, realistically, longer) tangent: There is an actually quite big German YouTuber who has a small brick shop and makes videos about LEGO and, for a while now, alternatives. He is fairly critical of LEGO as of late, on a very factual basis though. He compares new LEGO models to older models and especially products of their direct competitors. It is pretty clear that, objectively, the quality and simply the size of LEGO models has gone down, while the prices exploded. The competition, on the other hand, offers a way better deal almost across the board (the best comparison to me, so far, was between a 180€ LEGO technic car model that looked like shit and had absolutely no technic features while you could get a good-looking remote controlled (including a remote controlled transmission) competitor model with double the pieces for the same price).

To get to the point: That guy has a decent influence on the market. (That competitor model mentioned above actually sold out for a while after he presented it) So LEGO got winds of his videos. They skimmed through and found a moment in the video where he referred to the competitors model or some of its parts as "LEGO" and used that as grounds to demand the takedown of said video for "violating their IP". Not only is that bullshit on its own, but they fucked themselves in more than one way, because he rerecorded that video fixing that "flaw", pointing out even more problems with the model and making a bit of a mockery out of their bullshit. Reaching even more people than before, mind you.

So, basically, I trust LEGO to be overly protective of anything they consider their IP AND to make the worst possible decisions in terms of what to do legally, so I'd be careful.
    Probably because instructions don’t come with legos themselves, right? So you gotta go purchase your own anyway.
        There are fan games that Lego hasn't taken down.
            I’m not saying it’s like a 100% sure thing Lego goes after every single infringement, but just offered an explanation to why they may ignore certain ones.

Also, instructions may be something they’ve decided isn’t actually up to their infringement standard since you can’t copyright instruction manuals (very over generalizing here). The trademarks though, could be different.
                You actually can copyright manuals. You can't copyright the instructions themselves, or recipes or anything, but you can copyright an instruction book.

    >I can confirm people use brand names in their maps a lot and companies don’t bother cracking down if you’re not making a profit from it.

Only because a brand have the right to take you down, doesn't mean that they do it. In most cases this isn't worth the effort and also brings bad publicity.

But this doesn't count for Lego. They even sue people that make free advertising for them... they totally lost every connection to reality.
Block is probably ™d. Better go with Generic Brand Erection Rectangular Prism Texture Pack just to be safe!

I really want to enjoy LEGO Worlds but Adventure Mode is kinda 50/50 for me and Sandbox feels limited since it’s missing certain pieces.

Unfortunately it didn’t live up to the hype, kinda bummed out about it. I do quite enjoy it a lot though whenever I can think of something up to build, it’s just difficult when it’s a bit limited.
    despite my big gamer time gamer brain I cannot for the life of me answer why we don't have a satisfying lego building video game to date, or rather why Lego World just isn't that satisfying to play
        To be fair if they made a whole ass lego game where you could build what ever you want- you wouldn't wanna buy lego lol, why buy lego when you have an infinite amount in a videogame? My conspiracy theory is that lego purposely didn't make a full game so they are still able to sell physical lego
            This used to be my theory until I learned about [Lego Digital Designer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH9xoFC8CCM&ab_channel=JosephDepalma) aka LDD. I mean it's...legit official lego with infinite pieces. But...will it scratch that itch?

Edit: you can import [official sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6HpfRAdUKQ&t=745s&ab_channel=BrickSystemBrothers) too
                Hmm- tbh I still think that technically does it? Like that's designed so that people can design their own lego sets. However it only goes far enough so that your more likely to buy lego- because with that not only does it look sorta stale in terms of rendering, but obviously ya can't do much with it except look at it. A far more fledged designer would have a better looking render engine- and you could play with it virtually if you wanted. However lego wont do that, cuz that'd take away sales from physical lego
                The thing is, when I played with lego, I didnt because I enjoyed building, because I loved to play out numerous weird scenarios, from space battles to robot uprising etc etc.  


No digital lego game to date can scratch the itch that is flying a lego plane with your hand into the wall, only to have lego robots kill all your little lego people to have one lego man survive and kill all the lego robots to become lego king
            That's actually... a pretty decent theory. Have you seen Lego prices? That shit's worth more than gold
                Exactly- lego used to cost me an arm and a leg when I was super into it lol

Lego seems pretty chill with their copyright to the point of letting a whole team work on a Bionicle game with the condition that they don't make any money off of it. They even have a guy from the original commercials doing some video promos for them as well.
    >Lego seems pretty chill with their copyright

Haha, no. There are e.g. some smaller companies in Germany that have to fight some ridiculous lawsuits
    Part of having a trademark requires companies to actively defend it. Unless they sign an agreement with him to use their trademark, they risk losing it, because it sets precedent for other possible future infringements.
        > Part of having a trademark requires companies to actively defend it.

Isn't this a Reddit law that isn't actually true?
            I was originally amazed that the next comment in the chain wasn't "lol thats not true".

Trademarks and copyrights are just property of intelligence. If Lego^TM decided to be chill for someone being inspired by the brand, no government agency could force them to be upset. If Lego sued someone for making counterfeit sets, and branding them as Lego, it would not be diminished because someone made a texture pack.
            Yes, it's a reddit law. Have renewed TMs myself and gone over the documentation. To say that a company needs to be policing every potential infringement possible is nonsense. It would never hold up in or out of court to say that because you weren't dealt with for infringement, you're free to do it or that the trademark holder can no longer claim ownership. What has to be proven is that the infringing party knowingly used the property in ways that violate its accepted use. What's worse, the sort of regulation that requires constant policing would drastically undermine small businesses and give all of the power to large companies that can afford teams of lawyers working on this full time.  

Check out [this article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/trademark-law-does-not-require-companies-tirelessly-censor-internet) on the subject.
            I don’t what what Reddit Law is, but it is true. Done a bit of work with game development and seen both sides, companies defending and companies receiving cease and desist.

Also, trademark laws aren’t universal, different countries operate differently. One of the biggest complaints about the TPP was how much more power it gave those companies in enforcing their IP.
                > I don’t what what Reddit Law is

Something that is parroted on Reddit that isn't actually true.

Seems this is the case and companies don't need to "defend" their trademarks.
                    Except that precedent and corporate lawyers have them doing it. So sure, and idealistic interpretation of the law would be they don’t have to, but they all operate as if they do have to. By their very own page on the topic Lego believes in defending their trademark around the world.
        I mean I will be real, it's a minecraft texture pack on the internet. It is plenty valid for companies to have a blind eye to trademark offenders because it really isn't worth their time to pursue it, and it generally doesn't mean much in the long run.

If this developed into one of the most popular minecraft texture packs and pretty much everyone and their mother used it? I'm pretty sure Lego would step in due to obligations to defend their trademark.
            That’s not how obligations work unfortunately. They weaken their trademark for all future infringements so it does mean a lot in the long run. 

This is a corporation, they can’t afford to be soft or turn a blind eye and they don’t care about making people feel good when it comes to infringing on their IP. 

There’s a reason why these companies have giant law firms on retainer, or even large internal legal teams.

But hey, time will tell if this kid gets a cease and desist letter.
        >Part of having a trademark requires companies to actively defend it.

[This is a myth.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/trademark-law-does-not-require-companies-tirelessly-censor-internet) You do not lose a trademark if you choose not to sue someone. In fact it's the opposite. You have to regularly renew your trademark and note how it's being used - so you using it is what's important, not someone else. Companies sue/C&D people for infringing on IPs because it prevents their brand from becoming diluted and prevents other people from profiting off of their properties. Which, like, fair enough, but still. I think it's harmful to keep perpetuating this idea that companies are somehow mitigating regulatory risk. It paints them as "hey, lady, I'm just followin' da rules" when really they're just protecting a bottom line that honestly isn't really threatened.
            https://www.justia.com/intellectual-property/trademarks/enforcement/

“However, a failure to enforce a trademark by monitoring the mark for misuses will result in a weakening of the mark and loss of distinctiveness, which can lead to a loss of the trademark.”

Edit; Also claiming it’s a myth because of a 2013 opinion article about how current enforcement is overzealous doesn’t make it a myth. Sure, in a perfect world if they didn’t already operate like this that would be how it could work, but as that article even says, lawyers wanna get paid.

Plot twist: He didn't fall into the river on accident, he was going to visit it.
And Lego isn't? Autocorrect just sucks sometimes. Like, half the time I try typing "bot", it Autocorrects to "not"
    All I was saying is that it didn't need to correct anything because logo is a word.
        > Yeah idk why my autocorrect didn't recognise Lego



This implies that they typed "Lego" and it autocorrected to "logo"

    Now the “incident” with the younglings makes more sense.
    Like corona!
And this looks like it could be an official product from Lego so shaky territory- plus they have lego games so the market confusion argument seems easy
    I thought it was an official thing at first until I saw the "u/ ”

Lego would absolutely be willing to make something like this as an official product, they absolutely would be willing to brand it and advertise it with a picture like this, and someone would absolutely throw it up on this sub.
        Iirc lego already has put out several minecraft kits in the past. They tried making their own minecraft style game too. It's been years since I looked into it but it was kinda disappointing back then. It was supposed to be getting more content and idk if it ever did. 

Point being, this texture pack could potentially fall into the territory of affecting Lego's ability to sell their own products, which is usually one of the defining points used in trademark lawsuits.

In fact it's the opposite. You have to regularly renew your trademark and note how it's being used - so you using it is what's important, not someone else. Companies sue/C&D people for infringing on IPs because it prevents their brand from becoming diluted and prevents other people from profiting off of their properties. Which, like, fair enough, but still. I think it's harmful to keep perpetuating this idea that companies are somehow mitigating regulatory risk. It paints them as "hey, lady, I'm just followin' da rules" when really they're just protecting a bottom line that honestly isn't really threatened.

“However, a failure to enforce a trademark by monitoring the mark for misuses will result in a weakening of the mark and loss of distinctiveness, which can lead to a loss of the trademark.”

Edit; Also claiming it’s a myth because of a 2013 opinion article about how current enforcement is overzealous doesn’t make it a myth. Sure, in a perfect world if they didn’t already operate like this that would be how it could work, but as that article even says, lawyers wanna get paid.

        Are you ok after the river incident?
All I was saying is that it didn't need to correct anything because logo is a word.
    > Yeah idk why my autocorrect didn't recognise Lego



This implies that they typed "Lego" and it autocorrected to "logo"
        Oh ok, I got you. Sorry for the trouble.

Now the “incident” with the younglings makes more sense.
Like corona!
I thought it was an official thing at first until I saw the "u/ ”

Lego would absolutely be willing to make something like this as an official product, they absolutely would be willing to brand it and advertise it with a picture like this, and someone would absolutely throw it up on this sub.
    Iirc lego already has put out several minecraft kits in the past. They tried making their own minecraft style game too. It's been years since I looked into it but it was kinda disappointing back then. It was supposed to be getting more content and idk if it ever did. 

Point being, this texture pack could potentially fall into the territory of affecting Lego's ability to sell their own products, which is usually one of the defining points used in trademark lawsuits.
        Oh yeah that game was bad. I think I didn't make it an hour because the UI was so bad
            it also got filled with wangs pretty quickly, https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-06-01-lego-mmo-development-dogged-by-dong-detection-software
Also LEGO is well known for being happy to lawsuit their fans.

This is the first time I've actually understood why people misspell wary as weary so often. Goddammit, English.
Such wow
Alternate since the blocms look like they have 2 studs each.

There are fan games that Lego hasn't taken down.
    I’m not saying it’s like a 100% sure thing Lego goes after every single infringement, but just offered an explanation to why they may ignore certain ones.

Also, instructions may be something they’ve decided isn’t actually up to their infringement standard since you can’t copyright instruction manuals (very over generalizing here). The trademarks though, could be different.
        You actually can copyright manuals. You can't copyright the instructions themselves, or recipes or anything, but you can copyright an instruction book.

To be fair if they made a whole ass lego game where you could build what ever you want- you wouldn't wanna buy lego lol, why buy lego when you have an infinite amount in a videogame? My conspiracy theory is that lego purposely didn't make a full game so they are still able to sell physical lego
    This used to be my theory until I learned about [Lego Digital Designer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH9xoFC8CCM&ab_channel=JosephDepalma) aka LDD. I mean it's...legit official lego with infinite pieces. But...will it scratch that itch?

Edit: you can import [official sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6HpfRAdUKQ&t=745s&ab_channel=BrickSystemBrothers) too
        Hmm- tbh I still think that technically does it? Like that's designed so that people can design their own lego sets. However it only goes far enough so that your more likely to buy lego- because with that not only does it look sorta stale in terms of rendering, but obviously ya can't do much with it except look at it. A far more fledged designer would have a better looking render engine- and you could play with it virtually if you wanted. However lego wont do that, cuz that'd take away sales from physical lego
        The thing is, when I played with lego, I didnt because I enjoyed building, because I loved to play out numerous weird scenarios, from space battles to robot uprising etc etc.  


No digital lego game to date can scratch the itch that is flying a lego plane with your hand into the wall, only to have lego robots kill all your little lego people to have one lego man survive and kill all the lego robots to become lego king
    That's actually... a pretty decent theory. Have you seen Lego prices? That shit's worth more than gold
        Exactly- lego used to cost me an arm and a leg when I was super into it lol
I would say Blockland, as I played that game RELIGIOUSLY when I was younger, but the community is pretty dead. Nonetheless, it’s building mechanics is amazing, and there’s a spiritual successor being developed right now called Brickadia.
Have you heard about Minecraft?

    ok, so pack in question wasn't on the hard drive, but i did some digging, the pack in question was called legopak

    Hey, it's only been 7 years since my last update :).
when someone doesn't announce any sort of release date it's probably because they don't know, so my point still stands lol
> Part of having a trademark requires companies to actively defend it.

Isn't this a Reddit law that isn't actually true?
    I was originally amazed that the next comment in the chain wasn't "lol thats not true".

Trademarks and copyrights are just property of intelligence. If Lego^TM decided to be chill for someone being inspired by the brand, no government agency could force them to be upset. If Lego sued someone for making counterfeit sets, and branding them as Lego, it would not be diminished because someone made a texture pack.
    Yes, it's a reddit law. Have renewed TMs myself and gone over the documentation. To say that a company needs to be policing every potential infringement possible is nonsense. It would never hold up in or out of court to say that because you weren't dealt with for infringement, you're free to do it or that the trademark holder can no longer claim ownership. What has to be proven is that the infringing party knowingly used the property in ways that violate its accepted use. What's worse, the sort of regulation that requires constant policing would drastically undermine small businesses and give all of the power to large companies that can afford teams of lawyers working on this full time.  

Check out [this article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/trademark-law-does-not-require-companies-tirelessly-censor-internet) on the subject.
    I don’t what what Reddit Law is, but it is true. Done a bit of work with game development and seen both sides, companies defending and companies receiving cease and desist.

Also, trademark laws aren’t universal, different countries operate differently. One of the biggest complaints about the TPP was how much more power it gave those companies in enforcing their IP.
        > I don’t what what Reddit Law is

Something that is parroted on Reddit that isn't actually true.

Seems this is the case and companies don't need to "defend" their trademarks.
            Except that precedent and corporate lawyers have them doing it. So sure, and idealistic interpretation of the law would be they don’t have to, but they all operate as if they do have to. By their very own page on the topic Lego believes in defending their trademark around the world.
I mean I will be real, it's a minecraft texture pack on the internet. It is plenty valid for companies to have a blind eye to trademark offenders because it really isn't worth their time to pursue it, and it generally doesn't mean much in the long run.

If this developed into one of the most popular minecraft texture packs and pretty much everyone and their mother used it? I'm pretty sure Lego would step in due to obligations to defend their trademark.
    That’s not how obligations work unfortunately. They weaken their trademark for all future infringements so it does mean a lot in the long run. 

This is a corporation, they can’t afford to be soft or turn a blind eye and they don’t care about making people feel good when it comes to infringing on their IP. 

There’s a reason why these companies have giant law firms on retainer, or even large internal legal teams.

But hey, time will tell if this kid gets a cease and desist letter.
