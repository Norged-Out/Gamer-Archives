[[What's your favorite block (Mine is Gilded Blackstone)]]





I like crying obsidian.I like it more when complementry shader in on because it makes some of its parts glow.
    Oo that sounds cool
    Yup my dragon egg build uses it to make the flames glow at night.
I like dirt
    Like Crainer (props if yk him)
        Havent heard that name in years
            Ikr, bro old Ssundee, Captainsparklez, Crainer, DanTDM, and PopularMMOs was my childhood (even tho I'm still technically in my childhood)
                Yeah I used to watch them. I sometimes watch DanTDM but ive stopped watching popularmmos and ssundee
                    I've watched Pat, overall I still watch Dan and Ssundee, some vids are just boring but I like a few of them, BTW DANTDM MIGHT BE DOING MOD SHOWCASES AGAIN
                    popularmmos is kind of sad now
    >I like dirt

It don't hurt
Probably ancient debris. The feeling I get when finding ancient debris while mining never goes away no matter how many times I go mining in the nether. It's also just a nice block.
    The forbidden cinnamon roll...
        Someone is selling ancient debris as ‚ÄúCinnabons‚Äù on the smp I play on
            Secret 27th hermitcraft member confirmed???? /j
            Aren‚Äôt Cinnabons the name of the store?

Also how long have you all been playing to throw away ancient debris like that?
                Well, if you have a sheep farm and lots of wood, less than a week
        Yes

    So true
        happ cak day
    It really is the best feeling finding it. Now I miss minecraft
    It reminds me of Pokemon red/blues rock texture. Or something similar haha
Deepslate tiles slab.
    Love it, but don‚Äôt love mining it.
    Ooo interesting
    Deepslate and it's various forms are my go to blocks in my current world (it's the general theme of my base at the moment). You can never go wrong with it, and tho mining it can be a pain in the ass it is the best easily accessible building block in my opinion
    If only it looks good on more than floors and roofs :(
That's a hard question..

Probably spruce logs
    Spruce is the superior wood‚Ä¶ spruce doors are my favorite.
        They look kinda like castle doors. At least thats what i think.
    Nice wood choice
    I like using a mix of spruce and dark oak
the enchantment table‚Ä¶not quite the building block but it looks cool
    Very useful too
    Can be an awesome building block as a center piece to a room imo
Moss, I use it way too much
    Nice nice
Oooh this is tough. RN I‚Äôm enjoying using deepslate + bricks
    Nice combo
Why gilded blackstone?
    Because I honestly just like the look of it for some edgy-type builds üòÇüòÇ
    Shiny
Spruce Trapdoor
    A builders best friend
        No no a builder best friend is called resources
    This is the only answer tbh
Red netherbrick!
    Cool choice
        petrified oak slab
    Same! All my friends don't like it but I love the way it looks in roofs and floors
        End gateway and sculk shrieker.
    Based choice, I never see anyone use this block
Cracked Deepslate brick
    Nice
Deepslate tiles, cool sound when you break them and cool aesthetic.
    They make the best shingle roofs too!
Mud......
    SHREK
Amethyst, it looks and sound beautifull
Honey block. 

Just a nice visual and technical block. One of the very few blocks that functions in many areas of the game.
Command Block, by far.
    Command block is cool
I like crying obsidian
    It's a nice block
Prismarine
    Dark prismarine ü•¥
Calcite! If I ever come across it, I will mine it all out to bring back as flooring.
Waxed lightly weathered cut copper stairs
    r/oddlyspecific XD

It is a nice block ngl
    Ay oh we got a fake fan over here. A real copper head would know it stopped being called lightly weathered like halfway through the snapshots. When it was released in 1.17 the two middle stages are Exposed copper block and Weathered copper block, or ya know all the cut and so forth variants. 

Confess to me, you just saw a meme about the length of the name when the first snapshot came out
Sculk
    Nicee, new block
Mossy and Cracked Stone Bricks. I can't stop sprinkling them in whenever I build something out of stone bricks, gotta break up that texture
I like watermelon!
Raw gold block, it was my favorite when empires s.2 started and Joel started building with it
    fwhip may agree with you
Deepslate tile
netherite blocks if only it was cheap üòÇ
Moss, was a game changer honestly when it comes to building naturally and with the azaela and stuff that comes with its just so nice. Also just looks cozy
Emerald deepslate ore
    Nice, rare
        Also looks cool
Birch wood....
    Honestly Birch is so underrated. Like it is perfect for furnishing buildings, floors, accents, and even striped birch logs do so much for a build.
        i never understood the hate for birch and diorite. luckily when i started building i didn‚Äôt know of the hate those two had and didn‚Äôt get ‚Äúraised‚Äù with that mentality. they have their uses and if need be then i‚Äôll use them with no hesitation
            I personally dont like the log texture of birch everything else of birch is 7/10, i personally HATE the uncrafted diorite but when its mixed with the polished version it looks amazing for small houses
Dark prismarine probably for the tiny squares look lol
    I think i used to make pools with it
        Yea for instance although I made one with the prismarine bricks and it was before they had waterloggable slabs so it was a bit rough lol
            I dont know how we managed without waterlogable slabs
                Or walls or any of the other QoL stuff like


But still glass blocks require silk touch wtf
Dirt
    Possible OG Crainer fan?
I like sea lanterns, but they're annoying to farm.
crying obidisan
Lanterns and candles
Deepslate Coal idk i just like it lol
    Ah yes, the invisible coal
Polished Blackstone Bricks
    Amazing
I love it too! I also love redstone lamp ,enchanting table ,netherite block and wool. Acasia log/planks also have good vibes.
Jungle Leaves!
Calcite. Looks great for marble textures and doesn‚Äôt need a haste 2 beacon to be instamined
Brown terracotta for some nice natural texturing
I like grass block because i can tell my friend that i actually touch grass
Amethyst block. It makes cool sounds
Polished Deepslate. You can get it very easily, *Dark mode*, Looks good in any of my futuristic builds.
Diamonds black cz i love blue
concrete.
Diamonds!!!!
Piston!
moving piston head
armor standü§åüóø
crying obsidian the purple make it look like something magical and i love it
    Same. Every ruined portal near my mushroom continent has been stripped of its crying obsidian. Sometimes I leave the gold. If my inventory is full, I leave something behind lol.
tricky, tricky...

how about... ooh, I think either iron or netherite. I use both a lot (I'm mostly a creative player), but like one is fantasy and realistic stuff, the other is sci-fi style.
    Understandable
Course dirt
Before 1.17, it was deepslate bricks, but now it‚Äôs the stone variant of diamond ore. It feels satisfying to find one of those now.
Skulk Catalyst
Mine is stone bricks.
sculk block
Mine is also gilded blackstone :)
Netherite stair
Magma block
Honeycomb blocks! A huge fan of bees
Classic diamond ore
Endstone bricks
Pumpkin. I like to use it as a scafolding block, its a good way to get emmeralds, I like the sound it makes when its insta mined and can be turned into cool light sources and golems.
stripped mangrove log
    It's a nice block. It's a shame it's kinda difficult to harvest tho.
        Yes, but I love the color
            I used some in a build and it was kinda annoying to harvest. Mainly bc 4 logs make 3 of the all side log block thing.
Been enjoying using spruce (logs, stripped logs, planks) along with some calcite as of late. It gives the build a nice Nordic look!
    Nice, calcite and spruce work well together
Glass panes!!! They are so good for creating a vibe inside of your build if they are floating. But anything copper or dark oak for me is also up there.
Gilded black is the best, can't get enough of that stuff
Mangrove Wood Planks in the new update. Fits a lot of builds that I‚Äôm going to make.
Polished blackstone brick
Dark wood and spruce.
Deep slate Blackstone and quarts and it's other slab and stair variants
all the spruce wood and planks or all the deepslate blocks idk but i love both
Deepslate bricks, any other answer is wrong
Cobbled deepslate
Spruce trap door
any kind of deepslate
Barrier
Spruce log
Grass block
Deepslate Tiles
polished deepalate
deepslate lapis lazuli ore
Reinforced Stone from IndustrialCraft¬≤
Mine is Curse of Vanishing
Command block
Calcite. For building old house with white wall.
Maybe... Verdant froglight
pig üêñ
I like diorite...
Waxed Lightly Weathered Cut Copper Stairs
Mud brick! After years of mocking everyone with a dirt house by imagining them in a mud hut i can finally build myself a real mud hut!
I like the quartz blocks, use em almost everywhere
[Deepslate copper ore](https://i.imgur.com/0OJdom5.jpg)

Beautiful!
Me love stone
Glowstone
Mine is observor because of the funny face
Glowstone
Petrified Oak Slabs cause of its rarity and uniqueness
Warped tree is stunning with shaders
Prismaline
    I like that too bc of the color pallete
Polished diorite. I know I'm an idiot, but I love the way it looks.
Tuff. it isn‚Äôt the best looking block but after mining deepslate for ages, finding tuff is amazing it‚Äôs a satisfying speed boost and let‚Äôs me enjoy strip mining briefly.


Edit: the worst block is a lectern, it gives me flashbacks from trying to get a mending villager.
Honey block

H o n e y me like honey
Diamond , even though I have a ton of it I still get so happy when I find them
Diamond ore. No matter how many times I see it when I‚Äôm mining, it gives me the tinglies
I like light grey wool a little too much. I‚Äôll be in the middle of a massive mob battle in the overworld and be like ‚ÄúOoh! Light grey sheep!‚Äù And get out my shears.
Dirt (I am 67)
Grass
Spore Flower. I am a very nature loving person, and spore flowers really bring any nature-related build to life. May not be such a blocky block, but I had to say it.
Spruce planks. I just love chalet builds/darker style castles in general, and it looks great in my favourite biome (snowy plains)!
oak plank
Just realized that the syllables of ‚ÄúGilded Blackstone‚Äù are the same as the Indiana Jones theme
Crying obsidian.
mine is the netherite block.
That‚Äôs a tough call between the amethyst and crying obsidian for me‚Ä¶ the amethyst is so pretty and makes pretty chimes when you walk on it and the crying obsidian is also pretty and I love the ‚Äútears‚Äù they make for a nice aesthetic when I use it as a ceiling
I love podzol, netherrack and dirt.

Change my mind.
Bedrock
    A while ago I made a potion lab with a glass-filled bedrock floor. It might‚Äôve been dark gray glass, I can‚Äôt remember, but I loved the bedrock texture under the slick floor. I miss that build.
I don't really have one most of the time I play I'm grinding to become op to start wars in smp's
The swaggest stairs ever
Spruce logs, cause everytime I spawn in taiga biome it makes me feel so peaceful, it brings me comfort(strange). I also like everything made from birch and deepslate tilesüå≤üå≥
Diorite prior to 1.14.
Bookshelf.

You know why
A hunck o' Netherite
I like Deepslate, it's versatile and has many different types of it
    Why is this down
Voted wtf
Red blocks.
Oxidized Copper! My favorite color.
    And just like the block, the playerbase is rusting away
    Ring Ring Mojang  


The community is calling...  


Will you pick up or keep your phone on airplane mode??
    Hey, it would be nice if copper could have some actual interesting gameplay uses beside being a block that oxidizes
        What would you recommend? I don't see why it needs to be anything more than a building block - it's not like the other metal blocks have a lot of depth.
            Some unique new mechanic attached to it. There are plenty of ideas on youtube (my favourite is by SimplySarc) and on the minecraft suggestions sub. I really hoped copper would further expand the technical side of minecraft, being a building block makes copper very boring.
                My apologies, I thought you meant the copper block specifically, not copper as an item. I think the intention is that copper ingots will get more uses as more features are added to the game, much like iron has received a lot more use-cases over the years - but of course more copper uses would be great!
                    I am quite pessimistic about it. I'm afraid they will forget about it for a long time. Mojang has made in the recent updates a lot of features that are just for show, thus resulting in unfinished features that lack proper gameplay value.
I mean, what's the point of finding disc shards in the ancient cities if you can only craft them for a disc that is basically disc 11 rip-off? that's their only usage and it is an exceedingly idiotic feature the more I think about it.

Crying obsidian
copper or diorite or moss
I use deepslate and all its variants a lot
Either cobble deepslate or cobblestone
But dirt is still better
Air
Sculk shrieker because it‚Äôs terrifying when you‚Äôre looting an ancient city, find some chests and right next to them is a shrieker and sensor. I hear boss music anytime I see the two together.
Gilded Blackstone is a cool looking block.
Blackstone bricks.

Second would probably be sculk catalyst.
Oxidized Copper. Such a nice shade
Crying obsidian. Reminds me of red obsidian from my old pocket edition days.
Mine is Waxed Lightly Weathered Cut Copper Stairs
Probably all variants of Quartz. It‚Äôs so clean!
Mine is Polished Blocks. Or any type of Ore.
Mine is the command block, probably the most powerful block and it started a game that had an amazing plot and amazing characters
your post has convinced me to try and make my best house, both in the overworld and the nether, starting with a ruined portal as the base.
Dark Oak Logs. Idk why but it‚Äôs just kinda chill
My favorite block is dirt

Because the lapis and Redstone underground goes into the dirt and then plants get made and the red stone and lapis  goes into the plants

Then the animals eat the plants and the humans eat the plants 

And the humans and animals start to reproduce
All
cyan concrete powder is my fav, color is great
end gateway block it looks funni af
Mud Bricks
Mushroom stems, forgotten white-ish block and underrated imo
I wish Gilded Blackstone was renewable. Top three are Gilded Blackstone, Red Netherbrick, and Dark Prismarine.
prismarine, i really like the color :3
 g r a s s
Melon
Shroomlight
wood. its very useful
Deepslate tiles
Is gilded Blackstone a crafted block or one found in the wild?
El gato netherite
Definitely ‚ÄùWaxed Lightly Weathered Cut Copper Stairs‚Äú
Honestly like dirt, don't know why. I just like how useful it is.
I really like sea lanterns especially since I build a lot of sci if builds
Mud bricks might be my favourite. They look interesting and sound interesting. If not then maybe calcite. Calcite would win if it had stairs and slabs
Copper block
Quartz Bricks. I just love marble-like blocks, there so elegant and cool
Smooth stone, it‚Äôs just so smooth
Lodestone or The Dragon Egg.
I don‚Äôt know what it calls, but the recipe was smelting cobblestone is my favorite
Obsi
Dark Oak Planks!!!
Beacon, because it makes very satisfying, arcane noises
But of a Lime Terracotta fan for a very specific and well thought out reason that would make you instantly agree with me if I shared, which I will not
Why
Mine is also gilded blackstone :)
Stone brick and its variants. I just love building medieval towers with it!
Mine is just the grass block. I have seen it for years and it‚Äôs very nostalgic
MOSS!!!
I'd say either Polished Andesite or Deepslate Tiles.
Deepslate bricks
Mud
Air
I've never decided
Deepslate tiles
Netherite block,it just seem cool and make me look rich af
For a darker block I love polish blackstone bricks, but I also love the emerald block
Mine is red nether brick
Gold
[deleted]
Structure block, its useful and looks cool
Dark oak wood looks noice
Deepslate bricks and their variants
I really like the top texture of regular deepslate. Also jungle trapdoors
Stone bricks gang right here
blackstone bricks
Blackstone tiles.... It just hits different
i love a good deepslate tile
Netherite Block because it‚Äôs a block I never have :(

Seriously though it‚Äôs got an amazing texture and it‚Äôs downright criminal how hard it is to get
the bread block
Cake
end gateway
All the variants of quartz, except for the plain version. It gives a kinda marble look that I enjoy so much.
 Mine is structure void
i remember realllyy liking the nether reactor core!
Mud.
I don‚Äôt have one single favourite but oxidised cut copper, polished deepslate and dark prismarine are my top 3
If I had to pick just one? Yellow Terracotta. Which is odd cause I dislike Yellow as a color, but Mesa's are my favorite biome and the Yellow just pops so nicely.
Id say moss blocks. The look of its green is way cooler than grass and it gives a chill vibe if im surrounded by it
Recently I‚Äôve really been liking end stone bricks. I don‚Äôt know why but the combos you can get with it, just, beautiful.
Blackstone wall. I built houses using it as a wall and it looked really nice
Brich related blocks
I think that sea lanterns are really cool but I've never used them.
‚ÄúDiamond Block!‚Äù 
-Literally any 8 year old
there's a tie between programmer art gold and programmer art diamond. i like making checkerboards with them
Moss
Amethyst, raw gold, diamond block, basically any of the rare blocks. I love using them on roofs for my houses. It's kinda nostalgic, like an upgraded version of those diamond houses from 2012
My favorite is also gilded blackstone
Shroomlights!
Old netherite
Probably Deepslate tiles but i also love polished andesite a lot
deepslate tiles. it makes a really good floor
Stained glass !
Polished andesite fr
Used to be nether core reactor, but now observer cus nerd
Coal... Idk why it's just really nice
Diamond ore(not deepslate)
Same gilded blackstone is the best. I tried to make a base out of it once but it takes ages to get.
Dirt
My favorite is dark prismarine. It‚Äôs just so nice
lately i've been really into any variation of deepslate! i also love mangrove planks, they're so pretty
Crying Obsidian
In Survival, Diamond Ore.

In Creative, it's the good ol' Stone Brick.
Oak planks because I‚Äôm boring
smooth slightly rusty tiles copper slate.



is that correct or...
Happeh cek dae
Deepstone bricks
Mine is the "Swaggiest stairs ever".
Dragon egg
Smooth stone slab
My favourite block is Emerald Block.
Deepslate. Any form of deepslate. It‚Äôs so versatile for any build.
Sculk Catalyst.
Stone and deepslate brick. They're just so generally good looking that you can use then anywhere
I like the whole prismarine block set! I like the blue-teal color palette you get when you build with it. Since 1.16 I also like to mix warped planks in with prismarine while I'm building bc they just work with the color scheme.
STONE
Smooth stone or deepslate tiles. Both are clean and soothing to look at.
Command Block, as a programmer
wood blocküòç
Deepslate and all of its varients
Has anybody said air?
Just simple Spruce Log
Mine are sea lanterns they look soo nice and are very useful in many ways
I like the sculk growth/vine block. You can put it over different blocks for cool colour combinations
I think the old emeral block
To build with, to have, or best looking?
oak log üòé
Mosty cobblestone is my fav
Command Block
the possibilities are endless
Cobbled deepslate

I built my base out of it
Stone! Just stone :)
Spruce logs
Polished black stone it goes great with dark oak planks and birch logs and birch planks
Clay.  Red clay, grey clay, black clay, blue clay, all clay!  I cannot ever mine enough.  I fill chests full of clay and use it in every build :).  The muted colors work so well with so many designs.
Chiseled quartz
Sea Lantern

I just love how clean it looks, and it fits well with Both Scifi, and Old time builds
Command
Weird take but i love the jack o lanterns, i spam them in my builds
Cactus. I‚Äôm addicted to making huge cactus farms I don‚Äôt need
Idk why but I love polished andisite... just something about it pleases me.
Lapis ore
The different variants of bricks and fully oxidized cut copper
Any prismarine block
grass
lime concrete powder
Purpur blocks. I fall in love with them from the first 1.9 snapshot
Hard but i'd say Deepslate brick (My favourite building stone) and Spruce log (favourite building wood)
Barrier block
Polished blackstone, by far
Quartz
Conduit
Waxed Lightly Weathered Cut Copper Stairs

Edit: Jokes aside, I used to think Deepslate Bricks were my favorite, but Sculk is starting to grow on me
Mining Diamond Ore never gets old
Either Stone Brick or Deepslate Tile.
Smooth sandstone. It fits with most color palletes and has a soft texture
I like any version of deepslate not including cobbled
Probably smooth stone slab
The border block so i can keep you at bay, hush hush
Probably oxidized cut copper
Stonebrick, keepin the classix
weird pick, but don‚Äôt judge me‚Ä¶
cyan terracotta.
Very sad indeed....
Mines probably.... Chiseled Deepslate I think
Cracked Deepslate Tiles.
Tie between Crying Obsidian and Gilded Blackstone
Glazed terracotta, specially cyan :D
Grass Block. I always try to get the ones enderman drop when they die while holding one.
The Nether Reactor Core. 

I remember as a kid playing Minecraft for the very first time and thinking how cool the Nether Reactor looked. I went on Creative and made a giant, absolutely colossal cube made out of Nether Reactor Cores that I called a house. I made a burn pit in it and burned cows alive and tried eating the leather because I thought it was supposed to be meat or something, I didn‚Äôt even know what leather was. Good times man.
Granite probably, i love the combi of granite + bricks + terracotta
Scaffolding easily. There's no block like it, and it has so many functions.
Besides deepslate tiles that everyone‚Äôs mentioned, Chiseled quartz
Anything deepslate but specifically deepslate bricks, idk why but it resonates with me
Dark oak planks and deepslate bricks. I could find a way to make them work in anything
The top comments and this post are all Nether update blocks so let‚Äôs just agree it was a great update
Lantern. I have to admit, i abuse them in my builds. But if we don't count them as a full block, then obsydian or crying obsydian.
I like amethyst
respawn anchor


when ever i'm not allowed to use tnt it's my second option
iron ore.its just so satisfying mining a lot of iron in caves.
Deepslate Tiles
Crafting table
Bell.
The crimson hyphae!üòãü§§
Thinking about this at 11 PM is hard, imma say spawner, just loves it‚Äôs texture bro
acacia button
my favorite block is diamond block
Mud. Only thing that would make it better is if you could eat it. More realistic.
White Concrete
Mossy cobblestone! I use it almost all my builds
Chiseled Blackstone. For my Piglin Bois
I really like to use warped wood for all my builds since i really like to build haunted houses
lapis ore
I don‚Äôt know why.
Emerald Ore, definetely.
I‚Äôve made myself the challenge to implement every block in to my builds/terraforming (playing 1.8.9) and after every new build my new favorite block changes.

Colored glass is awesome but if I had to pick one:

Grass in Jungle Biomes.
Primarily, that colour just fits.
Crafting table, most important block of the game with lots of details
I love the spruce door
Warped block types
Scaffolding easily. There's no block like it, and it has so many functions.
Cobblestone its my childhood
i love prismerine. The colorchange is really cool.
deepslate tiles or smooth stone slab
cracked polished blackstone bricks
Shroomlight or the new Froglight
I love everything quartz and also Spruce Logs. spruce logs look great already and so much can be made from them, I love them
TNT goes boom
Crafting Table cuz my fav weapon crossbow was made when i used it
calcite cuz it look really nice
Honeycomb. Idk y it just looks nice
Probably grass
Quartz block
Gotta be same as you - gilded blackstone.
Spent hours mining the stuff in bastions simply because I think it looks so cool.
I like Gilded Blackstone as well! And just blackstone for edgy builds! (`‚Ä¢œâ‚Ä¢)~‚ô°
Spruce logs hit different
The old lapis texture from 1.6
Mines is slimeblocks
Red Nether Bricks
Mine is netherite
It is between Cobbled Deepslate/Cobblestone/Stone Bricks
Magma block
i LOVE deepslate tiles, they are so nicely paired with spruce wood
Hard question. Calcite is a block I use a lot. Also any type of Deepslate. I mix it up a lot when I build
Mine is probably also gilded Blackstone and emerald blocks. 

They go well together in my enchanting room üòã
Waxed Lightly Weathered Cut Copper Stairs. 

Not that remarkable of an item, but I like that it has the longest name of any block.
Gilded Blackstone is such a classy block. I have a weakness for Block of Lapis Lazuli
Also gilded blackstone.
I love how spruce logs look, honestly
smooth deepslate beicks
breirks*
beicks**
beidks***
UHG
bricks****
FINALLY
Uuuuh netherite block or mangrove trapdoor but i cant choose between them
fully grown potatoes
MOSSY COBBLESTONE!
Deepslate coal block, I don‚Äôt know it just looks cool
stone bricks, super easy to get a load of them and they look very pretty. cobble gen + tnt duper on a clock, and then get a bunch of lava from the nether and smelt
Birchwood
Nether reactor core
Gold.Idk what it is about it but it makes me feel powerful when I‚Äôm sitting on a pure golden block throne.also deepslate diamond ore looks really good
Copper
Sculk
My favorite block is andesite
I have to go with Amethyst. Its pretty, sounds cool, and it is farmable.
any type of stone brick. Deepslate, Blackstone, Mossy, Cracked or just regular old stone bricks. They look nice
Polished andesite or tiled deep slate
mangrove trapdoors
Brick or course dirt.
I really like the spruce blocks and the stone brick collection
Any type of Deepslate block you can craft. There's something about it that makes it look good compared to regular stone blocks...
Amethyst because it sings when you walk on it, hit it, and break it. It just always sings upon interaction. I love it.
Chiseled red sandstone. I love the little wither on it
Sculk sensors!
Moss and copper
Bedrock. It's a challenge to me as I one day I hope to pick it up as an item in survival.
Ofc Obsidian
Polished andesite and crying obsidian are my two personal favourites
Cobwebs
waxed lightly weathered cut copper stairs
Probably Quartz Block
raw iron block... beans
Prismarine Lanterns
Deepslete Tiles
fuck uhh...

spruce fav wood and deepslate fav stone

call me basic but i mean come on
Lime Wool
Waxed lightly weathered cut copper stairs
Mangrove and spruce, all blocks made with those 2
Spruce wood
Spruce wood üòç
Polished andesite for sure
Only real OG‚Äôs will understand 

**The Grass Block**
Mangrove trapdoor
Grindstones. Best block for pulleys, tank tracks, gears, joints, etc
Oo that sounds cool
Yup my dragon egg build uses it to make the flames glow at night.
Like Crainer (props if yk him)
    Havent heard that name in years
        Ikr, bro old Ssundee, Captainsparklez, Crainer, DanTDM, and PopularMMOs was my childhood (even tho I'm still technically in my childhood)
            Yeah I used to watch them. I sometimes watch DanTDM but ive stopped watching popularmmos and ssundee
                I've watched Pat, overall I still watch Dan and Ssundee, some vids are just boring but I like a few of them, BTW DANTDM MIGHT BE DOING MOD SHOWCASES AGAIN
                popularmmos is kind of sad now
>I like dirt

It don't hurt
The forbidden cinnamon roll...
    Someone is selling ancient debris as ‚ÄúCinnabons‚Äù on the smp I play on
        Secret 27th hermitcraft member confirmed???? /j
        Aren‚Äôt Cinnabons the name of the store?

Also how long have you all been playing to throw away ancient debris like that?
            Well, if you have a sheep farm and lots of wood, less than a week
    Yes

So true
    happ cak day
It really is the best feeling finding it. Now I miss minecraft
It reminds me of Pokemon red/blues rock texture. Or something similar haha
Love it, but don‚Äôt love mining it.
Ooo interesting
Deepslate and it's various forms are my go to blocks in my current world (it's the general theme of my base at the moment). You can never go wrong with it, and tho mining it can be a pain in the ass it is the best easily accessible building block in my opinion
If only it looks good on more than floors and roofs :(
Spruce is the superior wood‚Ä¶ spruce doors are my favorite.
    They look kinda like castle doors. At least thats what i think.
Nice wood choice
I like using a mix of spruce and dark oak
Very useful too
Can be an awesome building block as a center piece to a room imo
Nice nice
Nice combo
Because I honestly just like the look of it for some edgy-type builds üòÇüòÇ
Shiny
A builders best friend
    No no a builder best friend is called resources
This is the only answer tbh
Cool choice
    petrified oak slab
Same! All my friends don't like it but I love the way it looks in roofs and floors
    End gateway and sculk shrieker.
Based choice, I never see anyone use this block
Nice
They make the best shingle roofs too!
SHREK
Command block is cool
It's a nice block
Dark prismarine ü•¥
r/oddlyspecific XD

It is a nice block ngl
Ay oh we got a fake fan over here. A real copper head would know it stopped being called lightly weathered like halfway through the snapshots. When it was released in 1.17 the two middle stages are Exposed copper block and Weathered copper block, or ya know all the cut and so forth variants. 

Confess to me, you just saw a meme about the length of the name when the first snapshot came out
Nicee, new block
fwhip may agree with you
Nice, rare
    Also looks cool
Honestly Birch is so underrated. Like it is perfect for furnishing buildings, floors, accents, and even striped birch logs do so much for a build.
    i never understood the hate for birch and diorite. luckily when i started building i didn‚Äôt know of the hate those two had and didn‚Äôt get ‚Äúraised‚Äù with that mentality. they have their uses and if need be then i‚Äôll use them with no hesitation
        I personally dont like the log texture of birch everything else of birch is 7/10, i personally HATE the uncrafted diorite but when its mixed with the polished version it looks amazing for small houses
I think i used to make pools with it
    Yea for instance although I made one with the prismarine bricks and it was before they had waterloggable slabs so it was a bit rough lol
        I dont know how we managed without waterlogable slabs
            Or walls or any of the other QoL stuff like


But still glass blocks require silk touch wtf
Possible OG Crainer fan?
Ah yes, the invisible coal
Amazing
Same. Every ruined portal near my mushroom continent has been stripped of its crying obsidian. Sometimes I leave the gold. If my inventory is full, I leave something behind lol.
Understandable
It's a nice block. It's a shame it's kinda difficult to harvest tho.
    Yes, but I love the color
        I used some in a build and it was kinda annoying to harvest. Mainly bc 4 logs make 3 of the all side log block thing.
Nice, calcite and spruce work well together
I like that too bc of the color pallete
A while ago I made a potion lab with a glass-filled bedrock floor. It might‚Äôve been dark gray glass, I can‚Äôt remember, but I loved the bedrock texture under the slick floor. I miss that build.
Why is this down
Voted wtf
And just like the block, the playerbase is rusting away
Ring Ring Mojang  


The community is calling...  


Will you pick up or keep your phone on airplane mode??
Hey, it would be nice if copper could have some actual interesting gameplay uses beside being a block that oxidizes
    What would you recommend? I don't see why it needs to be anything more than a building block - it's not like the other metal blocks have a lot of depth.
        Some unique new mechanic attached to it. There are plenty of ideas on youtube (my favourite is by SimplySarc) and on the minecraft suggestions sub. I really hoped copper would further expand the technical side of minecraft, being a building block makes copper very boring.
            My apologies, I thought you meant the copper block specifically, not copper as an item. I think the intention is that copper ingots will get more uses as more features are added to the game, much like iron has received a lot more use-cases over the years - but of course more copper uses would be great!
                I am quite pessimistic about it. I'm afraid they will forget about it for a long time. Mojang has made in the recent updates a lot of features that are just for show, thus resulting in unfinished features that lack proper gameplay value.
I mean, what's the point of finding disc shards in the ancient cities if you can only craft them for a disc that is basically disc 11 rip-off? that's their only usage and it is an exceedingly idiotic feature the more I think about it.
