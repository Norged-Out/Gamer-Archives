[[An updated Risk of Rain 2 visual guide]]





Thank you for the straight forward visual resource.  I appreciate you OP.
    As a female streamer of this game exclusively on Twitch, I do not feel accepted or supported by the community in the slightest. I quite frankly feel bullied so it's really encouraging that the risk of rain Reddit community has been so supportive and appreciative of the content I post, so thank you very much.
        I’m sorry to hear about your experience on Twitch. I’m not much of a Twitch person, but yeah there’s more to the RoR2 community than just on that site. 

The Reddit squad is a quirky bunch that flips between dunking on artifact-enjoyers or calling them based whenever they post about getting achievements/unlocks haha

In any case, I’m glad you found support here, and in addition I’ve personally have very much enjoyed your posts!!

On to a game question… what is your opinion on Mountain Shrine (or as my friends like to call them, GaMeR Shrines lol) usage on E8 runs?
            Yeah the risk of rain 2 community has been wonderful to me so far. I was surprised by the amount of support I got from the few instances of sexism I've experienced on here (it wasn't a lot but a few people have told me I was only posting here to get subscribers on my other site which is clearly not true as I don't have a link to my other site on this Reddit account and clearly have a passion for the game as can be seen by the effort I put into the content I post here)

I used to use an infinite mountain shrine mod but at some point felt it was a little cheating because of how op you get on stage 4 and how many more items you'll get. There's probably never a time where I won't hit a mountain shrine, hell I've hit two or three mountain shrines with engi on stage 1 or 2 and the rationale is basically, might as well, if I don't survive then I haven't invested much anyways but the payout may be worth it. 

If you can't handle the mountain shrine, you were probably going to die anyways is my thought process so I'll always do them no matter how underpowered I am. Just hope it's not beetle queen
                Yeah I’m very glad that your experience here has been a positive one :) 

But yeah I also spam Mountain Shrines on sight, probably to my own detriment more often than not haha Like if I hit 2 of them Stage 1, the amount of time it would take for me to clear it makes the run way harder to maintain overall by basically starting behind the curve. Their value tho with a good green drop could be huge, especially in multiplayer.

And that makes a lot of sense, early game there’s not that much investment so if you make it, sweet, and if not, well it’s not that big of a deal to restart. But later on, you’re much stronger and the difficulty jump from a MS hit is much smaller.

That said, the question whenever one appears is always, “Well we ARE gamers, aren’t we?” Hahaha outside of value vs detriment, I think they’re just plain fun and a pretty well-made mechanic at that!
                I hate the mountain golem thing the laser sucks
        Yeah I've known two women who tried streaming.  They were almost immediately driven away by the gaming community as a whole.  Sounds vile and unpleasant.
        Keep doing what you are doing. There will sadly always be haters, let them yell into the void. You're doing great and it shows, be proud of yourself because you deserve it. Focus on the things that go well even if that sometimes can be difficult.
        Do you have a YT channel where you drop vods and stuff? I know watching vods don't really help, but I'm starved for Risk of Rain content creators.
            Only on  [twitch](http://twitch.tv/katarinaishii) atm but I want to work on YouTube
                Ay thanks for the link. I hope your endeavor is a succesful one!
        I'm sorry to hear that.  Another L for the gaming community.  I wonder what steps need to be taken to change this sort of thing.
Given how advanced some of these hints are, I'd have quoted potrolling in the bands slide. Aside of that good job man, very informative and readable

Also, why not relying too much on Lunars? I've been watching a lot of Race recently and I'm absorbing most of his gameplay habits, so I basically NEVER buy lunars EVER (he perceives them almost as cheating because of their power and because of how easy it is to obtain the one you want), but technically they're absolutely legit and obtainable even up to eclipse8.
    Thank you. Woman* haha

Yeah honestly I stopped using lunars after watching one of his videos about how to improve at risk of rain 2 and haven't looked back since. 

Now that I've completed eclipse 8 on each character, have 245 e8 wins for this year alone, I'll get lunars to gamble on a cleansing pool for the next stage but not usually for any actual use value. Never actually tried the tonic / gesture power combo either. 

Someone tried to make the argument that getting atgs and pocket is OP so how is this not considered cheating either. The difference is that you can't ever guarantee getting an atg or a pocket -- hell, I had a clover and pocket, with no atg (sad face) and literally looped till I got an atg, and finally as my last chest I opened up on sky meadow second loop was an atg. 

1) You can edit your lunar coins 
2) you can get 5 lunars in between each stage
3) you can infinitely reroll as many times as you've edited till you get what you want
        Oh sorry, I kind of use "man" as a nonbinary "dude" ahah. 

I agree on your second paragraph, finding enough pockets/ATGs is very rare and usually a good run emerges from a fair mix of luck and inventory management rather than brutally yeeting a bunch of lunars into a shop. Even finding an ATG printer doesn't guarantee you the win if some greens are carrying your run (quail&feathers for movement, shurikens for proccing bands...) and you mindlessly throw everything into the printer; you must have scrapped the right items in advance. Besides, it feels like winning the lottery when you luck out and actually get a legit ("legit") broken build! Artifact of command completely deletes the joy of these moments.

Regarding lunars, yeah, if you do edit in infinite coins that *definetely* is cheating on my book and completely breaks the game, lmao. You just hit the newt and spend 3k coins getting 5 shaped glasses at round 1. But, even though devs decided to leave the freedom to players and not patch out the lunar coin exploit, infinite coins is definetely an unintended mechanic. I think that lunars get *far* more reasonable if coins are collected legit: if you consistently hit the newt and pick the next stage, it's not rare to spend ~9 lunars per run, which almost negate the ones you get from winning. Considering that it's not that rare to get unlucky with the newt shop (realistically, almost all lunars are good, but only a couple of them are actually broken), if you start heavily rerolling items the coin usage quickly skyrockets: even Race at his peak (about 4k lunars obtained legit, if I remember correctly?), with an absurd amount of playtime and winrate, could have probably afforded at most a dozen wins bruteforced through exploiting lunars.

What I'm trying to say is: if you make use of lunars as intended by the devs and do not cheat, actually abusing them is unsustainable. You'll realistically end up picking up one of them, maybe two, once in a while: which still makes them very powerful and easy to access, but probably not broken on a COMPLETELY different order of magnitude than, say, void items (which are a very accessible source of void bears, plimps, lutes). 

I still haven't used a single lunar in my eclipse games so far, but I'm considering betraying papa Race's religion and picking up a Purity or a Gesture once in a while, to fix a ridiculously unlucky run instead of throwing it. Besides, they're *fun* items which allow for very unique builds, and it's quite sad to ditch them all in the trash because of how easy to find they are. I'd rather find a way to smoothly implement them into the runs instead - which the scarcity of coins almost already provides.
            I'm from Cali so I understand. We all refer to each other as "dude" regardless of gender haha. I only correct people because this game is heavily male dominated so I like to let people know that women in the community exist. 

I've gotten practically full crit on stage 1 as flurry huntress but had literally not one decent green damage item other than a shuriken which illustrates fairly well that even getting full crit on huntress isn't a guaranteed win if you don't have other damage items to balance it off with. Honestly, no greater joy than opening up a chest and getting pocket icbm on Engi. Probably wouldn't have the same satisfaction choosing it in command. 

I think the devs are just not concerned with cheating which is fair as it's a PvE game and there's no one really being cheated by doing this. All the player is doing is cheating themselves, and some people have fun this way so who are they to tell people how they are able to enjoy themselves. 

The only lunar I'm more tempted to take is focused convergence because it feels like it takes damn forever to charge the teleporter.
                >I've gotten practically full crit on stage 1 as flurry huntress but had literally not one decent green damage item other than a shuriken which illustrates fairly well that even getting full crit on huntress isn't a guaranteed win if you don't have other damage items to balance it off with. Honestly, no greater joy than opening up a chest and getting pocket icbm on Engi. Probably wouldn't have the same satisfaction choosing it in command. 

Yeah, command runs get stale pretty quickly. I had my full command period, it stops being fun pretty fast. It's much better when you break the game in a legit run rather than sandboxing with artifacts

>I think the devs are just not concerned with cheating which is fair as it's a PvE game and there's no one really being cheated by doing this. All the player is doing is cheating themselves, and some people have fun this way so who are they to tell people how they are able to enjoy themselves. 

Sure thing! I think that was the right call too. I just wouldn't include "you can break lunars by cheating in infinite coins" as one of the reasons why lunars "feel cheaty" even when used properly. Damn, I truly hope that people who only play command+1mil coins will one day rediscover the amazing experience that RoR2 provides when you have to build your character by challening the game's fair rng.

>The only lunar I'm more tempted to take is focused convergence because it feels like it takes damn forever to charge the teleporter.

Have fun with soul and design pillars 🥲 
Yeah focused convergence feels more like a QoL improvement rather than a broken item. Doesn't deserve the lunar discrimination!

I would also love to experience the power of a good Gesture build (which is quite potent if done properly, but the same can be said of builds which don't require lunars, like a working FMP build), it must be so fun to melt everything with the Capacitor. Purity is a very interesting lunar too - it's strong on the right character, but it *will* destroy any proc based build.

Even Race explicitly said that Purity and Benthic Bloom should be swapped (the Bloom should be a lunar, and Purity the void twin of the Clover)! He would definetely use it if it wasn't a Lunar. It's so sad to play with a narrower loot pool to preserve the fairness of the runs!
            Eulogy Zero
                That may unironically be the way. I'll consider picking up only 1 euology per run from bazaars
    Using lunar items once you have a firm grasp on the game's mechanics is fine, but many players will abuse them before they know how everything else in the game works which can actually make getting better at the game more difficult as there's ideas and muscle memory that has to be undone when not using lunar items. 

Of course, getting better isn't every player's goal. If some players want to cheat in lunar coins and use lunar items in lieu of spending time learning the game's mechanics, that's perfectly fine. It's just how those specific players have fun.
My favorite "easy" build is what I call the Tempest Medusa build:

Crowbars

Glasses

Energy Cells

Soulbound Catalyst (optional, but v useful)

Gesture of the Drowned

Royal Capacitor

My gaze become death, destroyer of Petrichor V
My way of doing things doesn't work for everyone so this is purely subjective and up to personal player preference. This is just what worked for me so it may not work for you. It's by no means definitive and objectively the best way to do things, as we all have different play styles.

If you haven't done my Risk of Rain 2 survey, you can do it [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/T8QYY6W)
    What do you do with the data from the survey if you don't mind me asking?
        Just personal data to see more info about the people who play risk of rain. I don't sell it or anything
            If you have enough responses would that be something you’d ever be interested in sharing here?
                [Here's](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-GGKZLl1BOiQvdFo7yT8nHQ_3D_3D) the survey data so far
An important tip for Vagrants is that you can hide behind the teleporter prongs when there's nothing else to hide behind.
You can also proc bands on commando with default m2 or alternate m2 and one atg
    Not two atgs?
        ATGs do total damage, which means that they scale off of the damage of the hit that procs them. Commandos default and alternate m2 deal 300% and 200% damage respectively, so the ATG missile will do 900% and 600% respectively, which will proc bands.

[Relevant wiki page](https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Damage#'Base'_vs._'Total'_Damagehttps://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Damage#'Base'_vs._'Total'_Damage) if you're interested in reading more.
            Oh okay thank you. I used grenades for commandos eclipse climb so didn't have many issues procing bands
I find the teleporters purely by proximity sound. You can actually hear it from rather far away as it blends into the music. And it gets louder the closer you are.
Oh sweet thank you! Uninstalling the game rn!
Very good guide, k would also add that stage 4 ALWAYS has a legendary chest (or a somewhat secret boss, if you are on siren's call)
    I remember playing with a viewer and I hear in the background, "daddy did you tell her about the secret red chest?" It was adorable that this father played ror with his 7 yr old son 🩷
Thanks a lot for the tips! Most of my runs end due to brass contraptions at high stages, I had no idea it was that easy to avoid them. And I also didn’t know I could skip mithrixs’ 4th phase. Thanks alot for the tips!
    No problem :) and same honestly. Especially overloading brass contraptions
This is fantastic. I struggle so much with monsoon, but I can’t seem to improve no matter what I do. This is so helpful to see the items instead of just a list of names that I can’t remember. I’ve looked up guides online, but it only does so much when I can’t remember what most items do half the time. You’re an absolute queen for this, thank you
    Yay! I'm glad to be helpful :)
nice. now do e16
    No interest. The modifiers are dumb
        hey my friend made it, it's a bit rude calling it dumb
            I think they should have talked to eclipse players before making the modifiers because no actual eclipse players play it - one of the modifiers being that some chests simply are empty is straight up dumb. If you grind up the gold to buy a chest, you should get something from it
                idk I was playing lotsa Isaac lately and many chests might as well be empty loool
                    why, it is stupid, eclipse is supposed to be punishing, not unfairly difficult
                        what's the difference?
                            punishing is for your mishaps, unfair is something detrimental happening that is fully out of your control, you can stop the curse by trying to avoid damage, making it skill based, but you cant avoid empty chests
                                decreased money gain is something that you control?
                                    you dont control it but its consistent, no random chance, you still need to be good, dont get me wrong, but good players arent rewarded almost purely on skill
I didn't know about image 6 and 14, thanks you so much
    Yay!
My biggest issue rn is that I enjoy multiplayer but finding anyone to help me do the eclipse grind is hard, since everyone is either 8 or 1. Do you have any tips for the grind? Bc I really can’t bring myself to start E, even if I’d like to play e8.
    Honestly I had more incentive to do it since I streamed and all of the bigger ror streamers did it on e8 so I wanted to be part of the community (still wasn't accepted even after completing it 🙃) 

Feel free to join my [discord](http://katishii.com/discord) if you want to play. I like doing the lower eclipse w people if you're not a loot goblin.
        How do you mean “Still wasn’t accepted”? The Reddit squad seems real happy to see you whenever you give E8 tips. Is it just because of the “other” streams? Bc that would be stupid.
            As a side note: do you do all the art yourself?
                Which art? I just design it but I do have adorable risk of rain 2 [emotes](https://imgur.com/a/G5vvQHc) which I commissioned from an actual artist. I love designing these guides and being helpful in general though. 

Honestly, Reddit's appreciation and acceptance of me is really encouraging and makes my day. A lot of the other Risk of rain 2 E8 streamers and their viewers don't like me for some reason and I just have to accept that most of the time there's no valid rationale for it. Maybe it is because I'm a woman or I'm autistic, or maybe they see me as "competition", overall, it's ridiculous that the only female exclusively risk of rain 2 streamer feels bullied by the community of a game she clearly loves. 

Honestly, I know I do things differently and better than they do. I actually play with viewers and help them on their eclipse grind, I allow any type of conversation and don't consider any sort of mention of their content as "self promo". I don't see people as competition and try to be supportive of other small creators and streamers. 

But the support I get here goes a long way for me.
Neat guide!

Not sure if you care to mention that Commando can proc bands with Phase Round if it pierces one enemy, or that Engie's ATGs can proc bands with 1 via any proc chain (obviously -- yeah, neither are consistent, so might not be the most pertinent for an overview type guide). 

One thing I've never understood is, do crits count for damage thresholds? Like if you crit with 1 atg, would it proc a band?

(Also, is that a typo on slide 14? I'm not sure if "You have to line-of-sight" is meant to be "You have to *break* line-of-sight"?)
    It doesn't on PC, but current console version is broken as all hell, so crits do count on console.
    Crits do not affect band procs
These are great, thank you!
    Thank you :)
Out of curiosity, what's your stance on transcendence as a whole? Do you think it's worth losing the 1 shot protection and the heal delay?
    it can be a lot easier to not get hit for 10 seconds than to try to regen to full depending on your healing, i'd advise playing as though one shot protection (aka OSP) does not exist

the extra max health is incredible also

for eclipse it negates e1 3 5 and a little bit of 8
        Thank you egg. If there's any suggestions or edits you think I should make for my guide let me know. I've already edited it a bit from this current version so far which I compiled into a giant PDF taking into considerations all the feed back I received thus far. Hope you're doing well and thriving.
            there's nothing major i'd change, but i think 1 minunte/item isn't really something you can control usually, but a focus on efficient full looting is a tip that's easier to apply imo

otherwise it's useful

and yea i'm doing alright, i hope you are as well
    I play E8 so I pretty much never have one shot protection. What sucks about transcendence is that the power elixirs don't protect your watches since you don't have health, so instead of going below health and consuming your power elixir, your watches just break which sucks. 

Transcendence is a pretty solid item; I don't use it because I don't use lunar items at all but if I did, I would probably rank it as one of the better ones. It's also a fall damage cancel which is nice for those who main mobility disinclined survivors (a moment of silence for engi mobility).
Defensive items like tougher times do not have diminishing returns. If you stack tougher times, rose buckler, and infusions plus a few multipliers like aegis and the lunar you will get a logarithmic increase in effective hp per item. While this only works well on agile builds it does scale faster than simulacrum damage does. 

Safer spaces block rate is variable depending on the number of attacks you take. Tougher times easily passes it at just a few attacks per second.
    [This](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/riskofrain2_gamepedia_en/images/f/f4/Graph_tougher_times.png/revision/latest?cb=20200201131258) chart shows that tougher times does have diminishing returns on each stack. I play Eclipse 8 so the goal is not to get hit and as you get better at the game, you tend to get hit less so safer spaces is way better. The guarantee to block damage is way better than the chance to block damage.
        That chart just shows it going towards 100% damage reduction which is only 1 of sources of effective hp. I've got an excel sheet showing the per item scaling in theory crafting on discord. You can get 6x raw hp scaling with aegis and lunar, 90%+ block, and 90%+ DR. Which is a 600x multiplier on EHP. 

A while back I had a sheet with it compared to monster lvl scaling with the number of items to keep out scaling them. 

It's mostly relevant for sim since it's the only mode that scales up much.
            Bro, Shes just talking about tougher times by itself. It will provide a smaller benefit each time you pick it up, unlike other items like lens maker glasses which will add a flat 10% crit every time. Thats literally the definition of diminishing returns
                It's not though. I have the math to prove it in theory crafting. It's a logarithmic increase in value per item when you stack all sources of EHP.
                Even the math on only tougher times is linear and has a slope of 0.15. Which means it has a very slightly increasing value per item.

Edit linear slope 0
                    Tougher times stacking is hyperbolic, not linear. Never speak again.
                        The block % but not the benefit. If you have 99.9% damage reduction it only takes 0.05% to double your effective HP. This is simple tank theory crafting. People been doing these calcs since EverQuest.
                            "effective hp"
                                Widely used term to compare yourself to raw numbers coming in which you can look up for every npc.
                                    sorry, but teddys arent npcs
                    How does Tougher Times block chance have a linear slope? If I pick up 7 tougher times (7 * 0.15 * 100% = 105%), I don’t have 100% block.

You can’t just take the item description at face value bc the game calculates it differently. Looking at [the wiki](https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Tougher_Times), it appears to be (0.15x / (0.15x + 1)) where x is the number of Tougher Times in possession. There’s no way that this is a linear function, and would seem to indicate that the value of each additional Tougher Times brings decreases as you collect more
                        The more damage reduction you have the less it takes to increase it % wise. 99.9% Dr only takes 0.05% to double your EHP. 200m hit at 99.9% DR is 200k at 99.95% it's 100k. Simple tank theory crafting that is anything but new. 

Just plot the EHP per item and calc the slope in excel. It's 0.15

Edit it's a linear increase with a slope 0 had an error in mine.
    OK, so I understand what you are saying now. You worded it a little poorly, but what you mean is that tougher times don't diminish in how much they increase your survability, right?
        Just by itself it's linear. If you stack from multiple sources like everything else in this game it becomes logarithmic. 

HP /(1-block%) /(1-armor%)

Can multiply that by wungus healing per second to figure out how much raw damage you take per second.
A couple criticisms I have:

I generally adhere to around 5-ish minutes per stage for the first three stages, after which I do my best to full loot while not wasting time. Stage 4 is weird in that if you’re not confident that you can kill AWU or grind the free legendary chest it’s probably not worth it.

The particles for the teleporter are orange, not white, and they’re very difficult to see on scorched acres.

I usually don’t open equipment barrels first on early stages cause half the time you get an equipment that’s literally useless.

Diversifying damage is ok, but focus crystal and crowbars are only good on certain survivors, so it’s better to either get something else from a multi shop or scrap them.

Fireworks are basically useless outside of a few specific scenarios. Just scrap them.

For abandoned aqueduct you can also roll the pots onto the buttons, although they are quite finicky (just ask woolie).

Commando’s frag grenades are ass, never use them.

Energy drinks are generally better on everyone because you should always be sprinting after every action. Goat hooves used to be better than drinks numerically but drinks got buffed.
    If you fully loot and get a solid build going in the first two stages, you'll go through the subsequent stages much quicker and with less difficulty than if you rush the teleporter and are struggling to kill enemies & stay alive because you're lacking in items. 

I honestly watched Woolie go through so many runs, resisting the urge to backseat and he most likely would have survived if he just looted more. But I tend to play more item dependent characters like Engi or who really benefits from having more items and can benefit from literally anything and everything. 

The [particles](https://images.app.goo.gl/LDr3CLUbC3RKyzba7) are red-ish, white-ish, orangish in color. As a new player, I swore to god the teleporter didn't spawn that run on scorched acres because I had such problems finding it. 

If you open equipment barrels first, you exhaust all options of getting a credit card; if you do open equipment barrels first, there's a chance of getting a credit card and you can get two more items than you normally would get which is a pretty sweet deal. 

Yeah -- obviously crowbars and focus crystals aren't ideal for huntress or engi but it's still good to keep in mind because damage items still stack multiplicatively [source](https://youtu.be/7MTKPm1f8WM) 

Fireworks can be pretty useful honestly - you're constantly interacting with things and killing enemies while you do so which is good for annoying mobs. On Multitudes difficulty, fireworks are especially good because there's so many more enemies to deal with but also more chests, so it's helpful clearing them out.

Yeah, I forgot to include that other survivors have to actually roll  pots. Thought that saying both pressure plates needed to be pushed assumed the player knew they would have to roll the pots on it. Will include that in a new edit.  

Grenade commando not bad when you learn how to aim the grenades which I've gotten decent at for procing bands.
        particles are red, but the bloom makes them appear white in the centre, so half right, makes it an easier to follow tip so its good
    I am a fireworks stan and here’s why: 
They are very useful early game (arguably the most important time to progress through efficiently) as they increase your looting efficiency by passively killing enemies (earning money) while you move to the next purchase.
They are perfectly scrap-able in the late game (not useful on Mithrix obviously) and when you’re looping, you’re likely already strong enough that you don’t need to loot as efficiently as in the early game.

People trash on items that are useful only in the early game, but I think it might be shortsighted to do so. The early game is very important to stay not behind curve, and once their use has expired during the late game, you have an excellent source of scrap to fund your late game items!
        Fireworks is amazing honestly and especially on characters I struggle with. How can you scrap the ability to kill enemies upon opening an intractable, especially in the early game? It kills enemies, and gives you money on kill.
    crowbar will (on paper) increase 10% of your attacks by 75% dmg each, that's pretty good
        They’re not bad but they don’t really get much use out of characters that aren’t good at one shotting
Fantastic as usual, these guides are great!

On the one item per minute rule, I'd add that generally earlier on you will likely get less than this, but can pretty easily exceed it later in a run.

Furthermore, you should always try and get the entire map, as each stage will also boost enemies, so having 30 items when on stage 3 and 30 minutes in is better than having 30 items on stage 6, but being only 25 minutes in.

Speed can also be more situational than just do you sprint or not, and can generally come down to personal preference. Being able to move faster even on characters who want to be attacking alot can be nice.

I'd also remove infusion and add Topas brooch on fmp build.
It pains me that you didnt even address the concept of attack speed x proc based items. You can go a long way with tritip daggers and ATGs plus attack speed.
    I addressed that in my engineer guide
btw you forgot ghorp tome on fmp, overall nice stuff you have posted here 👍
These are useful.

Except 10. I respect the council’s decision but I choose to ignore it 😜
Lol, was thinking step 1 was unistall and completely give up. It's impossible
I personally prefer tougher times over safer spaces unless I have 20+ stacks to transfer. Also what’s your twitch, I’m still learning the game.

If you want to just have a lot of pain in your next few runs pick both the artifact that makes it so one type of enemy spawns then pick the one that makes all enemies fully randomized you can get lucky with beetles or get destroyed by the dam "mini gunner clay man"(forgot name) or get owned by crab and last but not least the lesser wisps will doom you early game.
Now I just need updated Risk of Rain 2 console content! 

This is just a joke, I know they're working on it, and I also have a PC that I could play it on if I really wanted to. Just waiting for it so I can play it with a friend who only has it on Xbox.
    Wish I could help you there with it. Console be rough. Rip the console homies
Do drones go toward director credits?
    Yep they do. Drones, shrines, etc. Void seed takes up a lot of credits too.
best guide ever. Thank you so much for this!!
As a female streamer of this game exclusively on Twitch, I do not feel accepted or supported by the community in the slightest. I quite frankly feel bullied so it's really encouraging that the risk of rain Reddit community has been so supportive and appreciative of the content I post, so thank you very much.
    I’m sorry to hear about your experience on Twitch. I’m not much of a Twitch person, but yeah there’s more to the RoR2 community than just on that site. 

The Reddit squad is a quirky bunch that flips between dunking on artifact-enjoyers or calling them based whenever they post about getting achievements/unlocks haha

In any case, I’m glad you found support here, and in addition I’ve personally have very much enjoyed your posts!!

On to a game question… what is your opinion on Mountain Shrine (or as my friends like to call them, GaMeR Shrines lol) usage on E8 runs?
        Yeah the risk of rain 2 community has been wonderful to me so far. I was surprised by the amount of support I got from the few instances of sexism I've experienced on here (it wasn't a lot but a few people have told me I was only posting here to get subscribers on my other site which is clearly not true as I don't have a link to my other site on this Reddit account and clearly have a passion for the game as can be seen by the effort I put into the content I post here)

I used to use an infinite mountain shrine mod but at some point felt it was a little cheating because of how op you get on stage 4 and how many more items you'll get. There's probably never a time where I won't hit a mountain shrine, hell I've hit two or three mountain shrines with engi on stage 1 or 2 and the rationale is basically, might as well, if I don't survive then I haven't invested much anyways but the payout may be worth it. 

If you can't handle the mountain shrine, you were probably going to die anyways is my thought process so I'll always do them no matter how underpowered I am. Just hope it's not beetle queen
            Yeah I’m very glad that your experience here has been a positive one :) 

But yeah I also spam Mountain Shrines on sight, probably to my own detriment more often than not haha Like if I hit 2 of them Stage 1, the amount of time it would take for me to clear it makes the run way harder to maintain overall by basically starting behind the curve. Their value tho with a good green drop could be huge, especially in multiplayer.

And that makes a lot of sense, early game there’s not that much investment so if you make it, sweet, and if not, well it’s not that big of a deal to restart. But later on, you’re much stronger and the difficulty jump from a MS hit is much smaller.

That said, the question whenever one appears is always, “Well we ARE gamers, aren’t we?” Hahaha outside of value vs detriment, I think they’re just plain fun and a pretty well-made mechanic at that!
            I hate the mountain golem thing the laser sucks
    Yeah I've known two women who tried streaming.  They were almost immediately driven away by the gaming community as a whole.  Sounds vile and unpleasant.
    Keep doing what you are doing. There will sadly always be haters, let them yell into the void. You're doing great and it shows, be proud of yourself because you deserve it. Focus on the things that go well even if that sometimes can be difficult.
    Do you have a YT channel where you drop vods and stuff? I know watching vods don't really help, but I'm starved for Risk of Rain content creators.
        Only on  [twitch](http://twitch.tv/katarinaishii) atm but I want to work on YouTube
            Ay thanks for the link. I hope your endeavor is a succesful one!
    I'm sorry to hear that.  Another L for the gaming community.  I wonder what steps need to be taken to change this sort of thing.
Thank you. Woman* haha

Yeah honestly I stopped using lunars after watching one of his videos about how to improve at risk of rain 2 and haven't looked back since. 

Now that I've completed eclipse 8 on each character, have 245 e8 wins for this year alone, I'll get lunars to gamble on a cleansing pool for the next stage but not usually for any actual use value. Never actually tried the tonic / gesture power combo either. 

Someone tried to make the argument that getting atgs and pocket is OP so how is this not considered cheating either. The difference is that you can't ever guarantee getting an atg or a pocket -- hell, I had a clover and pocket, with no atg (sad face) and literally looped till I got an atg, and finally as my last chest I opened up on sky meadow second loop was an atg. 

1) You can edit your lunar coins 
2) you can get 5 lunars in between each stage
3) you can infinitely reroll as many times as you've edited till you get what you want
    Oh sorry, I kind of use "man" as a nonbinary "dude" ahah. 

I agree on your second paragraph, finding enough pockets/ATGs is very rare and usually a good run emerges from a fair mix of luck and inventory management rather than brutally yeeting a bunch of lunars into a shop. Even finding an ATG printer doesn't guarantee you the win if some greens are carrying your run (quail&feathers for movement, shurikens for proccing bands...) and you mindlessly throw everything into the printer; you must have scrapped the right items in advance. Besides, it feels like winning the lottery when you luck out and actually get a legit ("legit") broken build! Artifact of command completely deletes the joy of these moments.

Regarding lunars, yeah, if you do edit in infinite coins that *definetely* is cheating on my book and completely breaks the game, lmao. You just hit the newt and spend 3k coins getting 5 shaped glasses at round 1. But, even though devs decided to leave the freedom to players and not patch out the lunar coin exploit, infinite coins is definetely an unintended mechanic. I think that lunars get *far* more reasonable if coins are collected legit: if you consistently hit the newt and pick the next stage, it's not rare to spend ~9 lunars per run, which almost negate the ones you get from winning. Considering that it's not that rare to get unlucky with the newt shop (realistically, almost all lunars are good, but only a couple of them are actually broken), if you start heavily rerolling items the coin usage quickly skyrockets: even Race at his peak (about 4k lunars obtained legit, if I remember correctly?), with an absurd amount of playtime and winrate, could have probably afforded at most a dozen wins bruteforced through exploiting lunars.

What I'm trying to say is: if you make use of lunars as intended by the devs and do not cheat, actually abusing them is unsustainable. You'll realistically end up picking up one of them, maybe two, once in a while: which still makes them very powerful and easy to access, but probably not broken on a COMPLETELY different order of magnitude than, say, void items (which are a very accessible source of void bears, plimps, lutes). 

I still haven't used a single lunar in my eclipse games so far, but I'm considering betraying papa Race's religion and picking up a Purity or a Gesture once in a while, to fix a ridiculously unlucky run instead of throwing it. Besides, they're *fun* items which allow for very unique builds, and it's quite sad to ditch them all in the trash because of how easy to find they are. I'd rather find a way to smoothly implement them into the runs instead - which the scarcity of coins almost already provides.
        I'm from Cali so I understand. We all refer to each other as "dude" regardless of gender haha. I only correct people because this game is heavily male dominated so I like to let people know that women in the community exist. 

I've gotten practically full crit on stage 1 as flurry huntress but had literally not one decent green damage item other than a shuriken which illustrates fairly well that even getting full crit on huntress isn't a guaranteed win if you don't have other damage items to balance it off with. Honestly, no greater joy than opening up a chest and getting pocket icbm on Engi. Probably wouldn't have the same satisfaction choosing it in command. 

I think the devs are just not concerned with cheating which is fair as it's a PvE game and there's no one really being cheated by doing this. All the player is doing is cheating themselves, and some people have fun this way so who are they to tell people how they are able to enjoy themselves. 

The only lunar I'm more tempted to take is focused convergence because it feels like it takes damn forever to charge the teleporter.
            >I've gotten practically full crit on stage 1 as flurry huntress but had literally not one decent green damage item other than a shuriken which illustrates fairly well that even getting full crit on huntress isn't a guaranteed win if you don't have other damage items to balance it off with. Honestly, no greater joy than opening up a chest and getting pocket icbm on Engi. Probably wouldn't have the same satisfaction choosing it in command. 

Yeah, command runs get stale pretty quickly. I had my full command period, it stops being fun pretty fast. It's much better when you break the game in a legit run rather than sandboxing with artifacts

>I think the devs are just not concerned with cheating which is fair as it's a PvE game and there's no one really being cheated by doing this. All the player is doing is cheating themselves, and some people have fun this way so who are they to tell people how they are able to enjoy themselves. 

Sure thing! I think that was the right call too. I just wouldn't include "you can break lunars by cheating in infinite coins" as one of the reasons why lunars "feel cheaty" even when used properly. Damn, I truly hope that people who only play command+1mil coins will one day rediscover the amazing experience that RoR2 provides when you have to build your character by challening the game's fair rng.

>The only lunar I'm more tempted to take is focused convergence because it feels like it takes damn forever to charge the teleporter.

Have fun with soul and design pillars 🥲 
Yeah focused convergence feels more like a QoL improvement rather than a broken item. Doesn't deserve the lunar discrimination!

I would also love to experience the power of a good Gesture build (which is quite potent if done properly, but the same can be said of builds which don't require lunars, like a working FMP build), it must be so fun to melt everything with the Capacitor. Purity is a very interesting lunar too - it's strong on the right character, but it *will* destroy any proc based build.

Even Race explicitly said that Purity and Benthic Bloom should be swapped (the Bloom should be a lunar, and Purity the void twin of the Clover)! He would definetely use it if it wasn't a Lunar. It's so sad to play with a narrower loot pool to preserve the fairness of the runs!
        Eulogy Zero
            That may unironically be the way. I'll consider picking up only 1 euology per run from bazaars
Using lunar items once you have a firm grasp on the game's mechanics is fine, but many players will abuse them before they know how everything else in the game works which can actually make getting better at the game more difficult as there's ideas and muscle memory that has to be undone when not using lunar items. 

Of course, getting better isn't every player's goal. If some players want to cheat in lunar coins and use lunar items in lieu of spending time learning the game's mechanics, that's perfectly fine. It's just how those specific players have fun.
What do you do with the data from the survey if you don't mind me asking?
    Just personal data to see more info about the people who play risk of rain. I don't sell it or anything
        If you have enough responses would that be something you’d ever be interested in sharing here?
            [Here's](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-GGKZLl1BOiQvdFo7yT8nHQ_3D_3D) the survey data so far
Not two atgs?
    ATGs do total damage, which means that they scale off of the damage of the hit that procs them. Commandos default and alternate m2 deal 300% and 200% damage respectively, so the ATG missile will do 900% and 600% respectively, which will proc bands.

[Relevant wiki page](https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Damage#'Base'_vs._'Total'_Damagehttps://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Damage#'Base'_vs._'Total'_Damage) if you're interested in reading more.
        Oh okay thank you. I used grenades for commandos eclipse climb so didn't have many issues procing bands
I remember playing with a viewer and I hear in the background, "daddy did you tell her about the secret red chest?" It was adorable that this father played ror with his 7 yr old son 🩷
No problem :) and same honestly. Especially overloading brass contraptions
Yay! I'm glad to be helpful :)
No interest. The modifiers are dumb
    hey my friend made it, it's a bit rude calling it dumb
        I think they should have talked to eclipse players before making the modifiers because no actual eclipse players play it - one of the modifiers being that some chests simply are empty is straight up dumb. If you grind up the gold to buy a chest, you should get something from it
            idk I was playing lotsa Isaac lately and many chests might as well be empty loool
                why, it is stupid, eclipse is supposed to be punishing, not unfairly difficult
                    what's the difference?
                        punishing is for your mishaps, unfair is something detrimental happening that is fully out of your control, you can stop the curse by trying to avoid damage, making it skill based, but you cant avoid empty chests
                            decreased money gain is something that you control?
                                you dont control it but its consistent, no random chance, you still need to be good, dont get me wrong, but good players arent rewarded almost purely on skill
Yay!
Honestly I had more incentive to do it since I streamed and all of the bigger ror streamers did it on e8 so I wanted to be part of the community (still wasn't accepted even after completing it 🙃) 

Feel free to join my [discord](http://katishii.com/discord) if you want to play. I like doing the lower eclipse w people if you're not a loot goblin.
    How do you mean “Still wasn’t accepted”? The Reddit squad seems real happy to see you whenever you give E8 tips. Is it just because of the “other” streams? Bc that would be stupid.
        As a side note: do you do all the art yourself?
            Which art? I just design it but I do have adorable risk of rain 2 [emotes](https://imgur.com/a/G5vvQHc) which I commissioned from an actual artist. I love designing these guides and being helpful in general though. 

Honestly, Reddit's appreciation and acceptance of me is really encouraging and makes my day. A lot of the other Risk of rain 2 E8 streamers and their viewers don't like me for some reason and I just have to accept that most of the time there's no valid rationale for it. Maybe it is because I'm a woman or I'm autistic, or maybe they see me as "competition", overall, it's ridiculous that the only female exclusively risk of rain 2 streamer feels bullied by the community of a game she clearly loves. 

Honestly, I know I do things differently and better than they do. I actually play with viewers and help them on their eclipse grind, I allow any type of conversation and don't consider any sort of mention of their content as "self promo". I don't see people as competition and try to be supportive of other small creators and streamers. 

But the support I get here goes a long way for me.
It doesn't on PC, but current console version is broken as all hell, so crits do count on console.
Crits do not affect band procs
Thank you :)
it can be a lot easier to not get hit for 10 seconds than to try to regen to full depending on your healing, i'd advise playing as though one shot protection (aka OSP) does not exist

the extra max health is incredible also

for eclipse it negates e1 3 5 and a little bit of 8
    Thank you egg. If there's any suggestions or edits you think I should make for my guide let me know. I've already edited it a bit from this current version so far which I compiled into a giant PDF taking into considerations all the feed back I received thus far. Hope you're doing well and thriving.
        there's nothing major i'd change, but i think 1 minunte/item isn't really something you can control usually, but a focus on efficient full looting is a tip that's easier to apply imo

otherwise it's useful

and yea i'm doing alright, i hope you are as well
I play E8 so I pretty much never have one shot protection. What sucks about transcendence is that the power elixirs don't protect your watches since you don't have health, so instead of going below health and consuming your power elixir, your watches just break which sucks. 

Transcendence is a pretty solid item; I don't use it because I don't use lunar items at all but if I did, I would probably rank it as one of the better ones. It's also a fall damage cancel which is nice for those who main mobility disinclined survivors (a moment of silence for engi mobility).
[This](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/riskofrain2_gamepedia_en/images/f/f4/Graph_tougher_times.png/revision/latest?cb=20200201131258) chart shows that tougher times does have diminishing returns on each stack. I play Eclipse 8 so the goal is not to get hit and as you get better at the game, you tend to get hit less so safer spaces is way better. The guarantee to block damage is way better than the chance to block damage.
    That chart just shows it going towards 100% damage reduction which is only 1 of sources of effective hp. I've got an excel sheet showing the per item scaling in theory crafting on discord. You can get 6x raw hp scaling with aegis and lunar, 90%+ block, and 90%+ DR. Which is a 600x multiplier on EHP. 

A while back I had a sheet with it compared to monster lvl scaling with the number of items to keep out scaling them. 

It's mostly relevant for sim since it's the only mode that scales up much.
        Bro, Shes just talking about tougher times by itself. It will provide a smaller benefit each time you pick it up, unlike other items like lens maker glasses which will add a flat 10% crit every time. Thats literally the definition of diminishing returns
            It's not though. I have the math to prove it in theory crafting. It's a logarithmic increase in value per item when you stack all sources of EHP.
            Even the math on only tougher times is linear and has a slope of 0.15. Which means it has a very slightly increasing value per item.

Edit linear slope 0
                Tougher times stacking is hyperbolic, not linear. Never speak again.
                    The block % but not the benefit. If you have 99.9% damage reduction it only takes 0.05% to double your effective HP. This is simple tank theory crafting. People been doing these calcs since EverQuest.
                        "effective hp"
                            Widely used term to compare yourself to raw numbers coming in which you can look up for every npc.
                                sorry, but teddys arent npcs
                How does Tougher Times block chance have a linear slope? If I pick up 7 tougher times (7 * 0.15 * 100% = 105%), I don’t have 100% block.

You can’t just take the item description at face value bc the game calculates it differently. Looking at [the wiki](https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Tougher_Times), it appears to be (0.15x / (0.15x + 1)) where x is the number of Tougher Times in possession. There’s no way that this is a linear function, and would seem to indicate that the value of each additional Tougher Times brings decreases as you collect more
                    The more damage reduction you have the less it takes to increase it % wise. 99.9% Dr only takes 0.05% to double your EHP. 200m hit at 99.9% DR is 200k at 99.95% it's 100k. Simple tank theory crafting that is anything but new. 

Just plot the EHP per item and calc the slope in excel. It's 0.15

Edit it's a linear increase with a slope 0 had an error in mine.
OK, so I understand what you are saying now. You worded it a little poorly, but what you mean is that tougher times don't diminish in how much they increase your survability, right?
    Just by itself it's linear. If you stack from multiple sources like everything else in this game it becomes logarithmic. 

HP /(1-block%) /(1-armor%)

Can multiply that by wungus healing per second to figure out how much raw damage you take per second.
If you fully loot and get a solid build going in the first two stages, you'll go through the subsequent stages much quicker and with less difficulty than if you rush the teleporter and are struggling to kill enemies & stay alive because you're lacking in items. 

I honestly watched Woolie go through so many runs, resisting the urge to backseat and he most likely would have survived if he just looted more. But I tend to play more item dependent characters like Engi or who really benefits from having more items and can benefit from literally anything and everything. 

The [particles](https://images.app.goo.gl/LDr3CLUbC3RKyzba7) are red-ish, white-ish, orangish in color. As a new player, I swore to god the teleporter didn't spawn that run on scorched acres because I had such problems finding it. 

If you open equipment barrels first, you exhaust all options of getting a credit card; if you do open equipment barrels first, there's a chance of getting a credit card and you can get two more items than you normally would get which is a pretty sweet deal. 

Yeah -- obviously crowbars and focus crystals aren't ideal for huntress or engi but it's still good to keep in mind because damage items still stack multiplicatively [source](https://youtu.be/7MTKPm1f8WM) 

Fireworks can be pretty useful honestly - you're constantly interacting with things and killing enemies while you do so which is good for annoying mobs. On Multitudes difficulty, fireworks are especially good because there's so many more enemies to deal with but also more chests, so it's helpful clearing them out.

Yeah, I forgot to include that other survivors have to actually roll  pots. Thought that saying both pressure plates needed to be pushed assumed the player knew they would have to roll the pots on it. Will include that in a new edit.  

Grenade commando not bad when you learn how to aim the grenades which I've gotten decent at for procing bands.
    particles are red, but the bloom makes them appear white in the centre, so half right, makes it an easier to follow tip so its good
I am a fireworks stan and here’s why: 
They are very useful early game (arguably the most important time to progress through efficiently) as they increase your looting efficiency by passively killing enemies (earning money) while you move to the next purchase.
They are perfectly scrap-able in the late game (not useful on Mithrix obviously) and when you’re looping, you’re likely already strong enough that you don’t need to loot as efficiently as in the early game.

People trash on items that are useful only in the early game, but I think it might be shortsighted to do so. The early game is very important to stay not behind curve, and once their use has expired during the late game, you have an excellent source of scrap to fund your late game items!
    Fireworks is amazing honestly and especially on characters I struggle with. How can you scrap the ability to kill enemies upon opening an intractable, especially in the early game? It kills enemies, and gives you money on kill.
crowbar will (on paper) increase 10% of your attacks by 75% dmg each, that's pretty good
    They’re not bad but they don’t really get much use out of characters that aren’t good at one shotting
I addressed that in my engineer guide

I've gotten practically full crit on stage 1 as flurry huntress but had literally not one decent green damage item other than a shuriken which illustrates fairly well that even getting full crit on huntress isn't a guaranteed win if you don't have other damage items to balance it off with. Honestly, no greater joy than opening up a chest and getting pocket icbm on Engi. Probably wouldn't have the same satisfaction choosing it in command. 

I think the devs are just not concerned with cheating which is fair as it's a PvE game and there's no one really being cheated by doing this. All the player is doing is cheating themselves, and some people have fun this way so who are they to tell people how they are able to enjoy themselves. 

The only lunar I'm more tempted to take is focused convergence because it feels like it takes damn forever to charge the teleporter.

Yeah, command runs get stale pretty quickly. I had my full command period, it stops being fun pretty fast. It's much better when you break the game in a legit run rather than sandboxing with artifacts

Sure thing! I think that was the right call too. I just wouldn't include "you can break lunars by cheating in infinite coins" as one of the reasons why lunars "feel cheaty" even when used properly. Damn, I truly hope that people who only play command+1mil coins will one day rediscover the amazing experience that RoR2 provides when you have to build your character by challening the game's fair rng.

>The only lunar I'm more tempted to take is focused convergence because it feels like it takes damn forever to charge the teleporter.

Have fun with soul and design pillars 🥲 
Yeah focused convergence feels more like a QoL improvement rather than a broken item. Doesn't deserve the lunar discrimination!

I would also love to experience the power of a good Gesture build (which is quite potent if done properly, but the same can be said of builds which don't require lunars, like a working FMP build), it must be so fun to melt everything with the Capacitor. Purity is a very interesting lunar too - it's strong on the right character, but it *will* destroy any proc based build.

Even Race explicitly said that Purity and Benthic Bloom should be swapped (the Bloom should be a lunar, and Purity the void twin of the Clover)! He would definetely use it if it wasn't a Lunar. It's so sad to play with a narrower loot pool to preserve the fairness of the runs!
    Eulogy Zero
        That may unironically be the way. I'll consider picking up only 1 euology per run from bazaars
Just personal data to see more info about the people who play risk of rain. I don't sell it or anything
    If you have enough responses would that be something you’d ever be interested in sharing here?
        [Here's](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-GGKZLl1BOiQvdFo7yT8nHQ_3D_3D) the survey data so far
ATGs do total damage, which means that they scale off of the damage of the hit that procs them. Commandos default and alternate m2 deal 300% and 200% damage respectively, so the ATG missile will do 900% and 600% respectively, which will proc bands.

[Relevant wiki page](https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Damage#'Base'_vs._'Total'_Damagehttps://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Damage#'Base'_vs._'Total'_Damage) if you're interested in reading more.
    Oh okay thank you. I used grenades for commandos eclipse climb so didn't have many issues procing bands
hey my friend made it, it's a bit rude calling it dumb
    I think they should have talked to eclipse players before making the modifiers because no actual eclipse players play it - one of the modifiers being that some chests simply are empty is straight up dumb. If you grind up the gold to buy a chest, you should get something from it
        idk I was playing lotsa Isaac lately and many chests might as well be empty loool
            why, it is stupid, eclipse is supposed to be punishing, not unfairly difficult
                what's the difference?
                    punishing is for your mishaps, unfair is something detrimental happening that is fully out of your control, you can stop the curse by trying to avoid damage, making it skill based, but you cant avoid empty chests
                        decreased money gain is something that you control?
                            you dont control it but its consistent, no random chance, you still need to be good, dont get me wrong, but good players arent rewarded almost purely on skill
How do you mean “Still wasn’t accepted”? The Reddit squad seems real happy to see you whenever you give E8 tips. Is it just because of the “other” streams? Bc that would be stupid.
    As a side note: do you do all the art yourself?
        Which art? I just design it but I do have adorable risk of rain 2 [emotes](https://imgur.com/a/G5vvQHc) which I commissioned from an actual artist. I love designing these guides and being helpful in general though. 

Honestly, Reddit's appreciation and acceptance of me is really encouraging and makes my day. A lot of the other Risk of rain 2 E8 streamers and their viewers don't like me for some reason and I just have to accept that most of the time there's no valid rationale for it. Maybe it is because I'm a woman or I'm autistic, or maybe they see me as "competition", overall, it's ridiculous that the only female exclusively risk of rain 2 streamer feels bullied by the community of a game she clearly loves. 

Honestly, I know I do things differently and better than they do. I actually play with viewers and help them on their eclipse grind, I allow any type of conversation and don't consider any sort of mention of their content as "self promo". I don't see people as competition and try to be supportive of other small creators and streamers. 

But the support I get here goes a long way for me.
Thank you egg. If there's any suggestions or edits you think I should make for my guide let me know. I've already edited it a bit from this current version so far which I compiled into a giant PDF taking into considerations all the feed back I received thus far. Hope you're doing well and thriving.
    there's nothing major i'd change, but i think 1 minunte/item isn't really something you can control usually, but a focus on efficient full looting is a tip that's easier to apply imo

otherwise it's useful

and yea i'm doing alright, i hope you are as well
That chart just shows it going towards 100% damage reduction which is only 1 of sources of effective hp. I've got an excel sheet showing the per item scaling in theory crafting on discord. You can get 6x raw hp scaling with aegis and lunar, 90%+ block, and 90%+ DR. Which is a 600x multiplier on EHP. 

A while back I had a sheet with it compared to monster lvl scaling with the number of items to keep out scaling them. 

It's mostly relevant for sim since it's the only mode that scales up much.
    Bro, Shes just talking about tougher times by itself. It will provide a smaller benefit each time you pick it up, unlike other items like lens maker glasses which will add a flat 10% crit every time. Thats literally the definition of diminishing returns
        It's not though. I have the math to prove it in theory crafting. It's a logarithmic increase in value per item when you stack all sources of EHP.
        Even the math on only tougher times is linear and has a slope of 0.15. Which means it has a very slightly increasing value per item.

Edit linear slope 0
            Tougher times stacking is hyperbolic, not linear. Never speak again.
                The block % but not the benefit. If you have 99.9% damage reduction it only takes 0.05% to double your effective HP. This is simple tank theory crafting. People been doing these calcs since EverQuest.
                    "effective hp"
                        Widely used term to compare yourself to raw numbers coming in which you can look up for every npc.
                            sorry, but teddys arent npcs
            How does Tougher Times block chance have a linear slope? If I pick up 7 tougher times (7 * 0.15 * 100% = 105%), I don’t have 100% block.

You can’t just take the item description at face value bc the game calculates it differently. Looking at [the wiki](https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Tougher_Times), it appears to be (0.15x / (0.15x + 1)) where x is the number of Tougher Times in possession. There’s no way that this is a linear function, and would seem to indicate that the value of each additional Tougher Times brings decreases as you collect more
                The more damage reduction you have the less it takes to increase it % wise. 99.9% Dr only takes 0.05% to double your EHP. 200m hit at 99.9% DR is 200k at 99.95% it's 100k. Simple tank theory crafting that is anything but new. 

Just plot the EHP per item and calc the slope in excel. It's 0.15

Edit it's a linear increase with a slope 0 had an error in mine.
Just by itself it's linear. If you stack from multiple sources like everything else in this game it becomes logarithmic. 

HP /(1-block%) /(1-armor%)

Can multiply that by wungus healing per second to figure out how much raw damage you take per second.
particles are red, but the bloom makes them appear white in the centre, so half right, makes it an easier to follow tip so its good
Fireworks is amazing honestly and especially on characters I struggle with. How can you scrap the ability to kill enemies upon opening an intractable, especially in the early game? It kills enemies, and gives you money on kill.
They’re not bad but they don’t really get much use out of characters that aren’t good at one shotting
Yeah the risk of rain 2 community has been wonderful to me so far. I was surprised by the amount of support I got from the few instances of sexism I've experienced on here (it wasn't a lot but a few people have told me I was only posting here to get subscribers on my other site which is clearly not true as I don't have a link to my other site on this Reddit account and clearly have a passion for the game as can be seen by the effort I put into the content I post here)

I used to use an infinite mountain shrine mod but at some point felt it was a little cheating because of how op you get on stage 4 and how many more items you'll get. There's probably never a time where I won't hit a mountain shrine, hell I've hit two or three mountain shrines with engi on stage 1 or 2 and the rationale is basically, might as well, if I don't survive then I haven't invested much anyways but the payout may be worth it. 

If you can't handle the mountain shrine, you were probably going to die anyways is my thought process so I'll always do them no matter how underpowered I am. Just hope it's not beetle queen
    Yeah I’m very glad that your experience here has been a positive one :) 

But yeah I also spam Mountain Shrines on sight, probably to my own detriment more often than not haha Like if I hit 2 of them Stage 1, the amount of time it would take for me to clear it makes the run way harder to maintain overall by basically starting behind the curve. Their value tho with a good green drop could be huge, especially in multiplayer.

And that makes a lot of sense, early game there’s not that much investment so if you make it, sweet, and if not, well it’s not that big of a deal to restart. But later on, you’re much stronger and the difficulty jump from a MS hit is much smaller.

That said, the question whenever one appears is always, “Well we ARE gamers, aren’t we?” Hahaha outside of value vs detriment, I think they’re just plain fun and a pretty well-made mechanic at that!
    I hate the mountain golem thing the laser sucks
Only on  [twitch](http://twitch.tv/katarinaishii) atm but I want to work on YouTube
    Ay thanks for the link. I hope your endeavor is a succesful one!

            you dont control it but its consistent, no random chance, you still need to be good, dont get me wrong, but good players arent rewarded almost purely on skill
The block % but not the benefit. If you have 99.9% damage reduction it only takes 0.05% to double your effective HP. This is simple tank theory crafting. People been doing these calcs since EverQuest.
    "effective hp"
        Widely used term to compare yourself to raw numbers coming in which you can look up for every npc.
            sorry, but teddys arent npcs
The more damage reduction you have the less it takes to increase it % wise. 99.9% Dr only takes 0.05% to double your EHP. 200m hit at 99.9% DR is 200k at 99.95% it's 100k. Simple tank theory crafting that is anything but new. 

Just plot the EHP per item and calc the slope in excel. It's 0.15

Edit it's a linear increase with a slope 0 had an error in mine.
