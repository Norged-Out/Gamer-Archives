[[Ah yes, the standard run]]





Imagine feeling so invincible then you die to a single lesser wisp
    malachite lesser wisp.

I've died way too many times to lesser wisps in general.
        My account I’ve used this entire time, has “lesser wisp” as the greatest enemy.

Maybe I should make a new account. It recorded every single game I played, so when I was messing with values a bit, I could play as any enemy. My damage done as overloading magma worm outclassed all my other characters by so much I don’t even see them in the pie chart.
            Lesser wisp greatest enemy gang
                Mine is Lemurian for some reason but lesser wisps are close behind on the pie chart
                    Same here.
                    I swear they are the silent killer, you never think of them until you're run is over
                        Captain is immune to them for the most part
                    Lemurians have apparently killed me twice as much as mythrix. Granted, I started playing about a month ago.

                Definitely a mod. I'm assuming they're taking advantage of the fact that all characters in the game are treated the same (i.e. players can be swapped out for enemies and vice-versa)
                    No. Not mod. You can just change a value before the game starts that dictates what body you play as.
                        Like, a config file?
                            Nah, cheat engine.
                                Lmao mod = cheat engine my dude, two words for the same thing
                                    Cheat engine isn’t a mod though. Cheat engine doesn’t modify the games code, like mods most people think of, for example the mod that just straight up adds a command to change your character to whatever modifies the game code, while using cheat engine doesn’t modify the games code, just changes runtime values. I can’t use cheat engine to add anything new to the game that isn’t already there. So sure, cheat engine can modify the game, but it’s not a mod. It’s an external program.
            Mine are lemurians xD
        As an artificer, this is daily life.

"Hm? Overloading worms? Crisis Vanguards? Shitloads of Stone Golems? No problem. Eight lesser wisps? OH SHIT FUCK HUNTRESS HELP COME SAVE ME"
            huntress? why not call bandit gang
        Malachite. Just malachite
            Transcendence is great against malachites, i suggest trying it at least once (unless if you're rex)
        Don't remind me of the horror of old OSP malachite wisps
    Artefact of glass (or just a few shaped glass) + lesser wisp. Name a more iconic duo
Killed by: Brass Contraption
    captain mains reading this and not understanding
    I don't think I've ever died to a brass contraption. The projectiles are just too slow and easy to avoid.
        You're out there choosing which void Item you'll be taking and die thinking that 123 hp meant you were safe for at least a hit
            “Please let this be enough to survive one hit”

“With the Rix? No way! [extremely loud Mithrix hammer impact sound]”
            Yeah they do a lot of damage I just seem to be lucky and basically never get hit by em.
Me getting succed by some scavenger surrounded by elite lesser wisps
It either ends up being that or thinking you can take Mithrix two hours into the run. Both end the same though.
"You were killed by: the planet"
My biggest issue with the game is that stage 1 and 2 are so fucking boring and have nothing going on, it'll really make me stop playing sometimes just because I don't want to sit through 5-8 minutes of boredom every time I play. (I'm a fan of the game, I know that sounded super negative.)
    Maybe I'm weird but I like levels 1 and 2 a lot because your money matters a lot more and you have to make some decisions about routing that more or less go away by the time you reach level 3.
        Same.  There's no better feeling than grabbing an early brittle crown and just feeling the power that economy gives you
            Getting a decent start is the best part of the game sometimes imo. I love when I think I can declare I've won the run from the items I've got on stage 2.
                And then try some fancy shit and get killed
    If it's early game and like ~45 seconds to a minute go by and its super quiet, I'll just hit the teleporter. Instantly spawns enemies that you'd be waiting for anyway, and you can just grab whatever loot that's close after the TP is charged.
        General rule of thumb is to immediately hit the tp on stages 1 and 2 and only start grinding at stage 4 if you are going for an endless run.
            I used to follow this advice and would just get my ass kicked. I only play on monsoon now and regularly leave stage 1 with 6 items at the 430 mark. It's all about getting some high ground and quickly planning a route. I usually go to spots on the map father away from the teleporter to grab chests and leave things within sight of the teleporter for after the event. I just hate the way the first boss feels without items and levels. I do understand the importance of time especially early on but rushing the teleporter right off the bat has always felt a bit extreme to me.
                depends on the loadout, the character, and to some extent the enemy spawns, 

vagrant in particular is either really easy or really hard depending on your loadout and map.
                I do the same thing.  Scout the level in the first 20 seconds, decide on a loop around the level based on chests I can see, then grab some items on the way back to the boss.
            Unlees you find a crit printer and recycler on the same stage or something
    EnemiesSpawnFaster mod might help with that if you're on PC. It can be installed with a few clicks using R2ModMan.
    That’s why I do Glass-Sacrifice-Swarms. A single fuckup at the beginning can end you and you’re never safe the entire run. Certainly makes early game much more exciting.
    Not trying to be hostile or anything, but could be an issue with your pacing. You generally want to just leave stage 1/2 as soon as possible, so slow spawns shouldnt really matter much since youre usually just fighting boss immediately and leaving. If you find yourself waiting around in early game, youre probably doing something wrong in 90% of cases
        Nah I'm fully aware man, trust me, I'm booking it to get through the early stages as quick as possible.
    Playing multiplayer helps early game feel less slow, since there is more chests and more enemies earlier
For me, if you swap or even include "I'm lagging so hard" with "I AM A GOD"  then it would be quite accurate for me
    I always get like 100 fps but those new blob monsters that multiply, when I kill a Groupon like 3 instantly my fps tanks to like 1 or 2 lol
The other day on stage 39 of monsoon my game crashed from killing like 10 of them at the same time
        If you got the game to crash you've won
I been trying to kill the last boss but everytime i get one shoted
    Just be up in the air all the time or on one of the slopes. Mithrix has a hard time getting you there. And in the blue explody line phase, never jump but just keep walking counter to the line movement. Should be do able.
B E E T L E
When sensory overload kicks in like an hour into the god run and you just sit there like. “Uhhhhhhgghhh I’m doing so well but like please end me.......”
9 times outa 10 its those fking mushrooms
    Mushrooms can be scary
        even elder lemurians keep away from them at times
Only thing I'd disagree with is, that it's not kinda dull in the beginning.
    Sometimes it can feel that way due to a lack of mobility enhancing items and a relatively large starting area. Especially for newer players
        Counterpoint: loader/merc/artificer go nyoom 

Playing fast characters really makes the early game feel much faster, even though you’re still a bit starved for cash
    It can be imo but I also find it to be kinda refreshing sometimes
    I mean it objectively is dull at the start, basically every roguelike is. Takes ages for enemies to spawn, and when they do it's usually just harmless beetles. Takes ages to farm money for a chest and then it's just a fireworks. You move slow and deal little damage, against enemies that do the same. The start of game is only interesting if a legendary pops out of a small chest
        It's not objectively anything if it's an opinion.
            Fair enough, it's like I can't say watching paint dry is objectively boring because some people enjoy it
                But it is objectively so, given that you can reliably prove that there are more enemies and more action in later stages.  Even right away.  It's not really an opinion when you could just compare a thousand runs against each other and show that stage 1 starts out slow (dull), and stage 4/5/6 does not.
Where is the "looking for the god damn teleporter" section
I just got oneshotted by a twisted scavenger because i counterstrafed. Run was pretty fun though.
it’s the happiest mask for me. using command i’ve only picked it up on purpose in two runs. one on switch and one on pc. crashed my game both times. i was hoping my pc would be able to handle it a little better but it’s not worth it tbh
Idk why people bash on the early stages of a run. The quiet and waking potential are so exciting. I almost never do loop runs because imo a 10+ stage run always feels the same no matter what survivor you play. The shorter runs are more diverse and challenging
If you get past the "insta killed" you eventually become the melancholy God of destruction.
Was just having a god run only to get directly hit by a mini-mushroom spore and die from the DoT

I just closed the game and took a break ;-;
I like the beginning, I feel it is the part of the game in which you make the most use of your characters abilities, and, as a MUL-T main, I love switching up my weapons and using all I’ve got to take down each and every enemy.
Laughs in transcended heretic with 3 strides
every ducking time i became god the game say "world killed you"
my first time on hardest difficulty

\[this is ea ...\]\[OH FUCK, OH FUCK, OH FUCK, OH FUCK, OH FUCK, OH FUCK, OH FUCK\]
Died to my first Void Reaver today after finally getting enough Lunar Coins to get 3 Gestures and a Spinel Tonic  :       \^)
happend to me during a commando rolling thunder/uncorruptable run
Killed by: fusion cell.
I used the artifact that let me select my items and stacked like x30 Will-O-Wisps, then after hours of grinding for fun got insta-killed by a black hole. I was so upset.
The final part is always why if you can get a Dio, like in the cauldrons and such, do it. It's really easy to get overconfident or make a mistake ecause while you'll roll over mostly everything, the few enemies that can live long enough to hit you will straight up dunk you.

Feels like the item is pretty heavily underestimated because it only works if you die, and dying would mean you aren't doing well anyway, but the exception is when you're in that state of either being a god or instakilled, so in that situation I personally believe that Dio is the *only* item that really matters.
Oh man this reminds me of the time I had like 8 clovers, and 30+ teddy bears in a artifact of command God run. As me and my friend were calculating the chance of me getting damaged and dying (i also had a bunch of shaped glasses, and the run was 90ish minutes in) I got killed by a smol imp in the teleport we event.
rip
    Just fyi, the tougher times chance to block isn't affected by the clover.
You could also just make it the "What just insta killed me"
killed by: lesser wisp
The change from I AM A GOD to What just insta killed me and back to the first stage must be one of the most depressing parts of this game
After that happens I alt f4 at the start of the next run, get a feel that getting on the game is a good idea amd the cucle repeats
So many times this.
Then a elder lemurian ends your run. Every. Single. Time.
Literally happened to me on the king of nothing
wisps and lemurians have killed me so much oml.
Too relatable, take my award
It's always those fucking mushrooms.
It alway goes like that
Early game is literally stress in comic sans
Stop hoarding shaped glass and getting one-shot will be a thing of the past.
That last part could also be: this is now a powerpoint presentation of all the things dying and me killing them. In T minus 10 minutes from now my game will crash.

I won my first run
I hated it the first half hour or so I played then forced myself to try again and stuck with it longer. 3 hours instantly vanished and now I'm hooked
malachites and elder lumerians
After getting halfway through on my third run the beginning always destroys me, I have to play so careful on the first area now.
currently the only run i’ve played where I literally couldn’t die was a run where I had a lot of fuel cells and a gesture with blast shower. One shot protection always saved me, and being malachited didn’t matter because the cool down for blast shower at that point was like 3 seconds. I decided to fight the boss after 3 hours, the entire moon was just malachite scavengers, and i one shot every phase of the boss. good times
(it was a malachite)
This just happened on my new personal record thirteen stage, two artefact run. Had a lot of fun though and no regerts. (I died to an imp after my healing was disabled)
So true honestly
My own squid turret, as of yesterday.
Those dang lunar reavers always get me when I kill them
I 3d printed 20 gasoline's, I went to siren's call I killed the BIG BOY by running like a little bitch bc gasoline was the only item I had, a single enemy kill set the entire map on fire. I obtained a spooky legendary dagger, and then died to a voidtouched wisp that gave me 4 stacks of collapse in one hit
Those void reapers be really sneaky sometimes...
Me: *5K HP*

Scavenger: ~~5K HP~~ \-33 HP
Haha, it’s funny because it’s true :(
The early rounds are the greatest test of skill a lot of the time
Bruh i was doing so well, had legendaries and reds on monsoon then i got one shot on sky's meadow by a brass contraption
was one loop in obliterating all that stand before me only to get pulverized by an imp king
I've been trying the all artifacts on monsoon challenge lately and it makes the entire bracket just

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
That every single run. The f-ing "one shot protection" is just plain garbage. Borderlands 2 specifically does the same mechanic but it's actually useful because that game has invincibility frames plus it has some other mechanics before you have to start the whole damn game again.
Cant have this problem now
I use blast shower and safer spaces (I die to normal enemies instead of bullshit)
I felt pretty strong, oneshotting everything in my way, but then I remembered I installed umbral mithrix mod

                        Cheat engine isn’t a mod though. Cheat engine doesn’t modify the games code, like mods most people think of, for example the mod that just straight up adds a command to change your character to whatever modifies the game code, while using cheat engine doesn’t modify the games code, just changes runtime values. I can’t use cheat engine to add anything new to the game that isn’t already there. So sure, cheat engine can modify the game, but it’s not a mod. It’s an external program.
Mine are lemurians xD
huntress? why not call bandit gang
Transcendence is great against malachites, i suggest trying it at least once (unless if you're rex)
“Please let this be enough to survive one hit”

“With the Rix? No way! [extremely loud Mithrix hammer impact sound]”
Yeah they do a lot of damage I just seem to be lucky and basically never get hit by em.
Getting a decent start is the best part of the game sometimes imo. I love when I think I can declare I've won the run from the items I've got on stage 2.
    And then try some fancy shit and get killed
I used to follow this advice and would just get my ass kicked. I only play on monsoon now and regularly leave stage 1 with 6 items at the 430 mark. It's all about getting some high ground and quickly planning a route. I usually go to spots on the map father away from the teleporter to grab chests and leave things within sight of the teleporter for after the event. I just hate the way the first boss feels without items and levels. I do understand the importance of time especially early on but rushing the teleporter right off the bat has always felt a bit extreme to me.
    depends on the loadout, the character, and to some extent the enemy spawns, 

vagrant in particular is either really easy or really hard depending on your loadout and map.
    I do the same thing.  Scout the level in the first 20 seconds, decide on a loop around the level based on chests I can see, then grab some items on the way back to the boss.
Unlees you find a crit printer and recycler on the same stage or something
Fair enough, it's like I can't say watching paint dry is objectively boring because some people enjoy it
    But it is objectively so, given that you can reliably prove that there are more enemies and more action in later stages.  Even right away.  It's not really an opinion when you could just compare a thousand runs against each other and show that stage 1 starts out slow (dull), and stage 4/5/6 does not.
Mine is Lemurian for some reason but lesser wisps are close behind on the pie chart
    Same here.
    I swear they are the silent killer, you never think of them until you're run is over
        Captain is immune to them for the most part
    Lemurians have apparently killed me twice as much as mythrix. Granted, I started playing about a month ago.
Definitely a mod. I'm assuming they're taking advantage of the fact that all characters in the game are treated the same (i.e. players can be swapped out for enemies and vice-versa)
    No. Not mod. You can just change a value before the game starts that dictates what body you play as.
        Like, a config file?
            Nah, cheat engine.
