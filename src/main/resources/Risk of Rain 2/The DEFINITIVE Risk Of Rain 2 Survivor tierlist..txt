[[The DEFINITIVE Risk Of Rain 2 Survivor tierlist.]]





Nah, you got loader wrong, you wouldn't smash loader...loader would smash you
    And you'd be in the "would fucking die" category
    Yeah I think there needs to be a ‚ÄúI‚Äôd fucking die‚Ä¶ Smash.‚Äù Category just for Loader and VF
    In soviet russia, you no smash loader, loader smash you
    loader pegs men
    That‚Äôs a bad thing?
    I'm built different
I think huntress is made of actual styrofoam ‚ò†Ô∏è
    Nah, even styrofoam is tougher than her.
    Huntress is good wtf üò≠
        Well yeah she‚Äôs great but she also has the lowest starting health in the game, I still main her though
            Oh, true, that Alt R is so good lol
    I turned on artifact of glass while playing with a huntress main and I don't even think they noticed.
Please elaborate on the "I think she'd fucking die" tier. What the hell is that supposed to mean?
    Huntress fragile.
        Being considered fragile in a game, where at one point everything oneshots you, is a very definitive quality :D
    Huntress is strong in offense but weak in defense, so that may be why.
        Does that mean she‚Äôs a top?
            It means she could technically be a switch.
            She's ace
                Is there something in game that points to that?
                    She's an Arrow Ace
                        That‚Äôs the worst joke ever and what‚Äôs worse is it made me laugh
                    Lowest HP value.
                    Her like.. two hitpoints
                        I don‚Äôt see the connection between being ace and having low hp
                            you do so much as poke her with your pecker and she will explode into a cloud of ash
                            Asexuals are glass cannons
                                Yea alright I‚Äôm ok with that
                                i thought ace as in like ace
                        lol. I actually used to play Huntress a lot. But I play MUL-T a lot with Engineer too.
                            MUL-T + Daddy combo
                                MUL-T and Power Mode my beloved.
                    It was revealed in a dream.
                        I appreciate that dream. Ace representation isn‚Äôt common
                    She wears the lens makers like a goober. Shes ace (affectionate)
        "Strong is offense"
        Yeah, the game says that, but she also has the lowest damage output of any of the survivors.
            That Secondary tho. üëÄ
    Op would destroy utterly destroy the huntrussy(?)
Railgunner should be in her own Pass category. 100% smells like a gamer's mousepad
    does not change the fact i would smash.
    w-why?
    This is the most right wrong statement I‚Äôve seen
    What does this mean
    Like that isnt part of the appeal, smh
Depends!?
    Depends on whether or not Heretic feels like a dead person or whether or not MUL-T has any parts (which, now that I think about it, would be likely considering their whole multitool thing)
        MUL-T: PLEASE ASSUME THE POSITION
            NUMBNESS AND TINGLING WILL DISSIPATE AFTER A FEW MINUTES
    Depends on top or bottom im guessing
Huntress knows she would spontaneously die from fucking, so she‚Äôs into pegging thanks to her incredibly high offensive ability
Huntress mains when OSP doesn't save her from penetrative sex
MUL-T is hot has hell and no one can change my mind,what you mean depends?
    There's just a question of anatomy to account for before we can give a good answer.
What is "Smash"?
    Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a 2018 crossover fighting game developed by Bandai Namco Studios and Sora Ltd. and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is the fifth installment in the Super Smash Bros. series, succeeding Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U (2014). The game follows the series' traditional style of gameplay: controlling one of the various characters, players must use differing attacks to weaken their opponents and knock them out of an arena. It features a wide variety of game modes, including a campaign for single-player and multiplayer versus modes. Ultimate features 89 playable fighters, including all characters from previous Super Smash Bros. games alongside newcomers. The roster ranges from Nintendo mascots to characters from third-party franchises.
    they'd fuck that character
        The duality of man
I'm glad to hear that Huntress is fragile and I'm not just a noob. Literally died 3 runs in a row by stage 2
    I mean it‚Äôs probably a little bit of both then. A part of learning her is getting good at evading attacks. So even though she‚Äôs more fragile than others, you should be able to succeed with her regardless once you‚Äôve gotten used to her kit and movement :)
    I would recommend getting her 2nd utility skill. It helps a lot with evasion.
Huntress possibly dying is hilarious but still...smash
I‚Äôd smash acrid
    There's so many things wrong with fucking the acid dog
        Your point being?
            Melted off if you attempted it, is what the "point" would be.
                Well, the point would be gone by then, along with the rest of it.
    1: acrids a dog

2: you will probably get like every std ever

3: ACRID IS A DOG
        AN ACID DOG
            The acid makes it okay.
You mean you would NOT crave that Heretussy?
    NecrophiliaüíÄ
        You bring her back to life so it's more like such intense simpery they come back from the grave to friendzone you
POV you are bi and tryr to make any descisions ever
I mean...huntress is definitely more powerful than any of us resistance whise? She can take at least 1 shot from a wisp and survive or a fireball from a leumarian. I doubt any of us could survive any attack in RoR2...
When youre playing Don't Get Hit 2, I think Huntress should be higher up on the list
And you'd be in the "would fucking die" category
Yeah I think there needs to be a ‚ÄúI‚Äôd fucking die‚Ä¶ Smash.‚Äù Category just for Loader and VF
In soviet russia, you no smash loader, loader smash you
