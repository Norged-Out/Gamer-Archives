Some say I'm overly paranoid/cautious but I decide what trees I'll get wood from and shake each of them with my net out before equipping my stone axe.  Takes longer but I'm yet to get stung since I made the change.
    Same. If you sort the tools into your pocket a certain way, you can just use the arrow buttons to quickly switch between the net and axe.
        WAIT I could never figure out why the tools seemed cycle through at random. I assumed it would go through the tool circle order!! A game changer
            That's what I thought, until I tested it out just the other day. It would make more sense with the circle, but yeah it's the order you have them in your pocket.
                It’s because you have the ability to cycle through tools before you get the tool wheel.
                    and also you can use more tools that way
            It'll cycle to tools that aren't in your favs. It's entirely based on the order your tools are in your inventory. That made a huge difference for me. My net is always -> of my stone axe and <- of my axe.
            I intentionally keep the tools in the same order in my pockets so right is clockwise and left is anticlockwise.
    Same, but isn't this also the only way to get money and furniture from trees? By shaking them? I usually take a trip around my island shaking everything before taking a second trip with my stone axe.
        Happy cake day!
    I usually shake all my trees on my island before doing anything else. One time I was chopping wood and my axe broke, so I figured I'd make another. Shook that tree, went to shake another and a beat fell out. Apparently I missed one.
    You can also make 12500 bells a day doing it this way.
    That's a good idea.  Of late, I've been able to run, quickly switch to the net, turn around, and catch them before they get me, but it doesn't always pan out.
    I haven’t been able to catch a single one yet 😔
        Have your net out & Shake each tree right in the middle. Then when the bees come out swing as soon as you get over the shock reaction. You’ll already be facing them!
    I open my inventory as soon as I see bees and equip the bug bet from there. The bees pause until I close the inventory menu and then I catch them
Woof. Nooklings played you dirty.
Murder Hornets confirmed?
    100% are now called murder hornets
I swear to god that suspenseful chase-music that starts playing makes it so much worse
You got a solid 5 nose exhales from me friend. This is quality content.
    Its actually a random vid i saw on Instagram, I would've posted a source but it was already a re-upload and there were no tags or mentions☹️.
        At least you’re honest! Still quality content
And thats why I keep my net right next to my stone axe in my pockets.
    That’s why I shake a tree before I swing an axe at it.
Even when I get the net out, sometimes I accidentally shake the tree a second time instead of catching the swarm set to attack me!
    I always have a net out to shake a tree but I always stand at the very south/bottom of the tree looking at it. When you look at it this way your character turns toward the swarm whichever side they're on and gives you a clear swing without triggering another shaking of the tree.
        I’ll try that!
I imagine one of the twins looking her in the eyes as he locks the door in front of her. Click^click
    LMAO
always shake before you chop, that's my rule
    Thanks bro, I will do it
I'm so sorry but I literally just laughed out loud.
Hahaha

You know... Theres a trick.

If a hive drops. Run upwards a few paces and open your tool wheel. Bust out the net and you will be facing the proper direction. Swing when it gets close. Profit.
    learned this the hard way but i do this too! opening the tool wheel or your pockets pauses the wasps long enough to get over the mini heart attack lmao
When that happens go to your museum. Since the doors are always open and it never gets closed that is the best place to run to (unless you have time to get your net out and catch them)  but if your being chased by wasps, tarantulas, and scorpions, the museum will save you from being caught and stung.

I was having a ceremony for able sisters and then the lights just went out while we were having the ceremony, the thing is, the able sisters were with us,so who turned off the lights?
Now you can’t buy medicine either
    Some animals will give you either the medicine or a DIY to make it yourself!
Oh my they saw the character coming. Saw on YouTube those poppers works to scary away the wasps. Never knew they worked
F
F in the chat for our stung comrade
Omg, I felt that video... The pain!
Big oof
I've found it much easier to catch wasps in this game than the bees in previous ones... I had been saving them and when selling them to Flick today, I had 12 saved up!   
It just takes some time figuring out when to swing the net.
    I agree, it definitely seems easier to catch the wasps in this one! I almost never get stung anymore! Lol
Yoooooo I felt that lmao
they saw you coming, they didn’t want the wasps tho 💀
This us just beautifully chaotic 🤣
To be continued... > > >

I have had a rough day at work. I know your pain. I did LoL.
Your island is so beautiful!
I just buy lots of medicine, lol.
Top 10 saddest anime deaths
As someone who doesn't play what happens when you are stung?
    They sting your eye so your face gets disfigured. If you get stung a second time while not healed, you faint and end up back at your doorstep.
        Thanks
I always run into the museum. 

Unless I'm on a cliff then I try to catch them with the net.
Wait so if the store didn’t close would this have worked? 😂
    yep! if I happen to not have my net in hand, I run right into the museum and the wasps stop chasing me
Oooooooooooffff
Nests are only in non-fruit trees, so I put all fruit trees on my main island and having non-fruit trees only on my cliff tops. It makes it quicker to go through and shake each of them to get all 5 wasps, 2 furniture items, and coins when there are only 20 possible trees. And then I never worry about wasps.
Oof
Well... we've all been there lolol
if only you didn't have that Axe out, you would have made it lmao
Dam, that's one in a million lol
Lmao damn that sux
I did that yesterday but instead chopped the door with my axe...
I haven’t been stung by a wasp in weeks I caught like 5 per day too not tryna flex
Who gives a fuck, if you get stung by the bees your eyes closes up! Big fucking whoop it effects the game in ZERO ways .
LOL
