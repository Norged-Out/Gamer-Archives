[[I know I'm late to the party, but excited that I just got my first house!]]





Congrats! Cute how your apples match the roof
    Thank you! Glad you like it! Wanted it over hanging the sea but sadly I couldnt have that.
        Ya know in about 80 hours you can make it that way yourself.
            No, you actually can't edit the shore line at all. I've tried and couldn't figure out a way
                [deleted]
                    Bingo
        I moved mine to the top of my map and it just happened to have the sea right behind it. I really like it c:
You say you're late but yesterday I was helping my friend get the 5k nookmiles he needed to upgrade from camp to house xD 

Its just what time you can give you game
    That's very true indeed! I finish work early in the day so lots of time in the evening to sink into it! Plus its a break from the hectic gaming of Call of Duty.
        This game is suppose to be played in short bursts, not all day like other games. I've sunk in like 250 hours but now it's more fun for a couple hours
            I am finding its great to break up my day with a cup of tea and a little wander around the island. But still wow quite a while!
                I just wanna go outside! Dx
                    What is outside?!
                        I don't know! I just see a white ball of gas on the thing called the sky!

And a bunch of owners running around with their extremely energetic dogs on this huge grassy area behind my balcony. (Dog parks are closed)

One poor guy, his dog stopped momentarily and he finally catch up, his dog just runs. You could hear him yell "COME ON!"
                            Haha oh dear, see currently the graphics are really good! But the storyline is even worse at the moment! But atleast you're getting a bit of comedy at the moment it seems!
                                Let me know if you want any fruits! Mine are ready for harvest today, I can hold onto 10 of each if you want them
                                    Ooo really! Might have to take you up on that, looking to get those peaches and oranges!
        Yup. Animal Crossing and Moden Warfare are my daily drivers as well. Perfect change of pace
            I'm afraid to tell my Modern Warfare squad that I play Animal Crossing...
                Ha their loss.
Congrats!
    Thank you! Still so much work to be done!
        Sure, but have fun with it! Such a chill game to play during this quarantine~
    Great job dude
BEEEEES
    I hate them!
        Oh they are the worst lol. I find I‚Äôm allllways equipping the net before I go on shakefests for the trees, but even then I get stung. Gratz on the house though!
            Thank you! That time I was stung while axing the tree and my reflexes where way too slow!
            If you guys stand to the south (the trunk) of the tree, you can spam A when the nest drops. You'll always catch them that way and avoid the sting. I always shake the tree before cutting it.
                So, you can catch the hive before the wasp comes out?
                    You can't catch the hive. You shake it out, your character freaks out and stares at the wasps but yeah, spam A and you'll catch them. Always shake from the front of the tree and always with a net out and you'll catch them. Then pick the nest up afterwards :3
                    No the hive still falls to the ground but you can catch the bees since your character turns to the hive in time
                Awesome tip, thanks!
        I loved my look with the wasp sting! I was quite humored by it!
    WAAAASPS
        ANGRY STINGY BOIS
        Yeah let‚Äôs not give bees a bad wrap. Bees are great. Fuck wasps.
You‚Äôre gonna have so much fun lol. If you want anything I‚Äôd be happy to help. Since you‚Äôre just starting out I have a few cherry blossom items I can craft for you or give you some extra fruits I have. Just message me if anything :)
    Ahh brilliant! Thank you so much! I will definitely let you know!
It's never to late to start with this awesome game. I've would never bought it but my wife is a huge fan. And now I'm playing on a daily basis and thinking about buying a second switch so we can play both at the same time everywhere.
    Ahh now that is committment! But sounds like a great way to spend time with an SO! It has that relaxing charm to it!
        I really love to go fishing. Sometimes I just run around the island for 2 hours and go fishing. It's relaxing and fun.
    [deleted]
        Thanks for the best buy tip but I'm not from the US. üòÅ 
At the moment I'm really struggling to buy a second switch. I really would love to play together at the same time but on the other hand buying a switch for just one game seems kinda bit exaggerated. Struggle is real.
            [deleted]
                No problem. 
Yeah I got Zelda BotW shortly after it's release but never got the time to finish the game. Still something big on my to do list. I guess if there's a good offer I'll buy a second switch. I mean it's corona and you can't do any other stuff than gaming. So I think it's worth a try.
Very cool! Congratulations!
    Thank you!!
Nice I put my house in the exact same place
    I always wanted a house by the sea!
Congratulations! Hope u enjoy it
    Thank you! Loving it so far!
Welcome to being in debt forever.  Congrats though exciting moment! 
[r/AnimalCrossingHangOut](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossingHangOut?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
    Thank you! Glad I can bring real life into a game!
        Yeah this might be easier to pay off than real life though.  Here you can make a killing selling sticks. IRL not so much. Lol
            Haha, yeah I wish I could go to beach and making a living or just pull up random weeds and sell them to kids of some rich dude
You'll see in no time everything will be smooth sailing, you'll have a fully decorated island in a few days!
    I hope so! But I'll probably move everything around every other day!
        Well, im sure you'll find your ideal layout one day!
That‚Äôs awesome! I recently started too, my first house will be done tomorrow :)
I‚Äôve just started again, sort of. I was the second player on my husbands island and today have started my own island on a new Switch.
Welcome to the club ‚ò∫Ô∏è
    Thank you! I'm enjoying the grow and loving the community that's on the game! Enjoy growing your new island too!
Welcome i also started 2 weeks ago with my girlfriend on 1 island
    Aww lovely! And thank you! Hope you're both enjoying it greatly!
Congratulations!!
    Thank you!
Looks like you need some medicine!
    Ti's but a scratch!
        Just a flesh wound.
            Had worse
Oh man!!! I've been LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR APPLES!!!

Can I come visit you and pick a few? I'll bring you some EXTRA SPECIAL GIFTS üòâ
    Haha of course! It's a mess! But it's my mess!
        What's your island code? I'll come right now!üòÆüòÆüòÆüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÅüòÅüòÅ
            0LQVD see you soon!
                Omw!!!
                Can we still visit? I have some extra stuff I can give you.
You should close your gates now, so millions of people don't come
I started this week also it pretty fun but I‚Äôm in crippling debt now
    I guess it's the same as realvlife now then!
Congrats man make sure to keep us updated can't wait to see what you do with it  üëç
    Thank you! I'm sure I will! Didn't expect this post to blow up so much!
I love your villager!! And congrats!! Don‚Äôt worry too much on interior decorating if you can‚Äôt find all the right pieces right away, my house is fully upgraded but I haven‚Äôt touched the inside yet!!! Have fun :)
    Haha thank you! Love the explorer hat! Haha I have so many different ideas how I want everything to turn out and I haven't even started!
        Good luck with it all!!
Your not late, I just did that too with the same roof and apples! We oddly have a lot of our island in common and I just fished an oar fish so maybe you can too...Life works in mysterious ways
I just started yesterday myself. Wish I‚Äôd bought it sooner!
    I started yesterday too! :)
Have fun! When you get shop get medicine for the bee string / sometimes villagers give it to you after looking at you scared. 

‚ò∫Ô∏è
Congrats!!  
PS, I see I'm not the only one who has a habit of getting stung by wasps!
I put my house right on the beach at first. I always wanted to live on the beach, I‚Äôm from Florida and with hurricanes and such I never felt safe enough to live right on the water. Anyway, as soon as I could I moved my house because I hated it on the beach. Funny how things work out.
I just started playing last week.  I just got my first room attached to my house
You missed the egg festival which was really annoying so don't worry, you're right on time ! Some exciting new features are coming up so you'll have lots of fun ! 
Also there if you need help to start, don't hesitate to ask !
    Yeah I have seen all the hatred of eggs! So think I came at a better time!
And thank you! Currently on the hunt for iron!
        Oh yeah that's hard at the beginning. If you need √† stack or two I have plenty in my storage =)
            I'll see how I get on but I might take you up on that! Thank you!!!
You also got stung by bees it looks like.
    They're not that friendly it seems!
Ay congratulations dude! If you need anything I don't mind helping! I've got peaches and I may some extra diys somewhere on my island!
    Thank you! May take you up on those peaches! Gotta collect all the fruit!
        If I'm not too late sure thing! Rn I'm out getting groceries but once I get home I can come and give some to you! Dm your code :)
Best feeling ever!
    I was so happy when I logged on to see it standing there instead of my tent!
When it comes to tree's barring Plam Trees, have a net and shake. It will save you some pain. Stock up on all the wood you can find. You will burn through it quick. Other than that...
I hope your enjoying the game! I certainly am and my sister is and she doesn't like video games! She is officially addicted and she hates me for it XD.
    I will remember that for future! Thank your for the advice! And I'm trying to get my mum into it at the moment for something else she can do while in isolation!
Ahh I see you‚Äôve met the local wasps. Always a pleasure
    They're alot meaner than the rest of the residents :(
Welcome to the club! Glad to have you!
    Thank you! Glad to be here!
ooooh that red roof looks super cute with the apples!!!
    Thought it had to be a must when choosing it!
It is the small things like this game that actually brings the mood of the player up. A sense of accomplishment by your own hand. On the final house upgrade though... Be ready to pay Overlord Nook for 2.4 Million Bells.
    Oh I'm ready for it... Well not really as I'm still selling my shells! But it's great for moments of downtime that I can pick it up and just play!
Agreed. Do enjoy the adventure of building up your Island getaway to a Jewel of the tropical blue.
    I'm hoping to! Or just wait for it be claimed by some empire...
Lol.
Wait until you have to pay of the debt
It's never too late! Welcome and congrats! Have a blast!
Welcome! Have fun, and stay safe.
Much work to be done. 
Good stuff. Whrre I am they're sold out everywhere of systems and acnh
I have all of the fruit and some extra items if you want a cute little door hanger for your house!!
    Oh wow really! I think that would look lovely!! Thank you!
        Ofcourse! I can PM you a dodo code I‚Äôll be hopping on in a few!
            Aww awesome thank you!
Welcome to the rest of your quarantine.
It is never too late!
Also you got apples, I'm jealous.
I wish I had apples :/
    I can send you some if you want!
I put my house in the same place!
I'm just getting some gifts together to bring for you!
    Aww thank you!
Don't worry about the late start! I started earlier this month but only recently picked it up to *really* play. I just upgraded my room a couple days ago, and got my museum and upgraded residential services yesterday.

Congrats on the house!
    Thank you, and well I guess its all putting time into it. But I do love how easy it is to pick up and play!
Looks good man!
    Thank you! Just gotta keep building it up!
        I just got 3 star and unlocked the terraforming, it is pretty overwhelming, not sure where to start.
FYI you can buy medicine if you want from the resident services tent!! Unless you already have the store up.
Never too late to enjoy yourself!! Congrats!!
I think we may have the same beginning island design! Can‚Äôt wait to see what you do with it! If you‚Äôd like to visit I can help with the fruits you may need :)
Would you be willing to sell me some apples i can pay you with either 500 per apple for 3 apple's or 1 orange per apple for 3 apple's (if anyone thinks this is a unfair price please do let me know im new to trading)
    I can just give you them if you'd rather :)
        Ill pay for them i have a decent amount of cash and itll help you pay off that first loan
            Sure thing, how many would you like?
                3 will do
                    Have them all waiting for you!
                        Ok whats the code to get to your island
                            You can pm me if you don't want everyone to see it
                                Thanks again
You‚Äôre never late in Animal Crossing. 
Good job!
I‚Äôm rewatching Mad Men and your character is giving me ‚Äúchild Dick Whitman‚Äù vibes.
Love this!! Always nice to see the start of a  journey. Hope you have an awesome time!
   You're not the only one !
Don‚Äôt worry about being late, I‚Äôm just starting out as well :)
If you need help just ask üòÅ congrats!!
    Thank you! The community has been so great!
So exciting!! Have fun!!
Welcome to the party and have fun. The Game is Perfect to relaxing :)
Never too late! Welcome!
[deleted]
    You can get another fruit on a certain mystery island, but for the remaining two fruits you have to trade with others
        [deleted]
            Whenever I've got peaches (my sister fruit) it's always been a specific island layout. I've been playing for about 3 weeks and I've only got this island a few times, so it might take a while for you to find it
This was such a nice refreshing post. Welcome!
Im getting my first tommorow lol
Late or early be excited!!!!!
I‚Äôm still in my tent üò© besides that congrats! üòÑ
you're never too late for this game! congratulations!
I can‚Äôt remember it being that hard but it probably ways
Never to late! - I got friends who plan on grabbing it this weekend!

Welcome and have fun!
Hey congrats! If you wanna be friends add me! SW-5486-8097-2502
Heeey! Congrats! ^^ just in time for earth day :)
Congratulations! PM me if you want to be friends :) I have all fruit trees and anything I could help with I‚Äôd be happy to!
Congrats!
Think of it as at least you did not have to deal with bunny day...
Don't worry I'm right there with you! Just got mine last night lol. Still trying to figure out how the whole friends thing works and trying to go to other islands ü§£
Hey! Better now than never! I started a couple of weeks ago so I‚Äôm happy to visit/let you visit my place if you wish to do so! Pm for a friend code and I hope you enjoy the game!
Not late in the slightest, congrats
Congrats, i just started recently myself. Nice to know I'm not the only one haha!
Perioddd
You‚Äôre right on time, surprisingly I haven‚Äôt had rain yet and I‚Äôve been playing for a while
I‚Äôm pretty new too, only started playing over the weekend. Peaches are the indigenous fruit tree on my island. If you‚Äôd like, I‚Äôd be happy to dig a few up for you and we can exchange some fruit trees (non-indigenous fruits sell for 500 as opposed to 100 bells) and make some easy money! Just let me know! :)
    Thank you so much for the offer! I might have to talk you up on that when they restock tomorrow! And I didn't know that!
It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs honest work.
I think I put my house in a spot that looks exactly like that
Sure, just reach back out whenever. :)
Hey I think we have the same island! I have a money tree on that same peninsula. Wish I got apples though instead of oranges xD.
Great Job! Glad to see I am not the only one late. I‚Äôm in the same boat. Heard everyone talking about the game and just bought it. I just got my house too. Need iron nuggets to get shop going. Got like 11 and can‚Äôt find any. Destroyed my rocks without knowing what I was doing. Found out after that I was screwed. Today‚Äôs new rock gave me nothing but bells!?!?! 

Needless to say I got a lot to learn! First AC game.
Congratulations!
Also it looks like you‚Äôre in need of some medical attention given by the bee stings on your character
I‚Äôll give you 2 pouches for some apples if you want
Congrats!!!
Got mine yesterday!! ^^
Your never late to the party my friend! Any day is a day to start your adventure or further it! If you ever want to play let me know! I have a ton of extra recipes I'd love to give away :)

Oh and some fruit types if you want to grow your collection ü§ó
Yay!! Congrats
Have fun
Welcome to the tribe!! Ur just in time for the big update tmw toooo üçä
I actually just got mine today too!!\~ :D Glad I'm in good company. What villagers did you start out with?
Dont worry if you do everything Mr. Nook tells you in a week you will have the town hall.
Legit my face looked like that when I got my house. Took me forever to get the recipe for the meds and I had sold the stinking nest. It was a mess üòÇ. Grats on the house. When you pay off your mortgage, the Nook guy almost makes an expression
Don‚Äôt rush take your time and have fun!
I just started two days ago! First animal crossing game I‚Äôve played.
Welcome OP!!! (*chants one of us from the simpsons*)
Happy for you! :)
And here starts the climb to more rooms and debt. Just a heads up, still got time to get tarantulas before this month finishes
Hey, if you want any of the bunny day recipes you missed last week, I have a beach littered with them. You're welcome to come grab them... please. Lol.
Better late then never...you will love it...
I'm only 3 days in, so I'm in the same boat.  I want to open my island to visitors but since there isn't much there I haven't yet lol
Welcome home!
Congrats dude !
Looks you you went through hell to get it.. god speed solider..
I'm joining tomorrow!!! I just put in to get my house built üòä
Congrats!! Very cute
It‚Äôs a wonderful game! It‚Äôs the first of its kind that I‚Äôve ever played and I absolutely fell in love with it.
Looks great. If you need anything let me know, I‚Äôll be more then happy to help free of charge
I have my house in the same spot (:
Congratulations!
Like the spot
I've only been playing this past week so...good news you're not alone
Am I the only one who feel's creeped out when I see a Tarantula?
I'm late to the game too. I got the game last month and I'm on my 3rd? House upgrade. I just got to where I can build my own bridge and damn it's 228,000 no clue when I will be able to finish it.
did not know we could have more than one house?
Congrats! And hey this party ain't gonna stop
Thats where I put my house too!
Congratulations! Late is ok!
You need some medicine for that sting, mate?
Another poor soul scammed by the raccoon mafia welcome to the world of debt

Thank you! Glad to be here!
Thought it had to be a must when choosing it!
Oh I'm ready for it... Well not really as I'm still selling my shells! But it's great for moments of downtime that I can pick it up and just play!
I'm hoping to! Or just wait for it be claimed by some empire...
Oh wow really! I think that would look lovely!! Thank you!
    Ofcourse! I can PM you a dodo code I‚Äôll be hopping on in a few!
        Aww awesome thank you!
I can send you some if you want!
Aww thank you!
Thank you, and well I guess its all putting time into it. But I do love how easy it is to pick up and play!
Thank you! Just gotta keep building it up!
    I just got 3 star and unlocked the terraforming, it is pretty overwhelming, not sure where to start.
I can just give you them if you'd rather :)
    Ill pay for them i have a decent amount of cash and itll help you pay off that first loan
        Sure thing, how many would you like?
            3 will do
                Have them all waiting for you!
                    Ok whats the code to get to your island
                        You can pm me if you don't want everyone to see it
                            Thanks again
Thank you! The community has been so great!
You can get another fruit on a certain mystery island, but for the remaining two fruits you have to trade with others

        Whenever I've got peaches (my sister fruit) it's always been a specific island layout. I've been playing for about 3 weeks and I've only got this island a few times, so it might take a while for you to find it
Thank you so much for the offer! I might have to talk you up on that when they restock tomorrow! And I didn't know that!
Ya know in about 80 hours you can make it that way yourself.
    No, you actually can't edit the shore line at all. I've tried and couldn't figure out a way
        [deleted]
            Bingo
I moved mine to the top of my map and it just happened to have the sea right behind it. I really like it c:
This game is suppose to be played in short bursts, not all day like other games. I've sunk in like 250 hours but now it's more fun for a couple hours
    I am finding its great to break up my day with a cup of tea and a little wander around the island. But still wow quite a while!
        I just wanna go outside! Dx
            What is outside?!
                I don't know! I just see a white ball of gas on the thing called the sky!

And a bunch of owners running around with their extremely energetic dogs on this huge grassy area behind my balcony. (Dog parks are closed)

One poor guy, his dog stopped momentarily and he finally catch up, his dog just runs. You could hear him yell "COME ON!"
                    Haha oh dear, see currently the graphics are really good! But the storyline is even worse at the moment! But atleast you're getting a bit of comedy at the moment it seems!
                        Let me know if you want any fruits! Mine are ready for harvest today, I can hold onto 10 of each if you want them
                            Ooo really! Might have to take you up on that, looking to get those peaches and oranges!
Yup. Animal Crossing and Moden Warfare are my daily drivers as well. Perfect change of pace
    I'm afraid to tell my Modern Warfare squad that I play Animal Crossing...
        Ha their loss.
Sure, but have fun with it! Such a chill game to play during this quarantine~
Oh they are the worst lol. I find I‚Äôm allllways equipping the net before I go on shakefests for the trees, but even then I get stung. Gratz on the house though!
    Thank you! That time I was stung while axing the tree and my reflexes where way too slow!
    If you guys stand to the south (the trunk) of the tree, you can spam A when the nest drops. You'll always catch them that way and avoid the sting. I always shake the tree before cutting it.
        So, you can catch the hive before the wasp comes out?
            You can't catch the hive. You shake it out, your character freaks out and stares at the wasps but yeah, spam A and you'll catch them. Always shake from the front of the tree and always with a net out and you'll catch them. Then pick the nest up afterwards :3
            No the hive still falls to the ground but you can catch the bees since your character turns to the hive in time
        Awesome tip, thanks!
I loved my look with the wasp sting! I was quite humored by it!
ANGRY STINGY BOIS
Yeah let‚Äôs not give bees a bad wrap. Bees are great. Fuck wasps.
I really love to go fishing. Sometimes I just run around the island for 2 hours and go fishing. It's relaxing and fun.
Thanks for the best buy tip but I'm not from the US. üòÅ 
At the moment I'm really struggling to buy a second switch. I really would love to play together at the same time but on the other hand buying a switch for just one game seems kinda bit exaggerated. Struggle is real.
    [deleted]
        No problem. 
Yeah I got Zelda BotW shortly after it's release but never got the time to finish the game. Still something big on my to do list. I guess if there's a good offer I'll buy a second switch. I mean it's corona and you can't do any other stuff than gaming. So I think it's worth a try.
Yeah this might be easier to pay off than real life though.  Here you can make a killing selling sticks. IRL not so much. Lol
    Haha, yeah I wish I could go to beach and making a living or just pull up random weeds and sell them to kids of some rich dude
Well, im sure you'll find your ideal layout one day!
Just a flesh wound.
    Had worse
What's your island code? I'll come right now!üòÆüòÆüòÆüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÅüòÅüòÅ
    0LQVD see you soon!
        Omw!!!
        Can we still visit? I have some extra stuff I can give you.
Good luck with it all!!
Oh yeah that's hard at the beginning. If you need √† stack or two I have plenty in my storage =)
    I'll see how I get on but I might take you up on that! Thank you!!!
If I'm not too late sure thing! Rn I'm out getting groceries but once I get home I can come and give some to you! Dm your code :)
Ofcourse! I can PM you a dodo code I‚Äôll be hopping on in a few!
