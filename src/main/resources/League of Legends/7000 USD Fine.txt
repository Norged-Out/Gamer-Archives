No way the only series my goats lost this split is against teddy bear fucker
    I hope this leads to coaches assuming the correlation is causation and we find out GENG has been substituting a scrim block with an hour of dry humping a stuffed toy leading up to MSI.
        Leyan dry humping hack? Learn this new scrim technique
            this is why na cant compete smh when's the last time you saw Jensen hump any bears
                It's not too late to start.

        The funniest thing is that Leyan posted about it on weibo and he was like "it's not what it looked like, I just got excited while listening to music and I thought the bear looked cute so I hugged it and shook it" 

It sounds like sth your parents would say when you catch them during the act. Maybe he was listening to the same music as that reddit guy from 2022

                    that's a fucking classic LMAO

    well he's fucking a teddy bear on stream, maybe hes had practice with stuffed goats as well.
        Wdym we saw him stuffing the goats on stage
No wonder Teddy didn't go to the LPL
    Lmao
    man dodged a bullet
    Man was 4 steps ahead here 💀💀
    r/cursedcomments
    BRUH LOL
Can't wait for the leaks next year claiming Leyan intimidated the bear into having an abortion, true LPL style
    And then followed by the teddy bear changing clubs to service another player.
    Dark, but true.
    whats the reference?
        There was an LPL player who abused his girlfriend, she got pregnant, and then threatened to ruin her if she didn't abort. She got an abortion but exposed his ass afterwards.
            Was it Xiaohu or Knight? Or both? I know Xiaohu definitely has the abortion tiger nickname in LPL and iirc Knight is also called abortion hand sometimes
                Knight apparently was the one that forced his at the time GF into abortion, not sure if it was the same with Xiaohu but both did have their GFs do abortion. 

There's also a bunch of other players that got into controversies too like Huanfeng. LPL drama is just fucking wild lmao.
                    Not that the abortions are bad, mind you, I was talking about the whole "abort it or I'll ruin you" threat. Coercion isn't okay. Just want to make it clear I wasn't condemning people having abortions.
                Both did, and many more.
                Neither. Xiaohu's ex's friend came out and exposed the accuser of cheating, knight's abortion was under consent and is legal in China- just that abortion in general is looked down upon in China.
                    Abortion is not looked down in China in the same way anymore there.  People got used to it after the one child policy.
                    It's not the abortion that was wrong, it was him threatening her. Coercion is not acceptable.
                        That's my point. Knight never forced the abortion. I ain't gonna be knight's lawyer but I'm not going to let a misunderstanding about a player slide so
                both
            Xiaohu - The king of ~~spring~~ abortion
is that the bear from toy story 3 lol?
    I don't find it that surprising since Lotso has an overwhelming presence in China pop culturally. He's a very popular character and is slapped on pretty much everything; toys, pop up shops, teddy bears, blind bag figures... Miniso being the main prepatrator. iirc its only because companies bought the rights for producing Lotso merch since it was cheap since he's a small side character, and it went crazy. Think loopy for korea and sanrio characters for the us
        Lots of girls in South East Asia loves Lotso   
but don't even know its name or that its from Toy Story 3,  
they just think its a cute pink bear lol
            It's called Strawberry Bear in China.
                Lol its the exact same in vietnam. strawberry bear. They are everywhere. All the girls are obsessed with it.
                    God damn. As an American, this is funny as fuck.
            Its very funny people who haven't seen the movie treat him like hello kitty. It's like those ted bundy flower crown edits. Tbf its toy story but still
            its called the strawberry bear cause of the scent on the plushies
        Lotso being successful in China is not a good look lol. He was the dictator of a security state. Where he used his power and enforcers to oppress the other toys and even punish the political dissidents by sending them to the baby play room. 

That’s so fucking funny. You can’t write this better
        I don't think being the main antagonist of the movie is a "small side character".
    Then it is deserved
Lu “lay hand” Jue is a league of legends esports player, currently jungler for Invictus Gaming. Since failing to win spring split nor qualifying for MSI, Invictus Gaming has invested in other ways for their players to stand out. Lu “lay hand” Jue is currently best known for laying hands on a stuffed teddy bear, earning the well deserved title of “teddy bear fucker”
    wtf 😭
    Asia is something when it comes to virginity, it's definitely up there in the healthy sexuality countries.
ok that was less graphic than i thought. cringe, sure, but just dumb kid shit. i had the impression for some reason that it was going to be fetishistic.
    Yeah like tbh, why is there even a punishment for this???
        I can somewhat see a fine for being "unprofessional" but my got a 2 match ban like bruh what the fuck.

Getting fined and also a ban is excessive.
            The teddy bear thing is part of it but afaik the actual punishment is because he made a bet on stream that with another streamer and said if he lost he'd have to vape on stage. Vaping is, to no one's surprise, strictly prohibited on the LPL stage.
                Yeah if that's the case it makes a lot more sense.
                I wonder how this is worded by policy. Making a bet that you will do something isn't exactly the same as actually doing something. I'm sure Leyan would've just gone back on his word of the bet. 

There's a boundary here obviously as I can understand if you can't say something stupid like I'll matchfix the next game if I lose this bet, but surely nobody gets punished over an innocent joke like If I lose this bet I will purposefully pick Teemo jgl next game. Effectively both are the same thing, but I feel like either way it's a little silly to punish over such a nothing Whopper.
        Yea I dunno how much he gets payed but 7k for this feels pretty unreasonable
        Because it's inappropriate behaviour on stream and he's a public figure representing his team, if he does weird stuff on stream then the org also takes an hit.

It's not that different in any serious sport I think
        China is a different country 
        This is the same country that bans shit like skulls in games, lmao.
            isn’t this a myth? there’s no law banning it it’s just culturally frowned upon or something? there are definitely chinese games with skulls in them. 
                Yes, it's just anti china propaganda that people accept without question or investigation
    This is bullshit. The pro players should push back hard against this sort of thing. The League of Legends professional esports disciplinary team should not have this much say in what players do when they are not playing the game.
    Why do the cringe people have to give all of us that play video games lol
Not all of us are weird or social outcasts lol but stuff like this makes me see why people think that way
        [removed]
            So many kneckbeards and weirdos that do stuff like Leyan did give all of us a bad name. What we all get associated with. Similar thing to the Yugioh community and all the people that refuse to shower. I didn’t spell check my previous comment, meant to say that people like that give all of us a bad name
                [removed]
                    Did you seriously take the time to delete your comment and recommend under a different one? You must be one of the people I’m referring to, so cringe
        I mean you're on Reddit unironically using the term "cringe shit" so maybe take a deep breath and go touch some grass.
I am so lost. What the fuck is going on lmao
    He dry humped a tibbers bear on live stream. Got fined and suspended for 2 matches.
        Tibbers gonna need some therapy sessions now 💀💀
        To me it seems like he's kicking it with his knee not humping.
        deserved
            Idk it‘s pretty funny
                Funny in a sad cringe way, sure. Guess it’s to be expected of this player base
            Deservedly based
Does the video show full penetration?
    Where is that meme from ?

$7k fine and a 2 game ban for fucking around on stream. So absurd.
    He also got fined 2 months salary lol
        need to see his social credit score after this one
            It's in Bear territory.
        YOU WORK FREE 2 MONTH! SMILE!
What complete and utter bullshit. Yes its turbo cringe no questions asked but a 7000 dollar fine and 2 match ban? So blown out of proportion.
    whats funny is that LPL has multiple Tier 1 pros that did things far worse than what this guy did, Xiahou is a prime example
        Huanfeng trying to poison his teammate lmao
            I remember reading the article about Huanfeng's backstory and how he managed to make it to Worlds in 2020, some genuinely heartwarming and inspirational stuff. Then he immediately speedruns his reputation in the ground
            Wait what? I know he got caught sleeping with multiple women before world finals but when did this one happen lmao
                He was saying it as a joke but still.
        Image matters a ton in China, so it's about how public something is.  For other pros, a lot of the stuff they did could be handwaved as "he said she said", even if they're really likely.  Leyan was doing it on stream, even though it was just cringe and didn't hurt anyone.  The LDL for example, is full of matchfixing, but they kind of pretend it isn't there, until someone like Bo actually comes forward and admits to it, then he gets hit hard and even after the ban expires, is blacklisted by other LPL teams, when at least some of the current pros participated when they were in the lower leagues.
    frfr like who did he even harm???
        My eyes and the bear.
    This is China bro, they take the most random of stuff seriously
        Hey dont crap on my boy Winnie
        It's the fact that it's on stream.  For China, and kind of East Asia in general, if it could be handwaved as a rumor, then it doesn't matter how bad it is.  But if it's something as public as on stream and recorded to the internet, the slightest thing gets hit.
    Chinese TikTok has the wildest policies, action like this would get you banned which is exactly what happened to his stream. Also he has been doing a lot of game unrelated streams as a side hustle of an influencer recently, LPL officials didn't like that.
    The fine is whatever, the suspension is where i think it went overboard imo.
    Its china bro
    Main reason for the fines and punishment was because he said he’d vape on stage before an official game had he lost the bet he made with another streamer
?? What's the full story here. Why would he do that on stream knowingly?? Why is the girl watching? Wat
    He claimed he was listening to upbeat music, then saw the huge bear and thought it was adorable, then decided to dance with it... Yeah.
        Was he listening to Cbat or what
    >Why would he do that on stream knowingly

When you're 21 and full of hormones and an attractive girl is goading you...
        A quick trip to Japan would take care of that for less than $7000
            Relatedly, it's an open secret that some of the players visit prostitutes.  Leave was just one of the ones who got caught, and flaming his teammates definitely didn't help either.
        You are not "full of hormones" at 21 lol
            Mens sexual drive peaks at age of 20 and starts to slowly go down, so im not sure what you are talking about.
                I'm 40 and it's not going down.
                    Relevant flair
                    Wait till you are 43 .
    What is he doing with the teddy bear?
bro thought he was on Kick
LMAO his teammates are going to clown him so hard for being so down bad 😭
we can invite people who have onlyfans  to official riot events, but my guy cant even try fucking a bear, come on
    Who? Need to know so I can avoid seeing those terrible immoral people when they show up on stream
        Caedrel
        Jankos
        Sneaky

            BunnyFufu as well, not sure Riot ever invited hym anywhere tho
            Sneaky does cosplays on patreon I wouldn't consider it anywhere near softcore porn but it is kind of explicit.
                [removed]
                    I watch sneaky pretty much daily and have never heard of this.

                            Can't say I want to but I'll take your word for it.
    Were they fucking a teddy bear at those events?
    That's disgusting. Where?
    Send da link
        Hell naw dont do dis
        Send da video
    Wait whomst now
Free my boi T\_T. The bear needed some love and Leyan is a kind hearted man that who felt like he had to satisfy the bear's pain
He’s about to perma Hecarim next split
Can’t even fuck a bear anymore smh🤦
Well, WTF did he do to the bear?
POV: what happens to Tibbers when you miss Annie R
I mean a ton of this was him actually punching and kneeing it in the face not humping it but wtf either way lol
Dantes would've fucked that bear better
    Hancock too if he has the right motivation.
LPL drama really does hit different lmao... this is why they're the best
It doesn’t look like he’s humping it at all…you clearly see he’s kicking it and then punching it. Maybe I’m crazy?
Riot found Layan a bit unBEARable.
hey maybe the teddy bear is mature for its age.
Next you're gonna tell me he's started maining hecarim
I can only be that energetic and horny on coke lmao. Dude is probably relieved it’s only a fine and not a drug test as well
    Honestly, cocaine is less common and much harder to find in China.
Teddy Fans... smh
XD
O.o
Damn we really need MSI to start asap...
The fuck is he even doing
based
Just seen one of his solo queue IDs is 'Fu4kTheworld' (according to Lol.Fandom.com)

Nothing surprises me anymore
ok but this is obviously a joke no?
You have to pay 7000 for what he did? Does that make sense?
Wake up babe, an LPL player just did a braindead again.
How do you even come back from that
    Come back from what? Air humping a giant teddy bear on stream for the meme? Come on man lol
        I'm pretty sure we have all done worse in our childhood
            but not on a stream as a public esport guy?
    phodick (photic) came back from worse
        Showdicker
    we've all made mistakes in the heat of passion, jimbo
    Nothing to come back from. Hasn't everyone messed with a stuffy in some strange way like this before in a group setting?
        HUH!?
            You didn't get the memo? It's never too late
    Baron or Elder flip
    Lmao its not like he killed someone
He got too high.
Damn link his twitch, he deserves my sub
Omg I can’t watch the video. Is that hard?
    Idk but they were
He's gotta win worlds now its the only way to come back from this.
Where is the obligatory Dantes comment
    TEDDY BEAR I AM IN YOU
He also made a bet with another streamer and will need to vape on stage during a pro game if he losts. Smoking and vaping is obviously banned in lpl, so.

Iirc he was fined in the past for showing people on stream how to use a bug in league
Lol, he was humping the nose
Now i'm waiting for the Annie hovers from opponents in champ select next split

What in the name of god would possess you to do that
this headline is r/brandnewsentence material

    can you blame him its too many nights
He’s got bad form
Mans out here living his best life, enjoying a bear, and we fining him for this?! Bruh, ridiculous world we live in now.
but when Dantes does it no one bats an eye?!?!?!?
Idk, I think this has had the opposite effect. Consider me a fan of Leyan and IG now LOL.

I get it they want to be professional but fuck me, this is funny and he just looks like he's having a right old laugh, who's harmed by this?!
 -1 million social credit
Aww I expected something worse. That was just him doing a funny reenactment of Toy story 3 and giving Lonzo some well-deserved love to stop him from being evil.

IF he was fined that's already dumb, but the game bans are too much
Perpetually online leads to this
Fix your stupid game
finned
PlushieDreadfuls adding an ad for plushies below this post with a caption "We all could use a friend like you <3" is hilarious 🤣
plz he was punished bc he said he’s gonna vape in the next match
Ah we love dictatorship china :).  
You kick bear you get suspended, you call president pooh you get kil...investigated.
Sanest League of Legend player interaction with a girl
that‘s wrong news he got fine cuz he bet with other streamer on cigarette thing not fuking bear![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|disapproval)
The plastic surgery ghoul looks unimpressed at his humping abilities
Ok but like surely a bunch of league pros have played some BG3, are they all getting fined too?
This shit is absolutely hysterical 🤣 I don’t think any human in history has done such a thing

    I can somewhat see a fine for being "unprofessional" but my got a 2 match ban like bruh what the fuck.

Getting fined and also a ban is excessive.
        The teddy bear thing is part of it but afaik the actual punishment is because he made a bet on stream that with another streamer and said if he lost he'd have to vape on stage. Vaping is, to no one's surprise, strictly prohibited on the LPL stage.
            Yeah if that's the case it makes a lot more sense.
            I wonder how this is worded by policy. Making a bet that you will do something isn't exactly the same as actually doing something. I'm sure Leyan would've just gone back on his word of the bet. 

There's a boundary here obviously as I can understand if you can't say something stupid like I'll matchfix the next game if I lose this bet, but surely nobody gets punished over an innocent joke like If I lose this bet I will purposefully pick Teemo jgl next game. Effectively both are the same thing, but I feel like either way it's a little silly to punish over such a nothing Whopper.
    Yea I dunno how much he gets payed but 7k for this feels pretty unreasonable
    Because it's inappropriate behaviour on stream and he's a public figure representing his team, if he does weird stuff on stream then the org also takes an hit.

It's not that different in any serious sport I think
    China is a different country 
    This is the same country that bans shit like skulls in games, lmao.
        isn’t this a myth? there’s no law banning it it’s just culturally frowned upon or something? there are definitely chinese games with skulls in them. 
            Yes, it's just anti china propaganda that people accept without question or investigation
This is bullshit. The pro players should push back hard against this sort of thing. The League of Legends professional esports disciplinary team should not have this much say in what players do when they are not playing the game.
Why do the cringe people have to give all of us that play video games lol
Not all of us are weird or social outcasts lol but stuff like this makes me see why people think that way
    [removed]
        So many kneckbeards and weirdos that do stuff like Leyan did give all of us a bad name. What we all get associated with. Similar thing to the Yugioh community and all the people that refuse to shower. I didn’t spell check my previous comment, meant to say that people like that give all of us a bad name

    I mean you're on Reddit unironically using the term "cringe shit" so maybe take a deep breath and go touch some grass.
He dry humped a tibbers bear on live stream. Got fined and suspended for 2 matches.
    Tibbers gonna need some therapy sessions now 💀💀
    To me it seems like he's kicking it with his knee not humping.
    deserved
        Idk it‘s pretty funny
            Funny in a sad cringe way, sure. Guess it’s to be expected of this player base

He also got fined 2 months salary lol
    need to see his social credit score after this one
        It's in Bear territory.
    YOU WORK FREE 2 MONTH! SMILE!
whats funny is that LPL has multiple Tier 1 pros that did things far worse than what this guy did, Xiahou is a prime example
    Huanfeng trying to poison his teammate lmao
        I remember reading the article about Huanfeng's backstory and how he managed to make it to Worlds in 2020, some genuinely heartwarming and inspirational stuff. Then he immediately speedruns his reputation in the ground
        Wait what? I know he got caught sleeping with multiple women before world finals but when did this one happen lmao
            He was saying it as a joke but still.
    Image matters a ton in China, so it's about how public something is.  For other pros, a lot of the stuff they did could be handwaved as "he said she said", even if they're really likely.  Leyan was doing it on stream, even though it was just cringe and didn't hurt anyone.  The LDL for example, is full of matchfixing, but they kind of pretend it isn't there, until someone like Bo actually comes forward and admits to it, then he gets hit hard and even after the ban expires, is blacklisted by other LPL teams, when at least some of the current pros participated when they were in the lower leagues.
frfr like who did he even harm???
    My eyes and the bear.
This is China bro, they take the most random of stuff seriously
    Hey dont crap on my boy Winnie
    It's the fact that it's on stream.  For China, and kind of East Asia in general, if it could be handwaved as a rumor, then it doesn't matter how bad it is.  But if it's something as public as on stream and recorded to the internet, the slightest thing gets hit.
Chinese TikTok has the wildest policies, action like this would get you banned which is exactly what happened to his stream. Also he has been doing a lot of game unrelated streams as a side hustle of an influencer recently, LPL officials didn't like that.
The fine is whatever, the suspension is where i think it went overboard imo.
Its china bro
Main reason for the fines and punishment was because he said he’d vape on stage before an official game had he lost the bet he made with another streamer
He claimed he was listening to upbeat music, then saw the huge bear and thought it was adorable, then decided to dance with it... Yeah.
    Was he listening to Cbat or what
>Why would he do that on stream knowingly

When you're 21 and full of hormones and an attractive girl is goading you...
    A quick trip to Japan would take care of that for less than $7000
        Relatedly, it's an open secret that some of the players visit prostitutes.  Leave was just one of the ones who got caught, and flaming his teammates definitely didn't help either.
    You are not "full of hormones" at 21 lol
        Mens sexual drive peaks at age of 20 and starts to slowly go down, so im not sure what you are talking about.

Come back from what? Air humping a giant teddy bear on stream for the meme? Come on man lol

The funniest thing is that Leyan posted about it on weibo and he was like "it's not what it looked like, I just got excited while listening to music and I thought the bear looked cute so I hugged it and shook it" 

It sounds like sth your parents would say when you catch them during the act. Maybe he was listening to the same music as that reddit guy from 2022

Wdym we saw him stuffing the goats on stage
There was an LPL player who abused his girlfriend, she got pregnant, and then threatened to ruin her if she didn't abort. She got an abortion but exposed his ass afterwards.
    Was it Xiaohu or Knight? Or both? I know Xiaohu definitely has the abortion tiger nickname in LPL and iirc Knight is also called abortion hand sometimes
        Knight apparently was the one that forced his at the time GF into abortion, not sure if it was the same with Xiaohu but both did have their GFs do abortion. 

There's also a bunch of other players that got into controversies too like Huanfeng. LPL drama is just fucking wild lmao.
            Not that the abortions are bad, mind you, I was talking about the whole "abort it or I'll ruin you" threat. Coercion isn't okay. Just want to make it clear I wasn't condemning people having abortions.
        Both did, and many more.
        Neither. Xiaohu's ex's friend came out and exposed the accuser of cheating, knight's abortion was under consent and is legal in China- just that abortion in general is looked down upon in China.
            Abortion is not looked down in China in the same way anymore there.  People got used to it after the one child policy.
            It's not the abortion that was wrong, it was him threatening her. Coercion is not acceptable.
                That's my point. Knight never forced the abortion. I ain't gonna be knight's lawyer but I'm not going to let a misunderstanding about a player slide so
        both

they just think its a cute pink bear lol
    It's called Strawberry Bear in China.
        Lol its the exact same in vietnam. strawberry bear. They are everywhere. All the girls are obsessed with it.
            God damn. As an American, this is funny as fuck.
    Its very funny people who haven't seen the movie treat him like hello kitty. It's like those ted bundy flower crown edits. Tbf its toy story but still
    its called the strawberry bear cause of the scent on the plushies
Lotso being successful in China is not a good look lol. He was the dictator of a security state. Where he used his power and enforcers to oppress the other toys and even punish the political dissidents by sending them to the baby play room. 

That’s so fucking funny. You can’t write this better
I don't think being the main antagonist of the movie is a "small side character".
I can somewhat see a fine for being "unprofessional" but my got a 2 match ban like bruh what the fuck.
