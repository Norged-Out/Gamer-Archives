Big if true
    I swear 95% of those leak articles can be a tweet, but I suppose it’s more prestigious if you spit out a 50-word “article” on your website
(Totally not for the ad money)
        News websites are businesses that want to make money?!?! From ads?!?!


You're onto something big here, keep digging!
            big if true.
            I hope when he gets the big scoop he posts it to his own website for adrev.
                They're clearly above stooping so low as to get paid in ad-revenue, don't be absurd.
            I think the point he's making genius is that it doesn't particular warrant an article.

Even some League players have standards.
                > I think the point he's making genius is that it doesn't particular warrant an article.

Eh? If it's news then it's news. From there it's up to the journalist to decide if it's worth monetising or not, and I see no real reason that a journalist should decide that Elon Musk should get the financial reward for their reporting rather than themselves.
                (yes we all know that, genius)

It's a dumb point.

Short news is still news. There's nothing sneaky or underhanded about a news website making money via ads. Genius.
            This makes no sense have you calculated everything why would a business that does work that takes time and effort, want to make money?
        People are trying to earn money, wow!
        God forbid people try to monetize their journalistic work.
        how fucking dare they try to get paid for their work?
        Twitter is just another social media. Why force everyone to use them or scoff everyone who doenst?
        Internet existed before Twitter was a thing. Deal with it
        just install every adblocker you can put your hands on, i never read one single article written by an esport journalist worth the time you waste reading it
        Their other articles are generally longer and are interesting. Think in this case there's not much to add.

Keep in mind it's posted on their website first, shared on twitter as just that, a share. 

Also sorry about the people jumping on the angy angy bandwagon.  This sub is like that.

    it would be weird to have an international tournaments with not at least one team
    Who cares. NA can’t win worlds so we won’t win any other international.
    Idk, MSI already feels like a somewhat irrelevant tournament since they don't get any skins or anything too memorable for winning, a new tournament, specially in a format with not a lot of teams, is gonna be even less memorable. One more international championship will be entertaining, but it's just gonna be more draining for the players.

Edit: I'm not saying another tournament isn't exciting, I just think Riot should find ways to reward teams for winning MSI other than seed advantage, which is probably the most boring reward ever.
        Yeah but that's why it seems this year they did the changes for the 1st and 2nd place teams in MSI gaining their spot or their region a spot at worlds so there's very tangible benefits doing well at MSI.
            Yeah, but that's boring as fuck and since 1st and 2nd get this award it's basically meaningless because everyone already knows who the top 2 regions are going to be. If MSI winners got a single skin of their MVP players it'd be so much more hype.
    Honestly I think it would be cooler if there’s trans regional tournaments like the Asian Games 

So group LPL LCK VCS and SEA as one group 

LCS LEC LLA and CBLOL as another
So that’s why LEC moved to the 3 split format. It was heavily rumored back then too that this was the reason and other leagues are set to follow.
    I wonder if the format of double round robin bo3 will change for LCK if everyone gets three splits. Maybe it becomes single round robin bo3 like LCS is going to be because if it stays the same then that’s one compressed schedule
        While I'm excited for 3 international events, going from single round robin to one feels a little sad. You lose a lot of narrative hype if you get rid of rematches
            Also what happens with LPL who already run a single round robin system? It would have to be super condensed
                LPL plays in a bunch of arenas around the country though. Logistics might be rough, but at least they have venues to use if they have to fit more games in per week.
                    Fair but then playoffs have to be taken into account...LPL would either have to condense that schedule further or revamp it. Which would suck because it would wreck a great bracket format or hard cut the teams that qualify.
                        yeah they'd need to cut a few days to make it like 17 days (3 weekends, 2 weeks in between)

Most recent playoffs was 21 days
                LPL would probably just move to groups of 9 and 8 im guessing and maybe rotate groups or just do a full round robin split across two splits and then half a full round robin for split 3. LCK/LCS would just do 3 single round robin splits.
                it would be absolutely awful if we lose the superior lpl/lck format and they downgrade to something inferior...at worst something like lec.

i am getting my pitchforks ready.
                    The lec format isn't that bad if it get spaced out by an additional international (giving more of a rest ) and also gets a road show( that has nothing to do with format but money).
                        It’s bad since bo1 still exists
            You also gain a lot of narrative importance from only playing a team once a split. Now a Bo3 is so much more important for standings & placement than a single game. There's something to be said of the success of the NFL model in having less games compared to the MLB or NBA where there is a game nearly every day. [In case anyone hasn't seen it, the NFL dominates viewership and it isn't close.](https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/most-watched-shows-2023-ncis-oscars-blue-bloods-super-bowl-yellowstone-1235854795/)
        I wonder if the LCK would keep the existing format but drop down to 8 teams.
    LPL can't just move to 3 splits with 17 teams, though.
    Hopefully not the EU format is pretty bad and has teams gambling their entire split on their meta read in the first 3 weeks. I would rather LPL and LCK stick to their formats.
    Other regions moving to a shit 3 split format? Good, so LEC is not going to be the only region with such an insane disadvantage.

Edit: For everyone who wants an actual answere, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRblGOl1ZU8) is an explanation about the competitive implication the current LEC format has. There are also many other aspects to it like obviously the increased cost leading to no final event, patches, titles etc.
        What's so terrible about it when [both LEC representatives are Top 6 in games played in 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1c9qvd5/msi_teams_ranked_by_amount_of_stage_games_played/)?

It's certainly a better format for stage experience than the previous LEC format (or the current LCS one).
            I think that the main issue that i have heard coaches talk about is the fact, that every split is high intensity high stakes from the very start, so unless you are G2 and your baseline is good enough, you dont have enough time to work on actually fixing your issues, you have to bandaid week to week to get your required wins.

In the old format you often saw teams starting slow then getting their shit together and being decent by the end of the split, but now you can just get eliminated after 9 games which is really scary. Honestly i feel like this format either needs BO3 for the first round robin stage, or keep all 10 teams into BO3 stage to let them cook for a little longer and have time to fuck around a bit and figure themselves out.
                Make it triple round robin BO3. I don’t know why Riot hates making players actually play the game.
            Very watered down awarding 4 champions per year
                The splits will go up in value with 3 international tournaments
                What makes it feel watered down more than anything else is the fact that finals are played in the studio imo.

That being said I think they should combine summer and seasonal finals into some extended split so it's 3 titles like old OGN.
                    I would legit rather have them play regular split online and then have the finals be a big event. 

We already know it costs them a shit ton of money to run the show every weekend and the regular season games have less audience than a uni lecture anyway.
                That’s because winning doesn’t mean anything when it doesn’t qualify the team for an upcoming tournament
            > What's so terrible about it when both LEC representatives are Top 6 in games played in 2024

You mean the part where they already played basically 2/3rd of their season while the other regions have only played 1/2 and how by the end of it their games played will be about the same as NA and other wildcard regions while LCK and LPL will blow all the other regions out of the water?
        Its not shit. Personally I like it and I think its better than before.
            Yah it's not shit. OGN (LCK) used to do 3 splits for the year and it was fine.
                It wasnt just fine, it was better and more exciting than any other league. I used to watch OGN religiously and LCK imo has never been as good. A 16 Team tournament format 3 times a year? Bro that shit was better than worlds, especially since season 2/3 worlds still had byes into the playoff stage and only bo3s in quarters, at season 2 worlds even only the finals were bo5. OGN was peak League esports and still unbeaten imo. Only recently Riot has started to use good formats like the new MSI format
                    My favourite was when there's like a loser league. If you get completely eliminated, you just get seeded in the 2nd league playoff.

If you're a hardcore esports fan, more content for you. If you're casual, then you can just ignore it as it's less prestigious
                    Yup I fucking hate round Robin. OGN will always be more superior to me than LCK cuz of that reason alone. Every game actually mattered.
                        Those tournament splits allowed so many exciting storylines that youd never get in a round robin league
                            Yup everything is just more exciting. All the way from group draws to finals. Good times 🥲
                    How is the old format better??? 3 bo3 in groups determined who advance, losing 2 bo3 mean dropping down to NLB (which nobody cared or watched). The bracket was single elimination tournament, which is worse than current playoff bracket. They only used that format because there was OGN masters in the mid season before MSI was a thing.
                Most people here probably didn't watch around then to know this even.
                    Most people who compare the old OGN format with what the LEC is currently running have never seen what the old OGN format was acutally. You guys just comment "hurr dur OGN had 3 splits". Them both having 3 splits is pretty much the only similarity. The fact that OGN ran the splits throughout the entire year instead of just half the year like the LEC does now is completly ignored for example.
                        Most people throw out LEC having 3 splits as the issue not talking about format or the time. In fact I'd argue the format is actually good and most of the problems people bring up don't have anything to do with a format (like finals being in the studio)
                            No, the problem is not just having 3 splits. Its 3 splits compressed into half a year. How else could they realistically do 3 splits in half a year? 

>(like finals being in the studio)

Yes, because it costs more money, which leads to a lack of budget for events.
                        You act all snobby acting like we never watched OGN. Brother. You also fail to mention the format difference which LEC can still change. 

OGN had way more teams than LEC and was STILL able to pull it off, EPL in counter strike runs fucking 24 team leagues in less time than riot. How did they pull it off? By having multiple streams. By using multiple days. And guess what these two leagues have? Different formats compared to the dogshit round Robin single streams riot Europe wants to do.  

Just cuz you don't want to change shit doesn't mean the idea sucks. Just change your fucking format. Riot is capable of running condensed formats with lots of teams. Look at worlds. They just don't want to.
                            I dont know if you OGN stans just dont get it, but Riot has to schedule the entire season within half a year. **Yes, OGN was good, but the competitive calender of Riot games is not the same as it was in 2013. I would have no problem with 3 splits if we actually utilized the entire year but Riot wont do that.** Riot could also do worlds so it doesnt take an entire freaking month, but they wont. They also have to take current and future eSports like Valorant into account now.
                            One downside of OGN is due to the group + bracket system, some teams would literally never play one another. We've missed out on so many potential hype matches because of that.
                Completely sifferent. Ogn had gsl groups which was way more interesting than eu’s round robin. But riot came in and said that ogns format was trash and forced them to change it to match lcs.
            it's definitely better than what they had before. Still garbage compared to LPL and LCK.
        What's shit about it is the lack of roadshow for the end of split. If they adjust that everything is fine.
        The insane disadvantage of

*checks notes*

Playing 3 splits?????

Maybe you dislike the format but it it's pure cope to say any region is doing bad bc of its format.
        it's still shit if there's a third tournament to qualify for?
            Yes
                insane L take
                Garbage opinion, I want to see more international bo5s
        I'm not a fan of 3 splits because it doesn't work well in the current international schedule.

Also single round robin best of 1 for a "split" is an actual joke, but it sounds like LCS will be experimenting with bo3 which makes that nicer
        OGN used to do 3 splits for a season and they had amazing finals for each split. What are you talking about. Just cuz riot wants to be lazy in EU (and na cuz they want to kill hype finals too) doesn't mean it can't be done well. 

L take. And L edit.
            OGN spread their splits over the whole year instead of half the year as the LEC does now. Winter 2012 started on 11 November and ended on 2 February the following year.

Just look at Astralis last year. They played their last game on 3 July. Their next chance to play official matches would have been with the start of this season on 13 January this year.
            It was nothing like LEC's three splits. Not to mention that the format was completely different.
                You can change the format from this shit round Robin that is just fluff
                    Can be an will be done is very different— I doubt it'll be possible in LCK any more. Worlds teams' off season and transfers are already affected quite heavily by the schedule. Having another season start in November would not be great.

If it was held this year, they'd have one week in between worlds finals and season start. The Feb end conflicts with the spring start too.

With more internationals and Asian Games coming every 4 years, there simply isn't enough days to accommodate a third full season.

That is, unless you're open to treating players like game slaves and giving them no rest at all. That'd work well.

Don't yap around without backing it up with an actual solution or a suggestion for a different format that might work, rather than just say "BuT wE cAn ChAnGe It" without suggesting anything.
        > For everyone who wants an actual answere, here is an explanation about the competitive implication the current LEC format has.

The point about fewer days for "growth mindset" scrims is definitely well taken, but I think that the region's biggest issue internationally in recent years has been the LEC's inability to perform under pressure, particularly in the mid to late game. As a result, I think that the extra performance mentality games are actually a positive, particularly for the best teams. It is definitely a very punishing system for weaker teams, but I think that it is better for the strongest teams, because they get more reps at being required to perform under pressure. 

Furthermore, for the teams that go to internationals, they get more opportunities to play in Bo3s and Bo5s, which I think is very important for developing strategic depth, both in draft and in game. Getting more opportunities to practice adapting to a "cheese" and performing adjustments in front of a crowd with the pressure on is something that I see as a critical positive and worth the degradation of the bottom 3 teams' practice.


Additionally, it makes it harder for a team to abuse cheese for a high finish, because Bo1s have very little impact on your ultimate position when it comes to international qualification. As a result, I think that this system also does a better job of selecting the strongest teams to send, because they end up having to hold up against more strategies and more counters.
        Your cope is next level, gz
        if they make LCK and LPL move to short Bo1s or some bullshit I will be hating
    Which is a shame because it's by far the worst format we've ever had. Why would they ruin LPL and LCK too especially when they are growing.
        I think the format is so bad because there are only two international events so it completely screws up the qualification process. But I agree the LEC format is horrid and I hope other regions can see it's failures and not recreate it.
    I don’t mind it but Worlds will still be the only one that teams really care about. Teams are still practicing and getting familiar with each other pretty much for the first half of the year so early tournament results are going to be high variance.
        You are crazy if you think teams don't really care about MSI.You think TES and BLG don't want to beat the LCK in front of the home crowd or vice versa?
            I think he worded it wrong. The context is most teams care about worlds MORE THAN the MSI. not that they don't care about it.
                There is nothing wrong with Worlds being the most important. Other tournaments can still exist.

In fact it's a good thing that Worlds will continue to be the most important.
                That makes the take even more stupid tbh. So just don't host international tournaments anymore? Someone call up the Dota majors that bc they're not as important as TI they should just cancel them.
            Or that JDG didnt care about their golden road 🙄
            Yea most teams care. LCK teams probably care the least tho.


Edit: caring the least is different than not caring lmao
                Yeah it's not like Kkoma said in interview that they want to win MSI title for Korea after such long time
                    I mean what do you want lck coach to say. everyone said the same line. Do you expect them saying “oh we are ready to get fucked by lpl over again. I don't think this time we can win ff15” ? lol
                    He has to say that. If he says the opposite rabid Korean fans would lose it.
                That is so cope
                Bruh, LCK havent won MSI since 2017 lmao
                    I highly doubt any teams from LCK, LPL or EU don't care about MSI. Especially with this being one of the best opportunities EU has to play vs the best teams in the world (and with G2 saying that they want to get better)
                        The "competitive spirit" in this game has always seemed weird to me. Like pros saying they don't care about Rift Rivals, MSI isn't a big deal etc. In Starcraft you'd have the top players flying halfway across the world to play in a random tournament with a $2k prize pool just for the competition.
                            Pros have never said MSI wasn't a big deal. It's always this weird set of fans who seem to believe if it's not Worlds it's not important. Like this fanbase is so bizarre even compared to other esports.
                            Rift rivals was literally a meme tournament though so I get not caring about that
                                I always thought it was a wasted opportunity. It could've been a good tournament for bragging rights between EU and NA. Maybe expand it to the top 4 teams from EU and NA, 2 groups of 4 in to a double elim bracket so there are more games. Pros not caring about it was sort of my point though, it's like they don't care about competition just for competition's sake. At the end of the day you can only win what is in front of you, and you should want to win everything.
                    Yet they win worlds regularly. Clearly they care about both tournaments equally.
                The fan pressure on KR teams to win vs LPL is crazy,they were getting death threats last year after MSI
        It would be interesting if LoL moved to a major-like format where each event would be around the same prestige as the other ones.
            Tbh it will never be the same as long as worlds winner gets their own championship skin ,while other events get a slice of the worlds price pool
        I need you to type the words "JDG players and staff did not care about winning the golden road" as a reply to me. Please. It would be so funny.
            The correct question is would JDG rather win (winter international tournament + MSI) or win Worlds? Which combo do they care about more? Obviously yeah if you can, you want to win it all.
                > I don’t mind it but Worlds will still be the only one that teams really care about

So you acknowledge this is false?

Holding worlds in higher regard doesn't imply lack of care about non worlds tournaments. Teams would consider worlds the most prestigious title while still greatly caring about other titles/tournaments. Teams *really care* about winning MSI. Denying that is ludicrous.
        Stockholm Syndrome in a comment. You are speaking from being so accustomed to the current system.

We have so many other sports and esports with several important tournaments in a year. Hell we even had it in League too before the LCS era of 2013 onward.
            Yeah the pro league fandom is bizarre. I don't think I've ever seen a fandom with consistently such bad takes on international tournaments, formats and results. 

Like what Dota and CS majors don't matter if they're not the biggest tournament in the year? Wtf.
                The vast, vast majority of League of Legends esports fans have this as their first esport. That much is incredibly obvious.

Another thing that is incredibly obvious is that almost no one was around in 2012 for the tournament circuit.

The sheer amount of ignorance from League fans about completely settled topics in general esports is astounding and frustrating.
        Worlds is kind of not super amazing till they add ab actual prize pool like dota.
        I like the idea of having the one big one but wish they would do something for the other tournaments. Maybe get an emote with your name for winning MSI or an icon?
            Make an official MSI skin (I think it's Conqueror LoL skin) for each role and give the winning team a Chroma with the player's signature.
        MSI structure and format is superior and more competitive, so this is just wrong
    LEC is on 4 split format and there is no news that any other league changes their

Your comment has no sense
        They literally are on a 3 split format, what are you smoking. Season finals isnt split. Also its logical to assume other will have 3 splits so they dont have international tournament in the middle of split
Pretty nice to have a third international but I hope the LCK and LPL don't butcher their formats for it though wording implies we'll need some form of change which sucks.

LCK ruining their brilliant domestic double round best of 3 format and the LPL ruining their beautiful playoffs format is depressing.
    OGN used to do 3 tournaments/splits a year. This is where the famous beach tournament happened. I'm sure it'll be great domestically for them.

Throwback to 3 splits of OGN

T1 winning summer finals without dropping a match: https://youtu.be/7E5mjBtuSe8?t=16416
        Yea but it’s not a perfect system either. We never got to see KT Arrows vs SSW in 2014 Summer
            Not KT's fault SSW could not beat Samsung blue in Korea. And let's be real. Lord Kakao would've obliterated them. 😎😎

At least finals was still a banger though. Not complaining about kt arrows vs blue at all.
            The format tradeoff was getting the white/blue civil war for the finals spot instead of allowing the finals to be a civil war. 

I think even though there are many universes where SSW could have beaten KTA in the finals, this is less a problem of the format and more them not overcoming blue on the day. The reality of tournaments and formats is they all reward consistency and you have to show up each and every day.

Pursuing the ultimate best format with no perceived flaws is probably a folly. 3 splits as an excuse to get a 3rd international should be healthy for the scene as an entertainment product and for the competitive aspect.
        Their winter split didn’t have great format. It was like worlds with 4 groups but they played only 1 BO3 against each other in their group if I’m not wrong
            Their winter, spring and summer had the same format as each other. They only revamped the format in 2015 after they removed sister teams and winter split
                the OP was just referring to the 2014 format, yep. Although regions could potentially change formats between splits in current day. Using a new winter split for experimenting for example.
                    He/she specified that “their winter split” when in actuality it’s was the format used for all splits prior to 2015. Also I think OP forgot that it was a Bo2, 4 group format where the winner got 3 points. So the crux isn’t winter split but rather the format used
                        I went back and double checked for curiosity. 2013 spring had 2 groups of 6 while 2013 summer had 4 groups of 4. They increased the  amount of teams between spring and summer in 2013.

The "format" change, if you would even call it that, was just to fit in the increased amount of teams. It was still bo2 single round robin into playoffs, but with playing less teams because of the smaller groups. The playing less teams was ops concern and did change - for clarity.

This is why the LPL will have the most difficulty fitting 3 splits, they have the most amount of teams so they will either

1. have to go for a format that won't have each team play each other team while maintaining bo3 (groups, 1x8 1x9). upper limit 72 regular season games for a team per year.

2. just do bo2 (16 bo2 matches for each team), this will likely mean increasing matches per day from 2->3 & 3->4. 92 regular season games per team each year.

3. Somehow insanely do 16 bo3 per team which would mean an upper limit of 144 regular season games for the year.
            Yea 2014 was the 16 team 4 group round robin bo2. i personally really like experimenting with different formats (which 3 splits allows you to do) and enjoyed seeing the 16 team leagues back in the day, but I can see how it would be off-putting. I would say the lack of saturation on playing each team was more of a "16 teams in our league" problem and wouldn't happen in current day lck.

The actual playoffs/bracket stage of 2014 winter was great though.
                its only good if you liked most of the teams. back in the day, if the team you liked was pretty mid and got pulled into a group with strong teams you watch 3 bo3s and wait for next split.
                    True, incredible miracles would get like 9 matches a year. that doesn't seem like enough from the perspective of those players/fans. I wasn't ever a fan of those teams except maybe jin air so I never had those thoughts.
        wow I can't believe I forgot about the beach tournament
        Seeing all these new league fans know nothing of league history is so strange to me lmao
        thats a nice throwback...the names, the champs, the map and everything just looks so weird now.

i feel like we moved on from that system for a good reason and I don't want to go back to it.
            > i feel like we moved on from that system for a good reason

I wouldn't say that. The reason is "Riot said fall in line". https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ogn-the-champions-winter-future-uncertain-as-riot/1100-6438316/

OGN wanted to continue hosting competition including a 3rd winter split. it was wildly successful, **so much so that riot said "oh no you don't"**

The reason is OGN was told explicitly by Riot that if they want to be able to broadcast for a few more years they have to match other regions splits/format. They then phased out sponsors in preparation for Riot taking over and Riot not allowing 3rd parties to host tournaments any more (OGN).

During the 3 circuit era OGN had different major sponsors for each split. They then cut down to 2 sponsors and splits. Then they cut down to no major sponsors, because they were not allowed to host tournaments. Then they were kicked out.

The good reason was "riot is the only company with broadcasting riots".
                OGN was great. their format wasnt good for a league competition. I don't know, you leave out so much important context and you are not even giving a single argument for the ogn format. 

[https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Champions/2013\_Season/Winter#Overview](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Champions/2013_Season/Winter#Overview)

like wtf is that shit. OGN was successful despite that format. if that format is so great, why did other leagues fail with it? why is no other league copying that format? why did other league that had bo2 moved on from them?

why are other esports not using bo2?

yes, riot unfairly pushed out OGN and other third party tournament organizers, but holy fuck. can you form a coherent logical argument instead of blindly hating?
    If Riot butchers LPL playoffs format then it's going to suck. Not to mention LPL also has Demacia Cup with new rules so when are the players going to rest?
        dont teams that went to worlds normally use subs in demacia cup anyway
            new rules make it so non worlds qualifying teams need to use their main roster iirc
                >dont teams that went to worlds
        Maybe Demacia Cup gets expanded in importance to be a qualifier? Who knows lol Im not in charge of this shit (thank god)
        Literally the reason I started watching LPL over other regions, not like I'd stop watching but I'd be bummed out if playoffs had to change.

Demacia Cup is already kind of a show match, lots of prospects and lower tier players already play, it could more or less just become a 4fun tourney for subs and I wouldn't be all that upset.
    Probably 1 bo3 round robin into playoffs would be the easiest way for the eastern leagues to adjust to the shorter splits.
        LPL already does that since there’s 17 teams
        LPL is already a single round robin.
            Damn I forgot there’s 300 LPL teams. Good luck to them figuring out how to shorten their seasons. Hopefully they don’t move to bo1s or something backwards
    Well at the very least they can keep Summer format intact since this event will only be between Winter and Spring.
    another international tournament would make any domestic format change worth it imo, but hopefully it has as little impact as possible
    Let's hope players that are successful have even less time off, due to filled schedule wooooh
    They could just decide to do a mini-guantlet tourney leading up to the additional international tournament based on the current seedings.
    I mean. You can move back worlds by a few weeks, most of the time it ends by October anyways, there is plenty of space in the calendar
        But the player contracts end in November. Teams can’t be playing at Worlds with their players going FA in the middle of the tournament.
    Double round robin bo3 is brilliant? In what world? Why have Leagues when you can have tournaments? Theres no way anybody thinks current LCK is a better product than OGN.
        3 split format had it's own flaws such as KT Rolster Arrows winning summer and not going to worlds.

Also relies a lot on how the groups are drawn, imagine if a group had SSB/SSW and NJBS and one of them get knocked out while other "bad" teams go through due to the groups.

OGN's format had flaws, and it worked moreso because league was in its infancy era, the only benefit of the 3rd international would be more LPL vs LCK games but for every LCK/LPL hype match you get a LCK/LPL vs the west which are boring since the result is effectively forgone.
    Double round robin is ass lol. Completely rewriting history. LEC crowned a champion, got to celebrate MAD miracle run, had a mini off season, all while we were dicking around for 5 weeks in the LCK waiting for the next T1 vs GenG series. Yeah LCK playoffs were more hype but regular season being this long is pointless. 

I’d rather have 2 playoffs instead of 1. It’s also fun seeing who’s the best team at more points in the year.
    im completely fine with all regular seasons getting butchered if it means theres more china vs korea
        While true, for the 1/2 china vs korea series we get, we also get like 3-4 China/Korea vs EU/NA series which aren't fun because the latter just get bent over.
    LCK Butchering their brilliant double round Robin? Nah give me back the 3 OGN tournament splits per seasons. I hate round Robin so much.
fuck it, if we have MSI and Worlds for the best, make the third tournament only available to the worst teams from every region

MSI format, but the losing teams keep advancing into the rounds
    Rift Rivals but they're not really rivals, they're struggling.
        Rift survivals, losers get demoted and are not allowed to play in a tier 1 league for a year!
            Relegations with a whole bunch of extra steps ?
                Special relegations if you will!
        Grift Rivals
    The final losers region gets one less spot at worlds
        This would actually be hilarious
        I would support this. EU fans always try to claim that the bottom of the LPL is even worse coz of 16 teams. Let’s see them eat their words.
        Na having online 8 teams storting to make sense.
        HOLY
    Oscar night: the tournament
        Relevant flair
    It would be really cool to compare the skill *floors* of every league.

But also I could 100% see this being a weird thing of teams inting the end of the season to try to make international competition.
        Best way go judge that would be to make an international Tier 2 tournament at least for the 4 major regions. It would help compare the "medium" level of each region and put spotlight on true gems while giving them international exposure & experience on stage.

But this is very unrealistic as it would be a logistical nightmare when even Tier 1 teams barely face eachother twice a year and all 4 regions have widely different systems for their second league.
            Not to mention there is one particular major region with uh... a less than impressive t2
    I remember the demand letter from 9 lck teams that they wanted to do this but riot korea denied it.
        Got a source/more info? That sounds hilarious
            they wanted a tournament for all of the lower placed teams, not actually lose a series to advance.

I'd love to see that tbh, NA 4-6, EU 4-6, vs LPL 5-9, LCK 5-9 - nice 16 team single elim bo5 tournament or something.
    I'm trying to decide if this would be better or worse as nemesis draft
        Well I don't personally have to play it so I'm going to say its much better than nemesis draft.
    I like the idea of the 4 worst teams in each region competing. But it shouldnt be loser advances or teams will just throw for exposure
        If both teams are throwing, who wins?
            no one, you'll actively try to suicide in game. I guess you might learn some stuff about wave manipulation, but it'd mostly be afking and trying to get enemy minions to push faster.

Legit might be the most boring shit to watch
                Spoken like someone who hasn't watched Oscar Night, legitimately the most entertaining series I've ever seen.
            This actually happened in an LPL series years ago. For the purposes of playoff seeding, neither LGD or IG wanted to get put on the same side of the bracket as EDG. It's known as "Oscar Night" because the players are acting their hearts out to make it look like they're not throwing.
        They won't, no player with a drop of pride will want the distinction of being known as the worst team in the world
    BRO vs Rogue would go hard.
    Biggest loser.
    And the worst team of the tournament wins it all.
    Fearless draft or bust.
    They should eliminate lcs, and make it a reverse champions league.  Worst teams from every region.  It’ll raise the quality of lcs 
So the Valorant model? Hopefully they get a better format than in Valo lmao
    Teams getting to play like 3 matches every 4 months is a great format!
        Yeah that shit so ass man lmao. Play 5 matches and you are out lol
            Not even - this Masters (MSI Equiv?) FNC lost their first 2 games in the VCT EMEA qualifier earlier this year and they were out of the major tournament, no double elim for qualification. TH and KCORP got a tonne of practice in their version of the "play in" before playing against FNC. 

They played 2 games and didn't play another game until this month...
                Team Heretics didn't get tons of practice because they didn't go to the Play Ins (they were first of their Group) unlike KC.

Funnily enough, Fnatic have an advantage over KC and TH because they saw all their strats.
                not even lost their first 2, they won their 1 (one) group stage game then lost their top 4 match. Lost one bo3 and were eliminated.

They were eliminated from 2023 worlds on August 23rd, and started EMEA stage 1 on April 4th.

They played two official circuit bo3s over a 7 month period.
                i mean its not as bad as you are making it out to be but i agree its not great - Leo already confirmed they will be adjusting for next season accordingly. FNC also had a notable advantage coming into that format anyway and realistically a month break is not that big of a deal lol
    the sheer amount of downtime for tier 1 players valorant is absurd honestly. they want people to watch tier 2 3 tournaments and its like fuck that noise lol
        The one thing that keeps making me play league is watching eSports. I understood that when I realized I hadn't touched Valorant the whole time tier 1 was off...
    If its valorant without the downtime it'll be great
Man LPL players going to die. Hopefully they don't ruin their glorious playoff format
Is this seperate from the Saudi tournament?
    Yes this will be a riot tournament like MSI and Worlds
        Or... the Saudi tournament will henceforth **be** the 3rd tournament.
            Title says Riot plans to host. Since the saudi thing is not hosted by riot I dont think thats true.
LCK players gonna be burn out, scrimming, solo queue and players streaming is a must for the org then 3rd international event.
    That's how the West equalizes. Burn them out until they just don't show up anymore! /s
        get ready for the west coast weed meta
    Probably will be single round robin bo3 I would have to imagine
    Burnout is a western affliction
        There’s a reason there’s fuck all pros close to 30 . There’s only so long anyone can go on the way they do .
            [deleted]
                I’m not talking about taken or any other esport , I’m talking about league and their very competitive and long season
                    league isnt old enough for players to be that old yet. even the oldest players that are playing for a long time are maybe 27-28
                Well I guess if we just ignore every difference between league and tekken, then yeah the league players are just being wacky Lil goofballs quitting their lucrative careers.
        Nah, Showmaker has been very vocal about how burnt out he is and how it’s affecting his performance.

There’s also a reason why most Asian pros only play for a few years then fuck off to a less hardcore region.
        [removed]
            Reminds me of the guy in Eurovision movie lol
        Burnout is a Western thing because working for 120+ hours a week isn't normalized in the West (for a good reason) like it is in Asia.

Thinking burnout isn't a thing gives off the exact same vibes as people telling men to just 'thug it out' any time they have something dragging them down on the mental side. You are weak if you can't work 18 hours a day/let your silly little thoughts affect you.
i’m gonna say flat out- i’m worried that this might be the death of road shows. we’ve already witnessed the LEC do this, and if the LCS has to move to a 3 split format to compensate this… i don’t see how another road show happens
    I wish the LEC would scrap the season finals and just only have split finals. 

FNC v G2 as a split finals (as a FNC fan) just did not feel hype enough really. And it's a FNC v G2 finals, that should be the most hype game in the LEC.
        my assumption is next season everyone will move to 3 single round robin splits (ig LPL would do a 1/2 a round robin per split so effectively 1.5 round robins across 3 splits) - i don't think the 4 domestic trophies is very good for hype and 3 fits way better 1 per intl event.
    Road show?
        finals that are on the road and not held in studios
    I mean if we get 3 international road shows instead it might be worth it.
    I mean if we're going to get only one road show a year moving forward, it's always going to be the one before Worlds. Making it 3 split is not going to change things.
I absolutely cannot believe some people here prefer only 2 international tournaments and not being happy about this, you guys are so lost. 

ill take an open circuit back in an instant
    You can tell they only watch League if they think only 2 international tourneys is okay lmao
        Mate, go back in history to Season 2. Dude we had IEMs, we had IPL, we had MLG, we had OGN which btw. used to be an international tournament, CLG.EU almost won an OGN split.

If we never had these tournaments, we would never have the legendary Moscow 5 team which had most of its successes in IEMs.

Hell, they might have won Season 2 worlds had they actually had bo5s the entire playoffs, even 12 years ago bo3 in quarter and semi finals was a dogshit decision, OGN already had bo5s the entire playoffs through and i bet youll find a summoning insight episode where monte and thorin called them out for that.

I mean Riot has always been ass in terms of formats but Season 2 and Season 3 worlds have been especially garbage. Only now, in 2024, 13 years since their esports has gotten popular, are they starting to introduce decent formats
            I still remember when CLG went to Korea (NA and EU) to compete in OGN. That shit was incredible. Pretty sure Hotshot (and CLG) cooked up some absolutely cursed shit too, like Mid Nunu, mid lane swaps. A whole bag of tricks, some worked, some failed miserably. 

It's another reason I always hated when people claimed that "NA teams would suck" if they went to Korea. CLG EU ended up getting 2nd, and although CLG NA got 8th, they got pretty unlucky with the bracket. They were put in a group with CLG EU, and they both got out, but they dropped a game to their EU counterpart, which put them in the bracket against Azubu Frost, who went on to win that event, beating both halves of the team, and also being the runner up to Worlds that year. So despite their 8th place finish they only lost to CLG EU (2nd) and Azubu Frost (1st)

Dig was also there, and they got super unlucky too. They ended up in the group with Najin Sword (regarded as one of the best teams at the time) and Azubu Frost, so they didn't make it out of groups.
        It depends. I watch fighting games and smash a lot, which is ONLY tournaments. It definitely makes the major tournaments very interesting, but smaller minor events that don't have international competition aren't super interesting (to me).

It wouldn't really be a problem for league to be only tournaments like it used to be, but it's also because of the product Riot has cultivated all these years. The more tournaments you add, the less the regular season will matter, and even more so for teams at the bottom of the standings. 

Worlds is also the headliner event, as much as I enjoyed last years MSI (thankfully they finally fixed the formatting for it) it isn't all that meaningful. In fact the biggest "reward" about MSI isn't even the trophy or the money, it's the fact that you get a guaranteed seed at Worlds. 

The more tournements they add, the more downtime there is for lesser teams too. Meaning the regional leagues *might* suffer.

If they went to tournament ONLY on the other hand, then I'm okay with it. Like the good ol' days.
        Meh, some people are fans of teams and not the eSport as a whole. I will pretty much only watch FNC games unless I am bored that day then I'll watch the rest of the games, but I will usually always make time for the FNC game.

Some fans probably don't care about the 3rd international if they support a team like GIANTX/KCORP etc knowing the chances of them qualifying for anything is slim. 

(Please read my comment and understand I literally used the word 'some' several times and I did no way insinuate ALL fans are like this)
    Open circuit is mad overrated, I'd rather have 3 or 4 international tourneys and good regional leagues than a ton of international tournaments and basically no regional play like in CS
    you mean like in dota where you get invited/direct seeded teams backing out because of scheduling conflicts or logistical constraints, or because there's some other tournament more worthy of their time?

and twice a month you get congratulations posts on some team winning Fukuoka Major or something being an S-Tier tournament but arguably holds less weight because the actual best teams were competing in Brazil or something

And apparently Fnatic won it with Jensen? but that's no big surprise because last week he was with Dignitas and next week he'll be on DFM
    Simple. I don't care for this cross league tournaments outside of worlds being the big playoffs at the end. 

This offers nothing or interest to me
    I like more tournaments, but lets not pretend like the others are nearly as prestigious as worlds. It's all about worlds.

The more tournaments they add, the less the other splits and tournaments matter in my opinion. It's Riot's fault for cultivating a league system in the first place. If ALL you have are tournaments, most are pretty interesting, but the more international events you have, the less the regular season will seem to matter.

There's also a case of players being burned out. Specifically Chinese and Korean players, who are already playing the most League of Legends all year round. NA players just get more vacations and probably more roster shuffling in the downtime (assuming they don't make it to these events).
CANADA
Please, a tournament of national teams. I don't care if KR always wins, we need a world cup of countries.
    Eu will have so many national teams then lmao team France team spain team denmark
        a team france vs team spain would be fucking bonkers
            KC vs Mad on steroids.
                yeah and with the reach both Ibai and Kameto have many people not even interested in gaming would watch. Everyone in Spain loves a france vs spain in anything lmao
            Isn't that just EU Masters  already?
                nah most eu masters teams have imports not many of the teams are made up of 1 region of players
        In Europe it could be amazing
            Daily reminder Ibai was hosting one and Riot blocked it
                Completely moronic by Riot. A EuroCup would’ve done insane numbers and engagement.
                    Anything to maintain that control chokehold they love so much.
                        Unless it's saudi money xD
        A national teams tournament sounds a lot more fair as an EU tournament than a world one.
        team Poland with 4 junglers and Trymbi
    I want this just because it would be hilarious to see the Canadian team be better than the USA team.
        Dhokla-Blaber/Contractz-Palafox/APA-Yeon-Busio

vs

Licorice/Sniper-Tomio-Jojo-Massu-Vulcan

Honestly, I dunno now that Yeon's a top tier ADC in the league and with Vulcan trending downwards. Definitely a lot closer than it was a couple of years ago. Saying this as a Canadian too.
            Yeah looking at this it's definitely closer than it was a few years ago when EG with vulcan/jojo was top of the league. The NRG topside really saving this team, Palafox and Dhokla are a lot better than the equivalent best American mid/top from a couple of years ago.
            This would be really hype honestly. It could go either way and by now, all these players have performed on top teams in the LCS except Tomio
        That would be great if this event is finally Toronto's compensation event
            Have them play at Rebel for the true experience
        It would be pretty rough for the Canadians though because they have no junglers. The best one in the NA ecosystem right now is probably Tomio and even then he's a sub for SR (SR should totally promote him to main roster though).
        Why would it be hilarious?

Population isn't the be all end all of who's best at something
            Because as an American, we tend to see canada as an afterthought and its funny to me when they are better than us at something.
    You'd need a whole split of national teams to get the chemistry right going into the international event if you don't want it to be a clown show (or an auto win for the country with all national players).
        Not really. 

The iihf championships are starting soon and they're just so much as naming rosters.
    That shit aint ever happening outside of Asia games
    Yeah I'd love that. Imagine Spain vs France lmao
    not to brag but I kinda did a post about this some time ago with the teams and everything:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1bl88pi/the\_league\_of\_legends\_world\_cup\_national\_teams/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1bl88pi/the_league_of_legends_world_cup_national_teams/)
        Oh, thanks for sharing it! You did an awesome job and it makes me even more hopeful that someday something like this can be done.
    National team games are almost always worse because the lack of synergy between players
    Yea. Give me an actual world championship tournament.
    nah that would instantly make it a 4fun event. The lol circuit needs more serious international matches not this shit
    No we don't. Who tf cares.
Prediction: it will be held in Saudi Arabia.
Based
About time! Having only two international tournaments a year robbed us of so many insane matchups. More international tournaments please  
Quite rare W from Rito
Rare Riot W
    I mean it’s gonna be in Saudi Arabia so not sure about that
        How do you know that?
        don't care you can cry about it on Twitter
        Saudi Arabia production is 100x better than LEC and LCS combined, so good.
Please double elim
Good. I know three-split style that LEC plays is not the best but with some improvements it could be a lot more exciting and could be copied onto other regions, especially if there's a big international competition after every split.
    the best thing about the LEC format right now, is the amount of non playoffs game vs playoffs games is the lowest. and lets all be honest playoffs games are always just so much more suspense since every game has meaning.
    The LEC 3-split format would work great if there were actual finals and not these garbage ones in the same studio with 150 people in attendance. It's laughable and kills all the hype before it's even started. Also some cringy, awful trophy.
        That's not a format problem but yeah, I said with some changes. That being one of those but I don't think it's happening. It's a bigger chance they change the other competitions to resemble LEC's because it's cheaper. But we'll see.
            imagine seeing LCK's hype as fuck spring finals and deciding "we gotta make that be like LEC"
                I mean, I agree, but it's about money. People still seem to not understand Riot loses money whenever they organize a venue. Even big ones, like World Finals, Riot still loses money. And they probably have statistics that show it doesn't make a difference as far as money spent from the fans in-game, which is the whole point of having an esports, promotion of the game.
                    So they are so low on funds that they are organizing a third international tournament next year??
                        If they change the formats of other regions to LEC format, that will mean all those regions will only have one 'event' per year. So they'll use the money they would use there to hold one more international tournament. Not only they get to host one venue, instead of 2-3 small ones, they also give the fans what they've been asking for for a long time. So people will be like, "Sucks we only have one venue event per year, but at least we have three international competitions."

This is at least how I think they are thinking. I don't know what their plans are, I just know all they care about is money, and they have advanced statistics to know what brings them the most ROI. They don't care about making esports grow, they just care about bringing in more players and having those and present players spend money on the game.
                            You think their plan is to make lck finals be played in lolpark instead of national stadiums? That would be awful. Id rather lck and lpl be produced properly than giving western teams another chance to lose.
                                Yeah, I think that's their plan. I agree it would be awful and I do hope I'm wrong, but this company has made think very cynically about the future of the game and everything surrounding the game so yeah, we'll see.
Are comments on sheep esports posts botted?

So many of these posts seem to get a disproportionate amount of interactions regardless of time of posting.

On top of that so many of the comments seem to use the same 3 or 4 buzz words.
Wondering how LPL will fix their schedule to accomodate another tourney
    If I had to guess, they'll be returning to a 2 group format with single round robin
This is great news. I wonder how this will affect LPL though, the 3 split format is harder to adapt for them since they have more teams.
Nice
I love me more international games, but I'm concerned about the implementation and how it will affect the already taxing schedule of especially the eastern players.
God bless
2025? Damn riot really giving the fans what they’ve asked for for over a decade…
Another showdown tournament for LCK and LPL, and the other region just become punching bag for them.
Dumb Idea, watering down these events will make them lose the appeal
Good domestic and less internationals > bad domestic and more internationals. I am a huge fan of the way LCK works now it would be a shame to lose it for some wish MSI
Riot fired 530 employees along with so many people working on the e-sports scene, added an extra split and now they are adding another tournament? How is less quality more quantity the play here?
    Lmao, are you seriously complaining about having more international tournaments?
        That is not what I said at all though. I'm trying to understand Riot's thought process here because clearly they're attempting to save money where they can and tournaments are extremely expensive so them adding more splits to major regions, more tournaments and more costs seems backwards. Quality over quantity just seems to work better in that case unless that tournament is paid off by oil money like the one this summer.
            ESL and Saudi money will fuel the event over there and if riot offloads more to Saudi/esl then they won't need those employees
I hope we eventually get an international tournament between the non-top teams in the major regions.
    You need someway to exclude the top teams without accidentally incentivizing teams to do worse just to make internationals.
        Could just do it the way it works in European soccer. 

Multiple tiers of tournaments.
        You could do it in the same gap between splits that you hold MSI in.For example,the tournament could be going on now,between split end and MSI in May.You could also make MSI last one less week by condensing the schedule and have that one more week for a tier 2 international event.
Considering Sheep Esports' track record I ain't believing any of this until I start seeing confirmations from other sources or Riot itself.
I would much rather see localized tournaments rather than a third, fully international tournament. A tournament of the Americas, which would be LCS, vs LLA, vs CBLOL would be 10 times more interesting to me than seeing LCS and EU get stomped by LCK and LPL again:
    Yeah. Promoting regional rivalries seems way more exciting. East will have Korea x China (and some PCS/VN teams) as well.

Provided the tournament format doesn't suck, like Rift Rivals.
    The more international tournaments there are, the better LCS/LEC teams would be because theyre getting exposed to better play no?
        Not really as the core issue is developing youth talent.
    Top 4 LCK/LPL seed so #1 faces #4 and so on of each region, double elim bracket.

Guaranteed banger of a tournament. 

Do MSI for every other region. Seed top 2 NA/Eu into a double elim bracket and then have a play-ins for the final 4 spots of the #1 seeds of minor regions and the 3/4 of NA/Eu

Also would be a banger tournament.
    Agree
I know this is unpopular but i don't think we really need a third tournament.
    More tournaments wouldnt be a issue if they didnt take minimum 3 weeks to complete :^)
        This is a self-imposed problem by Riot. Hopefully they have now realized that you can run events much quicker. Other esports always realized it.

Hell even IPL5 in League of Legends did it.
            MSI could be a lot shorter, but I doubt that Worlds will ever be less than 4 weeks long. Riot wants the event to be a roadshow.
                ...but why?
            Alternatively I do like being able to always watch the tournaments live.

Sucks trying to spend the whole day avoiding spoilers otherwise.
                That's sadly the life for almost every Western fan these days. Even when it's in Europe, it doesn't start very late in the day because it'd be too late in the prime timeslot for China and Korea.
    I like international competition better than regional competition so if that's the trade off I don't mind.
    You hate watching the best teams play against eachother more than twice a year?
        The best teams play against each other all the time in lck and lpl domestic leagues.
            Yea, why would we ever want more LCK vs LPL matches. Who would watch that? More tournaments definitely aren't needed.
        I like that it feels special and i don't like how crammed the calendar will be with 3 Tournaments and lck/lpl having to adapt to 3 splits.
    Yeah man good point, 2 international events each year - one of which is only had 1 seed from each region for many years - is definitely enough, why would we want more international games?


I mean, other esports have way more international games. Who would want to see boring matchups like G2 vs SKT when we could have more Dignitas vs 100T??
        Either have regional leagues or only tournaments, pick one of the two.
            Dont play ignorant. It's not a dichotomy. 


You can have both but a different balance between international tourneys and a regional League.


Compare CSGO and its many international tourneys each year to Valorant with 3 international championships and then League with its measly 2.
    i honestly agree. if people want more international best of 5’s then i think riot should take the approach of just adding more games to the 2 existing tournaments. i know i might be stretching it here but simply making more tournaments is too similar to CSGO internationals which has so many tournaments that i simply don’t understand how anyone cares; it removes the prestige. 

going from 2 to 3 obviously doesn’t change much or devalue worlds and MSI but i hope that’s the cap.
    Is it too upsetting for you to watch NAs most overhyped team get destroyed 3 times a year instead of 2?
        Yeah it’s the NA teams that are overhyped, not G2.
        Atleast they made playoffs last worlds. EU on the other hand
            Same shit though. NRG was just a free ticket to semis for Weibo
                Atleast NRG was a ticket, EU was just a bunch of turds that got flushed down the toilet
                    I mean agree they both sucked
        Believing in NAmen memes as overhyping….
        sanest league player
            I rarely play league these days only watch it. I play tft and valorant
                Sorry, sanest valorant player
        Or maybe you just dilute the importance of international play for the sake of trying to save viewership
            What do you mean? How is more international games ever a bad thing? You don’t want to watch the best teams play against each other? Prefer to watch g2 winning in Europe with no competition and NA teams playing in Disneyland?
Yes they were already planning it as far back as 2022
Soo Qatar this time?
Would be cool to have it as a season starter right after teams form. Then at worlds we would get to see how the new teams evolved in the year.
OMG WORLD CUP HOPIUM
    Eh no i wanna see  teams from lck and lpl,  lol World cup will be more suited for the Summer event they are trying this year in United Arabs emirates
        The Arab event is something different from a national world cup entirly and i hope it gety boycotted tbh.
Oh, you mean rift rivals?
Great, another event, another pass. Geniouses.
so 2025 schedule is going to be fsi msi esports world cup psi
In that case, the LCS single RR bo3 format would make more sense
Finally, CBOLÃO International
Rift Rivals's return?
Would love to see a World Cup but the wording of the article makes this seem a little unlikely.
Arena International Tournament when please?????
we just need a real country world cup, korea hard win but i really want to watch it, the only one that was done was when competitive lol was just starting and it was never done again.
we already had a third one, called All-Stars Invitation. I haven't followed the scene for about 6 years, did they cancel all-star?
    Been gone for years
I really hope that lcs just makes it double round robin bo3 in spring and not just make it a whole other split cause I hate it in the lec. It makes splits feel less special imo
Conference League (of legends)
Western fans should be happy. The only way you can level up is by playing better competition more frequently. This could be a great thing for reducing region parity (this is mostly cope).
Wow! 10 years to late
So... this is a third International Tournament, but technically it will be a first International Tournament of the year?
why are people complaining about getting a third international tournament when we've experienced like 10 years of having like 9 international bo5s to watch in a year (with tons of these being domestic matchups), this is good news.
I think the best idea is to have a semi-franchised system where both franchised teams and rosters that aren't part of the main LoL esports ecosystem have a path to qualify for Worlds.
Well didnt read the article but is it a Riot hosted or do they plan to let 3rd party TOs to host? Given that Saudi money is now in play and they already going to prototype it with the Worlds esports cup or whatever that is going to happen later this year in Riyad.
I really hope it’s a west and east tournament. As an NA fan I would love an event with just western teams so we can have a realistic chance of winning something. It’s not fun going in to every tournament knowing there is no chance of winning and the hope is to lose less hard than Europe
    lol if they did that I would only care about the eastern tournament, and Im from the west..
        The great thing is we would have 2 tournaments to watch with both being competitive
        Nah, EU vs NA would be pretty hype as well
    I really agree, plus the lower rated LCK/LPL teams are also pretty interesting. In the LPL you'd have FPX and WBG 5th and 6th, in the LCK you have KT and KDF 5th and 6th. Some of these teams could do real damage in a tournament.
    We had Rift Rivals and mostly nobody cared
        That’s because right rivals was not an actual tournament. Id they didn’t have it randomly in the middle of a split and had teams play to win rather than just a region winning it would have been awesome
            Unfortunately even if the tournament was serious the problem is the viewers. A lot of ppl casual and esport fans only have enough brain space to think that worlds matter. Thus, it would be on the scale of eh it’s okay but doesn’t mean anything if we didn’t beat CN/KR. And those who care only for domestic titles, idk what they would feel having EU or NA beat their teams.
    This. I really thing worlds are boring because I know some Chinese or Korean team will win it.
I'm glad to hear it, international play is usually so much more hype than domestic leagues and it's sad it only happens twice a year.
Finally a *positive* development for international LoL esports.

Worlds & MSI have been getting downsized, regions have been getting merged left and right. But the addition of another major international event would be an unequivocally positive development for international LoL esports.
    How is MSI downsized? It used to be a joke but now it's no longer a mickey mouse tournament. Personally, I think it's better than Worlds.
        It now has both fewer regions and fewer teams than it used to have in the past, hence downsized
            Are you serious? Is it the opposite actually. From 2023, we have had 2 LCK/LPL/LEC/LCS teams. The old MSI used to have 60+ bo1s and only 3 bo5s lol.
I knew this is held for the teams from every region's last place.
So there's 4 internationals/ majors a year with Saudi world cup. Wow
A step closer to what we should have (just blatantly copy from CS 1.x/CS:GO/CS2 and Dota2 at this rate) but it's a shame that will prolly never happen, cus of those who invested in franchasing. Haiyaa..

But this is better than nothing though, I guess..
its just gonna be all-stars returning


(please let me be wrong)
Everyone thinking about the entertianment but not about the players who already spend countless hours in scrims, official games, solo q. Sure Western players don't do much but Eastern players are already doing a lot and the break between splits is what saves most of them.
Montecristo/thorin being right again, not surprised
    Wow, they were right about something that's been rumored since 2022, how do these geniuses keep getting everything right?
        eg situation, c9 situation, lcs situation, lec stuff, like 100 other examples, but sure bruv
If this happens, I hope it excludes the LPL and LCK. Their seasons work successfully and shouldn't be messed with. More importantly, another MSI-like international competition that only has 1 or 2 representative from each region would be kinda dull with how much of a gap there is between the LPL/LCK and the rest of the world. But a "rest of the world" tournament would actually be pretty compelling.
    >While the future of the LCK and LPL’s formats remains unknown, it is expected that some change will occur to accommodate a required qualification path during the year's first season.

I agree with you, LCK's regular season is by far the best, double round best of 3 so all teams can choose on what side they want to play 2/3 times(whereas the LPL can't since they have 17 teams).

Then the LPL have the best playoffs format by far.
    > But a "rest of the world" tournament would actually be pretty compelling.

Kind of a damned if you do, damned if you don't. If you invite 2 teams from every region, like you say, somebody will be upset because the third best LPL team could have put their carry boots on and won the whole thing maybe. 

If you just invite 4 teams from NA, EU, and CBLol or wherever, a mostly different group of people will complain that it doesn't count because real teams weren't there. 

Would be interesting to see I suppose, but did winning Rift Rivals every do anything for anybody's street cred?
        Rift Rivals had a lot of issues, bad timing, joke of a prize pool, usually a bad format. 

Just do a rift rivals with MSI format and not in the middle of the season with a real prize pool and you'd see a lot more interest.
            You're right. I thought about that right after I posted that Rift Rivals was absolutely dogshit so it's hard to compare.
Great change. It should have happened many years ago but we got there in the end.
Amazing news!

I'm sorry for the people who can't be happy about anything. They were probably complaining about a lack of international matches all these past years, and now they'll complain because the domestic leagues have to adapt their formats.
About fucking time. This is the only esport that has pathetically small amounts of tournaments. Riots esports ecosystem is laughably garbage compared to counterstrike, the fgc, or any other competitive game
    Pretty sure every fgc pro would love to swap to an lcs system over playing a bunch of random tournaments in different cities for low payouts
        In terms of money? Yeah duh Riot pumps their system with money. In terms of being trapped in their dogshit ecosystem and only playing 2 tournaments a year under their forced rules for broadcast you'd be out of your fucking mind
            Youre underestimating how shit traveling is. The consistency of lcs means you arent having to constantly make ad hoc arrangements to go to various tournaments. And you always have all the best teams (in na) in lcs (or korea for lck). In the fgc theres huge variation in who goes to what events
Do it like valorant kick off
Finally, Quarter Season Invitational
LFGGG!! If LCK adopts three split format, im 1000% sure that it will end up better than LEC.

Ideally Im hoping for Spring and Summer MSI followed up by Worlds in the fall.
talk about a money drain lol

People barely care about worlds/msi
they should do one where last place of lpl/lck plays vs first seed lec/lcs would really be interestedto see how hard we would lose
Just saying, I am available for this, if riot is looking to hire 😉
A third event is sketchy tbh. For the viewers, it’s a plus. Watching eu and na get blasted 3x per year? 

Ehhhhh it’s a risky move that could speedrun the death of those regions. Nobody will want to continue to watch their region get stuffed in a hand basket again and again.
    You're scared to get more chances to play against the best and level up? What kind of pussy shit is that
        I mean its good for EU/NA, it's shit for KR/CH.
            Why would it be bad for CN? Their market is huge and an excuse to expand on the existing product seems great
                What do China get from playing EU/NA lol?

Going to another international just to spank EU/NA isn't really "good for them", it's just a waste of time.
                    They get a 3rd split and a 3rd international trophy to win. It's part of the esport expanding, there is a ceiling to how big it can get in the 2-split format
        Scared wth lol I’m not playing ??? 

Here in reality, just look at the history of regions dying. Once the teams lose ability to be competitive, the region dies.
Literally everyone knew about this since summer 2023. "Sources" lol.
This tournament is likely to be less important than the Saudi esports world cup, not to mention Worlds and MSI.
Please, let it NOT be the thing that changes League forever. We don't need more Pro-oriented patches.
Ah yes. What monte told us 8 months ago.
Honestly i would live to see a europa league equivalent, as if if worlds is UCL, then we invite 4th and onwards teams from major regions and 2nd seeds from wildcards or something
I swear 95% of those leak articles can be a tweet, but I suppose it’s more prestigious if you spit out a 50-word “article” on your website

You're onto something big here, keep digging!
        big if true.
        I hope when he gets the big scoop he posts it to his own website for adrev.
            They're clearly above stooping so low as to get paid in ad-revenue, don't be absurd.
        I think the point he's making genius is that it doesn't particular warrant an article.

Even some League players have standards.
            > I think the point he's making genius is that it doesn't particular warrant an article.

Eh? If it's news then it's news. From there it's up to the journalist to decide if it's worth monetising or not, and I see no real reason that a journalist should decide that Elon Musk should get the financial reward for their reporting rather than themselves.
            (yes we all know that, genius)

It's a dumb point.

Short news is still news. There's nothing sneaky or underhanded about a news website making money via ads. Genius.
        This makes no sense have you calculated everything why would a business that does work that takes time and effort, want to make money?
    People are trying to earn money, wow!
    God forbid people try to monetize their journalistic work.
    how fucking dare they try to get paid for their work?
    Twitter is just another social media. Why force everyone to use them or scoff everyone who doenst?
    Internet existed before Twitter was a thing. Deal with it
    just install every adblocker you can put your hands on, i never read one single article written by an esport journalist worth the time you waste reading it
    Their other articles are generally longer and are interesting. Think in this case there's not much to add.

Keep in mind it's posted on their website first, shared on twitter as just that, a share. 

Also sorry about the people jumping on the angy angy bandwagon.  This sub is like that.
huge if correct
    Giantic if factual
it would be weird to have an international tournaments with not at least one team
Who cares. NA can’t win worlds so we won’t win any other international.
Idk, MSI already feels like a somewhat irrelevant tournament since they don't get any skins or anything too memorable for winning, a new tournament, specially in a format with not a lot of teams, is gonna be even less memorable. One more international championship will be entertaining, but it's just gonna be more draining for the players.

Edit: I'm not saying another tournament isn't exciting, I just think Riot should find ways to reward teams for winning MSI other than seed advantage, which is probably the most boring reward ever.
    Yeah but that's why it seems this year they did the changes for the 1st and 2nd place teams in MSI gaining their spot or their region a spot at worlds so there's very tangible benefits doing well at MSI.
        Yeah, but that's boring as fuck and since 1st and 2nd get this award it's basically meaningless because everyone already knows who the top 2 regions are going to be. If MSI winners got a single skin of their MVP players it'd be so much more hype.
Honestly I think it would be cooler if there’s trans regional tournaments like the Asian Games 

So group LPL LCK VCS and SEA as one group 

LCS LEC LLA and CBLOL as another
I wonder if the format of double round robin bo3 will change for LCK if everyone gets three splits. Maybe it becomes single round robin bo3 like LCS is going to be because if it stays the same then that’s one compressed schedule
    While I'm excited for 3 international events, going from single round robin to one feels a little sad. You lose a lot of narrative hype if you get rid of rematches
        Also what happens with LPL who already run a single round robin system? It would have to be super condensed
            LPL plays in a bunch of arenas around the country though. Logistics might be rough, but at least they have venues to use if they have to fit more games in per week.
                Fair but then playoffs have to be taken into account...LPL would either have to condense that schedule further or revamp it. Which would suck because it would wreck a great bracket format or hard cut the teams that qualify.
                    yeah they'd need to cut a few days to make it like 17 days (3 weekends, 2 weeks in between)

Most recent playoffs was 21 days
            LPL would probably just move to groups of 9 and 8 im guessing and maybe rotate groups or just do a full round robin split across two splits and then half a full round robin for split 3. LCK/LCS would just do 3 single round robin splits.
            it would be absolutely awful if we lose the superior lpl/lck format and they downgrade to something inferior...at worst something like lec.

i am getting my pitchforks ready.
                The lec format isn't that bad if it get spaced out by an additional international (giving more of a rest ) and also gets a road show( that has nothing to do with format but money).
                    It’s bad since bo1 still exists
        You also gain a lot of narrative importance from only playing a team once a split. Now a Bo3 is so much more important for standings & placement than a single game. There's something to be said of the success of the NFL model in having less games compared to the MLB or NBA where there is a game nearly every day. [In case anyone hasn't seen it, the NFL dominates viewership and it isn't close.](https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/most-watched-shows-2023-ncis-oscars-blue-bloods-super-bowl-yellowstone-1235854795/)
    I wonder if the LCK would keep the existing format but drop down to 8 teams.
LPL can't just move to 3 splits with 17 teams, though.
Hopefully not the EU format is pretty bad and has teams gambling their entire split on their meta read in the first 3 weeks. I would rather LPL and LCK stick to their formats.
Other regions moving to a shit 3 split format? Good, so LEC is not going to be the only region with such an insane disadvantage.

Edit: For everyone who wants an actual answere, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRblGOl1ZU8) is an explanation about the competitive implication the current LEC format has. There are also many other aspects to it like obviously the increased cost leading to no final event, patches, titles etc.
    What's so terrible about it when [both LEC representatives are Top 6 in games played in 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1c9qvd5/msi_teams_ranked_by_amount_of_stage_games_played/)?

It's certainly a better format for stage experience than the previous LEC format (or the current LCS one).
        I think that the main issue that i have heard coaches talk about is the fact, that every split is high intensity high stakes from the very start, so unless you are G2 and your baseline is good enough, you dont have enough time to work on actually fixing your issues, you have to bandaid week to week to get your required wins.

In the old format you often saw teams starting slow then getting their shit together and being decent by the end of the split, but now you can just get eliminated after 9 games which is really scary. Honestly i feel like this format either needs BO3 for the first round robin stage, or keep all 10 teams into BO3 stage to let them cook for a little longer and have time to fuck around a bit and figure themselves out.
            Make it triple round robin BO3. I don’t know why Riot hates making players actually play the game.
        Very watered down awarding 4 champions per year
            The splits will go up in value with 3 international tournaments
            What makes it feel watered down more than anything else is the fact that finals are played in the studio imo.

That being said I think they should combine summer and seasonal finals into some extended split so it's 3 titles like old OGN.
                I would legit rather have them play regular split online and then have the finals be a big event. 

We already know it costs them a shit ton of money to run the show every weekend and the regular season games have less audience than a uni lecture anyway.
            That’s because winning doesn’t mean anything when it doesn’t qualify the team for an upcoming tournament
        > What's so terrible about it when both LEC representatives are Top 6 in games played in 2024

You mean the part where they already played basically 2/3rd of their season while the other regions have only played 1/2 and how by the end of it their games played will be about the same as NA and other wildcard regions while LCK and LPL will blow all the other regions out of the water?
    Its not shit. Personally I like it and I think its better than before.
        Yah it's not shit. OGN (LCK) used to do 3 splits for the year and it was fine.
            It wasnt just fine, it was better and more exciting than any other league. I used to watch OGN religiously and LCK imo has never been as good. A 16 Team tournament format 3 times a year? Bro that shit was better than worlds, especially since season 2/3 worlds still had byes into the playoff stage and only bo3s in quarters, at season 2 worlds even only the finals were bo5. OGN was peak League esports and still unbeaten imo. Only recently Riot has started to use good formats like the new MSI format
                My favourite was when there's like a loser league. If you get completely eliminated, you just get seeded in the 2nd league playoff.

If you're a hardcore esports fan, more content for you. If you're casual, then you can just ignore it as it's less prestigious
                Yup I fucking hate round Robin. OGN will always be more superior to me than LCK cuz of that reason alone. Every game actually mattered.
                    Those tournament splits allowed so many exciting storylines that youd never get in a round robin league
                        Yup everything is just more exciting. All the way from group draws to finals. Good times 🥲
                How is the old format better??? 3 bo3 in groups determined who advance, losing 2 bo3 mean dropping down to NLB (which nobody cared or watched). The bracket was single elimination tournament, which is worse than current playoff bracket. They only used that format because there was OGN masters in the mid season before MSI was a thing.
            Most people here probably didn't watch around then to know this even.
                Most people who compare the old OGN format with what the LEC is currently running have never seen what the old OGN format was acutally. You guys just comment "hurr dur OGN had 3 splits". Them both having 3 splits is pretty much the only similarity. The fact that OGN ran the splits throughout the entire year instead of just half the year like the LEC does now is completly ignored for example.
                    Most people throw out LEC having 3 splits as the issue not talking about format or the time. In fact I'd argue the format is actually good and most of the problems people bring up don't have anything to do with a format (like finals being in the studio)
                        No, the problem is not just having 3 splits. Its 3 splits compressed into half a year. How else could they realistically do 3 splits in half a year? 

>(like finals being in the studio)

Yes, because it costs more money, which leads to a lack of budget for events.
                    You act all snobby acting like we never watched OGN. Brother. You also fail to mention the format difference which LEC can still change. 

OGN had way more teams than LEC and was STILL able to pull it off, EPL in counter strike runs fucking 24 team leagues in less time than riot. How did they pull it off? By having multiple streams. By using multiple days. And guess what these two leagues have? Different formats compared to the dogshit round Robin single streams riot Europe wants to do.  

Just cuz you don't want to change shit doesn't mean the idea sucks. Just change your fucking format. Riot is capable of running condensed formats with lots of teams. Look at worlds. They just don't want to.
                        I dont know if you OGN stans just dont get it, but Riot has to schedule the entire season within half a year. **Yes, OGN was good, but the competitive calender of Riot games is not the same as it was in 2013. I would have no problem with 3 splits if we actually utilized the entire year but Riot wont do that.** Riot could also do worlds so it doesnt take an entire freaking month, but they wont. They also have to take current and future eSports like Valorant into account now.
                        One downside of OGN is due to the group + bracket system, some teams would literally never play one another. We've missed out on so many potential hype matches because of that.
            Completely sifferent. Ogn had gsl groups which was way more interesting than eu’s round robin. But riot came in and said that ogns format was trash and forced them to change it to match lcs.
        it's definitely better than what they had before. Still garbage compared to LPL and LCK.
    What's shit about it is the lack of roadshow for the end of split. If they adjust that everything is fine.
    The insane disadvantage of

*checks notes*

Playing 3 splits?????

Maybe you dislike the format but it it's pure cope to say any region is doing bad bc of its format.
    it's still shit if there's a third tournament to qualify for?
        Yes
            insane L take
            Garbage opinion, I want to see more international bo5s
    I'm not a fan of 3 splits because it doesn't work well in the current international schedule.

Also single round robin best of 1 for a "split" is an actual joke, but it sounds like LCS will be experimenting with bo3 which makes that nicer
    OGN used to do 3 splits for a season and they had amazing finals for each split. What are you talking about. Just cuz riot wants to be lazy in EU (and na cuz they want to kill hype finals too) doesn't mean it can't be done well. 

L take. And L edit.
        OGN spread their splits over the whole year instead of half the year as the LEC does now. Winter 2012 started on 11 November and ended on 2 February the following year.

Just look at Astralis last year. They played their last game on 3 July. Their next chance to play official matches would have been with the start of this season on 13 January this year.
        It was nothing like LEC's three splits. Not to mention that the format was completely different.
            You can change the format from this shit round Robin that is just fluff
                Can be an will be done is very different— I doubt it'll be possible in LCK any more. Worlds teams' off season and transfers are already affected quite heavily by the schedule. Having another season start in November would not be great.

If it was held this year, they'd have one week in between worlds finals and season start. The Feb end conflicts with the spring start too.

With more internationals and Asian Games coming every 4 years, there simply isn't enough days to accommodate a third full season.

That is, unless you're open to treating players like game slaves and giving them no rest at all. That'd work well.

Don't yap around without backing it up with an actual solution or a suggestion for a different format that might work, rather than just say "BuT wE cAn ChAnGe It" without suggesting anything.
    > For everyone who wants an actual answere, here is an explanation about the competitive implication the current LEC format has.

The point about fewer days for "growth mindset" scrims is definitely well taken, but I think that the region's biggest issue internationally in recent years has been the LEC's inability to perform under pressure, particularly in the mid to late game. As a result, I think that the extra performance mentality games are actually a positive, particularly for the best teams. It is definitely a very punishing system for weaker teams, but I think that it is better for the strongest teams, because they get more reps at being required to perform under pressure. 

Furthermore, for the teams that go to internationals, they get more opportunities to play in Bo3s and Bo5s, which I think is very important for developing strategic depth, both in draft and in game. Getting more opportunities to practice adapting to a "cheese" and performing adjustments in front of a crowd with the pressure on is something that I see as a critical positive and worth the degradation of the bottom 3 teams' practice.


Additionally, it makes it harder for a team to abuse cheese for a high finish, because Bo1s have very little impact on your ultimate position when it comes to international qualification. As a result, I think that this system also does a better job of selecting the strongest teams to send, because they end up having to hold up against more strategies and more counters.
    Your cope is next level, gz
    if they make LCK and LPL move to short Bo1s or some bullshit I will be hating
Which is a shame because it's by far the worst format we've ever had. Why would they ruin LPL and LCK too especially when they are growing.
    I think the format is so bad because there are only two international events so it completely screws up the qualification process. But I agree the LEC format is horrid and I hope other regions can see it's failures and not recreate it.
I don’t mind it but Worlds will still be the only one that teams really care about. Teams are still practicing and getting familiar with each other pretty much for the first half of the year so early tournament results are going to be high variance.
    You are crazy if you think teams don't really care about MSI.You think TES and BLG don't want to beat the LCK in front of the home crowd or vice versa?
        I think he worded it wrong. The context is most teams care about worlds MORE THAN the MSI. not that they don't care about it.
            There is nothing wrong with Worlds being the most important. Other tournaments can still exist.

In fact it's a good thing that Worlds will continue to be the most important.
            That makes the take even more stupid tbh. So just don't host international tournaments anymore? Someone call up the Dota majors that bc they're not as important as TI they should just cancel them.
        Or that JDG didnt care about their golden road 🙄
        Yea most teams care. LCK teams probably care the least tho.


Edit: caring the least is different than not caring lmao
            Yeah it's not like Kkoma said in interview that they want to win MSI title for Korea after such long time
                I mean what do you want lck coach to say. everyone said the same line. Do you expect them saying “oh we are ready to get fucked by lpl over again. I don't think this time we can win ff15” ? lol
                He has to say that. If he says the opposite rabid Korean fans would lose it.
            That is so cope
            Bruh, LCK havent won MSI since 2017 lmao
                I highly doubt any teams from LCK, LPL or EU don't care about MSI. Especially with this being one of the best opportunities EU has to play vs the best teams in the world (and with G2 saying that they want to get better)
                    The "competitive spirit" in this game has always seemed weird to me. Like pros saying they don't care about Rift Rivals, MSI isn't a big deal etc. In Starcraft you'd have the top players flying halfway across the world to play in a random tournament with a $2k prize pool just for the competition.
                        Pros have never said MSI wasn't a big deal. It's always this weird set of fans who seem to believe if it's not Worlds it's not important. Like this fanbase is so bizarre even compared to other esports.
                        Rift rivals was literally a meme tournament though so I get not caring about that
                            I always thought it was a wasted opportunity. It could've been a good tournament for bragging rights between EU and NA. Maybe expand it to the top 4 teams from EU and NA, 2 groups of 4 in to a double elim bracket so there are more games. Pros not caring about it was sort of my point though, it's like they don't care about competition just for competition's sake. At the end of the day you can only win what is in front of you, and you should want to win everything.
                Yet they win worlds regularly. Clearly they care about both tournaments equally.
            The fan pressure on KR teams to win vs LPL is crazy,they were getting death threats last year after MSI
    It would be interesting if LoL moved to a major-like format where each event would be around the same prestige as the other ones.
        Tbh it will never be the same as long as worlds winner gets their own championship skin ,while other events get a slice of the worlds price pool
    I need you to type the words "JDG players and staff did not care about winning the golden road" as a reply to me. Please. It would be so funny.
        The correct question is would JDG rather win (winter international tournament + MSI) or win Worlds? Which combo do they care about more? Obviously yeah if you can, you want to win it all.
            > I don’t mind it but Worlds will still be the only one that teams really care about

So you acknowledge this is false?

Holding worlds in higher regard doesn't imply lack of care about non worlds tournaments. Teams would consider worlds the most prestigious title while still greatly caring about other titles/tournaments. Teams *really care* about winning MSI. Denying that is ludicrous.
    Stockholm Syndrome in a comment. You are speaking from being so accustomed to the current system.

We have so many other sports and esports with several important tournaments in a year. Hell we even had it in League too before the LCS era of 2013 onward.
        Yeah the pro league fandom is bizarre. I don't think I've ever seen a fandom with consistently such bad takes on international tournaments, formats and results. 

Like what Dota and CS majors don't matter if they're not the biggest tournament in the year? Wtf.
            The vast, vast majority of League of Legends esports fans have this as their first esport. That much is incredibly obvious.

Another thing that is incredibly obvious is that almost no one was around in 2012 for the tournament circuit.

The sheer amount of ignorance from League fans about completely settled topics in general esports is astounding and frustrating.
    Worlds is kind of not super amazing till they add ab actual prize pool like dota.
    I like the idea of having the one big one but wish they would do something for the other tournaments. Maybe get an emote with your name for winning MSI or an icon?
        Make an official MSI skin (I think it's Conqueror LoL skin) for each role and give the winning team a Chroma with the player's signature.
    MSI structure and format is superior and more competitive, so this is just wrong
LEC is on 4 split format and there is no news that any other league changes their

Your comment has no sense
    They literally are on a 3 split format, what are you smoking. Season finals isnt split. Also its logical to assume other will have 3 splits so they dont have international tournament in the middle of split
OGN used to do 3 tournaments/splits a year. This is where the famous beach tournament happened. I'm sure it'll be great domestically for them.

Throwback to 3 splits of OGN

Birds Eye Shot: https://youtu.be/7E5mjBtuSe8?t=13339

T1 winning summer finals without dropping a match: https://youtu.be/7E5mjBtuSe8?t=16416
    Yea but it’s not a perfect system either. We never got to see KT Arrows vs SSW in 2014 Summer
        Not KT's fault SSW could not beat Samsung blue in Korea. And let's be real. Lord Kakao would've obliterated them. 😎😎

At least finals was still a banger though. Not complaining about kt arrows vs blue at all.
        The format tradeoff was getting the white/blue civil war for the finals spot instead of allowing the finals to be a civil war. 

I think even though there are many universes where SSW could have beaten KTA in the finals, this is less a problem of the format and more them not overcoming blue on the day. The reality of tournaments and formats is they all reward consistency and you have to show up each and every day.

Pursuing the ultimate best format with no perceived flaws is probably a folly. 3 splits as an excuse to get a 3rd international should be healthy for the scene as an entertainment product and for the competitive aspect.
    Their winter split didn’t have great format. It was like worlds with 4 groups but they played only 1 BO3 against each other in their group if I’m not wrong
        Their winter, spring and summer had the same format as each other. They only revamped the format in 2015 after they removed sister teams and winter split
            the OP was just referring to the 2014 format, yep. Although regions could potentially change formats between splits in current day. Using a new winter split for experimenting for example.
                He/she specified that “their winter split” when in actuality it’s was the format used for all splits prior to 2015. Also I think OP forgot that it was a Bo2, 4 group format where the winner got 3 points. So the crux isn’t winter split but rather the format used
                    I went back and double checked for curiosity. 2013 spring had 2 groups of 6 while 2013 summer had 4 groups of 4. They increased the  amount of teams between spring and summer in 2013.

The "format" change, if you would even call it that, was just to fit in the increased amount of teams. It was still bo2 single round robin into playoffs, but with playing less teams because of the smaller groups. The playing less teams was ops concern and did change - for clarity.

This is why the LPL will have the most difficulty fitting 3 splits, they have the most amount of teams so they will either

1. have to go for a format that won't have each team play each other team while maintaining bo3 (groups, 1x8 1x9). upper limit 72 regular season games for a team per year.

2. just do bo2 (16 bo2 matches for each team), this will likely mean increasing matches per day from 2->3 & 3->4. 92 regular season games per team each year.

3. Somehow insanely do 16 bo3 per team which would mean an upper limit of 144 regular season games for the year.
        Yea 2014 was the 16 team 4 group round robin bo2. i personally really like experimenting with different formats (which 3 splits allows you to do) and enjoyed seeing the 16 team leagues back in the day, but I can see how it would be off-putting. I would say the lack of saturation on playing each team was more of a "16 teams in our league" problem and wouldn't happen in current day lck.

The actual playoffs/bracket stage of 2014 winter was great though.
            its only good if you liked most of the teams. back in the day, if the team you liked was pretty mid and got pulled into a group with strong teams you watch 3 bo3s and wait for next split.
                True, incredible miracles would get like 9 matches a year. that doesn't seem like enough from the perspective of those players/fans. I wasn't ever a fan of those teams except maybe jin air so I never had those thoughts.
    wow I can't believe I forgot about the beach tournament
    Seeing all these new league fans know nothing of league history is so strange to me lmao
    thats a nice throwback...the names, the champs, the map and everything just looks so weird now.

i feel like we moved on from that system for a good reason and I don't want to go back to it.
        > i feel like we moved on from that system for a good reason

I wouldn't say that. The reason is "Riot said fall in line". https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ogn-the-champions-winter-future-uncertain-as-riot/1100-6438316/

OGN wanted to continue hosting competition including a 3rd winter split. it was wildly successful, **so much so that riot said "oh no you don't"**

The reason is OGN was told explicitly by Riot that if they want to be able to broadcast for a few more years they have to match other regions splits/format. They then phased out sponsors in preparation for Riot taking over and Riot not allowing 3rd parties to host tournaments any more (OGN).

During the 3 circuit era OGN had different major sponsors for each split. They then cut down to 2 sponsors and splits. Then they cut down to no major sponsors, because they were not allowed to host tournaments. Then they were kicked out.

The good reason was "riot is the only company with broadcasting riots".
            OGN was great. their format wasnt good for a league competition. I don't know, you leave out so much important context and you are not even giving a single argument for the ogn format. 

[https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Champions/2013\_Season/Winter#Overview](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Champions/2013_Season/Winter#Overview)

like wtf is that shit. OGN was successful despite that format. if that format is so great, why did other leagues fail with it? why is no other league copying that format? why did other league that had bo2 moved on from them?

why are other esports not using bo2?

yes, riot unfairly pushed out OGN and other third party tournament organizers, but holy fuck. can you form a coherent logical argument instead of blindly hating?
If Riot butchers LPL playoffs format then it's going to suck. Not to mention LPL also has Demacia Cup with new rules so when are the players going to rest?
    dont teams that went to worlds normally use subs in demacia cup anyway
        new rules make it so non worlds qualifying teams need to use their main roster iirc
            >dont teams that went to worlds
    Maybe Demacia Cup gets expanded in importance to be a qualifier? Who knows lol Im not in charge of this shit (thank god)
    Literally the reason I started watching LPL over other regions, not like I'd stop watching but I'd be bummed out if playoffs had to change.

Demacia Cup is already kind of a show match, lots of prospects and lower tier players already play, it could more or less just become a 4fun tourney for subs and I wouldn't be all that upset.
Probably 1 bo3 round robin into playoffs would be the easiest way for the eastern leagues to adjust to the shorter splits.
    LPL already does that since there’s 17 teams
    LPL is already a single round robin.
        Damn I forgot there’s 300 LPL teams. Good luck to them figuring out how to shorten their seasons. Hopefully they don’t move to bo1s or something backwards
Well at the very least they can keep Summer format intact since this event will only be between Winter and Spring.
another international tournament would make any domestic format change worth it imo, but hopefully it has as little impact as possible
Let's hope players that are successful have even less time off, due to filled schedule wooooh
They could just decide to do a mini-guantlet tourney leading up to the additional international tournament based on the current seedings.
I mean. You can move back worlds by a few weeks, most of the time it ends by October anyways, there is plenty of space in the calendar
    But the player contracts end in November. Teams can’t be playing at Worlds with their players going FA in the middle of the tournament.
Double round robin bo3 is brilliant? In what world? Why have Leagues when you can have tournaments? Theres no way anybody thinks current LCK is a better product than OGN.
    3 split format had it's own flaws such as KT Rolster Arrows winning summer and not going to worlds.

Also relies a lot on how the groups are drawn, imagine if a group had SSB/SSW and NJBS and one of them get knocked out while other "bad" teams go through due to the groups.

OGN's format had flaws, and it worked moreso because league was in its infancy era, the only benefit of the 3rd international would be more LPL vs LCK games but for every LCK/LPL hype match you get a LCK/LPL vs the west which are boring since the result is effectively forgone.
Double round robin is ass lol. Completely rewriting history. LEC crowned a champion, got to celebrate MAD miracle run, had a mini off season, all while we were dicking around for 5 weeks in the LCK waiting for the next T1 vs GenG series. Yeah LCK playoffs were more hype but regular season being this long is pointless. 

I’d rather have 2 playoffs instead of 1. It’s also fun seeing who’s the best team at more points in the year.
im completely fine with all regular seasons getting butchered if it means theres more china vs korea
    While true, for the 1/2 china vs korea series we get, we also get like 3-4 China/Korea vs EU/NA series which aren't fun because the latter just get bent over.
LCK Butchering their brilliant double round Robin? Nah give me back the 3 OGN tournament splits per seasons. I hate round Robin so much.
Rift Rivals but they're not really rivals, they're struggling.
    Rift survivals, losers get demoted and are not allowed to play in a tier 1 league for a year!
        Relegations with a whole bunch of extra steps ?
            Special relegations if you will!
    Grift Rivals
The final losers region gets one less spot at worlds
    This would actually be hilarious
    I would support this. EU fans always try to claim that the bottom of the LPL is even worse coz of 16 teams. Let’s see them eat their words.
    Na having online 8 teams storting to make sense.
    HOLY
Oscar night: the tournament
    Relevant flair
It would be really cool to compare the skill *floors* of every league.

But also I could 100% see this being a weird thing of teams inting the end of the season to try to make international competition.
    Best way go judge that would be to make an international Tier 2 tournament at least for the 4 major regions. It would help compare the "medium" level of each region and put spotlight on true gems while giving them international exposure & experience on stage.

But this is very unrealistic as it would be a logistical nightmare when even Tier 1 teams barely face eachother twice a year and all 4 regions have widely different systems for their second league.
        Not to mention there is one particular major region with uh... a less than impressive t2
I remember the demand letter from 9 lck teams that they wanted to do this but riot korea denied it.
    Got a source/more info? That sounds hilarious
        they wanted a tournament for all of the lower placed teams, not actually lose a series to advance.

I'd love to see that tbh, NA 4-6, EU 4-6, vs LPL 5-9, LCK 5-9 - nice 16 team single elim bo5 tournament or something.
I'm trying to decide if this would be better or worse as nemesis draft
    Well I don't personally have to play it so I'm going to say its much better than nemesis draft.
I like the idea of the 4 worst teams in each region competing. But it shouldnt be loser advances or teams will just throw for exposure
    If both teams are throwing, who wins?
        no one, you'll actively try to suicide in game. I guess you might learn some stuff about wave manipulation, but it'd mostly be afking and trying to get enemy minions to push faster.

Legit might be the most boring shit to watch
            Spoken like someone who hasn't watched Oscar Night, legitimately the most entertaining series I've ever seen.
        This actually happened in an LPL series years ago. For the purposes of playoff seeding, neither LGD or IG wanted to get put on the same side of the bracket as EDG. It's known as "Oscar Night" because the players are acting their hearts out to make it look like they're not throwing.
    They won't, no player with a drop of pride will want the distinction of being known as the worst team in the world
BRO vs Rogue would go hard.
Biggest loser.
And the worst team of the tournament wins it all.
Fearless draft or bust.
They should eliminate lcs, and make it a reverse champions league.  Worst teams from every region.  It’ll raise the quality of lcs 
Teams getting to play like 3 matches every 4 months is a great format!
    Yeah that shit so ass man lmao. Play 5 matches and you are out lol
        Not even - this Masters (MSI Equiv?) FNC lost their first 2 games in the VCT EMEA qualifier earlier this year and they were out of the major tournament, no double elim for qualification. TH and KCORP got a tonne of practice in their version of the "play in" before playing against FNC. 

They played 2 games and didn't play another game until this month...
            Team Heretics didn't get tons of practice because they didn't go to the Play Ins (they were first of their Group) unlike KC.

Funnily enough, Fnatic have an advantage over KC and TH because they saw all their strats.
            not even lost their first 2, they won their 1 (one) group stage game then lost their top 4 match. Lost one bo3 and were eliminated.

They were eliminated from 2023 worlds on August 23rd, and started EMEA stage 1 on April 4th.

They played two official circuit bo3s over a 7 month period.
            i mean its not as bad as you are making it out to be but i agree its not great - Leo already confirmed they will be adjusting for next season accordingly. FNC also had a notable advantage coming into that format anyway and realistically a month break is not that big of a deal lol
the sheer amount of downtime for tier 1 players valorant is absurd honestly. they want people to watch tier 2 3 tournaments and its like fuck that noise lol
    The one thing that keeps making me play league is watching eSports. I understood that when I realized I hadn't touched Valorant the whole time tier 1 was off...
If its valorant without the downtime it'll be great
Yes this will be a riot tournament like MSI and Worlds
    Or... the Saudi tournament will henceforth **be** the 3rd tournament.
        Title says Riot plans to host. Since the saudi thing is not hosted by riot I dont think thats true.
That's how the West equalizes. Burn them out until they just don't show up anymore! /s
    get ready for the west coast weed meta
Probably will be single round robin bo3 I would have to imagine
Burnout is a western affliction
    There’s a reason there’s fuck all pros close to 30 . There’s only so long anyone can go on the way they do .
        [deleted]
            I’m not talking about taken or any other esport , I’m talking about league and their very competitive and long season
                league isnt old enough for players to be that old yet. even the oldest players that are playing for a long time are maybe 27-28
            Well I guess if we just ignore every difference between league and tekken, then yeah the league players are just being wacky Lil goofballs quitting their lucrative careers.
    Nah, Showmaker has been very vocal about how burnt out he is and how it’s affecting his performance.

There’s also a reason why most Asian pros only play for a few years then fuck off to a less hardcore region.
    [removed]
        Reminds me of the guy in Eurovision movie lol
    Burnout is a Western thing because working for 120+ hours a week isn't normalized in the West (for a good reason) like it is in Asia.

Thinking burnout isn't a thing gives off the exact same vibes as people telling men to just 'thug it out' any time they have something dragging them down on the mental side. You are weak if you can't work 18 hours a day/let your silly little thoughts affect you.
I wish the LEC would scrap the season finals and just only have split finals. 

FNC v G2 as a split finals (as a FNC fan) just did not feel hype enough really. And it's a FNC v G2 finals, that should be the most hype game in the LEC.
    my assumption is next season everyone will move to 3 single round robin splits (ig LPL would do a 1/2 a round robin per split so effectively 1.5 round robins across 3 splits) - i don't think the 4 domestic trophies is very good for hype and 3 fits way better 1 per intl event.
Road show?
    finals that are on the road and not held in studios
I mean if we get 3 international road shows instead it might be worth it.
I mean if we're going to get only one road show a year moving forward, it's always going to be the one before Worlds. Making it 3 split is not going to change things.
You can tell they only watch League if they think only 2 international tourneys is okay lmao
    Mate, go back in history to Season 2. Dude we had IEMs, we had IPL, we had MLG, we had OGN which btw. used to be an international tournament, CLG.EU almost won an OGN split.

If we never had these tournaments, we would never have the legendary Moscow 5 team which had most of its successes in IEMs.

Hell, they might have won Season 2 worlds had they actually had bo5s the entire playoffs, even 12 years ago bo3 in quarter and semi finals was a dogshit decision, OGN already had bo5s the entire playoffs through and i bet youll find a summoning insight episode where monte and thorin called them out for that.

I mean Riot has always been ass in terms of formats but Season 2 and Season 3 worlds have been especially garbage. Only now, in 2024, 13 years since their esports has gotten popular, are they starting to introduce decent formats
        I still remember when CLG went to Korea (NA and EU) to compete in OGN. That shit was incredible. Pretty sure Hotshot (and CLG) cooked up some absolutely cursed shit too, like Mid Nunu, mid lane swaps. A whole bag of tricks, some worked, some failed miserably. 

It's another reason I always hated when people claimed that "NA teams would suck" if they went to Korea. CLG EU ended up getting 2nd, and although CLG NA got 8th, they got pretty unlucky with the bracket. They were put in a group with CLG EU, and they both got out, but they dropped a game to their EU counterpart, which put them in the bracket against Azubu Frost, who went on to win that event, beating both halves of the team, and also being the runner up to Worlds that year. So despite their 8th place finish they only lost to CLG EU (2nd) and Azubu Frost (1st)

Dig was also there, and they got super unlucky too. They ended up in the group with Najin Sword (regarded as one of the best teams at the time) and Azubu Frost, so they didn't make it out of groups.
    It depends. I watch fighting games and smash a lot, which is ONLY tournaments. It definitely makes the major tournaments very interesting, but smaller minor events that don't have international competition aren't super interesting (to me).

It wouldn't really be a problem for league to be only tournaments like it used to be, but it's also because of the product Riot has cultivated all these years. The more tournaments you add, the less the regular season will matter, and even more so for teams at the bottom of the standings. 

Worlds is also the headliner event, as much as I enjoyed last years MSI (thankfully they finally fixed the formatting for it) it isn't all that meaningful. In fact the biggest "reward" about MSI isn't even the trophy or the money, it's the fact that you get a guaranteed seed at Worlds. 

The more tournements they add, the more downtime there is for lesser teams too. Meaning the regional leagues *might* suffer.

If they went to tournament ONLY on the other hand, then I'm okay with it. Like the good ol' days.
    Meh, some people are fans of teams and not the eSport as a whole. I will pretty much only watch FNC games unless I am bored that day then I'll watch the rest of the games, but I will usually always make time for the FNC game.

Some fans probably don't care about the 3rd international if they support a team like GIANTX/KCORP etc knowing the chances of them qualifying for anything is slim. 

(Please read my comment and understand I literally used the word 'some' several times and I did no way insinuate ALL fans are like this)
Open circuit is mad overrated, I'd rather have 3 or 4 international tourneys and good regional leagues than a ton of international tournaments and basically no regional play like in CS
you mean like in dota where you get invited/direct seeded teams backing out because of scheduling conflicts or logistical constraints, or because there's some other tournament more worthy of their time?

and twice a month you get congratulations posts on some team winning Fukuoka Major or something being an S-Tier tournament but arguably holds less weight because the actual best teams were competing in Brazil or something

And apparently Fnatic won it with Jensen? but that's no big surprise because last week he was with Dignitas and next week he'll be on DFM
Simple. I don't care for this cross league tournaments outside of worlds being the big playoffs at the end. 

This offers nothing or interest to me
I like more tournaments, but lets not pretend like the others are nearly as prestigious as worlds. It's all about worlds.

The more tournaments they add, the less the other splits and tournaments matter in my opinion. It's Riot's fault for cultivating a league system in the first place. If ALL you have are tournaments, most are pretty interesting, but the more international events you have, the less the regular season will seem to matter.

There's also a case of players being burned out. Specifically Chinese and Korean players, who are already playing the most League of Legends all year round. NA players just get more vacations and probably more roster shuffling in the downtime (assuming they don't make it to these events).
Eu will have so many national teams then lmao team France team spain team denmark
    a team france vs team spain would be fucking bonkers
        KC vs Mad on steroids.
            yeah and with the reach both Ibai and Kameto have many people not even interested in gaming would watch. Everyone in Spain loves a france vs spain in anything lmao
        Isn't that just EU Masters  already?
            nah most eu masters teams have imports not many of the teams are made up of 1 region of players
    In Europe it could be amazing
        Daily reminder Ibai was hosting one and Riot blocked it
            Completely moronic by Riot. A EuroCup would’ve done insane numbers and engagement.
                Anything to maintain that control chokehold they love so much.
                    Unless it's saudi money xD
    A national teams tournament sounds a lot more fair as an EU tournament than a world one.
    team Poland with 4 junglers and Trymbi
I want this just because it would be hilarious to see the Canadian team be better than the USA team.
    Dhokla-Blaber/Contractz-Palafox/APA-Yeon-Busio

vs

Licorice/Sniper-Tomio-Jojo-Massu-Vulcan

Honestly, I dunno now that Yeon's a top tier ADC in the league and with Vulcan trending downwards. Definitely a lot closer than it was a couple of years ago. Saying this as a Canadian too.
        Yeah looking at this it's definitely closer than it was a few years ago when EG with vulcan/jojo was top of the league. The NRG topside really saving this team, Palafox and Dhokla are a lot better than the equivalent best American mid/top from a couple of years ago.
        This would be really hype honestly. It could go either way and by now, all these players have performed on top teams in the LCS except Tomio
    That would be great if this event is finally Toronto's compensation event
        Have them play at Rebel for the true experience
    It would be pretty rough for the Canadians though because they have no junglers. The best one in the NA ecosystem right now is probably Tomio and even then he's a sub for SR (SR should totally promote him to main roster though).
    Why would it be hilarious?

Population isn't the be all end all of who's best at something
        Because as an American, we tend to see canada as an afterthought and its funny to me when they are better than us at something.
You'd need a whole split of national teams to get the chemistry right going into the international event if you don't want it to be a clown show (or an auto win for the country with all national players).
    Not really. 

The iihf championships are starting soon and they're just so much as naming rosters.
That shit aint ever happening outside of Asia games
Yeah I'd love that. Imagine Spain vs France lmao
not to brag but I kinda did a post about this some time ago with the teams and everything:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1bl88pi/the\_league\_of\_legends\_world\_cup\_national\_teams/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1bl88pi/the_league_of_legends_world_cup_national_teams/)
    Oh, thanks for sharing it! You did an awesome job and it makes me even more hopeful that someday something like this can be done.
National team games are almost always worse because the lack of synergy between players
Yea. Give me an actual world championship tournament.
nah that would instantly make it a 4fun event. The lol circuit needs more serious international matches not this shit
No we don't. Who tf cares.
I mean it’s gonna be in Saudi Arabia so not sure about that
    How do you know that?
    don't care you can cry about it on Twitter
    Saudi Arabia production is 100x better than LEC and LCS combined, so good.
the best thing about the LEC format right now, is the amount of non playoffs game vs playoffs games is the lowest. and lets all be honest playoffs games are always just so much more suspense since every game has meaning.
The LEC 3-split format would work great if there were actual finals and not these garbage ones in the same studio with 150 people in attendance. It's laughable and kills all the hype before it's even started. Also some cringy, awful trophy.
    That's not a format problem but yeah, I said with some changes. That being one of those but I don't think it's happening. It's a bigger chance they change the other competitions to resemble LEC's because it's cheaper. But we'll see.
        imagine seeing LCK's hype as fuck spring finals and deciding "we gotta make that be like LEC"
            I mean, I agree, but it's about money. People still seem to not understand Riot loses money whenever they organize a venue. Even big ones, like World Finals, Riot still loses money. And they probably have statistics that show it doesn't make a difference as far as money spent from the fans in-game, which is the whole point of having an esports, promotion of the game.
                So they are so low on funds that they are organizing a third international tournament next year??
                    If they change the formats of other regions to LEC format, that will mean all those regions will only have one 'event' per year. So they'll use the money they would use there to hold one more international tournament. Not only they get to host one venue, instead of 2-3 small ones, they also give the fans what they've been asking for for a long time. So people will be like, "Sucks we only have one venue event per year, but at least we have three international competitions."

This is at least how I think they are thinking. I don't know what their plans are, I just know all they care about is money, and they have advanced statistics to know what brings them the most ROI. They don't care about making esports grow, they just care about bringing in more players and having those and present players spend money on the game.
                        You think their plan is to make lck finals be played in lolpark instead of national stadiums? That would be awful. Id rather lck and lpl be produced properly than giving western teams another chance to lose.
                            Yeah, I think that's their plan. I agree it would be awful and I do hope I'm wrong, but this company has made think very cynically about the future of the game and everything surrounding the game so yeah, we'll see.
If I had to guess, they'll be returning to a 2 group format with single round robin
Lmao, are you seriously complaining about having more international tournaments?
    That is not what I said at all though. I'm trying to understand Riot's thought process here because clearly they're attempting to save money where they can and tournaments are extremely expensive so them adding more splits to major regions, more tournaments and more costs seems backwards. Quality over quantity just seems to work better in that case unless that tournament is paid off by oil money like the one this summer.
        ESL and Saudi money will fuel the event over there and if riot offloads more to Saudi/esl then they won't need those employees
You need someway to exclude the top teams without accidentally incentivizing teams to do worse just to make internationals.
    Could just do it the way it works in European soccer. 

Multiple tiers of tournaments.
    You could do it in the same gap between splits that you hold MSI in.For example,the tournament could be going on now,between split end and MSI in May.You could also make MSI last one less week by condensing the schedule and have that one more week for a tier 2 international event.
Yeah. Promoting regional rivalries seems way more exciting. East will have Korea x China (and some PCS/VN teams) as well.

Provided the tournament format doesn't suck, like Rift Rivals.
The more international tournaments there are, the better LCS/LEC teams would be because theyre getting exposed to better play no?
    Not really as the core issue is developing youth talent.
Top 4 LCK/LPL seed so #1 faces #4 and so on of each region, double elim bracket.

Guaranteed banger of a tournament. 

Do MSI for every other region. Seed top 2 NA/Eu into a double elim bracket and then have a play-ins for the final 4 spots of the #1 seeds of minor regions and the 3/4 of NA/Eu

Also would be a banger tournament.
Agree
More tournaments wouldnt be a issue if they didnt take minimum 3 weeks to complete :^)
    This is a self-imposed problem by Riot. Hopefully they have now realized that you can run events much quicker. Other esports always realized it.

Hell even IPL5 in League of Legends did it.
        MSI could be a lot shorter, but I doubt that Worlds will ever be less than 4 weeks long. Riot wants the event to be a roadshow.
            ...but why?
        Alternatively I do like being able to always watch the tournaments live.

Sucks trying to spend the whole day avoiding spoilers otherwise.
            That's sadly the life for almost every Western fan these days. Even when it's in Europe, it doesn't start very late in the day because it'd be too late in the prime timeslot for China and Korea.
I like international competition better than regional competition so if that's the trade off I don't mind.
You hate watching the best teams play against eachother more than twice a year?
    The best teams play against each other all the time in lck and lpl domestic leagues.
        Yea, why would we ever want more LCK vs LPL matches. Who would watch that? More tournaments definitely aren't needed.
    I like that it feels special and i don't like how crammed the calendar will be with 3 Tournaments and lck/lpl having to adapt to 3 splits.
Yeah man good point, 2 international events each year - one of which is only had 1 seed from each region for many years - is definitely enough, why would we want more international games?


I mean, other esports have way more international games. Who would want to see boring matchups like G2 vs SKT when we could have more Dignitas vs 100T??
    Either have regional leagues or only tournaments, pick one of the two.
        Dont play ignorant. It's not a dichotomy. 


You can have both but a different balance between international tourneys and a regional League.


Compare CSGO and its many international tourneys each year to Valorant with 3 international championships and then League with its measly 2.
i honestly agree. if people want more international best of 5’s then i think riot should take the approach of just adding more games to the 2 existing tournaments. i know i might be stretching it here but simply making more tournaments is too similar to CSGO internationals which has so many tournaments that i simply don’t understand how anyone cares; it removes the prestige. 

going from 2 to 3 obviously doesn’t change much or devalue worlds and MSI but i hope that’s the cap.
Is it too upsetting for you to watch NAs most overhyped team get destroyed 3 times a year instead of 2?
    Yeah it’s the NA teams that are overhyped, not G2.
    Atleast they made playoffs last worlds. EU on the other hand
        Same shit though. NRG was just a free ticket to semis for Weibo
            Atleast NRG was a ticket, EU was just a bunch of turds that got flushed down the toilet
                I mean agree they both sucked
    Believing in NAmen memes as overhyping….
    sanest league player
        I rarely play league these days only watch it. I play tft and valorant
            Sorry, sanest valorant player
    Or maybe you just dilute the importance of international play for the sake of trying to save viewership
        What do you mean? How is more international games ever a bad thing? You don’t want to watch the best teams play against each other? Prefer to watch g2 winning in Europe with no competition and NA teams playing in Disneyland?
Eh no i wanna see  teams from lck and lpl,  lol World cup will be more suited for the Summer event they are trying this year in United Arabs emirates
    The Arab event is something different from a national world cup entirly and i hope it gety boycotted tbh.
Been gone for years
lol if they did that I would only care about the eastern tournament, and Im from the west..
    The great thing is we would have 2 tournaments to watch with both being competitive
    Nah, EU vs NA would be pretty hype as well
I really agree, plus the lower rated LCK/LPL teams are also pretty interesting. In the LPL you'd have FPX and WBG 5th and 6th, in the LCK you have KT and KDF 5th and 6th. Some of these teams could do real damage in a tournament.
We had Rift Rivals and mostly nobody cared
    That’s because right rivals was not an actual tournament. Id they didn’t have it randomly in the middle of a split and had teams play to win rather than just a region winning it would have been awesome
        Unfortunately even if the tournament was serious the problem is the viewers. A lot of ppl casual and esport fans only have enough brain space to think that worlds matter. Thus, it would be on the scale of eh it’s okay but doesn’t mean anything if we didn’t beat CN/KR. And those who care only for domestic titles, idk what they would feel having EU or NA beat their teams.
This. I really thing worlds are boring because I know some Chinese or Korean team will win it.
How is MSI downsized? It used to be a joke but now it's no longer a mickey mouse tournament. Personally, I think it's better than Worlds.
    It now has both fewer regions and fewer teams than it used to have in the past, hence downsized
        Are you serious? Is it the opposite actually. From 2023, we have had 2 LCK/LPL/LEC/LCS teams. The old MSI used to have 60+ bo1s and only 3 bo5s lol.
Wow, they were right about something that's been rumored since 2022, how do these geniuses keep getting everything right?
    eg situation, c9 situation, lcs situation, lec stuff, like 100 other examples, but sure bruv
>While the future of the LCK and LPL’s formats remains unknown, it is expected that some change will occur to accommodate a required qualification path during the year's first season.

I agree with you, LCK's regular season is by far the best, double round best of 3 so all teams can choose on what side they want to play 2/3 times(whereas the LPL can't since they have 17 teams).

Then the LPL have the best playoffs format by far.
> But a "rest of the world" tournament would actually be pretty compelling.

Kind of a damned if you do, damned if you don't. If you invite 2 teams from every region, like you say, somebody will be upset because the third best LPL team could have put their carry boots on and won the whole thing maybe. 

If you just invite 4 teams from NA, EU, and CBLol or wherever, a mostly different group of people will complain that it doesn't count because real teams weren't there. 

Would be interesting to see I suppose, but did winning Rift Rivals every do anything for anybody's street cred?
    Rift Rivals had a lot of issues, bad timing, joke of a prize pool, usually a bad format. 

Just do a rift rivals with MSI format and not in the middle of the season with a real prize pool and you'd see a lot more interest.
        You're right. I thought about that right after I posted that Rift Rivals was absolutely dogshit so it's hard to compare.
Pretty sure every fgc pro would love to swap to an lcs system over playing a bunch of random tournaments in different cities for low payouts
    In terms of money? Yeah duh Riot pumps their system with money. In terms of being trapped in their dogshit ecosystem and only playing 2 tournaments a year under their forced rules for broadcast you'd be out of your fucking mind
        Youre underestimating how shit traveling is. The consistency of lcs means you arent having to constantly make ad hoc arrangements to go to various tournaments. And you always have all the best teams (in na) in lcs (or korea for lck). In the fgc theres huge variation in who goes to what events
You're scared to get more chances to play against the best and level up? What kind of pussy shit is that
    I mean its good for EU/NA, it's shit for KR/CH.
        Why would it be bad for CN? Their market is huge and an excuse to expand on the existing product seems great
            What do China get from playing EU/NA lol?

Going to another international just to spank EU/NA isn't really "good for them", it's just a waste of time.
                They get a 3rd split and a 3rd international trophy to win. It's part of the esport expanding, there is a ceiling to how big it can get in the 2-split format
    Scared wth lol I’m not playing ??? 

Here in reality, just look at the history of regions dying. Once the teams lose ability to be competitive, the region dies.
News websites are businesses that want to make money?!?! From ads?!?!


You're onto something big here, keep digging!
    big if true.
    I hope when he gets the big scoop he posts it to his own website for adrev.
        They're clearly above stooping so low as to get paid in ad-revenue, don't be absurd.
    I think the point he's making genius is that it doesn't particular warrant an article.

Even some League players have standards.
        > I think the point he's making genius is that it doesn't particular warrant an article.

Eh? If it's news then it's news. From there it's up to the journalist to decide if it's worth monetising or not, and I see no real reason that a journalist should decide that Elon Musk should get the financial reward for their reporting rather than themselves.
        (yes we all know that, genius)

It's a dumb point.

Short news is still news. There's nothing sneaky or underhanded about a news website making money via ads. Genius.
    This makes no sense have you calculated everything why would a business that does work that takes time and effort, want to make money?
People are trying to earn money, wow!
God forbid people try to monetize their journalistic work.
how fucking dare they try to get paid for their work?
Twitter is just another social media. Why force everyone to use them or scoff everyone who doenst?
Internet existed before Twitter was a thing. Deal with it
just install every adblocker you can put your hands on, i never read one single article written by an esport journalist worth the time you waste reading it
Their other articles are generally longer and are interesting. Think in this case there's not much to add.

Keep in mind it's posted on their website first, shared on twitter as just that, a share. 

Also sorry about the people jumping on the angy angy bandwagon.  This sub is like that.
Giantic if factual
Yeah but that's why it seems this year they did the changes for the 1st and 2nd place teams in MSI gaining their spot or their region a spot at worlds so there's very tangible benefits doing well at MSI.
    Yeah, but that's boring as fuck and since 1st and 2nd get this award it's basically meaningless because everyone already knows who the top 2 regions are going to be. If MSI winners got a single skin of their MVP players it'd be so much more hype.
While I'm excited for 3 international events, going from single round robin to one feels a little sad. You lose a lot of narrative hype if you get rid of rematches
    Also what happens with LPL who already run a single round robin system? It would have to be super condensed
        LPL plays in a bunch of arenas around the country though. Logistics might be rough, but at least they have venues to use if they have to fit more games in per week.
            Fair but then playoffs have to be taken into account...LPL would either have to condense that schedule further or revamp it. Which would suck because it would wreck a great bracket format or hard cut the teams that qualify.
                yeah they'd need to cut a few days to make it like 17 days (3 weekends, 2 weeks in between)

Most recent playoffs was 21 days
        LPL would probably just move to groups of 9 and 8 im guessing and maybe rotate groups or just do a full round robin split across two splits and then half a full round robin for split 3. LCK/LCS would just do 3 single round robin splits.
        it would be absolutely awful if we lose the superior lpl/lck format and they downgrade to something inferior...at worst something like lec.

i am getting my pitchforks ready.
            The lec format isn't that bad if it get spaced out by an additional international (giving more of a rest ) and also gets a road show( that has nothing to do with format but money).
                It’s bad since bo1 still exists
    You also gain a lot of narrative importance from only playing a team once a split. Now a Bo3 is so much more important for standings & placement than a single game. There's something to be said of the success of the NFL model in having less games compared to the MLB or NBA where there is a game nearly every day. [In case anyone hasn't seen it, the NFL dominates viewership and it isn't close.](https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/most-watched-shows-2023-ncis-oscars-blue-bloods-super-bowl-yellowstone-1235854795/)
I wonder if the LCK would keep the existing format but drop down to 8 teams.
What's so terrible about it when [both LEC representatives are Top 6 in games played in 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1c9qvd5/msi_teams_ranked_by_amount_of_stage_games_played/)?

It's certainly a better format for stage experience than the previous LEC format (or the current LCS one).
    I think that the main issue that i have heard coaches talk about is the fact, that every split is high intensity high stakes from the very start, so unless you are G2 and your baseline is good enough, you dont have enough time to work on actually fixing your issues, you have to bandaid week to week to get your required wins.

In the old format you often saw teams starting slow then getting their shit together and being decent by the end of the split, but now you can just get eliminated after 9 games which is really scary. Honestly i feel like this format either needs BO3 for the first round robin stage, or keep all 10 teams into BO3 stage to let them cook for a little longer and have time to fuck around a bit and figure themselves out.
        Make it triple round robin BO3. I don’t know why Riot hates making players actually play the game.
    Very watered down awarding 4 champions per year
        The splits will go up in value with 3 international tournaments
        What makes it feel watered down more than anything else is the fact that finals are played in the studio imo.

That being said I think they should combine summer and seasonal finals into some extended split so it's 3 titles like old OGN.
            I would legit rather have them play regular split online and then have the finals be a big event. 

We already know it costs them a shit ton of money to run the show every weekend and the regular season games have less audience than a uni lecture anyway.
        That’s because winning doesn’t mean anything when it doesn’t qualify the team for an upcoming tournament
    > What's so terrible about it when both LEC representatives are Top 6 in games played in 2024

You mean the part where they already played basically 2/3rd of their season while the other regions have only played 1/2 and how by the end of it their games played will be about the same as NA and other wildcard regions while LCK and LPL will blow all the other regions out of the water?
Its not shit. Personally I like it and I think its better than before.
    Yah it's not shit. OGN (LCK) used to do 3 splits for the year and it was fine.
        It wasnt just fine, it was better and more exciting than any other league. I used to watch OGN religiously and LCK imo has never been as good. A 16 Team tournament format 3 times a year? Bro that shit was better than worlds, especially since season 2/3 worlds still had byes into the playoff stage and only bo3s in quarters, at season 2 worlds even only the finals were bo5. OGN was peak League esports and still unbeaten imo. Only recently Riot has started to use good formats like the new MSI format
            My favourite was when there's like a loser league. If you get completely eliminated, you just get seeded in the 2nd league playoff.

If you're a hardcore esports fan, more content for you. If you're casual, then you can just ignore it as it's less prestigious
            Yup I fucking hate round Robin. OGN will always be more superior to me than LCK cuz of that reason alone. Every game actually mattered.
                Those tournament splits allowed so many exciting storylines that youd never get in a round robin league
                    Yup everything is just more exciting. All the way from group draws to finals. Good times 🥲
            How is the old format better??? 3 bo3 in groups determined who advance, losing 2 bo3 mean dropping down to NLB (which nobody cared or watched). The bracket was single elimination tournament, which is worse than current playoff bracket. They only used that format because there was OGN masters in the mid season before MSI was a thing.
        Most people here probably didn't watch around then to know this even.
            Most people who compare the old OGN format with what the LEC is currently running have never seen what the old OGN format was acutally. You guys just comment "hurr dur OGN had 3 splits". Them both having 3 splits is pretty much the only similarity. The fact that OGN ran the splits throughout the entire year instead of just half the year like the LEC does now is completly ignored for example.
                Most people throw out LEC having 3 splits as the issue not talking about format or the time. In fact I'd argue the format is actually good and most of the problems people bring up don't have anything to do with a format (like finals being in the studio)
                    No, the problem is not just having 3 splits. Its 3 splits compressed into half a year. How else could they realistically do 3 splits in half a year? 

>(like finals being in the studio)

Yes, because it costs more money, which leads to a lack of budget for events.
                You act all snobby acting like we never watched OGN. Brother. You also fail to mention the format difference which LEC can still change. 

OGN had way more teams than LEC and was STILL able to pull it off, EPL in counter strike runs fucking 24 team leagues in less time than riot. How did they pull it off? By having multiple streams. By using multiple days. And guess what these two leagues have? Different formats compared to the dogshit round Robin single streams riot Europe wants to do.  

Just cuz you don't want to change shit doesn't mean the idea sucks. Just change your fucking format. Riot is capable of running condensed formats with lots of teams. Look at worlds. They just don't want to.
                    I dont know if you OGN stans just dont get it, but Riot has to schedule the entire season within half a year. **Yes, OGN was good, but the competitive calender of Riot games is not the same as it was in 2013. I would have no problem with 3 splits if we actually utilized the entire year but Riot wont do that.** Riot could also do worlds so it doesnt take an entire freaking month, but they wont. They also have to take current and future eSports like Valorant into account now.
                    One downside of OGN is due to the group + bracket system, some teams would literally never play one another. We've missed out on so many potential hype matches because of that.
        Completely sifferent. Ogn had gsl groups which was way more interesting than eu’s round robin. But riot came in and said that ogns format was trash and forced them to change it to match lcs.
    it's definitely better than what they had before. Still garbage compared to LPL and LCK.
What's shit about it is the lack of roadshow for the end of split. If they adjust that everything is fine.
The insane disadvantage of

*checks notes*

Playing 3 splits?????

Maybe you dislike the format but it it's pure cope to say any region is doing bad bc of its format.
it's still shit if there's a third tournament to qualify for?
    Yes
        insane L take
        Garbage opinion, I want to see more international bo5s
I'm not a fan of 3 splits because it doesn't work well in the current international schedule.

Also single round robin best of 1 for a "split" is an actual joke, but it sounds like LCS will be experimenting with bo3 which makes that nicer
OGN used to do 3 splits for a season and they had amazing finals for each split. What are you talking about. Just cuz riot wants to be lazy in EU (and na cuz they want to kill hype finals too) doesn't mean it can't be done well. 

L take. And L edit.
    OGN spread their splits over the whole year instead of half the year as the LEC does now. Winter 2012 started on 11 November and ended on 2 February the following year.

Just look at Astralis last year. They played their last game on 3 July. Their next chance to play official matches would have been with the start of this season on 13 January this year.
    It was nothing like LEC's three splits. Not to mention that the format was completely different.
        You can change the format from this shit round Robin that is just fluff
            Can be an will be done is very different— I doubt it'll be possible in LCK any more. Worlds teams' off season and transfers are already affected quite heavily by the schedule. Having another season start in November would not be great.

If it was held this year, they'd have one week in between worlds finals and season start. The Feb end conflicts with the spring start too.

With more internationals and Asian Games coming every 4 years, there simply isn't enough days to accommodate a third full season.

That is, unless you're open to treating players like game slaves and giving them no rest at all. That'd work well.

Don't yap around without backing it up with an actual solution or a suggestion for a different format that might work, rather than just say "BuT wE cAn ChAnGe It" without suggesting anything.
> For everyone who wants an actual answere, here is an explanation about the competitive implication the current LEC format has.

The point about fewer days for "growth mindset" scrims is definitely well taken, but I think that the region's biggest issue internationally in recent years has been the LEC's inability to perform under pressure, particularly in the mid to late game. As a result, I think that the extra performance mentality games are actually a positive, particularly for the best teams. It is definitely a very punishing system for weaker teams, but I think that it is better for the strongest teams, because they get more reps at being required to perform under pressure. 

Furthermore, for the teams that go to internationals, they get more opportunities to play in Bo3s and Bo5s, which I think is very important for developing strategic depth, both in draft and in game. Getting more opportunities to practice adapting to a "cheese" and performing adjustments in front of a crowd with the pressure on is something that I see as a critical positive and worth the degradation of the bottom 3 teams' practice.


Additionally, it makes it harder for a team to abuse cheese for a high finish, because Bo1s have very little impact on your ultimate position when it comes to international qualification. As a result, I think that this system also does a better job of selecting the strongest teams to send, because they end up having to hold up against more strategies and more counters.
Your cope is next level, gz
if they make LCK and LPL move to short Bo1s or some bullshit I will be hating
I think the format is so bad because there are only two international events so it completely screws up the qualification process. But I agree the LEC format is horrid and I hope other regions can see it's failures and not recreate it.
You are crazy if you think teams don't really care about MSI.You think TES and BLG don't want to beat the LCK in front of the home crowd or vice versa?
    I think he worded it wrong. The context is most teams care about worlds MORE THAN the MSI. not that they don't care about it.
        There is nothing wrong with Worlds being the most important. Other tournaments can still exist.

In fact it's a good thing that Worlds will continue to be the most important.
        That makes the take even more stupid tbh. So just don't host international tournaments anymore? Someone call up the Dota majors that bc they're not as important as TI they should just cancel them.
    Or that JDG didnt care about their golden road 🙄
    Yea most teams care. LCK teams probably care the least tho.


Edit: caring the least is different than not caring lmao
        Yeah it's not like Kkoma said in interview that they want to win MSI title for Korea after such long time
            I mean what do you want lck coach to say. everyone said the same line. Do you expect them saying “oh we are ready to get fucked by lpl over again. I don't think this time we can win ff15” ? lol
            He has to say that. If he says the opposite rabid Korean fans would lose it.
        That is so cope
        Bruh, LCK havent won MSI since 2017 lmao
            I highly doubt any teams from LCK, LPL or EU don't care about MSI. Especially with this being one of the best opportunities EU has to play vs the best teams in the world (and with G2 saying that they want to get better)
                The "competitive spirit" in this game has always seemed weird to me. Like pros saying they don't care about Rift Rivals, MSI isn't a big deal etc. In Starcraft you'd have the top players flying halfway across the world to play in a random tournament with a $2k prize pool just for the competition.
                    Pros have never said MSI wasn't a big deal. It's always this weird set of fans who seem to believe if it's not Worlds it's not important. Like this fanbase is so bizarre even compared to other esports.
                    Rift rivals was literally a meme tournament though so I get not caring about that
                        I always thought it was a wasted opportunity. It could've been a good tournament for bragging rights between EU and NA. Maybe expand it to the top 4 teams from EU and NA, 2 groups of 4 in to a double elim bracket so there are more games. Pros not caring about it was sort of my point though, it's like they don't care about competition just for competition's sake. At the end of the day you can only win what is in front of you, and you should want to win everything.
            Yet they win worlds regularly. Clearly they care about both tournaments equally.
        The fan pressure on KR teams to win vs LPL is crazy,they were getting death threats last year after MSI
It would be interesting if LoL moved to a major-like format where each event would be around the same prestige as the other ones.
    Tbh it will never be the same as long as worlds winner gets their own championship skin ,while other events get a slice of the worlds price pool
I need you to type the words "JDG players and staff did not care about winning the golden road" as a reply to me. Please. It would be so funny.
    The correct question is would JDG rather win (winter international tournament + MSI) or win Worlds? Which combo do they care about more? Obviously yeah if you can, you want to win it all.
        > I don’t mind it but Worlds will still be the only one that teams really care about

So you acknowledge this is false?

Holding worlds in higher regard doesn't imply lack of care about non worlds tournaments. Teams would consider worlds the most prestigious title while still greatly caring about other titles/tournaments. Teams *really care* about winning MSI. Denying that is ludicrous.
Stockholm Syndrome in a comment. You are speaking from being so accustomed to the current system.

We have so many other sports and esports with several important tournaments in a year. Hell we even had it in League too before the LCS era of 2013 onward.
    Yeah the pro league fandom is bizarre. I don't think I've ever seen a fandom with consistently such bad takes on international tournaments, formats and results. 

Like what Dota and CS majors don't matter if they're not the biggest tournament in the year? Wtf.
        The vast, vast majority of League of Legends esports fans have this as their first esport. That much is incredibly obvious.

Another thing that is incredibly obvious is that almost no one was around in 2012 for the tournament circuit.

The sheer amount of ignorance from League fans about completely settled topics in general esports is astounding and frustrating.
Worlds is kind of not super amazing till they add ab actual prize pool like dota.
I like the idea of having the one big one but wish they would do something for the other tournaments. Maybe get an emote with your name for winning MSI or an icon?
    Make an official MSI skin (I think it's Conqueror LoL skin) for each role and give the winning team a Chroma with the player's signature.
MSI structure and format is superior and more competitive, so this is just wrong
They literally are on a 3 split format, what are you smoking. Season finals isnt split. Also its logical to assume other will have 3 splits so they dont have international tournament in the middle of split
Yea but it’s not a perfect system either. We never got to see KT Arrows vs SSW in 2014 Summer
    Not KT's fault SSW could not beat Samsung blue in Korea. And let's be real. Lord Kakao would've obliterated them. 😎😎

At least finals was still a banger though. Not complaining about kt arrows vs blue at all.
    The format tradeoff was getting the white/blue civil war for the finals spot instead of allowing the finals to be a civil war. 

I think even though there are many universes where SSW could have beaten KTA in the finals, this is less a problem of the format and more them not overcoming blue on the day. The reality of tournaments and formats is they all reward consistency and you have to show up each and every day.

Pursuing the ultimate best format with no perceived flaws is probably a folly. 3 splits as an excuse to get a 3rd international should be healthy for the scene as an entertainment product and for the competitive aspect.
Their winter split didn’t have great format. It was like worlds with 4 groups but they played only 1 BO3 against each other in their group if I’m not wrong
    Their winter, spring and summer had the same format as each other. They only revamped the format in 2015 after they removed sister teams and winter split
        the OP was just referring to the 2014 format, yep. Although regions could potentially change formats between splits in current day. Using a new winter split for experimenting for example.
            He/she specified that “their winter split” when in actuality it’s was the format used for all splits prior to 2015. Also I think OP forgot that it was a Bo2, 4 group format where the winner got 3 points. So the crux isn’t winter split but rather the format used
                I went back and double checked for curiosity. 2013 spring had 2 groups of 6 while 2013 summer had 4 groups of 4. They increased the  amount of teams between spring and summer in 2013.

The "format" change, if you would even call it that, was just to fit in the increased amount of teams. It was still bo2 single round robin into playoffs, but with playing less teams because of the smaller groups. The playing less teams was ops concern and did change - for clarity.

This is why the LPL will have the most difficulty fitting 3 splits, they have the most amount of teams so they will either

1. have to go for a format that won't have each team play each other team while maintaining bo3 (groups, 1x8 1x9). upper limit 72 regular season games for a team per year.

2. just do bo2 (16 bo2 matches for each team), this will likely mean increasing matches per day from 2->3 & 3->4. 92 regular season games per team each year.

3. Somehow insanely do 16 bo3 per team which would mean an upper limit of 144 regular season games for the year.
    Yea 2014 was the 16 team 4 group round robin bo2. i personally really like experimenting with different formats (which 3 splits allows you to do) and enjoyed seeing the 16 team leagues back in the day, but I can see how it would be off-putting. I would say the lack of saturation on playing each team was more of a "16 teams in our league" problem and wouldn't happen in current day lck.

The actual playoffs/bracket stage of 2014 winter was great though.
        its only good if you liked most of the teams. back in the day, if the team you liked was pretty mid and got pulled into a group with strong teams you watch 3 bo3s and wait for next split.
            True, incredible miracles would get like 9 matches a year. that doesn't seem like enough from the perspective of those players/fans. I wasn't ever a fan of those teams except maybe jin air so I never had those thoughts.
wow I can't believe I forgot about the beach tournament
Seeing all these new league fans know nothing of league history is so strange to me lmao
thats a nice throwback...the names, the champs, the map and everything just looks so weird now.

i feel like we moved on from that system for a good reason and I don't want to go back to it.
    > i feel like we moved on from that system for a good reason

I wouldn't say that. The reason is "Riot said fall in line". https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ogn-the-champions-winter-future-uncertain-as-riot/1100-6438316/

OGN wanted to continue hosting competition including a 3rd winter split. it was wildly successful, **so much so that riot said "oh no you don't"**

The reason is OGN was told explicitly by Riot that if they want to be able to broadcast for a few more years they have to match other regions splits/format. They then phased out sponsors in preparation for Riot taking over and Riot not allowing 3rd parties to host tournaments any more (OGN).

During the 3 circuit era OGN had different major sponsors for each split. They then cut down to 2 sponsors and splits. Then they cut down to no major sponsors, because they were not allowed to host tournaments. Then they were kicked out.

The good reason was "riot is the only company with broadcasting riots".
        OGN was great. their format wasnt good for a league competition. I don't know, you leave out so much important context and you are not even giving a single argument for the ogn format. 

[https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Champions/2013\_Season/Winter#Overview](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Champions/2013_Season/Winter#Overview)

like wtf is that shit. OGN was successful despite that format. if that format is so great, why did other leagues fail with it? why is no other league copying that format? why did other league that had bo2 moved on from them?

why are other esports not using bo2?

yes, riot unfairly pushed out OGN and other third party tournament organizers, but holy fuck. can you form a coherent logical argument instead of blindly hating?
dont teams that went to worlds normally use subs in demacia cup anyway
    new rules make it so non worlds qualifying teams need to use their main roster iirc
        >dont teams that went to worlds
Maybe Demacia Cup gets expanded in importance to be a qualifier? Who knows lol Im not in charge of this shit (thank god)
Literally the reason I started watching LPL over other regions, not like I'd stop watching but I'd be bummed out if playoffs had to change.

Demacia Cup is already kind of a show match, lots of prospects and lower tier players already play, it could more or less just become a 4fun tourney for subs and I wouldn't be all that upset.
LPL already does that since there’s 17 teams
LPL is already a single round robin.
    Damn I forgot there’s 300 LPL teams. Good luck to them figuring out how to shorten their seasons. Hopefully they don’t move to bo1s or something backwards
But the player contracts end in November. Teams can’t be playing at Worlds with their players going FA in the middle of the tournament.
3 split format had it's own flaws such as KT Rolster Arrows winning summer and not going to worlds.

Also relies a lot on how the groups are drawn, imagine if a group had SSB/SSW and NJBS and one of them get knocked out while other "bad" teams go through due to the groups.

OGN's format had flaws, and it worked moreso because league was in its infancy era, the only benefit of the 3rd international would be more LPL vs LCK games but for every LCK/LPL hype match you get a LCK/LPL vs the west which are boring since the result is effectively forgone.
While true, for the 1/2 china vs korea series we get, we also get like 3-4 China/Korea vs EU/NA series which aren't fun because the latter just get bent over.
Rift survivals, losers get demoted and are not allowed to play in a tier 1 league for a year!
    Relegations with a whole bunch of extra steps ?
        Special relegations if you will!
Grift Rivals
This would actually be hilarious
I would support this. EU fans always try to claim that the bottom of the LPL is even worse coz of 16 teams. Let’s see them eat their words.
Na having online 8 teams storting to make sense.
HOLY
Relevant flair
Best way go judge that would be to make an international Tier 2 tournament at least for the 4 major regions. It would help compare the "medium" level of each region and put spotlight on true gems while giving them international exposure & experience on stage.

But this is very unrealistic as it would be a logistical nightmare when even Tier 1 teams barely face eachother twice a year and all 4 regions have widely different systems for their second league.
    Not to mention there is one particular major region with uh... a less than impressive t2
Got a source/more info? That sounds hilarious
    they wanted a tournament for all of the lower placed teams, not actually lose a series to advance.

I'd love to see that tbh, NA 4-6, EU 4-6, vs LPL 5-9, LCK 5-9 - nice 16 team single elim bo5 tournament or something.
Well I don't personally have to play it so I'm going to say its much better than nemesis draft.
If both teams are throwing, who wins?
    no one, you'll actively try to suicide in game. I guess you might learn some stuff about wave manipulation, but it'd mostly be afking and trying to get enemy minions to push faster.

Legit might be the most boring shit to watch
        Spoken like someone who hasn't watched Oscar Night, legitimately the most entertaining series I've ever seen.
    This actually happened in an LPL series years ago. For the purposes of playoff seeding, neither LGD or IG wanted to get put on the same side of the bracket as EDG. It's known as "Oscar Night" because the players are acting their hearts out to make it look like they're not throwing.
They won't, no player with a drop of pride will want the distinction of being known as the worst team in the world
Yeah that shit so ass man lmao. Play 5 matches and you are out lol
    Not even - this Masters (MSI Equiv?) FNC lost their first 2 games in the VCT EMEA qualifier earlier this year and they were out of the major tournament, no double elim for qualification. TH and KCORP got a tonne of practice in their version of the "play in" before playing against FNC. 

They played 2 games and didn't play another game until this month...
        Team Heretics didn't get tons of practice because they didn't go to the Play Ins (they were first of their Group) unlike KC.

Funnily enough, Fnatic have an advantage over KC and TH because they saw all their strats.
        not even lost their first 2, they won their 1 (one) group stage game then lost their top 4 match. Lost one bo3 and were eliminated.

They were eliminated from 2023 worlds on August 23rd, and started EMEA stage 1 on April 4th.

They played two official circuit bo3s over a 7 month period.
        i mean its not as bad as you are making it out to be but i agree its not great - Leo already confirmed they will be adjusting for next season accordingly. FNC also had a notable advantage coming into that format anyway and realistically a month break is not that big of a deal lol
The one thing that keeps making me play league is watching eSports. I understood that when I realized I hadn't touched Valorant the whole time tier 1 was off...
Or... the Saudi tournament will henceforth **be** the 3rd tournament.
    Title says Riot plans to host. Since the saudi thing is not hosted by riot I dont think thats true.
get ready for the west coast weed meta
There’s a reason there’s fuck all pros close to 30 . There’s only so long anyone can go on the way they do .
    [deleted]
        I’m not talking about taken or any other esport , I’m talking about league and their very competitive and long season
            league isnt old enough for players to be that old yet. even the oldest players that are playing for a long time are maybe 27-28
        Well I guess if we just ignore every difference between league and tekken, then yeah the league players are just being wacky Lil goofballs quitting their lucrative careers.
Nah, Showmaker has been very vocal about how burnt out he is and how it’s affecting his performance.

There’s also a reason why most Asian pros only play for a few years then fuck off to a less hardcore region.
[removed]
    Reminds me of the guy in Eurovision movie lol
Burnout is a Western thing because working for 120+ hours a week isn't normalized in the West (for a good reason) like it is in Asia.

Thinking burnout isn't a thing gives off the exact same vibes as people telling men to just 'thug it out' any time they have something dragging them down on the mental side. You are weak if you can't work 18 hours a day/let your silly little thoughts affect you.
my assumption is next season everyone will move to 3 single round robin splits (ig LPL would do a 1/2 a round robin per split so effectively 1.5 round robins across 3 splits) - i don't think the 4 domestic trophies is very good for hype and 3 fits way better 1 per intl event.
finals that are on the road and not held in studios
Mate, go back in history to Season 2. Dude we had IEMs, we had IPL, we had MLG, we had OGN which btw. used to be an international tournament, CLG.EU almost won an OGN split.

If we never had these tournaments, we would never have the legendary Moscow 5 team which had most of its successes in IEMs.

Hell, they might have won Season 2 worlds had they actually had bo5s the entire playoffs, even 12 years ago bo3 in quarter and semi finals was a dogshit decision, OGN already had bo5s the entire playoffs through and i bet youll find a summoning insight episode where monte and thorin called them out for that.

I mean Riot has always been ass in terms of formats but Season 2 and Season 3 worlds have been especially garbage. Only now, in 2024, 13 years since their esports has gotten popular, are they starting to introduce decent formats
    I still remember when CLG went to Korea (NA and EU) to compete in OGN. That shit was incredible. Pretty sure Hotshot (and CLG) cooked up some absolutely cursed shit too, like Mid Nunu, mid lane swaps. A whole bag of tricks, some worked, some failed miserably. 

It's another reason I always hated when people claimed that "NA teams would suck" if they went to Korea. CLG EU ended up getting 2nd, and although CLG NA got 8th, they got pretty unlucky with the bracket. They were put in a group with CLG EU, and they both got out, but they dropped a game to their EU counterpart, which put them in the bracket against Azubu Frost, who went on to win that event, beating both halves of the team, and also being the runner up to Worlds that year. So despite their 8th place finish they only lost to CLG EU (2nd) and Azubu Frost (1st)

Dig was also there, and they got super unlucky too. They ended up in the group with Najin Sword (regarded as one of the best teams at the time) and Azubu Frost, so they didn't make it out of groups.
It depends. I watch fighting games and smash a lot, which is ONLY tournaments. It definitely makes the major tournaments very interesting, but smaller minor events that don't have international competition aren't super interesting (to me).

It wouldn't really be a problem for league to be only tournaments like it used to be, but it's also because of the product Riot has cultivated all these years. The more tournaments you add, the less the regular season will matter, and even more so for teams at the bottom of the standings. 

Worlds is also the headliner event, as much as I enjoyed last years MSI (thankfully they finally fixed the formatting for it) it isn't all that meaningful. In fact the biggest "reward" about MSI isn't even the trophy or the money, it's the fact that you get a guaranteed seed at Worlds. 

The more tournements they add, the more downtime there is for lesser teams too. Meaning the regional leagues *might* suffer.

If they went to tournament ONLY on the other hand, then I'm okay with it. Like the good ol' days.
Meh, some people are fans of teams and not the eSport as a whole. I will pretty much only watch FNC games unless I am bored that day then I'll watch the rest of the games, but I will usually always make time for the FNC game.

Some fans probably don't care about the 3rd international if they support a team like GIANTX/KCORP etc knowing the chances of them qualifying for anything is slim. 

(Please read my comment and understand I literally used the word 'some' several times and I did no way insinuate ALL fans are like this)
a team france vs team spain would be fucking bonkers
    KC vs Mad on steroids.
        yeah and with the reach both Ibai and Kameto have many people not even interested in gaming would watch. Everyone in Spain loves a france vs spain in anything lmao
    Isn't that just EU Masters  already?
        nah most eu masters teams have imports not many of the teams are made up of 1 region of players
In Europe it could be amazing
    Daily reminder Ibai was hosting one and Riot blocked it
        Completely moronic by Riot. A EuroCup would’ve done insane numbers and engagement.
            Anything to maintain that control chokehold they love so much.
                Unless it's saudi money xD
A national teams tournament sounds a lot more fair as an EU tournament than a world one.
team Poland with 4 junglers and Trymbi
Dhokla-Blaber/Contractz-Palafox/APA-Yeon-Busio

vs

Licorice/Sniper-Tomio-Jojo-Massu-Vulcan

Honestly, I dunno now that Yeon's a top tier ADC in the league and with Vulcan trending downwards. Definitely a lot closer than it was a couple of years ago. Saying this as a Canadian too.
    Yeah looking at this it's definitely closer than it was a few years ago when EG with vulcan/jojo was top of the league. The NRG topside really saving this team, Palafox and Dhokla are a lot better than the equivalent best American mid/top from a couple of years ago.
    This would be really hype honestly. It could go either way and by now, all these players have performed on top teams in the LCS except Tomio
That would be great if this event is finally Toronto's compensation event
    Have them play at Rebel for the true experience
It would be pretty rough for the Canadians though because they have no junglers. The best one in the NA ecosystem right now is probably Tomio and even then he's a sub for SR (SR should totally promote him to main roster though).
Why would it be hilarious?

Population isn't the be all end all of who's best at something
    Because as an American, we tend to see canada as an afterthought and its funny to me when they are better than us at something.
Not really. 

The iihf championships are starting soon and they're just so much as naming rosters.
Oh, thanks for sharing it! You did an awesome job and it makes me even more hopeful that someday something like this can be done.
How do you know that?
don't care you can cry about it on Twitter
Saudi Arabia production is 100x better than LEC and LCS combined, so good.
That's not a format problem but yeah, I said with some changes. That being one of those but I don't think it's happening. It's a bigger chance they change the other competitions to resemble LEC's because it's cheaper. But we'll see.
    imagine seeing LCK's hype as fuck spring finals and deciding "we gotta make that be like LEC"
        I mean, I agree, but it's about money. People still seem to not understand Riot loses money whenever they organize a venue. Even big ones, like World Finals, Riot still loses money. And they probably have statistics that show it doesn't make a difference as far as money spent from the fans in-game, which is the whole point of having an esports, promotion of the game.
            So they are so low on funds that they are organizing a third international tournament next year??
                If they change the formats of other regions to LEC format, that will mean all those regions will only have one 'event' per year. So they'll use the money they would use there to hold one more international tournament. Not only they get to host one venue, instead of 2-3 small ones, they also give the fans what they've been asking for for a long time. So people will be like, "Sucks we only have one venue event per year, but at least we have three international competitions."

This is at least how I think they are thinking. I don't know what their plans are, I just know all they care about is money, and they have advanced statistics to know what brings them the most ROI. They don't care about making esports grow, they just care about bringing in more players and having those and present players spend money on the game.
                    You think their plan is to make lck finals be played in lolpark instead of national stadiums? That would be awful. Id rather lck and lpl be produced properly than giving western teams another chance to lose.
                        Yeah, I think that's their plan. I agree it would be awful and I do hope I'm wrong, but this company has made think very cynically about the future of the game and everything surrounding the game so yeah, we'll see.
That is not what I said at all though. I'm trying to understand Riot's thought process here because clearly they're attempting to save money where they can and tournaments are extremely expensive so them adding more splits to major regions, more tournaments and more costs seems backwards. Quality over quantity just seems to work better in that case unless that tournament is paid off by oil money like the one this summer.
    ESL and Saudi money will fuel the event over there and if riot offloads more to Saudi/esl then they won't need those employees
Could just do it the way it works in European soccer. 

Multiple tiers of tournaments.
You could do it in the same gap between splits that you hold MSI in.For example,the tournament could be going on now,between split end and MSI in May.You could also make MSI last one less week by condensing the schedule and have that one more week for a tier 2 international event.
Not really as the core issue is developing youth talent.
This is a self-imposed problem by Riot. Hopefully they have now realized that you can run events much quicker. Other esports always realized it.

Hell even IPL5 in League of Legends did it.
    MSI could be a lot shorter, but I doubt that Worlds will ever be less than 4 weeks long. Riot wants the event to be a roadshow.
        ...but why?
    Alternatively I do like being able to always watch the tournaments live.

Sucks trying to spend the whole day avoiding spoilers otherwise.
        That's sadly the life for almost every Western fan these days. Even when it's in Europe, it doesn't start very late in the day because it'd be too late in the prime timeslot for China and Korea.
The best teams play against each other all the time in lck and lpl domestic leagues.
    Yea, why would we ever want more LCK vs LPL matches. Who would watch that? More tournaments definitely aren't needed.
I like that it feels special and i don't like how crammed the calendar will be with 3 Tournaments and lck/lpl having to adapt to 3 splits.
Either have regional leagues or only tournaments, pick one of the two.
    Dont play ignorant. It's not a dichotomy. 


You can have both but a different balance between international tourneys and a regional League.


Compare CSGO and its many international tourneys each year to Valorant with 3 international championships and then League with its measly 2.
Yeah it’s the NA teams that are overhyped, not G2.
Atleast they made playoffs last worlds. EU on the other hand
    Same shit though. NRG was just a free ticket to semis for Weibo
        Atleast NRG was a ticket, EU was just a bunch of turds that got flushed down the toilet
            I mean agree they both sucked
Believing in NAmen memes as overhyping….
sanest league player
    I rarely play league these days only watch it. I play tft and valorant
        Sorry, sanest valorant player
Or maybe you just dilute the importance of international play for the sake of trying to save viewership
    What do you mean? How is more international games ever a bad thing? You don’t want to watch the best teams play against each other? Prefer to watch g2 winning in Europe with no competition and NA teams playing in Disneyland?
The Arab event is something different from a national world cup entirly and i hope it gety boycotted tbh.
The great thing is we would have 2 tournaments to watch with both being competitive
Nah, EU vs NA would be pretty hype as well
That’s because right rivals was not an actual tournament. Id they didn’t have it randomly in the middle of a split and had teams play to win rather than just a region winning it would have been awesome
    Unfortunately even if the tournament was serious the problem is the viewers. A lot of ppl casual and esport fans only have enough brain space to think that worlds matter. Thus, it would be on the scale of eh it’s okay but doesn’t mean anything if we didn’t beat CN/KR. And those who care only for domestic titles, idk what they would feel having EU or NA beat their teams.
It now has both fewer regions and fewer teams than it used to have in the past, hence downsized
    Are you serious? Is it the opposite actually. From 2023, we have had 2 LCK/LPL/LEC/LCS teams. The old MSI used to have 60+ bo1s and only 3 bo5s lol.
eg situation, c9 situation, lcs situation, lec stuff, like 100 other examples, but sure bruv
Rift Rivals had a lot of issues, bad timing, joke of a prize pool, usually a bad format. 

Just do a rift rivals with MSI format and not in the middle of the season with a real prize pool and you'd see a lot more interest.
    You're right. I thought about that right after I posted that Rift Rivals was absolutely dogshit so it's hard to compare.
In terms of money? Yeah duh Riot pumps their system with money. In terms of being trapped in their dogshit ecosystem and only playing 2 tournaments a year under their forced rules for broadcast you'd be out of your fucking mind
    Youre underestimating how shit traveling is. The consistency of lcs means you arent having to constantly make ad hoc arrangements to go to various tournaments. And you always have all the best teams (in na) in lcs (or korea for lck). In the fgc theres huge variation in who goes to what events
I mean its good for EU/NA, it's shit for KR/CH.
    Why would it be bad for CN? Their market is huge and an excuse to expand on the existing product seems great
        What do China get from playing EU/NA lol?

Going to another international just to spank EU/NA isn't really "good for them", it's just a waste of time.
            They get a 3rd split and a 3rd international trophy to win. It's part of the esport expanding, there is a ceiling to how big it can get in the 2-split format
Scared wth lol I’m not playing ??? 

Here in reality, just look at the history of regions dying. Once the teams lose ability to be competitive, the region dies.
big if true.
I hope when he gets the big scoop he posts it to his own website for adrev.
    They're clearly above stooping so low as to get paid in ad-revenue, don't be absurd.
I think the point he's making genius is that it doesn't particular warrant an article.

Even some League players have standards.
    > I think the point he's making genius is that it doesn't particular warrant an article.

Eh? If it's news then it's news. From there it's up to the journalist to decide if it's worth monetising or not, and I see no real reason that a journalist should decide that Elon Musk should get the financial reward for their reporting rather than themselves.
    (yes we all know that, genius)

It's a dumb point.

Short news is still news. There's nothing sneaky or underhanded about a news website making money via ads. Genius.
This makes no sense have you calculated everything why would a business that does work that takes time and effort, want to make money?
Yeah, but that's boring as fuck and since 1st and 2nd get this award it's basically meaningless because everyone already knows who the top 2 regions are going to be. If MSI winners got a single skin of their MVP players it'd be so much more hype.
Also what happens with LPL who already run a single round robin system? It would have to be super condensed
    LPL plays in a bunch of arenas around the country though. Logistics might be rough, but at least they have venues to use if they have to fit more games in per week.
        Fair but then playoffs have to be taken into account...LPL would either have to condense that schedule further or revamp it. Which would suck because it would wreck a great bracket format or hard cut the teams that qualify.
            yeah they'd need to cut a few days to make it like 17 days (3 weekends, 2 weeks in between)

Most recent playoffs was 21 days
    LPL would probably just move to groups of 9 and 8 im guessing and maybe rotate groups or just do a full round robin split across two splits and then half a full round robin for split 3. LCK/LCS would just do 3 single round robin splits.
    it would be absolutely awful if we lose the superior lpl/lck format and they downgrade to something inferior...at worst something like lec.

i am getting my pitchforks ready.
        The lec format isn't that bad if it get spaced out by an additional international (giving more of a rest ) and also gets a road show( that has nothing to do with format but money).
            It’s bad since bo1 still exists
You also gain a lot of narrative importance from only playing a team once a split. Now a Bo3 is so much more important for standings & placement than a single game. There's something to be said of the success of the NFL model in having less games compared to the MLB or NBA where there is a game nearly every day. [In case anyone hasn't seen it, the NFL dominates viewership and it isn't close.](https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/most-watched-shows-2023-ncis-oscars-blue-bloods-super-bowl-yellowstone-1235854795/)
I think that the main issue that i have heard coaches talk about is the fact, that every split is high intensity high stakes from the very start, so unless you are G2 and your baseline is good enough, you dont have enough time to work on actually fixing your issues, you have to bandaid week to week to get your required wins.

In the old format you often saw teams starting slow then getting their shit together and being decent by the end of the split, but now you can just get eliminated after 9 games which is really scary. Honestly i feel like this format either needs BO3 for the first round robin stage, or keep all 10 teams into BO3 stage to let them cook for a little longer and have time to fuck around a bit and figure themselves out.
    Make it triple round robin BO3. I don’t know why Riot hates making players actually play the game.
Very watered down awarding 4 champions per year
    The splits will go up in value with 3 international tournaments
    What makes it feel watered down more than anything else is the fact that finals are played in the studio imo.

That being said I think they should combine summer and seasonal finals into some extended split so it's 3 titles like old OGN.
        I would legit rather have them play regular split online and then have the finals be a big event. 

We already know it costs them a shit ton of money to run the show every weekend and the regular season games have less audience than a uni lecture anyway.
    That’s because winning doesn’t mean anything when it doesn’t qualify the team for an upcoming tournament
> What's so terrible about it when both LEC representatives are Top 6 in games played in 2024

You mean the part where they already played basically 2/3rd of their season while the other regions have only played 1/2 and how by the end of it their games played will be about the same as NA and other wildcard regions while LCK and LPL will blow all the other regions out of the water?
Yah it's not shit. OGN (LCK) used to do 3 splits for the year and it was fine.
    It wasnt just fine, it was better and more exciting than any other league. I used to watch OGN religiously and LCK imo has never been as good. A 16 Team tournament format 3 times a year? Bro that shit was better than worlds, especially since season 2/3 worlds still had byes into the playoff stage and only bo3s in quarters, at season 2 worlds even only the finals were bo5. OGN was peak League esports and still unbeaten imo. Only recently Riot has started to use good formats like the new MSI format
        My favourite was when there's like a loser league. If you get completely eliminated, you just get seeded in the 2nd league playoff.

If you're a hardcore esports fan, more content for you. If you're casual, then you can just ignore it as it's less prestigious
        Yup I fucking hate round Robin. OGN will always be more superior to me than LCK cuz of that reason alone. Every game actually mattered.
            Those tournament splits allowed so many exciting storylines that youd never get in a round robin league
                Yup everything is just more exciting. All the way from group draws to finals. Good times 🥲
        How is the old format better??? 3 bo3 in groups determined who advance, losing 2 bo3 mean dropping down to NLB (which nobody cared or watched). The bracket was single elimination tournament, which is worse than current playoff bracket. They only used that format because there was OGN masters in the mid season before MSI was a thing.
    Most people here probably didn't watch around then to know this even.
        Most people who compare the old OGN format with what the LEC is currently running have never seen what the old OGN format was acutally. You guys just comment "hurr dur OGN had 3 splits". Them both having 3 splits is pretty much the only similarity. The fact that OGN ran the splits throughout the entire year instead of just half the year like the LEC does now is completly ignored for example.
            Most people throw out LEC having 3 splits as the issue not talking about format or the time. In fact I'd argue the format is actually good and most of the problems people bring up don't have anything to do with a format (like finals being in the studio)
                No, the problem is not just having 3 splits. Its 3 splits compressed into half a year. How else could they realistically do 3 splits in half a year? 

>(like finals being in the studio)

Yes, because it costs more money, which leads to a lack of budget for events.
            You act all snobby acting like we never watched OGN. Brother. You also fail to mention the format difference which LEC can still change. 

OGN had way more teams than LEC and was STILL able to pull it off, EPL in counter strike runs fucking 24 team leagues in less time than riot. How did they pull it off? By having multiple streams. By using multiple days. And guess what these two leagues have? Different formats compared to the dogshit round Robin single streams riot Europe wants to do.  

Just cuz you don't want to change shit doesn't mean the idea sucks. Just change your fucking format. Riot is capable of running condensed formats with lots of teams. Look at worlds. They just don't want to.
                I dont know if you OGN stans just dont get it, but Riot has to schedule the entire season within half a year. **Yes, OGN was good, but the competitive calender of Riot games is not the same as it was in 2013. I would have no problem with 3 splits if we actually utilized the entire year but Riot wont do that.** Riot could also do worlds so it doesnt take an entire freaking month, but they wont. They also have to take current and future eSports like Valorant into account now.
                One downside of OGN is due to the group + bracket system, some teams would literally never play one another. We've missed out on so many potential hype matches because of that.
    Completely sifferent. Ogn had gsl groups which was way more interesting than eu’s round robin. But riot came in and said that ogns format was trash and forced them to change it to match lcs.
it's definitely better than what they had before. Still garbage compared to LPL and LCK.
Yes
    insane L take
    Garbage opinion, I want to see more international bo5s
OGN spread their splits over the whole year instead of half the year as the LEC does now. Winter 2012 started on 11 November and ended on 2 February the following year.

Just look at Astralis last year. They played their last game on 3 July. Their next chance to play official matches would have been with the start of this season on 13 January this year.
It was nothing like LEC's three splits. Not to mention that the format was completely different.
    You can change the format from this shit round Robin that is just fluff
        Can be an will be done is very different— I doubt it'll be possible in LCK any more. Worlds teams' off season and transfers are already affected quite heavily by the schedule. Having another season start in November would not be great.

If it was held this year, they'd have one week in between worlds finals and season start. The Feb end conflicts with the spring start too.

With more internationals and Asian Games coming every 4 years, there simply isn't enough days to accommodate a third full season.

That is, unless you're open to treating players like game slaves and giving them no rest at all. That'd work well.

Don't yap around without backing it up with an actual solution or a suggestion for a different format that might work, rather than just say "BuT wE cAn ChAnGe It" without suggesting anything.
I think he worded it wrong. The context is most teams care about worlds MORE THAN the MSI. not that they don't care about it.
    There is nothing wrong with Worlds being the most important. Other tournaments can still exist.

In fact it's a good thing that Worlds will continue to be the most important.
    That makes the take even more stupid tbh. So just don't host international tournaments anymore? Someone call up the Dota majors that bc they're not as important as TI they should just cancel them.
Or that JDG didnt care about their golden road 🙄
Yea most teams care. LCK teams probably care the least tho.


Edit: caring the least is different than not caring lmao
    Yeah it's not like Kkoma said in interview that they want to win MSI title for Korea after such long time
        I mean what do you want lck coach to say. everyone said the same line. Do you expect them saying “oh we are ready to get fucked by lpl over again. I don't think this time we can win ff15” ? lol
        He has to say that. If he says the opposite rabid Korean fans would lose it.
    That is so cope
    Bruh, LCK havent won MSI since 2017 lmao
        I highly doubt any teams from LCK, LPL or EU don't care about MSI. Especially with this being one of the best opportunities EU has to play vs the best teams in the world (and with G2 saying that they want to get better)
            The "competitive spirit" in this game has always seemed weird to me. Like pros saying they don't care about Rift Rivals, MSI isn't a big deal etc. In Starcraft you'd have the top players flying halfway across the world to play in a random tournament with a $2k prize pool just for the competition.
                Pros have never said MSI wasn't a big deal. It's always this weird set of fans who seem to believe if it's not Worlds it's not important. Like this fanbase is so bizarre even compared to other esports.
                Rift rivals was literally a meme tournament though so I get not caring about that
                    I always thought it was a wasted opportunity. It could've been a good tournament for bragging rights between EU and NA. Maybe expand it to the top 4 teams from EU and NA, 2 groups of 4 in to a double elim bracket so there are more games. Pros not caring about it was sort of my point though, it's like they don't care about competition just for competition's sake. At the end of the day you can only win what is in front of you, and you should want to win everything.
        Yet they win worlds regularly. Clearly they care about both tournaments equally.
    The fan pressure on KR teams to win vs LPL is crazy,they were getting death threats last year after MSI
Tbh it will never be the same as long as worlds winner gets their own championship skin ,while other events get a slice of the worlds price pool
The correct question is would JDG rather win (winter international tournament + MSI) or win Worlds? Which combo do they care about more? Obviously yeah if you can, you want to win it all.
    > I don’t mind it but Worlds will still be the only one that teams really care about

So you acknowledge this is false?

Holding worlds in higher regard doesn't imply lack of care about non worlds tournaments. Teams would consider worlds the most prestigious title while still greatly caring about other titles/tournaments. Teams *really care* about winning MSI. Denying that is ludicrous.
Yeah the pro league fandom is bizarre. I don't think I've ever seen a fandom with consistently such bad takes on international tournaments, formats and results. 

Like what Dota and CS majors don't matter if they're not the biggest tournament in the year? Wtf.
    The vast, vast majority of League of Legends esports fans have this as their first esport. That much is incredibly obvious.

Another thing that is incredibly obvious is that almost no one was around in 2012 for the tournament circuit.

The sheer amount of ignorance from League fans about completely settled topics in general esports is astounding and frustrating.
Make an official MSI skin (I think it's Conqueror LoL skin) for each role and give the winning team a Chroma with the player's signature.
Not KT's fault SSW could not beat Samsung blue in Korea. And let's be real. Lord Kakao would've obliterated them. 😎😎

At least finals was still a banger though. Not complaining about kt arrows vs blue at all.
The format tradeoff was getting the white/blue civil war for the finals spot instead of allowing the finals to be a civil war. 

I think even though there are many universes where SSW could have beaten KTA in the finals, this is less a problem of the format and more them not overcoming blue on the day. The reality of tournaments and formats is they all reward consistency and you have to show up each and every day.

Pursuing the ultimate best format with no perceived flaws is probably a folly. 3 splits as an excuse to get a 3rd international should be healthy for the scene as an entertainment product and for the competitive aspect.
Their winter, spring and summer had the same format as each other. They only revamped the format in 2015 after they removed sister teams and winter split
    the OP was just referring to the 2014 format, yep. Although regions could potentially change formats between splits in current day. Using a new winter split for experimenting for example.
        He/she specified that “their winter split” when in actuality it’s was the format used for all splits prior to 2015. Also I think OP forgot that it was a Bo2, 4 group format where the winner got 3 points. So the crux isn’t winter split but rather the format used
            I went back and double checked for curiosity. 2013 spring had 2 groups of 6 while 2013 summer had 4 groups of 4. They increased the  amount of teams between spring and summer in 2013.

The "format" change, if you would even call it that, was just to fit in the increased amount of teams. It was still bo2 single round robin into playoffs, but with playing less teams because of the smaller groups. The playing less teams was ops concern and did change - for clarity.

This is why the LPL will have the most difficulty fitting 3 splits, they have the most amount of teams so they will either

1. have to go for a format that won't have each team play each other team while maintaining bo3 (groups, 1x8 1x9). upper limit 72 regular season games for a team per year.

2. just do bo2 (16 bo2 matches for each team), this will likely mean increasing matches per day from 2->3 & 3->4. 92 regular season games per team each year.

3. Somehow insanely do 16 bo3 per team which would mean an upper limit of 144 regular season games for the year.
Yea 2014 was the 16 team 4 group round robin bo2. i personally really like experimenting with different formats (which 3 splits allows you to do) and enjoyed seeing the 16 team leagues back in the day, but I can see how it would be off-putting. I would say the lack of saturation on playing each team was more of a "16 teams in our league" problem and wouldn't happen in current day lck.

The actual playoffs/bracket stage of 2014 winter was great though.
    its only good if you liked most of the teams. back in the day, if the team you liked was pretty mid and got pulled into a group with strong teams you watch 3 bo3s and wait for next split.
        True, incredible miracles would get like 9 matches a year. that doesn't seem like enough from the perspective of those players/fans. I wasn't ever a fan of those teams except maybe jin air so I never had those thoughts.
> i feel like we moved on from that system for a good reason

I wouldn't say that. The reason is "Riot said fall in line". https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ogn-the-champions-winter-future-uncertain-as-riot/1100-6438316/

OGN wanted to continue hosting competition including a 3rd winter split. it was wildly successful, **so much so that riot said "oh no you don't"**

The reason is OGN was told explicitly by Riot that if they want to be able to broadcast for a few more years they have to match other regions splits/format. They then phased out sponsors in preparation for Riot taking over and Riot not allowing 3rd parties to host tournaments any more (OGN).

During the 3 circuit era OGN had different major sponsors for each split. They then cut down to 2 sponsors and splits. Then they cut down to no major sponsors, because they were not allowed to host tournaments. Then they were kicked out.

The good reason was "riot is the only company with broadcasting riots".
    OGN was great. their format wasnt good for a league competition. I don't know, you leave out so much important context and you are not even giving a single argument for the ogn format. 

[https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Champions/2013\_Season/Winter#Overview](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Champions/2013_Season/Winter#Overview)

like wtf is that shit. OGN was successful despite that format. if that format is so great, why did other leagues fail with it? why is no other league copying that format? why did other league that had bo2 moved on from them?

why are other esports not using bo2?

yes, riot unfairly pushed out OGN and other third party tournament organizers, but holy fuck. can you form a coherent logical argument instead of blindly hating?
new rules make it so non worlds qualifying teams need to use their main roster iirc
    >dont teams that went to worlds
Damn I forgot there’s 300 LPL teams. Good luck to them figuring out how to shorten their seasons. Hopefully they don’t move to bo1s or something backwards
Relegations with a whole bunch of extra steps ?
    Special relegations if you will!
Not to mention there is one particular major region with uh... a less than impressive t2
they wanted a tournament for all of the lower placed teams, not actually lose a series to advance.

I'd love to see that tbh, NA 4-6, EU 4-6, vs LPL 5-9, LCK 5-9 - nice 16 team single elim bo5 tournament or something.
no one, you'll actively try to suicide in game. I guess you might learn some stuff about wave manipulation, but it'd mostly be afking and trying to get enemy minions to push faster.

Legit might be the most boring shit to watch
    Spoken like someone who hasn't watched Oscar Night, legitimately the most entertaining series I've ever seen.
This actually happened in an LPL series years ago. For the purposes of playoff seeding, neither LGD or IG wanted to get put on the same side of the bracket as EDG. It's known as "Oscar Night" because the players are acting their hearts out to make it look like they're not throwing.
Not even - this Masters (MSI Equiv?) FNC lost their first 2 games in the VCT EMEA qualifier earlier this year and they were out of the major tournament, no double elim for qualification. TH and KCORP got a tonne of practice in their version of the "play in" before playing against FNC. 

They played 2 games and didn't play another game until this month...
    Team Heretics didn't get tons of practice because they didn't go to the Play Ins (they were first of their Group) unlike KC.

Funnily enough, Fnatic have an advantage over KC and TH because they saw all their strats.
    not even lost their first 2, they won their 1 (one) group stage game then lost their top 4 match. Lost one bo3 and were eliminated.

They were eliminated from 2023 worlds on August 23rd, and started EMEA stage 1 on April 4th.

They played two official circuit bo3s over a 7 month period.
    i mean its not as bad as you are making it out to be but i agree its not great - Leo already confirmed they will be adjusting for next season accordingly. FNC also had a notable advantage coming into that format anyway and realistically a month break is not that big of a deal lol
Title says Riot plans to host. Since the saudi thing is not hosted by riot I dont think thats true.
[deleted]
    I’m not talking about taken or any other esport , I’m talking about league and their very competitive and long season
        league isnt old enough for players to be that old yet. even the oldest players that are playing for a long time are maybe 27-28
    Well I guess if we just ignore every difference between league and tekken, then yeah the league players are just being wacky Lil goofballs quitting their lucrative careers.
Reminds me of the guy in Eurovision movie lol
I still remember when CLG went to Korea (NA and EU) to compete in OGN. That shit was incredible. Pretty sure Hotshot (and CLG) cooked up some absolutely cursed shit too, like Mid Nunu, mid lane swaps. A whole bag of tricks, some worked, some failed miserably. 

It's another reason I always hated when people claimed that "NA teams would suck" if they went to Korea. CLG EU ended up getting 2nd, and although CLG NA got 8th, they got pretty unlucky with the bracket. They were put in a group with CLG EU, and they both got out, but they dropped a game to their EU counterpart, which put them in the bracket against Azubu Frost, who went on to win that event, beating both halves of the team, and also being the runner up to Worlds that year. So despite their 8th place finish they only lost to CLG EU (2nd) and Azubu Frost (1st)

Dig was also there, and they got super unlucky too. They ended up in the group with Najin Sword (regarded as one of the best teams at the time) and Azubu Frost, so they didn't make it out of groups.
KC vs Mad on steroids.
    yeah and with the reach both Ibai and Kameto have many people not even interested in gaming would watch. Everyone in Spain loves a france vs spain in anything lmao
Isn't that just EU Masters  already?
    nah most eu masters teams have imports not many of the teams are made up of 1 region of players
Daily reminder Ibai was hosting one and Riot blocked it
    Completely moronic by Riot. A EuroCup would’ve done insane numbers and engagement.
        Anything to maintain that control chokehold they love so much.
            Unless it's saudi money xD
Yeah looking at this it's definitely closer than it was a few years ago when EG with vulcan/jojo was top of the league. The NRG topside really saving this team, Palafox and Dhokla are a lot better than the equivalent best American mid/top from a couple of years ago.
This would be really hype honestly. It could go either way and by now, all these players have performed on top teams in the LCS except Tomio
Have them play at Rebel for the true experience
Because as an American, we tend to see canada as an afterthought and its funny to me when they are better than us at something.
imagine seeing LCK's hype as fuck spring finals and deciding "we gotta make that be like LEC"
    I mean, I agree, but it's about money. People still seem to not understand Riot loses money whenever they organize a venue. Even big ones, like World Finals, Riot still loses money. And they probably have statistics that show it doesn't make a difference as far as money spent from the fans in-game, which is the whole point of having an esports, promotion of the game.
        So they are so low on funds that they are organizing a third international tournament next year??
            If they change the formats of other regions to LEC format, that will mean all those regions will only have one 'event' per year. So they'll use the money they would use there to hold one more international tournament. Not only they get to host one venue, instead of 2-3 small ones, they also give the fans what they've been asking for for a long time. So people will be like, "Sucks we only have one venue event per year, but at least we have three international competitions."

This is at least how I think they are thinking. I don't know what their plans are, I just know all they care about is money, and they have advanced statistics to know what brings them the most ROI. They don't care about making esports grow, they just care about bringing in more players and having those and present players spend money on the game.
                You think their plan is to make lck finals be played in lolpark instead of national stadiums? That would be awful. Id rather lck and lpl be produced properly than giving western teams another chance to lose.
                    Yeah, I think that's their plan. I agree it would be awful and I do hope I'm wrong, but this company has made think very cynically about the future of the game and everything surrounding the game so yeah, we'll see.
ESL and Saudi money will fuel the event over there and if riot offloads more to Saudi/esl then they won't need those employees
MSI could be a lot shorter, but I doubt that Worlds will ever be less than 4 weeks long. Riot wants the event to be a roadshow.
    ...but why?
Alternatively I do like being able to always watch the tournaments live.

Sucks trying to spend the whole day avoiding spoilers otherwise.
    That's sadly the life for almost every Western fan these days. Even when it's in Europe, it doesn't start very late in the day because it'd be too late in the prime timeslot for China and Korea.
Yea, why would we ever want more LCK vs LPL matches. Who would watch that? More tournaments definitely aren't needed.
Dont play ignorant. It's not a dichotomy. 


You can have both but a different balance between international tourneys and a regional League.


Compare CSGO and its many international tourneys each year to Valorant with 3 international championships and then League with its measly 2.
Same shit though. NRG was just a free ticket to semis for Weibo
    Atleast NRG was a ticket, EU was just a bunch of turds that got flushed down the toilet
        I mean agree they both sucked
I rarely play league these days only watch it. I play tft and valorant
    Sorry, sanest valorant player
What do you mean? How is more international games ever a bad thing? You don’t want to watch the best teams play against each other? Prefer to watch g2 winning in Europe with no competition and NA teams playing in Disneyland?
Unfortunately even if the tournament was serious the problem is the viewers. A lot of ppl casual and esport fans only have enough brain space to think that worlds matter. Thus, it would be on the scale of eh it’s okay but doesn’t mean anything if we didn’t beat CN/KR. And those who care only for domestic titles, idk what they would feel having EU or NA beat their teams.
Are you serious? Is it the opposite actually. From 2023, we have had 2 LCK/LPL/LEC/LCS teams. The old MSI used to have 60+ bo1s and only 3 bo5s lol.
You're right. I thought about that right after I posted that Rift Rivals was absolutely dogshit so it's hard to compare.
Youre underestimating how shit traveling is. The consistency of lcs means you arent having to constantly make ad hoc arrangements to go to various tournaments. And you always have all the best teams (in na) in lcs (or korea for lck). In the fgc theres huge variation in who goes to what events
Why would it be bad for CN? Their market is huge and an excuse to expand on the existing product seems great
    What do China get from playing EU/NA lol?

Going to another international just to spank EU/NA isn't really "good for them", it's just a waste of time.
        They get a 3rd split and a 3rd international trophy to win. It's part of the esport expanding, there is a ceiling to how big it can get in the 2-split format
They're clearly above stooping so low as to get paid in ad-revenue, don't be absurd.
> I think the point he's making genius is that it doesn't particular warrant an article.

Eh? If it's news then it's news. From there it's up to the journalist to decide if it's worth monetising or not, and I see no real reason that a journalist should decide that Elon Musk should get the financial reward for their reporting rather than themselves.
(yes we all know that, genius)

It's a dumb point.

Short news is still news. There's nothing sneaky or underhanded about a news website making money via ads. Genius.
LPL plays in a bunch of arenas around the country though. Logistics might be rough, but at least they have venues to use if they have to fit more games in per week.
    Fair but then playoffs have to be taken into account...LPL would either have to condense that schedule further or revamp it. Which would suck because it would wreck a great bracket format or hard cut the teams that qualify.
        yeah they'd need to cut a few days to make it like 17 days (3 weekends, 2 weeks in between)

Most recent playoffs was 21 days
LPL would probably just move to groups of 9 and 8 im guessing and maybe rotate groups or just do a full round robin split across two splits and then half a full round robin for split 3. LCK/LCS would just do 3 single round robin splits.
it would be absolutely awful if we lose the superior lpl/lck format and they downgrade to something inferior...at worst something like lec.

i am getting my pitchforks ready.
    The lec format isn't that bad if it get spaced out by an additional international (giving more of a rest ) and also gets a road show( that has nothing to do with format but money).
        It’s bad since bo1 still exists
Make it triple round robin BO3. I don’t know why Riot hates making players actually play the game.
The splits will go up in value with 3 international tournaments
What makes it feel watered down more than anything else is the fact that finals are played in the studio imo.

That being said I think they should combine summer and seasonal finals into some extended split so it's 3 titles like old OGN.
    I would legit rather have them play regular split online and then have the finals be a big event. 

We already know it costs them a shit ton of money to run the show every weekend and the regular season games have less audience than a uni lecture anyway.
That’s because winning doesn’t mean anything when it doesn’t qualify the team for an upcoming tournament
It wasnt just fine, it was better and more exciting than any other league. I used to watch OGN religiously and LCK imo has never been as good. A 16 Team tournament format 3 times a year? Bro that shit was better than worlds, especially since season 2/3 worlds still had byes into the playoff stage and only bo3s in quarters, at season 2 worlds even only the finals were bo5. OGN was peak League esports and still unbeaten imo. Only recently Riot has started to use good formats like the new MSI format
    My favourite was when there's like a loser league. If you get completely eliminated, you just get seeded in the 2nd league playoff.

If you're a hardcore esports fan, more content for you. If you're casual, then you can just ignore it as it's less prestigious
    Yup I fucking hate round Robin. OGN will always be more superior to me than LCK cuz of that reason alone. Every game actually mattered.
        Those tournament splits allowed so many exciting storylines that youd never get in a round robin league
            Yup everything is just more exciting. All the way from group draws to finals. Good times 🥲
    How is the old format better??? 3 bo3 in groups determined who advance, losing 2 bo3 mean dropping down to NLB (which nobody cared or watched). The bracket was single elimination tournament, which is worse than current playoff bracket. They only used that format because there was OGN masters in the mid season before MSI was a thing.
Most people here probably didn't watch around then to know this even.
    Most people who compare the old OGN format with what the LEC is currently running have never seen what the old OGN format was acutally. You guys just comment "hurr dur OGN had 3 splits". Them both having 3 splits is pretty much the only similarity. The fact that OGN ran the splits throughout the entire year instead of just half the year like the LEC does now is completly ignored for example.
        Most people throw out LEC having 3 splits as the issue not talking about format or the time. In fact I'd argue the format is actually good and most of the problems people bring up don't have anything to do with a format (like finals being in the studio)
            No, the problem is not just having 3 splits. Its 3 splits compressed into half a year. How else could they realistically do 3 splits in half a year? 

>(like finals being in the studio)

Yes, because it costs more money, which leads to a lack of budget for events.
        You act all snobby acting like we never watched OGN. Brother. You also fail to mention the format difference which LEC can still change. 

OGN had way more teams than LEC and was STILL able to pull it off, EPL in counter strike runs fucking 24 team leagues in less time than riot. How did they pull it off? By having multiple streams. By using multiple days. And guess what these two leagues have? Different formats compared to the dogshit round Robin single streams riot Europe wants to do.  

Just cuz you don't want to change shit doesn't mean the idea sucks. Just change your fucking format. Riot is capable of running condensed formats with lots of teams. Look at worlds. They just don't want to.
            I dont know if you OGN stans just dont get it, but Riot has to schedule the entire season within half a year. **Yes, OGN was good, but the competitive calender of Riot games is not the same as it was in 2013. I would have no problem with 3 splits if we actually utilized the entire year but Riot wont do that.** Riot could also do worlds so it doesnt take an entire freaking month, but they wont. They also have to take current and future eSports like Valorant into account now.
            One downside of OGN is due to the group + bracket system, some teams would literally never play one another. We've missed out on so many potential hype matches because of that.
Completely sifferent. Ogn had gsl groups which was way more interesting than eu’s round robin. But riot came in and said that ogns format was trash and forced them to change it to match lcs.
insane L take
Garbage opinion, I want to see more international bo5s
You can change the format from this shit round Robin that is just fluff
    Can be an will be done is very different— I doubt it'll be possible in LCK any more. Worlds teams' off season and transfers are already affected quite heavily by the schedule. Having another season start in November would not be great.

If it was held this year, they'd have one week in between worlds finals and season start. The Feb end conflicts with the spring start too.

With more internationals and Asian Games coming every 4 years, there simply isn't enough days to accommodate a third full season.

That is, unless you're open to treating players like game slaves and giving them no rest at all. That'd work well.

Don't yap around without backing it up with an actual solution or a suggestion for a different format that might work, rather than just say "BuT wE cAn ChAnGe It" without suggesting anything.
There is nothing wrong with Worlds being the most important. Other tournaments can still exist.

In fact it's a good thing that Worlds will continue to be the most important.
That makes the take even more stupid tbh. So just don't host international tournaments anymore? Someone call up the Dota majors that bc they're not as important as TI they should just cancel them.
Yeah it's not like Kkoma said in interview that they want to win MSI title for Korea after such long time
    I mean what do you want lck coach to say. everyone said the same line. Do you expect them saying “oh we are ready to get fucked by lpl over again. I don't think this time we can win ff15” ? lol
    He has to say that. If he says the opposite rabid Korean fans would lose it.
That is so cope
Bruh, LCK havent won MSI since 2017 lmao
    I highly doubt any teams from LCK, LPL or EU don't care about MSI. Especially with this being one of the best opportunities EU has to play vs the best teams in the world (and with G2 saying that they want to get better)
        The "competitive spirit" in this game has always seemed weird to me. Like pros saying they don't care about Rift Rivals, MSI isn't a big deal etc. In Starcraft you'd have the top players flying halfway across the world to play in a random tournament with a $2k prize pool just for the competition.
            Pros have never said MSI wasn't a big deal. It's always this weird set of fans who seem to believe if it's not Worlds it's not important. Like this fanbase is so bizarre even compared to other esports.
            Rift rivals was literally a meme tournament though so I get not caring about that
                I always thought it was a wasted opportunity. It could've been a good tournament for bragging rights between EU and NA. Maybe expand it to the top 4 teams from EU and NA, 2 groups of 4 in to a double elim bracket so there are more games. Pros not caring about it was sort of my point though, it's like they don't care about competition just for competition's sake. At the end of the day you can only win what is in front of you, and you should want to win everything.
    Yet they win worlds regularly. Clearly they care about both tournaments equally.
The fan pressure on KR teams to win vs LPL is crazy,they were getting death threats last year after MSI
> I don’t mind it but Worlds will still be the only one that teams really care about

So you acknowledge this is false?

Holding worlds in higher regard doesn't imply lack of care about non worlds tournaments. Teams would consider worlds the most prestigious title while still greatly caring about other titles/tournaments. Teams *really care* about winning MSI. Denying that is ludicrous.
The vast, vast majority of League of Legends esports fans have this as their first esport. That much is incredibly obvious.

Another thing that is incredibly obvious is that almost no one was around in 2012 for the tournament circuit.

The sheer amount of ignorance from League fans about completely settled topics in general esports is astounding and frustrating.
the OP was just referring to the 2014 format, yep. Although regions could potentially change formats between splits in current day. Using a new winter split for experimenting for example.
    He/she specified that “their winter split” when in actuality it’s was the format used for all splits prior to 2015. Also I think OP forgot that it was a Bo2, 4 group format where the winner got 3 points. So the crux isn’t winter split but rather the format used
        I went back and double checked for curiosity. 2013 spring had 2 groups of 6 while 2013 summer had 4 groups of 4. They increased the  amount of teams between spring and summer in 2013.

The "format" change, if you would even call it that, was just to fit in the increased amount of teams. It was still bo2 single round robin into playoffs, but with playing less teams because of the smaller groups. The playing less teams was ops concern and did change - for clarity.

This is why the LPL will have the most difficulty fitting 3 splits, they have the most amount of teams so they will either

1. have to go for a format that won't have each team play each other team while maintaining bo3 (groups, 1x8 1x9). upper limit 72 regular season games for a team per year.

2. just do bo2 (16 bo2 matches for each team), this will likely mean increasing matches per day from 2->3 & 3->4. 92 regular season games per team each year.

3. Somehow insanely do 16 bo3 per team which would mean an upper limit of 144 regular season games for the year.
its only good if you liked most of the teams. back in the day, if the team you liked was pretty mid and got pulled into a group with strong teams you watch 3 bo3s and wait for next split.
    True, incredible miracles would get like 9 matches a year. that doesn't seem like enough from the perspective of those players/fans. I wasn't ever a fan of those teams except maybe jin air so I never had those thoughts.
OGN was great. their format wasnt good for a league competition. I don't know, you leave out so much important context and you are not even giving a single argument for the ogn format. 

[https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Champions/2013\_Season/Winter#Overview](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Champions/2013_Season/Winter#Overview)

like wtf is that shit. OGN was successful despite that format. if that format is so great, why did other leagues fail with it? why is no other league copying that format? why did other league that had bo2 moved on from them?

why are other esports not using bo2?

yes, riot unfairly pushed out OGN and other third party tournament organizers, but holy fuck. can you form a coherent logical argument instead of blindly hating?
>dont teams that went to worlds
Special relegations if you will!
Spoken like someone who hasn't watched Oscar Night, legitimately the most entertaining series I've ever seen.
Team Heretics didn't get tons of practice because they didn't go to the Play Ins (they were first of their Group) unlike KC.

Funnily enough, Fnatic have an advantage over KC and TH because they saw all their strats.
not even lost their first 2, they won their 1 (one) group stage game then lost their top 4 match. Lost one bo3 and were eliminated.

They were eliminated from 2023 worlds on August 23rd, and started EMEA stage 1 on April 4th.

They played two official circuit bo3s over a 7 month period.
i mean its not as bad as you are making it out to be but i agree its not great - Leo already confirmed they will be adjusting for next season accordingly. FNC also had a notable advantage coming into that format anyway and realistically a month break is not that big of a deal lol
I’m not talking about taken or any other esport , I’m talking about league and their very competitive and long season
    league isnt old enough for players to be that old yet. even the oldest players that are playing for a long time are maybe 27-28
Well I guess if we just ignore every difference between league and tekken, then yeah the league players are just being wacky Lil goofballs quitting their lucrative careers.
yeah and with the reach both Ibai and Kameto have many people not even interested in gaming would watch. Everyone in Spain loves a france vs spain in anything lmao
nah most eu masters teams have imports not many of the teams are made up of 1 region of players
Completely moronic by Riot. A EuroCup would’ve done insane numbers and engagement.
    Anything to maintain that control chokehold they love so much.
        Unless it's saudi money xD
I mean, I agree, but it's about money. People still seem to not understand Riot loses money whenever they organize a venue. Even big ones, like World Finals, Riot still loses money. And they probably have statistics that show it doesn't make a difference as far as money spent from the fans in-game, which is the whole point of having an esports, promotion of the game.
    So they are so low on funds that they are organizing a third international tournament next year??
        If they change the formats of other regions to LEC format, that will mean all those regions will only have one 'event' per year. So they'll use the money they would use there to hold one more international tournament. Not only they get to host one venue, instead of 2-3 small ones, they also give the fans what they've been asking for for a long time. So people will be like, "Sucks we only have one venue event per year, but at least we have three international competitions."

This is at least how I think they are thinking. I don't know what their plans are, I just know all they care about is money, and they have advanced statistics to know what brings them the most ROI. They don't care about making esports grow, they just care about bringing in more players and having those and present players spend money on the game.
            You think their plan is to make lck finals be played in lolpark instead of national stadiums? That would be awful. Id rather lck and lpl be produced properly than giving western teams another chance to lose.
                Yeah, I think that's their plan. I agree it would be awful and I do hope I'm wrong, but this company has made think very cynically about the future of the game and everything surrounding the game so yeah, we'll see.
...but why?
That's sadly the life for almost every Western fan these days. Even when it's in Europe, it doesn't start very late in the day because it'd be too late in the prime timeslot for China and Korea.
Atleast NRG was a ticket, EU was just a bunch of turds that got flushed down the toilet
    I mean agree they both sucked

The "competitive spirit" in this game has always seemed weird to me. Like pros saying they don't care about Rift Rivals, MSI isn't a big deal etc. In Starcraft you'd have the top players flying halfway across the world to play in a random tournament with a $2k prize pool just for the competition.
    Pros have never said MSI wasn't a big deal. It's always this weird set of fans who seem to believe if it's not Worlds it's not important. Like this fanbase is so bizarre even compared to other esports.
    Rift rivals was literally a meme tournament though so I get not caring about that
        I always thought it was a wasted opportunity. It could've been a good tournament for bragging rights between EU and NA. Maybe expand it to the top 4 teams from EU and NA, 2 groups of 4 in to a double elim bracket so there are more games. Pros not caring about it was sort of my point though, it's like they don't care about competition just for competition's sake. At the end of the day you can only win what is in front of you, and you should want to win everything.
I went back and double checked for curiosity. 2013 spring had 2 groups of 6 while 2013 summer had 4 groups of 4. They increased the  amount of teams between spring and summer in 2013.

The "format" change, if you would even call it that, was just to fit in the increased amount of teams. It was still bo2 single round robin into playoffs, but with playing less teams because of the smaller groups. The playing less teams was ops concern and did change - for clarity.

This is why the LPL will have the most difficulty fitting 3 splits, they have the most amount of teams so they will either

1. have to go for a format that won't have each team play each other team while maintaining bo3 (groups, 1x8 1x9). upper limit 72 regular season games for a team per year.

2. just do bo2 (16 bo2 matches for each team), this will likely mean increasing matches per day from 2->3 & 3->4. 92 regular season games per team each year.

3. Somehow insanely do 16 bo3 per team which would mean an upper limit of 144 regular season games for the year.
Unless it's saudi money xD
If they change the formats of other regions to LEC format, that will mean all those regions will only have one 'event' per year. So they'll use the money they would use there to hold one more international tournament. Not only they get to host one venue, instead of 2-3 small ones, they also give the fans what they've been asking for for a long time. So people will be like, "Sucks we only have one venue event per year, but at least we have three international competitions."

This is at least how I think they are thinking. I don't know what their plans are, I just know all they care about is money, and they have advanced statistics to know what brings them the most ROI. They don't care about making esports grow, they just care about bringing in more players and having those and present players spend money on the game.
    You think their plan is to make lck finals be played in lolpark instead of national stadiums? That would be awful. Id rather lck and lpl be produced properly than giving western teams another chance to lose.
        Yeah, I think that's their plan. I agree it would be awful and I do hope I'm wrong, but this company has made think very cynically about the future of the game and everything surrounding the game so yeah, we'll see.
Yup everything is just more exciting. All the way from group draws to finals. Good times 🥲
No, the problem is not just having 3 splits. Its 3 splits compressed into half a year. How else could they realistically do 3 splits in half a year? 

>(like finals being in the studio)

Yes, because it costs more money, which leads to a lack of budget for events.
I dont know if you OGN stans just dont get it, but Riot has to schedule the entire season within half a year. **Yes, OGN was good, but the competitive calender of Riot games is not the same as it was in 2013. I would have no problem with 3 splits if we actually utilized the entire year but Riot wont do that.** Riot could also do worlds so it doesnt take an entire freaking month, but they wont. They also have to take current and future eSports like Valorant into account now.
