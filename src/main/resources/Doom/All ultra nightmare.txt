[[All ultra nightmare]]


I originally played this game on console, eventually I switched to pc and I finally beat ultra nightmare on all of the campaigns. It took a long time, course I still play with controller. I think my level was 283 or something on console.


Nice!
    Thanks, it's my favorite game.
        Do you prefer it over Doom 2016?
            Yes I do however they're both fantastic games I do think the music in the ancient gods 1 and 2 isn't as good as the main campaign I wish they treated Mick Gordon better cause I really would've liked to listen to some new music he would've created and I feel like the main campaign is just overall better designed something about ancient gods 1 and 2 feels a little bit off
Congrats, now do all the Master Levels on Ultra Nightmare :3
    Yeaaa gonna do that eventually after I take a bit of a break game kept glitching out in nekravol infinite spawns and the sort
        Was it near the end of Nekravol 2 with the Doom Hunters not spawning? That happens a lot with me lol
            It was Nekravol 1 before you punch the statue ironically I think it was also because of the doom hunters not spawning whole glitch happened because I used to bfg but literally before you enter the arena there's a bfg round on the ground so of course I would use it
                Ohhh okay lol. I've had that problem as well since I use cheats to get my season event stuff; I BFG like a goofus and it glitches the DHs into not spawning. I think it's because I somehow killed them before they appear lol
                    All about timing you think they'd test it out better
Congrats! What was the hardest level for you to pass?
    Definitely dark lord fight
        I know you probably won‚Äôt need the tips, but for anyone who is stuck on this fight on UN:

I tried to always keep my distance, and only close in when I‚Äôm ready for any attack he throws. Going aggressive can work for the first 2 or so phases, but one slip up on one of the later phases and you‚Äôre dead.

Whenever you take a hit, try to focus attention on a fodder demon, get that extra health and shield. May seem arbitrary, but from experience, that extra health may just save your fight.
Nice!. Any advice fo people who wants to do a UN run?
    Don't do it, nah jk it takes a lot of patience and practice. You have to accept you will die. I really can't say more than has already been said by others ya know. I would recommend watching videos on how to do UN clears I mainly used the videos to find where demons spawn in each arena and what demon will spawn so I could prepare for each demon I was about to face. Also the last area in nekravol where you need to punch the statue DO NOT USE THE BFG there's a chance the game will glitch and there will be infinite demons spawning in making it so you cannot progress. Also the mission where you fight the doom hunter before you grab the red key there's a cacodemon you can meathook and sling yourself to the end of the map. Also you have to find what weapon mods you're most comfortable with I love using lock on for hell knights and dread knights for example. Also try and figure out quick ways to dispatch certain demons like the cyber mancubus what I tend to do is meathook into them until I'm super close and then I shoot them with super shotgun and then I blood punch which stuns the mancubus basically turning them into free glory kills although it is risky cause of their ground slam attack also the carcass is just fun to kill one blood punch and then you can glory kill couldn't be any easier.

To summarize: deeply study the game. Also you don't need to do every single campaign UN. Even completing one is an achievement.
        the first time i played Doom eternal and DLC i did them all in Nightmare, Died A lot. When i got back in the campain i played like nothing thaths why.
GIVE THIS MAN A ROUND OF CLAPS CAUSE I'M F@CKING JEALOUS OF THIS MOFO
This is the kind of loadout I get paired against in battlemode.
    UN campaign and both DLC doesn‚Äôt really transfer to bm to well 

It‚Äôs when you see Friday night fights üòÇ 
Or default slayer skin and podium when a sweat is trying to avoid getting lobby dodged üòÇ
        It's a real shame too, the first month or so was an absolute blast. Nowadays it's a guaranteed win for the Slayer unless demons abuse the meta. Also wanted to ask, is it true that TAG2 is the easiest UN? Cause it's the only skin that actually looks good.
            For me it was pretty difficult, then again everybody has different levels of skill. Guess the only way to find out is to try yourself, you might find it easy.
                Not so much level of skill but what parts they are skilled at 
Honesty first I seen someone answer dark lord it‚Äôs normally samur or cultist base I see but that is fine it‚Äôs the samur or cultist base or dark lord game can‚Äôt measure someone‚Äôs skill by judgment of one fight 
Not sure if I word that right I am trying to credit you regards what part you struggled with, it is still same end result
                    Yeah I see what you're saying,  maybe a combo of both dean takahashi couldn't pull it off.
                        Though my initial reaction to the dark lord fight(very first time playing it) was probably one of my worst game rage moments like I didn‚Äôt break or do anything, just felt psychically sick from the frustration 
How I think it built up so much was , that I never died but a lot of moments where we both fully healed so might as well be a death but there is no moment as the check point reloads making it even more enduring (noticing as you reload a check point even if it‚Äôs fast that moment of rest like sure I could of paused but it was not on my mind it was go go never stop never give up until I broke)
I gave up that run , and when i tried a second time I went in with the wrong attitude like I kind of was worried about getting that level of frustration again 
It healed once from my mistake and I like ‚Äúnah not today Satan‚Äù and just turned it off and went outside üòÇ at this point I still haven‚Äôt even died to it 
Honesty more proud of coming back to beat it that first time than beating it on UN
            I found ag2 to be the easiest yes , the hammer is so broken, for me at first samur was hardest but more fun than the early game making getting good at the early game more tedious so it became harder by time I was thinking of UN 

There is modded battlemode if you are on PC it‚Äôs balanced better , demons are stronger but in away where they don‚Äôt need summons (they don‚Äôt have them) but need to actually coordinate to win (as slayer is also stronger), the skill cap feels much higher and felt much better not being balanced around summons 

There be some modded battlemode videos on my YouTube somewhere if the demons are white all over that is modded battle mode (we had to make them bright white as there was outline issues)
God damn!!!!! You are fucking amazing!!!!!!! <3
üí™üèª
Congrats on getting all ultra nightmare cosmetics! I know for sure I can never be able to do that since ultra nightmare is super hard for me to finish (and besides I‚Äôve 100% the game so that‚Äôs enough for me haha)
    What matters is having fun you own the game play how you want
Thanks, it's my favorite game.
