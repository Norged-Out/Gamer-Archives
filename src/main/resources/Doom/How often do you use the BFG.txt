[[How often do you use the BFG]]


These apply to pretty much every Doom game. If your confused by the poll options, here are the translations:

Get-out-of-jail-free card = if I‚Äôm swarmed with enemies I use the BFG

Room clearer = if there are a bunch of enemies regardless if I‚Äôm surrounded or not I use it

If there is ammo, I use it = self explanatory 

Big Forgettable Gun = I never use it

Unmayker = Unmayker

Never. But that's only because every time i consider using it, my dumbass brain goes "I should conserve this for when i REALLY need it."
    Same thing happens with me, but then that moment never comes
    There are other easy tactics for threats like Archviles, Tyrants or hunters, i usualy go ice bomb double nade and shield ram the fuckerrs. Works like a charm although my fps goes down like a Grey 4 pay.
Umm, am I the only one who accidentally fires it?
    No lol should‚Äôve made that an option too
        Unless you don't change ur settings you won't fire accidentally
    the game autoswitching back to the bfg after you‚Äôre shooting something automatic and run out of ammo is a pain
    One time I fired the BFG from auto-switching

I was so angry that not even words can express my emotions from that moment
    Accidentally fired it and got the "whew, that was a close one!" achievement.
        Yeah, I just got that one intentionally. Mostly because I played up to the last level on my cool uncle's Xbox but didn't finish, and I now have it on PC at home. Got it accidentally in a different way on the Xbox.
    i do love myself firing the bfg whilst trying to switch to my rocketlauncher
    No.. you're not. I know your pain.. especially when I'm doing my nightmare run on horde mode üò°
    i did that in doom 3 once
    My hotkey setup means I've occasionally gotten it out in hot moments when I actually wanted the chain gun
You forgot,‚ÄùI don‚Äôt want to spend any useful ammo on this demon, BFG time‚Äù
Solely for Archviles and possesed super heavies IF  i don't have the crucible.

Otherwise everything dies by bullet.
    This. If an Archvile shows up he's taking number 1 priority and a BFG to the face
    The possesed Baron of Hell in the Blood Swamps can tank two BFG shots.
        I KNOW!
            I fucking hate that section because of him
That thing does not save me. If anything pulling it out can make me lose my focus and get schwacked before I can even fire. It's for saving ammo on spawn happy Archviles only
TAG 1
If this applies to every doom game where is the option ‚Äúbecause it is a necessary/required strategy.‚Äù  Maybe not in eternal, but enough doom 2 wads I‚Äôd say the level was designed around using the bfg
Not gonna lie, I don‚Äôt really like the bfg all that much, I don‚Äôt think it helps you with learning the mechanics or gaining skill, it just feels like a ‚Äúfuck everything in that general direction‚Äù gun, I usually just use it on tyrants for direct shots or on arch viles
    Congrats, you have figured out the point of a BFG. Its been like this since the og doom
        There are quite a few times in classic Doom (e.g. E3M9) where the game throws such a large number of shot gunners at you at once that you‚Äôd be foolish not to use the BFG
        I feel like ignoring what I‚Äôm saying is a common trend here, not to mention if you‚Äôve played classic doom, the bfg in 2016 and eternal are like bfg times one thousand, the bfg had a small aoe, and was a ‚Äúfuck that thing in particular gun‚Äù.

Besides that I think the bfg could do with a rework, it never felt good ending a fight by just pressing one button, it‚Äôs an issue even on nightmare difficulty, it feels like you just cheesed the fight. Don‚Äôt even get me started with the poor poor umayker, if it didn‚Äôt share bfg ammo it would be so good, but sadly it does, and I‚Äôm not gonna lie it‚Äôs an easy choice between kill everything and kill one thing, and sometimes not even killing it very well
            I mean I guess? There are some really good mods that tweak the power weapons. I think if the unmakyrs initial shot was its strongest, that would be a really cool way to Include it in quick-swicthing
    That‚Äôs the point
I try my best not to use the BFG because I want to be good enough to win fights without it, but I only whip it out in a desperate situation where I know I will be killed unless I drop a green nuke. I admit it saved my hide a few times.

That said, it would have been nice to have BFG ammo when I was recently in the Holt's Slayer Gate. That was a rough battle.
I usually fire it when i am about to lose my un run but 99% i forget about it.
It's not fun so I'd rather use the unmaykr in most fights
I guess it's a get out of jail for free card for me, but I would only use it if I did an encounter for too many times and I just wanna get to the next fight already
The only time I use it is ever on a UN master level like taras nabad with the archvile room or i will accidentally use it by accidentally choosing it on the weapon wheel. I play mostly on console (PS4). Which annoys me to no end on horde mode üò°

I avoid using BFG, Unmaykr, Crucible and the power up Haste and Quad Damage because I love a challenge. Unless it's Bersek... I love the bersek power up and I do use the Sentinel hammer a lot because its effective in TAG 2 and horde mode.
Third option for me. I usually want to challenge myself against the demons saying to myself "what if I don't have BFG ammos?", but if there are ammos on the floor I use them at the right moment
I can't even play the game :,)
archviles usually, dont often have the issue with being too swarmed
It is my absolute last resort.
Its Doom, its not about firing the BFG it's about finding it !!!
The only time I ever use the bfg is on the cyber mancubus encounter at the very end of mars core, I'm too lazy to fight that encounter
Only against bosses
I usually use the Unmayker instead. If I ever use BFG ammo, its usually because I specifically want something dead quick, like an Archvile or something.
I don't use it until I get to a section that I genuinely can't beat after several attempts. Then I try again, BFG when I'm on the verge of failing, and get nailed by the next wave anyway
I wish the bfg and unmakyr had seperate buttons, I accidentally use the bfg all the time while trying to work the unmakyr into combos
PC I never use it. 

Switch I use it after first ssg blast to a Marauder lol.
I like clearing away a lot of fodder and stuff I don't want to deal with. So when I see a lot of crap charging at me and there's bigger fish to fry run to a spot far from them and shoot the big one. The little ones often get caught in it too.
I use it almost exclusively on Archviles. Screw them, screw them in particular.
Pretty useless compared to all the other weapons i just use it whenever theres ammo and the unmaykrs not even worth using given it uses BFG ammo.
In Eternal/2016 only when i feel it's necessary .

In Classic Doom it's usually reserved for Archies , masses of Pain Elementals or Cybers in close quarters. Depending on the wad i'll also keep cells for the occasional slaughter room.
I use it either in master levels sometimes or fire it accidentally on horde mode (that happened a lot). I also use the unmayker but only in cases I face a possessed baron or tyrant.
I've only played Doom 4 but I use it whenever the game makes it obvious.  Essentially whenever you're in a cramped arena and mancubi start spawning in.  I'd ideally like to not use it but I'd rather fire one shot off and beat the section over respawning until I'm a perfect god.
I've almost never used it in any of my playthroughs, I keep it just for the perfect ocassion but that time never comes so
I'll tend use when I have it especially when I play wads on pistol start because you'll never know when you get it again, Its pretty useful for clearing rooms, getting rid of nasty archviles, mowing down hordes, and such
only on ultra-nightmare. i personally think there's no good reason to use it otherwise. if you die, you can just respawn and try again...
Same thing happens with me, but then that moment never comes
