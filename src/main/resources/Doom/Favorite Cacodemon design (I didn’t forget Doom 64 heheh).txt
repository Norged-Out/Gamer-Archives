[[Favorite Cacodemon design (I didn’t forget Doom 64 heheh)]]





If I had to rank them

5: Doom 3, it feels more like the head of another monster than a Caco, and it shouldn't have more than one eye.

4: Doom Eternal, because I prefer the creepier look of 2016, also not a fan of the tiny hands.

3: Doom 64: I like how mischievous it looks, and the big hands and chains are kinda cool.

2: Doom 2016, the lack of a devilish smile and the pupils really makes it look a lot more intimidating, not to mention, it kinda looks like it has meat sickles instead of hands.

1: Doom 1 and 2, simply put, he is best boi, OG meatball FTW.
    This probably wouldn't change the ranking but 2016 had tiny hands too
    Caco is Tomato. Meatballs are pain elementals
        caco = raw meatball

pain elemental = cooked meatball
        Rotten Tomato, Rotten Potato.
I really like the scary 2016 look
    I personally think it looks kinda derpy lol
    Doom 3 caco wants to differ
        I think the doom 3 version fits better as a separate demon from the caco.
            I do like the interesting take from Doom 3, and really wish id would bring more of those designs back as new enemies.
            Tbf all of Doom 3's demons look drastically different than their previous versions.
    Why the hell does everyone in this sub think 2016 is so scary it baffles me
        Its not that they think it's actually scary, it's that 2016 was sorta designed with a realistic fear factor, the monsters are meant to look scary to benefit your power fantasy.
        It’s just not as cartoony. It’s not a horror game, but by comparison it may as well be one
        It looks "metal", not scary. Not sure why they don't see the difference. I think they based them off what would appear in a heavy-metal action comic
[deleted]
    I don’t know how I feel about this
        Feel confused
    That loop is perfect
Doom 3

Jk original’s my fav
I like doom 64's. It looks like a uncanny nightmarish 90s fever dream. Doom 64 is just weird in like a scary way almost...
Doom 1 best meatball
I want og one as my friend irl
Classic, eternal, 2016, 64, 3

64 just looks like a pain elemental while 3 just looks like it belongs in a completely different series

Eternal and 2016 are basically tied, both do things I like more than the other

Classic is just perfecting. Also, try finger but hole

My personal opinion so no hate but:

1. Original DOOM 1 caco. Very devilish smile and a cool, creepy look to it with the pupils. 

2. 2016. It gets rid of the evil smile and replaces it with a no pupil horror design. I understand that 2016 was supposed to be more of a thriller way to put “wow demons guess it’s time to rip and tear” but it still can’t compare to the original champ. 

3. Eternal. I don’t know about your opinion, comment reader, but I like the more cartoony approach to the demons, it’s cool. But it doesn’t give you the same chills and threat as the terrifying 2016 nightmare fuel of a demon. 

4. 64. Pretty cool though I feel it sits more towards pain elemental than caco, so yeah. 

5. Lastly, the DOOM 3 caco. Now don’t get me wrong, had I not seen the other designs this would have been sick, but in my full honesty….I think Doom 3’s caco is….HIDEOUS. AbSOLUTELY DIGORSTING. Now don’t get me wrong it’s scary it’s cool and it gives off really cool demon vibes but I would’ve liked this design a lot more had it been some other type of demon. I very honestly do not like the design and I don’t think it fits the get up if a caco demon. 

Though, don’t take this too seriously and start aggressively shoving the my opinion us wrong in my face, we all have different ones. If you do not have anything nice to say, then please don’t reply.
    I don't see how a demon looking hideo kojima or aBsolutely disgorsting is an issue here? Are demons supposed to look pleasant?

Ah shitemere, I didn't have anything nice to say, I shouldn't have replied.
        It’s not like what you meant to say was mean but I don’t mean it in that context. I’m saying it just doesn’t really look like a demon it just doesn’t really fit the demon perspective in my opinion. Plus making such a major change to one of the most iconic demons in doom was just not it for me. But it’s still only my opinion.
            I think it looks alright... Just not as a cacodemon in a Doom game
The original is best.
Classic. The new ones lack the defining cuteness of the original.
Doom 1 y 2. 

Why do the new ones since 64 have arms? (Doom 3 doesn't count) 

And isn't the Doom 3 caco a lost soul moreso?
    Why didn't the original ones _not_ have arms?

Because of the limited tech, most likely.
        Beholder beasts don't have arms. The guy from dnd? No arms.
            They were an inspiration, though. Not a direct copy.
    What never played doom 3?
        He's incorrect, it behaves as a caco, shoots fireballs, it's a bit derpy in flight maybe due to the engine.
        I have, didn't make it very far. Only encountered the hell knoghts and pinkies. I'm just going off of appearances.
            No it's a caco, shoots fireballs, it's just a bit more skully and less meatbally
Doom 3.
    Same
2016, as usual. The featureless eye made it more alien, and I swear its fireballs were more dangerous.
    Shame they barely do anything on Nightmare, though.
Original for sure
Original honestly haha
Doom 3. I will be taking no further questions.
Og caco
64 and eternal
original
https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Frule34.xxx%2Fthumbnails%2F280%2Fthumbnail_efedf5e46f170e86ced61e26d9a6381a3914e475.jpg%3F279500&f=1&nofb=1
    Confused boner.
The one from Eternal is my favorite. It looks like the OG one,  but better! 

And, actually I like all of them, _except the one from Doom 3_. And don't take me wrong, I like Doom 3 in general,  but that design it's just too different.
Tomat
The only 2 that aren't derpy looking are the Doom OG and Doom 64.
Doom 64 caco is just a pain elemental
don't kill me but

doom 3
    oh nah is fine, I like that design too.
Personally my favorite is Doom Eternal. I wish the model didn’t have any arms, and especially no hands, but it’s not a deal breaker. I just love it’s goofier look compared to 2016, especially the eyes. The 2016 ones try to look creepy, but the problem is that to the player these guys are giant floating ballsacks. They aren’t creepy looking, and giving it creepy looking textures just feels like the model design and the textures clash with each other. In Eternal, I can imagine these things being absolutely horrible to come across as a human, but to the player/slayer it’s a goofy lookin floating ballsack that is hard to take seriously.
Oh wtf Doom 3 is awful
3 make me think what hell like things would look like
Doom 2016 is my favourite, I really like his design compared to others
Doom 64 is underrated but my favourite demon is the revenant because doot
2016/eternal
2016
Eternal because it’s cute
    OG because it's cute
I like the 64 look. I remember the really loud cymbal clash that happened whenever you woke one up. It always scared me on my old 20" crt where i couldn't even see them.
The classic borb. 2016 and Eternal never really clicked with me bc of the little limbs, they seem out of place lol
I love all of them except for Doom 3 which can fuck right off
2016 looks the best to me
All cacodemons are females in the og design

Also I like eternal best
eternal looks so goofy lmao, can't help but want to squish it
Hear me out: Pathfinder's Cacodaemon.  


I know that they are small, i know that they aren't taht dangerous, but i fucking love the design
1 4 and 5. I think this one has been consistent over the years.
Eternal
there's something so cute to me about the 2016 one
First one
Classic Cacodemon: Space Meatball
2016 is so sick
The Classic and Eternal versions
The Eternal version is my favorite design, it's similar to how the newest games in the franchise went about rebooting the series (it updated things that could be changed, but kept the spirit of the original).
2016 takes it for sure, has the dark scary look of doom 3 with the good graphics of the year 2016
1: Happy. Cacodemon enjoys his design

2: Anger. Cacodemon doesn't enjoy his new design

3: Confusion. Why has Cacodemon turned into this?

4: Sadness. This design reminds Cacodemon of his original design. How he longs for the days of 16 bit.

5: Acceptance. Cacodemon accepts that this is his design. He may not like it, but he accepts it.
I always thought the doom 64 cacodemons were pain elementals.
2016 and that's coming from a major eternal fan
I like doom eternal's one because funny hand and cute
2016 I love how it looks like a more relaistic and horrific take on the classic caco

Edi: meatball
I always thought the doom 64 design was a pain elemental
Doom 64. Looks the most evil out of them
Gotta go with original. Hes a wide boi
the OGs.
Classic doom caco is simply timeless
I like the 2016 and eternal ones best, mainly because of memes
Doom 2016 if not counting the og for nostalgia
I love doom 3’s design, but 1 is my favorite
Wasn't the DOOM 64 one supposed to be the Pain Elemental, but the sprites were accidentally swapped?
    No.
I'm sorry but he just looks so goofy in Eternal
I find the OG Caco to be the most iconic demon design in Doom, period.
Doom 1 and 2 and doom eternal
Eternal one is cute.... in a way
I love how true to the original demon design eternal was…
Either original or eternal
2016
I love the original, but eternal is perfection
My favorite design is the one where its ripped in half.
Original and 2016 version.
Eternal cacodemons really capture a similar feel to the originals. Hell that's the case for most of the demons. They did super well there.
the OG all day
All of them, except maybe not doom 3

They are cute and i love them and I want to shoot rockets at them
Original is my favorite, Doom3 least favorite
Eternal Cacodemon looks like a more chill version of the spooky 2016 Cacodemon.
the doom 64 design is my favorite as a design, but as a cacodemon nothing will ever beat the OG, 2016 comes pretty close though
HOW DARE YOU!?!? (Read In Rockos modern life big momma)
    I TYPED A REFERENCE! (But it requires clarification within the comfort of these parentheses)
Prolly DOOM 1 and DOOM 2016
Original all day
The 2016 one looks like a real life demon, definitely the scariest there. The Eternal one looks pretty cool, but the original design from the classics is the best.
I think Doom eternals variant is the best variant out there. Not because it's the newest but because it's just as cartoony as the classic variant with more expression in its face when you show the doom blade through its eye.
OG 1992 raspberry ftw
OG Caco. He just looks like a decent dude who will play some Warhammer with you and not bust your balls with the rulebook.

Edit: [Just because](https://preview.redd.it/sygibmedbzi41.jpg?width=1024&auto=webp&s=7e203218a6035ada3a816e28a514f894ca4a9acc)
I like the menacing look of 2016. 
Honorabel mention goes to doom 1, he is my ps4 prof pic
Probably the og one
Before I'd say the original one and the one from Doom 2016, but now I think the one from Eternal takes the best of both
I like eternal because I like the eye more
Probably 2016, looks soo evil
eternal first, he’s so goofy i love him

1/2 next, an obvious classic

doom 3, it’s such a strange design compared to the others but i have a certain fondness to doom 3

2016 next, probably the most intimidating design and still great

then 64, still great in my opinion but nowhere near as brutal as the 64 pain elemental
Always and only the original, for me. 

It's so cute.
Doom 1 and 2
5) doom 3: idk wtf its supposed to be
4) doom 64: cool but makes me think pain elemental, not caco
3) doom eternal: very good but pupils makes it less spooky
2) doom 1: classic
1) doom 2016: very scary
For me it's 
1. Doom 1/2
2. 2016
3. Eternal
4. 64
5. Doom 3
Same reasons as most comments said.

I would just like to point out that according to doom fandom the reason why Doom 3 caco looks weird is because it was supposed to be a mix between pain elemental and caco
DOOM (2016), Doom (1993) +Doom 2
I think Eternal’s is a pretty good encapsulation of the series as a whole. Like yeah, it’s a big demon with teeth and can shoot you with…whatever they shoot you with, but it’s just goofy enough for the general vibe of Doom. It’s a video game series, and a damn fun one at that. 2016 might’ve been closer to the intended vision of what Doom was meant to be, but over the years it’s definitely embraced the ridiculous nature of it all, and I love it. That’s my take, obviously everyone’s opinions will vary.
the cacodemon one
My favorite has to be the original Cacodemon design. They look cool, mischevious but also kinda cute. Just one perfect tomato boy. Love it.

The D64 Cacodemon is alright. Looks kinda like a pain elemental to be honest but I wouldn't say it's bad. I like the design, it's cool and the chains are a nice detail.

D3 Cacodemon is weird. Really weird. Doesn't look like a Cacodemon at all. I mean it suits the asthetic of Doom 3's strange looking demons. It fits into this game but I doubt it would into any other Doom game.

I really like the D4 design. It's creepy, demonic looking and is just great. I just think they're neat. Also, Doom 4 is the first game of the series I played.

The Doom Eternal Design is just a more cartoony version of the D4 Design. Not bad, kinda cute but I prefer the Doom 4 Version.
The og cus of Cacussy
classic>64>2016>eternal>doom3 imo
OG Doom Cacodemon is the best but I do enjoy the kind of doofusy look the Doom Eternal one has in the photo…
Bruh I’m playing 3 right now and I completely forgot that the caco was in the game
Eternal
Doom 2016
Show us the backside and then I'll rank.
Man it wasn't until they released doom64 on pc that I realized the doom 64 cacodemon had 1 eye. I misread the sprite as a kid and though it had 2 small yellow eyes for my whole life.
If we talking about cuteness then between eternal and D II
2016 one
Og looks the best imo
wtf where they thinking when making the doom 3 desing.

btw favourite one is doom 1
Doom 3's design is my favorite
Well, Doom 3 Cacodemon is, like the entire game, creepier and more horror-looking. I kinda like that, but the classic one always stays my favorite.
Eternal is the best but the og is close
Doom 2016 just looks scarier
OG
This probably wouldn't change the ranking but 2016 had tiny hands too
Caco is Tomato. Meatballs are pain elementals
    caco = raw meatball

pain elemental = cooked meatball
    Rotten Tomato, Rotten Potato.
I personally think it looks kinda derpy lol
Doom 3 caco wants to differ
    I think the doom 3 version fits better as a separate demon from the caco.
        I do like the interesting take from Doom 3, and really wish id would bring more of those designs back as new enemies.
        Tbf all of Doom 3's demons look drastically different than their previous versions.
Why the hell does everyone in this sub think 2016 is so scary it baffles me
    Its not that they think it's actually scary, it's that 2016 was sorta designed with a realistic fear factor, the monsters are meant to look scary to benefit your power fantasy.
    It’s just not as cartoony. It’s not a horror game, but by comparison it may as well be one
    It looks "metal", not scary. Not sure why they don't see the difference. I think they based them off what would appear in a heavy-metal action comic
I don’t know how I feel about this
    Feel confused
That loop is perfect
