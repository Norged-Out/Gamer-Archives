A lot of old designs are also simpler and adhere to certain trends.

You look at an old fantasy novel's cover and the artwork of some characters can look goofy nowadays.

The Cacodemon is obviously based off that one DnD artwork.
    The beholder and Astral dreadnought combined
    Appearantely, his name came from this guy

        Wdym who is that?
            According to my most definitely smart brain that didn't look this up it is inspired by the head of the astral dreadnought that appears on the cover of 𝙰𝙳𝚅𝙰𝙽𝙲𝙴𝙳 𝙳𝚄𝙽𝙶𝙴𝙾𝙽𝚂&𝙳𝚁𝙰𝙶𝙾𝙽𝚂ᵐᵃⁿᵘᵃˡ ᵒᶠ ᵗʰᵉ ᵖˡᵃⁿᵉˢ.

                I mean, I know that. I'm just curious who's that on the painting
                    It's a demon called cacodemon
                    I'm curious about it as well.
The cacodemon is beautiful
    As a cacodemon lover, I agree

    All Caco's Are Beautiful!
The design of the Cacodemon is based on the artwork for a DnD monster (forgot the name of it but it looks very similar to the caco)
    It's based on [this picture of the Astral Dreadnought](https://i.redd.it/7nggi4lncv951.jpg)
        That's what I was thinking of. Thank you. I recognized where it drew inspiration but I forgot what it was called
        I would have thought it was based off of beholders. Guess I was wrong
        Forbidden body cacodemon
    I know, it looked kinda scary
        OG Caco was plenty scary to ten year olds in 1993.  Sensibilities have shifted ever so slightly.
He’s not goofy. Flying meatballs are a very serious matter
    Sorry, i didn't realise that
The DnD creature everyone is mentioning is The Beholder
    The Cacodemon is the Astral Dreadnought's head
    Isn't that the creature with multiple eyes?
        Yeah but not like you would think, has one big eye in the center of its head and a bunch on the ends of it's little tentacle lookin things (which would sort of be the equivalent of the cacodemon's spikes
        Usually 10 magic eyestalks and a big anti-magic eye in the actual body.
I like watching them mate.
    I think you missed a comma
    How do they Mate? They don't have penis
The amount of time I've died to this mf on e4m2 but i still love him

        Very cool image, I'm screenshooting

    All my homies hate Perfect Hatred. Fuck that map.
        That's my favorite map bitch
He is a big goofball and I love him for it. Mike Wazowski mf
    Even his sounds are goofy ahh
He’s a lil meatball
Because they’re squishy good bois
Because silly little guy
we love a spicy meatball
hes in a silly squishy mood
The cacodemon was rather scary back in the day. At least it was to me.
Never ask about the second hole.
He reminds me of Madballs. From the late 80s. I think that was the name. They were baseballs but shaped like monster heads.

Found a pic.
HEY YOU LEAVE MY SPICY MEATBALL ALONE
Dungeons and Dragons gave the cacodemon

BIG

MEATY

CLAWS

    Spongebob reference lol
    Actually, doom removed his claws
        Oh what, the Astral Dreadnought came first? Wow.
            Yeah they just took his head and made him cacodemon
Cause caco is babygirl
What are you talking about the angry meatball is terrifying!
THE SKYFOOGLE
said the guy running around Mars in a tank top.
I started playing classic doom and started e4 today,idk what youre talking ab opening a door and hearing three of them screech is terrifying
    I guess when you get used to it they start to look less scary
Smash
Getting mauled to death by a goofy muppet is a way scarier idea than getting killed by something slick like a xenomorph.
It isn't. It looks scary af.
    Only scary in Doom 2016, kiut in classic dooms and eternal
        When I was a kid growing up playing DOOM on my 32X I found them pretty scary lol
        Doom 3 caco Is very unsettling too
Flying Tomatos, much like Killer Tomatoes, are a joke right up UNTIL THEY ATTACK!
What do the cacodemons holes do? Is he a fleshlight? Is he just stupid?
Just don't look behind him
Why not?
Big floating head with one eye and vibrant skin tone
I think it's a kickass design
Such a cutie
The cacohole
I think the longer you look the more unsettling it becomes. Imagine the classic doom caco in real life, imagine that creepy unsettling smile.
No you
Personally I like him so much I got him tattooed on me
He's just a little guy.

A little demonic fella 

=:)>
How dare you call this thing goofy! The classic Cacodemon design used to terrify me as a 4 year old watching my dad play it on his laptop!
![gif](giphy|41hvmIG9bCsJEfoMFO|downsized)

Critters vibes
But the Cacodemon is my favorite
He's just a silly little guy
Because he’s a silly boy.
He's a meatball with horns, teeth and a green eye. That's why.
    He would've looked 10 times scarier if he didn't have a pupil, like the 2016 cacodemon.
        2016 cacodemon was actually intimidating. More intimidating when you see how big they actually are in DOOM VFR.
He's a giant flying tomato with an eyeball and a smile.

What is not silly about him?
Purely so I'd software can sell more plushies.
    I don't think videogame plushies were a thing back then
I think he looks cute

![gif](giphy|UgdsbZzb2MIjS)
It likes to be goofy
red meatball
I personally think he is a dapper little fellow
To get to the other side 🤣
thats a good caco boi
I can’t be scared of it even now it’s just so CUTEEE
Probably the coolest trash mob design from classic Doom. At least in D1/UD.
Why do you spam post on r/doom?
    I don't, this Is my first post this month
        It's so low effort that it might as well be spam
            I had to point out cacodemon's design
                Nobody on r/doom has ever seen the cacodemon's design before
    Or you could answer the question and not call the post “low effort”
        Low effort posts warrant low effort comments
            Or OP just wants everyone’s opinion on the cacodemon. Everyone got the memo but you so what gives, asshole?
                Ah yeah, because nobody has ever shared their opinion on the cacodemon in the Doom subreddit before. Gotcha. I think I'll post here asking what people think of Doom 3, instead of just looking.
Just a little boy
These things always sneak up on me, and when that happens they are scare af
Anyone talking about me around here?
