{{Nihongo foot|'''''The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild'''''|ゼルダの伝説 ブレス オブ ザ ワイルド|Zeruda no Densetsu: Buresu obu za Wairudo|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 2017 [[action-adventure game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[Wii U]]. Set at the end of the [[Zelda timeline|''Zelda'' timeline]], the player controls an [[amnesiac]] [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] as he sets out to save [[Princess Zelda]] and prevent [[Calamity Ganon]] from destroying the world. Players explore the [[open world]] of [[Hyrule]] while they collect items and complete objectives such as puzzles or [[side quests]]. ''Breath of the Wild''{{'s}} world is unstructured and encourages exploration and experimentation; the story can be completed in a [[Nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear]] fashion.
Development lasted five years, commencing immediately after the release of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword]]'' in 2011. Led by director [[Hidemaro Fujibayashi]] and producer [[Eiji Aonuma]], [[Nintendo]] sought to rethink ''[[The Legend of Zelda|Zelda]]''{{'s}} conventions and introduced elements such as detailed chemistry and [[physics engines]]. The designers drew inspiration from ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]'' (2005) and ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' (2011). [[Monolith Soft]], known for their work on the open-world ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'' series, assisted in designing landscapes and topography.
''Breath of the Wild'' was first planned for release in 2015 as a Wii U [[Platform exclusivity|exclusive]]. It was eventually released on March 3, 2017, as a [[launch game]] for the Switch and the final Nintendo game for the Wii U. It received acclaim and won numerous [[List of Game of the Year awards|Game of the Year]] accolades. Critics praised its open-ended gameplay, open-world design, and attention to detail, though some criticized its technical performance. It is the best-selling ''Zelda'' game and one of the [[best-selling video games of all time]], with 33.31 million copies sold by 2023.
''Breath of the Wild'' is considered one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. Journalists described it as a landmark in open-world design for its emphasis on experimentation, physics-based [[sandbox game|sandbox]], and [[emergent gameplay]]. Numerous developers cited ''Breath of the Wild'' as inspiration, and it is a popular point of comparison among open-world games. A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], ''[[Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity]]'', was released in 2020 while a sequel, ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom]]'', was released in 2023.
==Gameplay==
{{See also|The Legend of Zelda#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of The Legend of Zelda series}}
[[File:Breath of the Wild paraglide.jpg|thumb|left|Players are free to explore the world of ''Breath of the Wild'' using a variety of tools. For example, by jumping from a high elevation and deploying his paraglider, Link can travel quickly.|alt=An in-game screenshot of the protagonist Link, paragliding across a vast world.]]
''Breath of the Wild'' is an open world [[action-adventure game]]. Players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of [[Hyrule]] while controlling [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]]. ''Breath of the Wild'' encourages [[nonlinear gameplay]], which is illustrated by the lack of defined entrances or exits to areas, scant instruction given to the player, and encouragement to explore freely. ''Breath of the Wild'' introduces a consistent [[physics engine]] to the ''Zelda'' series, letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution. For example, during [[thunderstorms]], metal objects will attract powerful lightning strikes; during a storm, therefore, a player must be careful not to carry metal, but may also throw metal objects at enemies to draw lightning to them.
As Link, players can perform actions such as running, climbing, swimming, and gliding with a [[paraglider]], although Link is limited by his [[endurance|stamina]]. In combat, players can lock onto targets for more precise attacks, while certain button combinations allow for advanced offensive and defensive moves.
[[File:Climbing in BotW.jpg|thumb|One of ''Breath of the Wild'' 's major gameplay mechanics is the ability to climb nearly anything in the game. With it, players can reach areas without following a particular path.]]
Besides exploration, players can undergo quests or challenges to obtain certain benefits. Activating towers and shrines will add waypoints to the map that the player may warp to at any time. When Link has at least 13 hearts, he can reclaim the [[Master Sword]] in the Korok Forest. The Master Sword is the only unbreakable weapon in the game, but it can run out of energy after extended use, requiring a 10-minute recharge. In addition to shrines, the Divine Beasts, giant mechanical animals, act as extended puzzles, each based around a unique animal and element. Scattered across Hyrule are small puzzles that reveal Korok Seeds, which can be traded to expand inventory size for weapons, shields, and bows. Towns serve as hotspots for quests, sidequests, and shops selling materials and clothing. Hikers and other travelers offer sidequests, hints, or conversation. Additionally, players can scan [[Amiibo]] figures against their controller to summon items or call Link's horse [[Epona (The Legend of Zelda)|Epona]] from previous ''Zelda'' games and Wolf Link from ''Twilight Princess''.
==Plot==
{{Further|The Legend of Zelda#Fictional chronology|label1=Fictional chronology of ''The Legend of Zelda''}}
''Breath of the Wild'' takes place at the end of the [[The Legend of Zelda#Fictional chronology|''Zelda'' timeline]] in the kingdom of [[Hyrule]]. In ancient times, the ancient Sheikah race had developed Hyrule into an advanced civilization, protected by four enormous animalistic machines called the Divine Beasts and an army of autonomous weapons called Guardians. When an ancient evil known as [[Calamity Ganon]] appeared and threatened Hyrule, four great warriors were given the title of Champion, and each piloted one of the Divine Beasts to weaken Ganon while the princess with the blood of the goddess and her appointed knight fought and defeated him by sealing him away.
Ten millennia later, the kingdom of Hyrule had since [[Medieval technology|regressed]] to a medieval state. Reading their ancestors' prophecies, Hyrule's peoples recognized the signs of Ganon's return and excavated surrounding areas to uncover the Divine Beasts and Guardians. During this time, [[Princess Zelda]] trained vigorously to awaken the sealing magic needed to defeat Ganon while trying to maintain her personal research. In the meantime, a knight was appointed to protect her: [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], a Hylian who was chosen due to his ability to wield the Master Sword, also known as "the sword that seals the darkness". After being sought out by Zelda, the Champions—[[Mipha]], princess of the aquatic [[Zoras|Zora]]; [[Characters of The Legend of Zelda#Revali|Revali]], archer of the birdlike [[Rito (The Legend of Zelda)|Rito]]; [[Characters of The Legend of Zelda#Daruk|Daruk]], warrior of the mountainous [[Goron]]s; and [[Urbosa]], chief of the desert-dwelling [[Gerudo]]—assembled to pilot the Divine Beasts (Vah Ruta, Vah Medoh, Vah Rudania, and Vah Naboris, respectively) while Zelda and Link would face Ganon directly.
However, when Ganon appeared on Zelda's seventeenth birthday, he possessed the Guardians and Divine Beasts, turning them against Hyrule. King Rhoam and the Champions were killed, much of the kingdom was laid to waste, and Link was gravely wounded protecting Zelda while on their way to Fort Hateno. Zelda unlocked her sealing powers, using them to save Link. Zelda had Link taken to safety for him to heal, hid the Master Sword in Korok Forest under the protection of the [[Great Deku Tree]], and used her light magic to seal herself and Ganon in Hyrule Castle. This cataclysmic tragedy came to be known over time as the Great Calamity.
A century after being placed in a healing chamber in the Shrine of Resurrection, an [[amnesiac]] Link awakens in a now-ravaged Hyrule. He meets an old man, who eventually reveals himself as the lingering spirit of [[Characters of The Legend of Zelda#King of Hyrule|King Rhoam]]. Rhoam explains that Ganon, sealed in Hyrule Castle, has grown stronger; he pleads for Link to defeat Ganon before he regains his full strength, breaks free, and destroys the world.
Link reunites with [[Impa]], a Sheikah elder who previously served the royal family, and she instructs him to free the Divine Beasts. Link travels across Hyrule, returning to locations from his past and regaining his memories. At the behest of Hyrule's peoples,{{efn|The Hylians, Sheikah, Zora, Rito, Gorons, and Gerudo}} he boards the four Divine Beasts and purges them of the Blight Ganons, freeing the captive spirits of Hyrule's fallen Champions and allowing them to pilot the Divine Beasts once again. After freeing the Champion's spirits, they each gift Link an ability. Mipha gives him Mipha's Grace, a healing ability, Revali gives Revali's Gale, a flight-giving ability, Daruk, gives Daruk's Protection, which grants immunity to attacks, and Urbosa, gifts him Urbosa's Fury, allowing Link to create lightning. In this endeavor, Link is assisted by [[Prince Sidon|Sidon]], the Zora prince and Mipha's younger brother; [[Characters of The Legend of Zelda#Champions|Yunobo]], Daruk's cowardly descendant; [[Characters of The Legend of Zelda#Champions|Teba]], a Rito warrior; and [[Characters of The Legend of Zelda#Champions|Riju]], the child chief of the Gerudo. After obtaining the Master Sword from Korok Forest, Link enters Hyrule Castle and confronts Ganon. The Divine Beasts weaken him, and after Link defeats him, he transforms into Dark Beast Ganon in an attempt to destroy the world. Zelda gives Link the Bow of Light, which allows him to weaken Ganon enough for Zelda to seal him away, restoring peace and allowing the spirits of King Rhoam and the Champions to depart to the afterlife. Sensing their presence, Link and Zelda smile fondly.
If players have found all thirteen memories in the "Captured Memories" main quest, they unlock a post-credits cutscene in which Zelda declares that Hyrule must be rebuilt and that she and Link must begin the process by themselves. As Link and Zelda survey Hyrule and embark to restore it to—and perhaps beyond—its former glory, the princess confides in him that although her powers may have dwindled over time, she has come to terms with it.
==Development==
[[File:Eiji Aonuma at E3 2013 (cropped headshot).jpg|thumb|upright=.8|With ''Breath of the Wild'', ''Zelda'' series producer [[Eiji Aonuma]] sought to rethink series conventions.|alt=An image of Eiji Aonuma, the producer.]]
[[Nintendo EPD]], an internal division of [[Nintendo]], developed ''Breath of the Wild'' for the [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[Wii U]]. According to series producer [[Eiji Aonuma]], the development team aimed to "rethink the conventions of ''Zelda''". Development started immediately upon the release of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword]]'' (2011). Aonuma received comments from players who wished to see a more interconnected map to explore the locales between the gameplay areas. In 2013, Nintendo experimented with [[nonlinear gameplay]] in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds]]'', which was a common point of praise from many outlets. At [[E3 2014]], Aonuma said he planned to reform dungeons and puzzles, two of the series' major gameplay elements, and redesign the game to allow players to reach the end without progressing through the story. As Nintendo had never developed an open-world game on the scale of ''Breath of the Wild'', they looked at ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' and ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]'', the latter of which had some similar climbing mechanics and whose creator, [[Fumito Ueda]], was friends with Aonuma. For the art style, the team drew inspiration from various Japanese [[anime]] which they had grown up watching, suspected to include [[Studio Ghibli]] and [[Hayao Miyazaki]] productions, among other anime. The protagonist, Link, was redesigned, with Aonuma purposely making him more [[Gender neutrality|gender neutral]] so that players could more easily relate to him.
Before full development, the developers designed a playable 2D prototype similar to the original ''Zelda'' to experiment with physics-based puzzles. The final game uses a modified version of the [[Havok (software)|Havok]] [[physics engine]]. At the [[Game Developers Conference|2017 Game Developers Conference]], director [[Hidemaro Fujibayashi]], technical director Takuhiro Dohta, and art director Satoru Takizawa held a presentation titled "Change and Constant&nbsp;– Breaking Conventions with ''The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild''", during which they demoed the prototype. Aonuma called the physics engine in ''Breath of the Wild'' a major development for the ''Zelda'' series, saying that it "underpins everything in the world" and makes things operate in a "logical and realistic way", allowing players to approach puzzles and problems in different ways. He expanded on the difficulty in developing this system, recalling how one day during development he entered a game area and found that all the objects had been blown away by the wind. As previous ''Zelda'' games increased the amount of actions Link could perform, the development team realized that having too many actions would complicate the controls, so instead of adding more actions, they increased the number of events the player could interact with in the world.

| quote = Our mission in developing this new ''Zelda'' game ... is quite plainly to re-think the conventions of ''Zelda''. I'm referring to the expectation that the player is supposed to complete dungeons in a certain order...we want to set aside these conventions, get back to basics and create a newborn ''Zelda'' so that the players can best enjoy the real essence of the franchise.

''Breath of the Wild'' was built and demonstrated with touchscreen features for the Wii U, but the developers found that "looking back and forth between the GamePad and the screen" was a distraction. The features were removed when the game moved to tandem development across the Switch and Wii U. The Switch version performs better than the Wii U release when docked to a television, although when undocked, both run at the same [[graphics display resolution|resolution]]. The Switch version also has higher-quality environmental sounds. Aonuma said the art design was inspired by [[gouache]] and [[en plein air]] art to help identify the vast world. Takizawa has also cited the [[Jōmon period]] as an inspiration for the ancient [[Sheikah]] technology and architecture, due to the mystery surrounding the period. The landscape was based on locations in and around [[Kyoto]], the hometown of the director, [[Hidemaro Fujibayashi]], and was partially designed by [[Monolith Soft]], who assisted with topographical level design. The initial area was made a plateau so that players can see the world's expansive environments.
{{quote box
| quote = I really think the implementation of this physics engine is a major development for the ''Zelda'' series. The way the physics engine underpins everything in the world really offers up a lot of new possibilities. For instance, in ''Breath of the Wild'' you might have a puzzle where making use of the physics, there'll be various ways you can solve that puzzle. That really opens up a lot of possibilities so there’s not just one way to progress in the game or just one way to solve a puzzle.

''Breath of the Wild'' was the first main ''Zelda'' game to use voice acting in [[cutscene]]s, although Link remains a [[silent protagonist]]. Aonuma was affected by the first time he heard a character with a human voice in-game, and wanted to leave a similar impression on players. After five years of development, the game [[went gold]], with Nintendo holding a [[wrap party]] to celebrate. Coinciding with the launch in Taiwan and South Korea in early 2018, Nintendo introduced a patch worldwide adding traditional and simplified Chinese and Korean translations for the Nintendo Switch version.{{efn|The Chinese and Korean localization is text only and borrows the Japanese voice-over by default.}}
The original score was composed by Manaka Kataoka,{{efn|Under her maiden name of Manaka Tominaga}} Yasuaki Iwata, and Hajime Wakai. Kataoka and Wakai had previously worked on the ''Zelda'' games ''[[Spirit Tracks]]'' and ''[[The Wind Waker]]'' respectively. The soundtrack was primarily written and performed on a [[piano]], with a focus on [[ambient music]] and sounds rather than melodic and upbeat music as seen in previous ''Zelda'' games. According to Wakai, this helped add "authenticity" to the environments and was taken on as a challenge by the rest of the sound team.
==Release==
[[File:E3 - 2016 (27647046866).jpg|thumb|right|A demo kiosk at [[E3 2016]] for ''Breath of the Wild'']]
Aonuma announced the game for the [[Wii U]] on January 23, 2013, during a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation. He said it would challenge the series' conventions, such as the requirement that players complete dungeons in a set order. The next year, Nintendo introduced the [[High-definition video|high-definition]], [[cel-shaded]] visual style with in-game footage at its [[E3]] press event. Once planned for release in 2015, the game was delayed early in the year and did not show at [[E3 2015|that year's E3]]. The ''Zelda'' creator, [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], confirmed that it would be released for the Wii U despite the development of Nintendo's next console, the [[Nintendo Switch]]. It was delayed again in April 2016 due to problems with its physics engine. Nintendo let attendees play the Wii U version at the [[E3 2016|E3 convention]] in June 2016, where they also announced its subtitle, ''Breath of the Wild''. It was listed among the best games at E3 by several publications.
''Breath of the Wild'' launched for both the Wii U and Switch on March 3, 2017. It was the last Nintendo game released for the Wii U. The Switch version was available in limited "Special Edition" and "Master Edition" bundles, which both included a Sheikah Eye coin, a Calamity Ganon tapestry with world map, a soundtrack CD, and a themed carrying case for the Switch. The Master Edition also included a figurine based on the Master Sword. An "Explorer's Edition" was released for the Switch on November 23, containing a two-sided map and a 100-page book of story information. In Europe, the game used unique packing artwork. A five-disc, 211-track soundtrack was released in Japan on April 25, 2018.
=== Downloadable content ===
Throughout 2017, Nintendo released two packs of [[downloadable content]] (DLC) via an "expansion pass": ''The Master Trials'' and ''The Champions' Ballad''.{{r|Verge: $20}} ''The Master Trials'', released in June, adds gameplay modes, features, and items. In the "Trial of the Sword" challenge, the player faces three trials, consisting of twelve, sixteen, and twenty-three rooms respectively. Each room is full of enemies which the player must defeat before proceeding. Every room must be completed before the player can claim their reward. The player begins with no equipment and will lose all progress if they receive a game over. At the end of each trial the player's Master Sword has its attack power upgraded by ten points and the blue sheen of its blade grows slightly. By the end of the third trial, the Master Sword will have doubled in attack power and will glow blue. The pack also adds an optional higher [[difficulty level]], Master Mode, which adds faster rank leveling and raises the ranks of enemies by 1. The enemies are more perceptive when Link sneaks near them and slowly regenerate health in battle. New floating platforms throughout the land offer enemies to battle and treasure as a reward. The Hero's Path feature draws the player's path on the map, designed to help players determine places they have not visited. The player can also find the hidden Travel Medallion to save Link's current position as a single waypoint to which the player can transport Link at any time. New items include the Korok Mask, which alerts the player when a Korok is nearby, and other themed cosmetics related to previous ''Zelda'' games.
''The Champions' Ballad'' was released in December. It added a new dungeon, additional story content, new gear, and additional challenges, as well as the Master Cycle Zero, a motorcycle-like vehicle that Link can ride upon completing the quest line.
A complete "Expansion Pass" edition, containing all DLC on the game card, was released exclusively in Japan on October 8, 2021.

''Breath of the Wild'' received "universal acclaim", according to the [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]]. and holds the largest number of perfect reviews of any game from any year. Several critics called it a [[masterpiece]].{{refn|name=masterpiece|Reviewers who called the game a "masterpiece" include those of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', [[IGN]], ''[[Eurogamer]]'', and ''[[The A.V. Club]]''. }}
The open-world gameplay received praise. Jose Otero of ''IGN'' described it as "a masterclass in open-world design" and "a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored". ''[[GameSpot]]'' called it the most impressive game Nintendo had made, writing that it "takes designs and mechanics perfected in other games and reworks them for its own purposes to create something wholly new, but also something that still feels quintessentially like a ''Zelda'' game ... It's both a return to form and a leap into uncharted territory, and it exceeds expectations on both fronts". ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' wrote that the world was "an absolute, and unremitting, pleasure to get lost in" and that "the magic of being given all the tools in the opening hour is the knowledge that the solution to any problem is already at your disposal, and you can always change tack". According to ''[[Digital Trends]]'', the ability to climb any surface and glide across the map gave players freedom of movement that "broke the genre open, pushing developers to rethink how players interact with the world" and putting extra thought into vertical design. In contrast to "[[Ubisoft]]-style" games that filled the map with points of interest and objectives, ''Breath of the Wild''{{'}}s free-form exploration encourages players to set their own objectives, marking the map with discoveries that serve as a record of what players have accomplished.
According to Kyle Orland of ''[[Ars Technica]]'', the open-world design reinvented ''Zelda'' formula, in comparison to other entries of the franchise. Journalists commented on unexpected interactions between game elements,
Reviewers lauded the sense of detail and immersion. ''Kotaku'' recommended turning off UI elements in praise of the indirect cues that contextually indicate the same information, such as Link shivering in the cold or waypoints appearing when using the scope. Reviewers also commented on the unexpected permutations of interactions between Link, villagers, pets, and enemies, many of which were shared widely on social media. A tribute to former Nintendo president [[Satoru Iwata]], who died during development, also attracted praise.
[[Jim Sterling]] was more critical than most, giving ''Breath of the Wild'' a 7/10 score, criticizing the difficulty, weapon durability, and level design, but praising the open world and variety of content. Other criticism focused on the unstable [[frame rate]] and the low resolution of 900p; updates addressed some of these problems.
===Sales===
''Breath of the Wild'' broke sales records for a Nintendo launch game in multiple regions. In the United States, ''Breath of the Wild'' was the second-bestselling video game during its month of release behind ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands]]''. Nintendo reported that ''Breath of the Wild'' sold more than one million copies in the US that month—925,000 of which were for Switch, outselling the Switch itself. Nintendo president [[Tatsumi Kimishima]] said that the attach rate on the Switch was "unprecedented". ''Breath of the Wild'' had sold {{nts|31.61}} million copies on the Switch by December 2023 and {{nts|1.70}} million copies on the [[Wii U]] by December 2020.
===Awards===
Following its demonstration at E3 2016, ''Breath of the Wild'' received several accolades from the [[Game Critics Awards]] and won the award for Most Anticipated Game at [[the Game Awards 2016]].
After its release, ''Breath of the Wild'' won multiple awards at [[the Game Awards 2017]], including Game of the Year, Best Game Direction, and Best Action/Adventure Game, and was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Score/Music, and Best Audio Design. ''GameSpot'', ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''[[Eurogamer]]'', ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', ''[[GamesRadar+]]'', and ''[[Game Informer]]'' ranked ''Breath of the Wild'' the best game of 2017. According to Metacritic, ''Breath of the Wild'' topped 18 lists of the decade's best games, more than any other game of the 2010s. It also ranked highly in several lists of the greatest video games, including ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''IGN'', ''Edge Magazine'', and ''Famitsu''. In a 2021 poll conducted by ''[[TV Asahi]]'', polling over 50,000 Japanese users, ''Breath of the Wild'' was voted the best console game of all time, above ''[[Dragon Quest V]]'' at number two. A 2023 poll conducted by [[GQ|''GQ Magazine'']] which surveyed a team of video game journalists across the industry ranked ''Breath of the Wild'' as the best video game of all time.

|quote=It's been three long years since ''The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild'' rewired the connections inside my brain. It messed me up. In some ways you might say it ruined video games. ''Other'' video games. [...] It's not ''[[God of War (2018 video game)|God of War]]''{{'}}s fault that it's not ''Breath of the Wild''. It's not ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]''{{'}}s fault that it's not ''Breath of the Wild''. I spent a good 10 hours playing ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'', hoping it was ''Breath of the Wild'', then eventually gave up. No one's fault. Sorry, other video games. You tried, but you weren't ''Breath of the Wild''.

Shortly after ''Breath of the Wild''{{'s}} release, journalists and video game industry figures discussed how it would influence future open-world games and the ''Zelda'' series. Benjamin Plich, designer of ''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]'' and ''[[For Honor]]'', said that he believed developers would take inspiration from its focus on experimental and [[emergent gameplay]], such as "the ability to experiment with things more freely, in an open way" and having a sense of autonomy and experimentation with the environment and the tools at their disposal. Damien Monnier, designer of ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt]]'', said ''Breath of the Wild'' managed to bring classic open world mechanics together while not relying on them to guide the player through its world, encouraging players to explore. and the game was noted for its experimental chemistry engine, emphasizing chemistry as much as physics. ''[[PC Gamer]]'' wrote that it set a new standard for its genre and the future games to come. and ''[[GQ]]'', whose list was advised by game developers, streamers, directors, writers and others across the world.
In the years since its release, multiple games and developers have cited ''Breath of the Wild'' as an inspiration. These include ''[[Genshin Impact]]'', ''[[Ghost of Tsushima]]'', ''[[Immortals Fenyx Rising]]'', ''[[Telling Lies (video game)|Telling Lies]]'', ''[[Halo Infinite]]'', ''[[Elden Ring]]'', and ''[[Forspoken]]''. Similarities have also been noted between ''Breath of the Wild'' and other open-world games since its launch, including ''[[Pokémon Legends: Arceus]]'', ''[[Sonic Frontiers]]'' and ''[[Horizon Forbidden West]]''. According to ''Digital Trends'', ''Breath of the Wild'' has become a popular point of comparison among open world games.
The success sparked increased interest in the Wii U emulator [[Cemu]], as the Cemu developers rapidly updated the software to run ''Breath of the Wild'' at a steady frame rate within weeks of release. The ability to run the game in an emulator led to a thriving [[Video game modding|modding]] scene.
''[[Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity]]'', a [[hack and slash]] game in the style of ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'' series, following 2014's ''[[Hyrule Warriors]]'', is a spin-off of ''Breath of the Wild'', with the story set 100 years before. It was released on November 20, 2020, on the Nintendo Switch.
=== Sequel ===
{{Main|The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom}}
A sequel was announced at [[E3 2019]] with the title later revealed to be ''The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom''. It was conceived during planning for ''Breath of the Wild''{{'s}} DLC; the team came up with too many ideas, some of which could not be implemented due to technical constraints, so used them for a new game. According to Aonuma, the sequel would build atop the original's world with a new story and gameplay elements, and is inspired in part by ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]''. Fujibayashi returned as the director. The game was released on May 12, 2023.
