'''''Shadows of Mordor: Game Two of Lord of the Rings''''' is a [[text adventure game]] for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Apple II]], [[DOS]], and [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh]]. It is based on the second part of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' story. It's a sequel to ''[[Lord of the Rings: Game One]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit (1982 video game)|The Hobbit]]''.
The game focuses on [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] (with [[SmeÃÅagol]] as an NPC) on their journey to [[Mordor]] to destroy the [[One Ring]]. The game is considered{{by whom|date=August 2017}} an improvement over its predecessor, though still not on par with ''[[The Hobbit (1982 video game)|The Hobbit]]''.
The game was followed by ''The Crack of Doom'' in 1989, which was released on [[Commodore 64]], [[Apple II]], [[DOS]], and [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh]].
==Reception==
''[[Macworld]]'' reviewed the Macintosh versions of ''[[The Hobbit (1982 video game)|The Hobbit]]'', ''[[Lord of the Rings: Game One|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and ''The Shadows of Mordor'' simultaneously, criticizing ''The Hobbit'', calling it "particularly clumsy" as it is "handicapped by a 400-word input vocabulary" as opposed to the latter two games' 800 words. ''Macworld'' calls ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' "particularly intricate" and recommends it as an entry point to the series as opposed to ''The Hobbit''. ''Macworld'' praises ''The Hobbit's'' graphics, but states that in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' and ''The Shadows of Mordor'' the art adds little to the games' overall appeal. Furthermore, ''Macworld'' heralds the three games as "literate and faithful in spirit to original books", but criticizes the dated and "rigid" nature of the text-adventure format.
