''Bloons TD 6'' is a [[tower defense]] game played from a [[2.5D]] perspective, as opposed to the 2D perspective of previous ''[[Bloons Tower Defense]]'' games, and utilizes [[3D computer graphics]].
In the game, the player—who is able to team up with up to three other players in a [[Cooperative video game|co-op]] mode ''Bloons TD 6'' introduces a new category of monkeys, known as "heroes", which level up and become stronger either over time, or through the player using in-game currency to increase their level. When destroyed, Bloons grant the player money, which can be used to purchase additional defenses or upgrade existing ones As the player pops more Bloons each round, the player and all active towers gradually earn XP every round, which help unlock new upgrades and other features as the player continues to play the game.
Bloons spawn in several [[Glossary of video game terms#wave|waves]], and travel along a predetermined path. Sets of waves are separated into rounds, each of which consists of a set amount of Bloons, which over time become stronger and may have properties resistant to certain effects, Some maps contain obstacles that will prevent monkeys from shooting at bloons in front of the offending area (some of which can be removed for a set amount of cash).
The player can earn several [[In-game currency|in-game currencies]] through gameplay: "Monkey Money" is rewarded for winning rounds or completed challenges and allows for additional features to be unlocked in the game,
Boss Bloons are a type of special event in the game, first introduced in ''[[Bloons TD 5]]''. In these events, players must prepare for a Boss Bloon, a very powerful MOAB class bloon with large amounts of health. The boss will appear first at round 40, and appears every 20 rounds after that, its health increasing each time. These bosses have special abilities, such as summoning recently popped bloons, speeding up regular bloons, or become immune to certain monkey types. There are 5 boss bloons: Bloonarius, Lych, Vortex, Dreadbloon, and Phayze.
Paragons, the first of which being introduced in the same update as bosses, were built as their counter. Being some of the most expensive tower upgrades, they combine each of the tower's 3 paths into one much more powerful upgrade. They are some of the most powerful towers in the games, and especially excel against bosses due to a damage buff against them. There are currently 8 Paragons: the Apex Plasma Master (Dart Monkey), Glaive Dominus (Boomerang Monkey), Master Builder (Engineer Monkey), Goliath Doomship (Monkey Ace), Magus Perfectus (Wizard Monkey), Nautic Siege Core (Monkey Sub),

==Reception==

''Bloons TD 6'' received mostly positive reviews from critics. [[New Zealand Game Developers Association]] secretary Stephen Knightly praised the depth of the gameplay in ''Bloons TD 6'', specifically the visual appeal to a general audience and the level of complexity for more experienced players: "It's fun and friendly, so it's accessible, but under the surface it's quite complicated". Although praise was given for its extended gameplay variety, it was also criticized for its lack of replayability. Because ''Bloons TD 6'' is a paid app featuring in-app purchases that may be used to unlock certain features in the game faster, some critics argue that the game feels like it runs on a [[Freemium|freemium model]].
Harry Slater from ''Pocket Gamer'' describes the core gameplay as being too reliant on the mechanics of older games in the series, which he claims doesn't provide enough impact for players wanting to play the game long-term.
The cartoonish visuals used in the game were praised for its appeal for a wider audience, particularly through combination of playability and complexity. Critics have noted the use of characterization of towers and long-term success of the predecessor ''Bloons TD'' games as factors to the success of ''Bloons TD 6''. Note was taken about the complexity of the game and the game mechanics accompanied with the game; PCGamesN describes the complexity of ''Bloons TD 6'' to be given a "whole new plane of addiction" when it comes to integrating the highlighted focus of interacting monkey characters with the main gameplay, while other critics state that the implementation of such features may feel too childish or otherwise make the game appear too generic or dependent on microtransactions.
The business model for ''Bloons TD 6'' has received mixed reviews. Simon Hill from ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' perceives the business model of the game to take into account both the premium market and the freemium market: "It’s a premium game that fully justifies the price of entry, but it also offers a wide range of microtransactions that includes the usual cosmetic upgrades, gameplay boosts, and unlimited access to special events." He also praises the balance of replayability with complexity, mainly through the deepened progression and development of strategy in a tower defense context. Further attention has been pointed towards the conventional mobile market, which generally relies on the freemium model as the primary source of income, and pointed out that ''Bloons TD 6'' lacks third-party advertisements but varies use of optional in-app purchases in the game. Others are more critical and negative on the business model for ''Bloons TD 6''. One critic from MetaCritic argues that the game has an overwhelming amount of content that lack sufficient replayability and uses a dubious mix of premium and freemium marketing styles.
=== Sales ===
''BTD6'' topped as the best-selling app within the first week of release. It now receives over 10,000 constant players on average for any given moment on steam, being the largest Bloons game in the franchise by far.

''Kotaku'' noted that [[New Zealand]]'s gaming industry revenue surpassed that of Australia's gaming industry in 2019, with one of the main sources being from ''Bloons TD 6'', the others being ''[[Path of Exile]]'' by [[Grinding Gear Games]] and ''Valleys Between'' by Little Lost Fox.
=== Legacy ===
The game regularly receives updates that include constant balance changes and additional content. As of April 2024, there has been 42 major updates added to the game.
Ben "RidiculousHat" Goodman from ''PC Gamer'' praises the continuous development of ''Bloons TD 6'', which regularly refines the balance in the game through updates to promote a variety of gameplay.
The success of the ''Bloons TD'' franchise had been given praise by digital investment company [[Modern Times Group]], with special note on Ninja Kiwi's continuous work to "pioneer" the tower defense genre in an economically viable but quality format.
