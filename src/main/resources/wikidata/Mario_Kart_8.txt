{{nihongo foot|'''''Mario Kart 8'''''|マリオカート8|Mario Kāto Eito|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 2014 [[kart racing game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Wii U]]. It retains the gameplay of previous games in the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' series, with players controlling a ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' franchise character in races around tracks. Tracks are themed around locales from the ''[[Super Mario]]'' platform series and are populated with [[power-up]]s that help players gain advantages in races. Different difficulties are selectable prior to a race; harder difficulties make gameplay faster. In the new [[anti-gravity]] sequences, players drive on walls and ceilings. ''Mario Kart 8'' contains a variety of [[single-player]] and local and online [[multiplayer]] games modes, including [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] racing and arena-based battle modes.
Nintendo revealed ''Mario Kart 8'' in 2013, and released it in May 2014. Both paid and free [[downloadable content]] (DLC) were released after its launch, including a further difficulty setting and additional tracks. It was re-released on the [[Nintendo Switch]] in April 2017 as {{nihongo foot|'''''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'''''.|マリオカート8 デラックス|Mario Kāto Eito Derakkusu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha|ref_name=}} ''Deluxe'' includes all of the original DLC, as well as a revamped battle mode and other gameplay alterations. Nintendo continued to add downloadable circuits and characters as paid DLC.
''Mario Kart 8'' was a critical success; reviewers praised its gameplay and presentation, but the battle mode received mixed reviews. Critics praised ''Deluxe'' as the definitive version of ''Mario Kart 8'' for its improved battle modes and presentation. Both releases have been named by critics as among the best ''Mario Kart'' games, have won and been nominated for several awards, and have been cited in following years as being among the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]]. ''Mario Kart 8'' is one of the [[best-selling video games of all time]], at over 69.04&nbsp;million sold. It is also the [[best-selling Wii U game]] at 8.46&nbsp;million sold and the [[best-selling Nintendo Switch game]] at 60.58&nbsp;million.
==Gameplay==
{{See also|Mario Kart#Gameplay|label 1=Gameplay of ''Mario Kart''}}
[[File:MK8 Mario Circuit.jpg|thumb|left|Anti-gravity racing introduced in ''Mario Kart 8'']]
''Mario Kart 8'' is a [[kart racing game]]; players control characters from the ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' universe to race in [[go-kart]]s around a course. They may hinder their opponents or improve their performance using [[power-up]]s found in item boxes throughout the course. It includes four different difficulties, each differing in speed, which may be selected before the race. "Mirror Mode" horizontally inverts all courses. Returning features from previous installments include [[motorbike]]s and 12-player racing from ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'', as well as [[hang glider]]s, underwater racing and vehicle customization from ''[[Mario Kart 7]]''. Up to four players can play together on a single system, up to eight can play together through a local wireless connection (Nintendo Switch only), and up to twelve can play together via online multiplayer.
The signature new feature of ''Mario Kart 8'' is [[anti-gravity]] racing, in which certain parts of a course allow racers to drive on walls and ceilings. The game features 32 courses spread across eight cups, with an additional 16 courses later released as [[downloadable content]] (DLC) in four additional cups.
===''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe''===
''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' includes all [[downloadable content]] (DLC) for ''Mario Kart 8'', including characters, courses, and vehicle components, into a single product for [[Nintendo Switch]], as well as being the first ''Mario'' game for the console. In addition to previous DLC, several new characters were introduced in ''Deluxe'', including the [[Inkling (Splatoon)|Inklings]] from ''[[Splatoon]]'', [[Bowser Jr.]], [[Dry Bones (character)|Dry Bones]], and [[King Boo]]. Other notable changes to the gameplay include the ability to hold two items at once, and [[accessibility]] features to assist newer players, such as auto-acceleration or smart steering, which prevents players from veering off course.

Isabelle is driving towards a blue switch with a key icon placed below a yellow and blue cage.

The largest addition to ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' is the updated battle mode. ''Deluxe'' includes five new battle mode-exclusive courses, and three battle courses adapted from previous entries in the ''Mario Kart'' series. These battle courses are designed specifically for the mode, featuring layouts that allow for easier item play, rather than repurposing standard race courses like ''Mario Kart 8''. The Feather item, reintroduced from previous entries in the series, is exclusive to this mode and allows the player to get a small boost in height when it is activated. In Coin Runners, players scavenge coins from around the course and steal them from other players, aiming to have the biggest hoard. The final mode is Renegade Roundup, which involves a team of "renegades" trying to avoid the "authorities" armed with [[Piranha Plant]]s, which takes inspiration from the children's game "[[Tag (game)#Cops and robbers|cops and robbers]]". Renegades may free their captured teammates by driving over switches under the cages controlled by the authorities.

==Development and release==
[[File:Wii U Console and Gamepad.png|thumb|''Mario Kart 8'' was released exclusively for the [[Wii U]].|left]]
Initially confirmed in a January 2013 [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation, ''Mario Kart 8'' was fully unveiled at [[E3 2013]]. Some members of [[Bandai Namco Games]] received special thanks in the credits.
[[File:E3 2013 (9020973991).jpg|thumb|A replica of the standard kart seen in ''Mario Kart 8'' at [[E3 2013]]]]
Nintendo's launch promotions of ''Mario Kart 8'' include a Limited Edition with a Spiny Shell figurine; and special [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] themed console bundles, with a hat, strategy guide, Wii Remote Plus controller, Wii Wheel, and GamePad protector. A soundtrack album containing 68 tracks from the game was made available as an exclusive reward available to [[Club Nintendo]] members shortly preceding the service's discontinuation in 2015.
Game updates added new features and [[user experience]] improvements, such as support for [[Amiibo]] figurines, a 200cc difficulty setting, player statistics, and additional [[Mii]] outfits. Downloadable content for ''Mario Kart 8'' is no longer available to purchase due to the discontinuation of the [[Nintendo eShop]] for Wii U.
In March 2023, Nintendo halted online play for ''Mario Kart 8'' and ''[[Splatoon (video game)|Splatoon]]'' due to a [[security vulnerability]]. The issue was fixed with an update, and online play resumed on August 3, 2023. Nintendo further stated that if further issues occurred, online play may be discontinued for the games. On October 4, 2023, Nintendo announced that [[Nintendo Network|online services]] for most Wii U and Nintendo 3DS software, including ''Mario Kart 8'', would end by April 2024. Online services for ''Mario Kart 8'' were terminated on April 9, 2024.
===''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe''===
[[File:Nintendo-Switch-wJoyCons-BlRd-Standing-FL.jpg|thumb|''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' was announced alongside and exclusively released for the [[Nintendo Switch]], a [[hybrid console]] that allows for both [[Handheld game console|handheld]] and [[Home video game console|docked]] play.|alt=The Nintendo Switch in handheld mode. The center tablet is black, and attached on both sides are Joy-Con controllers. The left Joy-Con is blue, with several buttons. The right Joy-Con is red, with several other buttons.|left]]
After initially being [[Teaser (trailer)|teased]] alongside the Nintendo Switch's announcement in October 2016, ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' was formally revealed at the Nintendo Switch Presentation on January 12, 2017. The trailer showcased mechanics such as Smart Steering and crossover elements from the ''Splatoon'' series—additional crossovers with ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'' were added in an update post-launch. The release date was set for April 28, 2017, only a month after the Switch's March 3 launch. An overview trailer revealed details about the game's battle mode including several battle mode-exclusive courses, as well as the return of the Shine Thief mode from ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]''. After the release of the trailer, several [[internet meme]]s circulated surrounding [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] appearing to perform a celebratory [[Dab (dance)|dab]]. ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' revamps the battle mode, adds a second item slot, among other minor gameplay improvements.
Shortly after launch, Nintendo released a [[Patch (computing)|software update]] that changed one of the victory gestures done by the Inkling Girl. Prior to the update, the Inkling Girl performed a gesture that consisted of placing her hand on a flexed [[Biceps|bicep]] and pumping her fist into the air. In Japan, the gesture means something similar to "bring it on!", though in [[Europe]]an and [[Latin America]]n countries, it was likened to the [[bras d'honneur]], an offensive gesture that can be interpreted as "up your ass", "[[Fuck|fuck you]]", or similar meanings. After the update, the Inkling Girl no longer clenches her fist around her flexed arm, instead simply performing a "[[fist pump]]", though the rest of the gesture was unchanged.
A series of updates in 2018 added compatibility with [[Nintendo Labo]], a [[toys-to-life]] kit that uses [[cardboard]] to create motion-controlled toys with Joy-Con controllers. The first update enabled the Toy-Con Motorbike as a controller for ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'', allowing the player to use the physical [[throttle]], [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebars]], and [[gyroscope]] present on the Toy-Con Motorbike, while actions like braking, drifting, and item pickups are still performed using the standard controller buttons. A later update added compatibility for the Toy-Con Car, Pedal, and Key to control actions like braking, drifting, and using the horn on the steering wheel to launch items.
An update released on December 7, 2022, added an item customization option for certain modes, allowing players to choose which items are obtainable in a race or Battle.
====Booster Course Pass====
During a February 2022 [[Nintendo Direct]], it was announced that ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' would get a paid downloadable content [[Season pass (video games)|season pass]] called the "Booster Course Pass". Courses in the "Booster Course Pass" are largely remastered from their incarnations in previous ''Mario Kart'' games. The "Booster Course Pass" was released in six waves, with each wave containing eight courses split into two cups, totaling to 48 additional tracks that were released between March 2022 and November 2023. It can be accessed by purchasing it on the Nintendo Switch's [[Nintendo eShop|eShop]], or by having an active [[Nintendo Switch Online|Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack]] subscription. Wave 2 was released on August 4, 2022, containing the Turnip Cup and the Propeller Cup. It also featured Sky-High Sundae, an original course not introduced in a previous ''Mario Kart'' game. Alongside the release of Wave 2, Nintendo released an update to the Wave 1 course Coconut Mall that changed the cars at the end of the course to perform [[Doughnut (driving)|donuts]], rather than remaining stationary, except for in [[Time trial#Video games|Time Trials]]. This change was widely praised, especially after many were disappointed that the cars were stationary in the "Booster Course Pass" to begin with.{{Efn|Supported by multiple sources:|name=Coco}} Wave 3 was released on December 7, 2022, containing the Rock Cup and the Moon Cup. The ability to remove certain items from "VS Race" mode and online races was also added. Wave 4 was released on March 8, 2023, in North America and March 9 elsewhere, containing the Fruit Cup and the Boomerang Cup. It also featured a brand new original course based on ''[[Yoshi's Island]]'' (1995). Wave 5 was released on July 12, 2023, containing the Feather Cup and the Cherry Cup. It also featured a brand new course, Squeaky Clean Sprint. The final wave, Wave 6 was shown off in a Nintendo Direct on September 14, 2023, and released on November 9, 2023, containing the Acorn Cup and the Spiny Cup. Wave 6 features the addition of a music player featuring music from all courses in the game, as well as 18 additional costumes for the Mii racers.
Starting in February 2023, Nintendo added eight more playable characters to the game, all having previously appeared in other ''Mario Kart'' titles. The first of these characters, [[Birdo]], debuted in Wave 4; [[Petey Piranha]], [[Wiggler (Mario)|Wiggler]], and [[Kamek]] in Wave 5; and [[Diddy Kong]], [[Funky Kong]], [[Pauline (Nintendo)|Pauline]] and [[Peachette]] in Wave 6.

''Mario Kart 8'' received "generally favorable" reviews, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]],{{Efn|name=MCScore}} Overall, reviewers held ''Mario Kart 8'' in high esteem among racing games,{{Efn|Supported by multiple sources: Improvements in ''Deluxe'' made certain features of ''Mario Kart 8'' feel worse in retrospect. However, many reviewers criticized the lack of new content in ''Deluxe'' compared to ''Mario Kart 8''.{{Efn|Supported by multiple sources: |name=NoNew}}
The main racing mode of ''Mario Kart 8'' was widely praised. ''[[Eurogamer]]'' called it the "most vibrant home console racing game in years". The [[Rubber banding (games)|rubber-banding]] mechanics present in the game's [[AI]] competitors was criticized, though ''[[Game Informer]]'' noted that "fans accepted that pitfall as a series mainstay long ago". Finding the core racing unchanged, they said ''Deluxe'' is still "the same great title from the Wii U". ''GameSpot'' and ''[[Nintendo Life]]'' also considered ''Deluxe'' 's racing to be as strong as the original. Minor mechanical changes, such as the ability to hold two items, were praised, with many liking how it added more strategy to ''Deluxe'' 's item play.{{Efn|Supported by multiple sources: |name=DoubleItem}} Accessibility options like smart steering and auto-acceleration received mixed feedback. Many felt that the additions made ''Deluxe'' the most accessible ''Mario Kart'' game, and others appreciated how they helped less experienced players enjoy the game, despite making the game too easy for veteran players.{{Efn|Supported by multiple sources: |name=HelpNewPlayers}} However, some reviewers disliked how smart steering was enabled by default, and how it could overcorrect or interfere with precision inputs.
The main criticism levied at ''Mario Kart 8'' was its battle mode, which was less well received than previous entries. ''[[Easy Allies]]'' called it "abysmal", However, ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' said that the battle mode was "not so much a point for ''Deluxe'' that these modes are included as it is a retroactive demerit for the original ''Mario Kart 8''". Many critics considered Renegade Roundup to be the best of ''Deluxe'' 's battle modes,{{Efn|Supported by multiple sources: |name=Renegade}} though ''[[GameRevolution]]'' and ''[[USgamer]]'' said it was their least favorite.
Reviewers also focused on the graphics and visual style of the game. ''[[Eurogamer]]'' praised both the vast sense of scale and the "exquisite details" of the courses. ''Eurogamer'' called the game's soundtrack "outrageously upbeat", and that ''Deluxe'' 's "defining moment" was the game's live band rendition of ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' 's main theme.
===Booster Course Pass===
Upon announcement, the "Booster Course Pass" received mixed reception from fans. Many fans disliked that additional content for a previous game was being prioritized over a new entry in the series, citing how it had been nearly eight years since ''Mario Kart 8'' first released on the [[Wii U]]. The graphics of the courses in the "Booster Course Pass" were also a point of contention, with some saying that they fell short of the standards set by ''Deluxe''.

After release, critics were mixed—according to Metacritic, Waves 1 & 5 received "mixed or average reviews",{{Efn|Score based on 10 reviews{{Efn|Score based on 7 reviews ''Digital Foundry'' attributed this to the courses being built upon their versions from ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]''. Another common criticism was that the earlier courses did not include ''Mario Kart 8'' 's signature anti-gravity or underwater features.{{Efn|Supported by multiple sources: ''Nintendo Life'' praised the audio design, calling it "stellar" and "a delight". The addition of courses that vary every lap was praised by critics, with ''Nintendo Life'' wishing it would become a "mainstay" feature of the series.

===Fan response===
"Luigi's death stare" is an [[Internet meme]] describing the automatic facial expression displayed by [[Luigi]] toward other characters upon attacking or passing them during a race, in which he gives them a disapproving [[Glaring|glare]]. It was featured in several [[viral video]]s and animated [[GIF]]s, and the phenomenon was covered by [[WNYW]] in early June 2014. Nintendo referenced the meme in their [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014|E3 2014]] digital event. ''[[VentureBeat]]'' praised Nintendo's handling of the meme, noting that it was a "slick way" of acknowledging fan culture. The meme was nominated for the Best Gaming Moment at the 32nd [[Golden Joystick Awards]].
Several [[Video game modding|mods]] have been created for ''Mario Kart 8'' and ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe''. In February 2022, a mod was created that added [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]]'s Mouthful Mode car transformation ([[Colloquialism|colloquially]] known as "Carby") from ''[[Kirby and the Forgotten Land]]'' as a selectable kart and character. In June 2022, a mod was published that added [[Green Hill Zone]] from the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series as a course.
