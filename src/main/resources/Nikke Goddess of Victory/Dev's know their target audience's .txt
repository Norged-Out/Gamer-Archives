        I can't deny it, because i play both of them
        What‚Äôs the glaring one?

                I know the cunny  meme with the crying face and the angry red lines, but what is the crab supposed to mean?
                    cunny sounds like kani, which is japanese for crab. illiterate brat needs to be educated ‚Ä¶ üí¢üí¢üí¢
    Haha. I play AL and I do spend money. Gotta have those skins. Oh and dock space.
        How much do skins typically cost on AL?
            They range from 780 gems to 1200 gems per skin. Depending if its L2D or not. How lewd it is (I think that affectd price) and the shipgirl's popularity.

You can buy gems for $1, $5, $10, $20  and all the way up $80. Always make the first purchase and wait till gem reset to buy again.

Because, lets say the $20 dollar purchase. First time buying will give you 1200 gems PLUS 1200 gems for free for a total 2400 gems. If you buy that pack again before the reset then you will get your 1200 gems BUT only like 120 free gems. So that is why it is worth to wait for reset.

So to answer your question short. Between 5 and 10 bucks. Not bad at all.

Dawg we in here paying a baseline of 20 for a new spriteüò≠üò≠

                    Yeah I know! I have a few Nikke skins I want to buy but dont want to drop 20 bucks just for that. Maybe if they bundled with 10 pull tickets or some resources.

In AL youcan interact with the skins and some have "hidden" touch features. New Jersey's swimsuit skin is so nice!

Edit: love the One Piece Enel. Hahaha
                        Bruh New Jersey‚Äôs swimsuit is what all the skins in Nikke should be 

And that one‚Äôs also only 5-10$ right?
                            This was 1200 gems. So technically 10 bucks.
                        Is it possible to get old skins in this game?
                            Yes. Some that are older are added permanently to the shop. Others that came out during their event will go away but eventually you will have a chance to buy it again. Thanksgiving time for their "black friday" celebration, they make all skins available and reset the gems purchase so you can get the full amount of free gems.
                                Thanks, man!
                    Yeah as someone who has been playing AL for a few years now this is the reason why I barely buy any of the nikke skins
                Akagi and Kaga's swimsuit skins are only 600
                    Nice! I honestly forgot about that. So yeah. There you go. Skins even at 600 gems good catch!
                Arknights players: you guys pay for skins?
                    I tried Arknights a long time ago. Just wasnt feeling it. How is it now? Do they have "quality" skins?
                        I only started a year ago so I don't know how it was day one, but in my time playing they did add a few quality of life features like skipping annihilation. 

Regarding the skins, if you're looking for the same level of fanservice as Azur Lane then Arknights can't compete. But if it's "cool or pretty" looking skins then we have those in spades.

Kal'tsit and Chen Alter's L2D skins come to mind as well as the upcoming Texas Alter and Mlynar skins.
        And how many gems do the devs give yearly again oh right enough to allow F2P players more then enough dock space
            Honestly. For the Chinese New Year they give the envelopes that contain gems and rarely for compensation after maintenance. And aside from that, that is pretty much it unless I missed something. But I can say if I did not spend money I would not have the dock space I have now. I have 605 ships and my dock space is 630 at the moment. I collect all the ladies.

My money is also goes to skins. I have most of the swimsuits, most of the race queens, some randoms that I like (lewd ones) and definitely all of Agir's. I wait for the gem reset so I can get double for my money. I also use Google Rewards which you asnwer a few surveys and it gives you money. I have bought most of my gems that way.
                I started playing about half a year after the game launched globally and I can tell you that before my degeneracy took over and started spending gems on skins, I always had enough gems to expand dock space as a f2p player.
                    I started playing sice day one. Left a few times but came back. I have 605 ships and none are repeats. My collect percent is 95. I know being in a guild gives you dock space too after you upgrade that area. Thats cool though. Accept the pervy! Haha
                        Yeah guild gives me more space so that definitely helped me :D
    Also Azur Lane players: spends money on skins
        I mean have you seen New Jersey's swimsuit skin?
            And Shinano's. I have them both
            I know, and I encourage it. Top tier skin.
                Devonshires new skin and Peresus skin has sex too lmao
            I have New Jersey skin, i don;t have New Jersey, man i just saw the special interaction and was an insta buy, i just need to get her XD.
                Can guarantee get her as pity in the heavy ship pool.
                    The problem is that I don't have any UR to sacrifice without losing the the ship
                        Pardon but what do you mean by that? Like bulins?
                            Nope the pity doesn't give you one UR directly you need to exchange one UR for one UR.
                                Uh that's not how the pity works for the UR exchange. You need 400 pts through any pull on light, medium, heavy banners with 1 cube = 1 pt. Once you get 400 pts you can exchange for either NJ or shinano. Also if you get a UR on medium or heavy it doesn't count towards the points. I just exchanged, no need to exchange 1 UR for another UR
        I play Nikke and azur lane and I bought Shinano and Prinz Eugen's race queen skins...
            Eugen's and UvH's Race Queen skins are peak
        Counterside too. Some of them are spicy
    Bro, as an AL Player myself, I call cap on yo stereotype of us! WE SPEND SHITLOADS ON DOCK SPACE ALONE!!!!


Oh and some of the Hardcore whales go for skins too I guess.
        Yes! That dock space is no joke. 200 gems for 10 more spots. I am currently sitting at 630 dock space and 605 of that is being used.
            Bruh, shut yo ass up, stop yo flexin! My ass is sitting on 440 dock space! And guess what! I HAVE 2 FREE SPOTS LEFT! IM USING UP 438 DOCK SPACE! AND THAT'S WITHOUT FUCKIN BULINS!
                ü§£ü§£ü§£ my bad my guy! Download Google Rewards. You do little surveys based on places you been. Honestly that is how I got most of my gems.

https://preview.redd.it/uk87pc6zbwvc1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07a22897ef407caa0773781720475dcf760193cc

I have $8.71 available. But the $261.87 is the total since 2016 when I got the app. Its slow but it helps.
        Yeah, I left that game because of that bs. And I had been playing for a year and buying every skin of every character that came out. But that "You can't play if you don't buy more space, neither you can gacha" is pure bs
    I play Azur Lane and I've spend way too much money just because the skins are top notch and they are not that expensive
    Only skins lmao. I will always say that Nikke shoulda copied their homework. Their monetizations system is hotdog water.
        This is kind of a blessing in disguise, but all the bundles in the shop are such terrible value that I don‚Äôt feel even remotely tempted to get them. $80 for less than 30 pulls is crazy. $100 for 50 limited pulls is absurd when there‚Äôs a $20 for 20 limited pulls package.
            This is actually a marketing technique. Just having good deals doesn't sell as much as having a good deal and a bad deal.

The 20 pulls for $20 deal ends up looking and selling better because the 35 pulls for $55 deal exists and that one sells better because the 57 pulls for $100 deal exists.

The $20 monthly Mission and Event passes with skins work similarly due to the $20 shop skins existing. Skin plus goodies sells better than just skin.
            I honestly think that the majority of the shop is priced in such a way that people go for the mission passes. Makes them feel priced better in comparison. I'm sure they have a psychological consultant on these games haha.

And I mean, whales will buy whatever no matter what of course.
                I would be fine with mission pass if the skin had new animations and new voicelines  but thats almost never the case.
            True, theres no way I'm ever touching any of those "deals" lmao. Even the pass mission skins are a skip for me. I'd rather buy the skin outright for 20 bucks rather than having to jump through hoops to get them.
    Is azur lane and blue archive good? (In terms of story and gameplay)
        Blue Archive: good story, decent gameplay

Azur Lane: what story, what gameplay?

With BA it's both I would argue. We may joke about Cunny Archive, and it's true to an extent, but in any case, Karin, Asuna and Rio are more popular than most BA characters. I would even say the bunny duo is the face of the game.
    Shiroko took offense with your statement
        Shiroko will grape any Sensei who doesn't vote for her
            Wolfseggs is non-negotiable
            Shiroko ü§ùMaxwell  
Grape
        Shiroko goes both ways so automatically she is the best girl
    Yuuka is da best
    For people that don't play BA sure they're the most popular but for people that play probably not...

And here is the [most used L2Ds](https://imgur.com/a/8T356hb) in the game as of jp 3rd anni, could probably use this as a gauge on popularity.
        Honestly, I see no discernible pattern here, at least from the appearance point of view. First thought is "characters with the most screentime in story/events", but then the lack of Shiroko kinda nullifies that. I guess it could be "characters with the most interesting personality+backstory". And Yuuka. She kinda doesn't fit in that definition, but we can just write it of as a "first girl privilege" (since you are forced to initiate her personal story as part of the tutorial).

Also seeing Swimsuit Hanako on the 8th place reminds me that she is practically Summer Helm, but kinda in reverse. While Helm's appearance was constantly mired in the censorship discussions, Hanako's design was like taking the same concept just to make it as lewd as possible, to the point that she is canonically "going commando" in it. I guess that the power of cute and funny game up and going 16+ to avoid censorship vs. an unabashed cummer game constantly trying to keep the game 12+. Hehe, you might just even say NIKKE COULD NEVE- \*gunshot sound\*
            Yuuka has lots of interactions, so she has lots of presence in the fanart community.

You got her dynamic with Sensei and Noa. (Gomen Yuuka)


You got her single mom dynamic with the entire GDD

You got her being the exasperated boss/authority/etc of C&C, Engineering Club, and Veritas.

You got her being the exasperated underling of Rio.

She's also attached to multiple memes. 100 kg, Gomen Yuuka, Calculator Wife...

She's been a fan favorite since forever. She's proof of the appeal of well done tsunderes.
            The only pattern I could see is "plot relevance + popularity". Base Yuuka is the exception since she's the first L2D everyone unlocks anyway, others are simply popular characters that appear in main story (maybe with exception of Kikyou who's relatively recent). Other than that, they all have different body types, playstyle, rarity (with some Aru or Hina that realistically most older players have since they're in base pool, or Mika/SHoshino that had higher 3* drop rate banners).

If anything, I'm surprised some like Mutsuki or Wakamo aren't higher.
                I mean, "popularity" is a bit of a moot point if we're trying to discern what makes character popular picks in the first place. As for "plot relevance" - once again it clashes with the fact that there is not a single Shiroko in that list. Honestly, with her story presence, popularity in both art and memes, and having 3 versions, with one of them being pvp meta pick - it's weird to not see her at least crack top 10.
                    >once again it clashes with the fact that there is not a single Shiroko in that list.

You know that was one IS surprising. Moreso than Wakamo.
        Aru has been my L2D screen since forever. It's just so nice.
    From what I recall, in the most recent popularity vote, the top two were Mika and Koharu so it is indeed both
    The day Rio gets put in the gacha is the day BA might have a chance at topping genshin. The charts might just explode that day.
        Nah, there's plenty of people that hate Rio and wouldn't roll for her in any case. While the design may be hot, her personality and role in the story is very contentious.
            Putting aside the ‚Äúif evil why hot‚Äù crew, I think she has been humanized a lot, and I do not think a lot of the playerbase hates her anymore.
                A Rio banner would regardless not be that game changing. Take Kisaki for example, she had even less screentime than Rio, appeared later and yet has more fanart than her. Thus I'd expect a Kisaki banner to be more impactful personally.
                    On a cursory search on Pixiv, Rio has 4,793 to Kisaki's 3,786 illustrations.

Rio being contentious is a strange argument to make as Mika is also incredibly contentious, and arguably, less reprimanded for her mistakes. There's also the possibility that her debut would coincide with an event or other story (perhaps Volume 2, Chapter 3) that goes into and further works on her issues.
                        Yeah but Mika is racist so she has that advantage
                        for me Rio is just a far more lonely and logical Nagisa. Heck even in the story before her amend with arisu in vol F i already forgive her. Since i knew her point of view, she just really do the right thing in her mind as the  council of seminar.
                        I think the case with Mika is that she had good intentions but was misled/manipulated, while Rio came up with her plans all on her own. People are more likely to forgive a dum dum than someone consciously willing to do bad things to further their goals.
                        You're using the wrong tag then. I'm getting 5,783 pixiv entries for Ryuuge Kisaki.
            Make her Mika-tier OP and even those people will pull for her.
    And yet Hina is sensei's favourite.
    We saw big booba fan art in typical social medias more just because it is safer.
    Nah they are the most popular  amount BA and outsiders but if we talking BA only then characters like Hina are more popular
    Uhh this guy is trying to cover up their cunny agenda

Is Blue Archive a fun game? I heard it manages to earn alot of money and idk if I should play it. If so should I download the global or JP version?
    It's pretty low maintenance and unless you care about ranking high in raid unit pulling doesn't matter that much. All the story (the main reason for playing) is easily accessible.
        Is Blue Archive known for its story?
            Kind of. I mean it was a good enough to get an anime adaptation this season
                Oh then I'm playing it. I love gacha games where the story is it's best thing.
                    Oh then BA is definitely a game that ud enjoy. The story is probably its main draw for me. Theres plenty of lore videos out as well in case u get confused.
                    I would also chime in and recommend Limbus Company. Though it has a more darker story than most other gachas, so do consult with yourself if you want to play it.
                        I like when the story is dark so I will also try it out
                            Then make sure to!

Although technically the third game in the Project Moon (so far) Trilogy, the game doesn't require you to play the previous installments . If anything, not knowing the reasons or inner workings of everything that happens is a better experience, I'd say. Additionally, there's the in-game "lorebook" called Dante's Notes in which you are slowly introduced to things you might be confused on, all written in-character too!

The game doesn't require a lot of time either (the main progression is a weekly activity, which takes no more than 2-3 hours per week in the worst case; dailies take around 15 minutes, or even less if you have well-built teams), if that matters.
                                Drag him down the project moon rabbit hole, Wdym the trilogy isn‚Äôt required, it‚Äôs fucking mandatory to distort him into one of us
                                    The knowledge of the past two games will certanly enhance the experience, but it isn't mandatory to enjoy the story of limbus. For now, at least.
                                I have vacation next week so I will definitely have time to play the game
                        hello pmoon fellow sleeper agent
                        And also very un-fanservicey. I'm ok with that, but it's probably a make or break thing for some new players.
                            I wouldn't say so. Its got quite a lot of fanservice, though mostly directed at players from previous games.

The word you're looking for is "ecchi", I'd say. Even that I'd argue that someone like Middle Don or Molar Ishmael could easily be a Nikke design with 0 changes, so its just rare, though with recent-ish developments it may be that they won't be doing anything like that again
                    You should try R1999 then. Very f2p friendly, has the best QoL in all gacha games and the story is quite up there as well.
                        Thanks for the recommendation! I will give it a try too.
                            I do have to warn you that the energy system does get quite annoying when you're at the later part of grinding for character upgrades in that game (i went from loke 600 something energy down to 30 from I3ing a character and the dailies)
                                I am a patient person so it will be fine
                                    Also, since you said you like story based gachas, i would recommend Limbus Company. The dailies are VERY short and optional and the story is really good (plus they give a shit ton of gacha currency)
            The opposite of Nikke. A lot of light hearted event stories and then it just drops the depreso bomb on your head.
            Story is split between main chapters (generally more serious) and events (a bit more light hearted, chaotic).
            Yes it's really good.
            Story is my favourite part about blue archive
            Yes
        when will they have pc client i cannot play in mobile anymore
    Blue Archive is relatively a chill game and yes the devs know their player base so well. You should try to play it on Global, at least you know future banners since JP server came first
        Thanks! I will downloaded and give it a try. 
*
    Yes, it's very good 

The only two cons I felt during the first time I tried BA are 
Gameplay and Not having a Voiced story both of which took some getting used to

It's a really lovely game with adorable characters and story that gives you goosebumps (even without it being voiced) ....also has wonderful bgms


I would totally recommend you to try it (also watch the PVs cuz they are amazing)
        I'll give a try, thanks!
    As someone who plays both games, I'd say BA is the closest gacha game to NIKKE so if you like one you'll prob like the other one

If you like the music in NIKKE, BA has an equally banger OST (example: Unwelcome School, kitsunebi, Oxygen Destroyer). If you enjoy the story of NIKKE, BA is more light-hearted, but the main story has a similar tone and equally good writing as NIKKE (just ask any BA player about Eden Treaty). Character designs are really good and they're pretty generous with player rewards.

As for gameplay, this is completely subjective. Most people will say it's full auto (similar to NIKKE) but the core mechanic is teambuilding and timing bursts during high level boss fights, whereas the core mechanic in NIKKE I would say is teambuilding and recognizing boss attack patterns to hide behind cover.

Also, the 2 most popular characters in BA is arguably Asuna and Karin, aka Blanc and Noir (also please ShiftUp and Nexon make a collab between these 2 games, Tia and Naga for Asuna and Karin would be the perfect trade deal)
        BA is much closer to Priconne than Nikke.
        Sounds fun! I will download the game now!
    Probably unpopular opinion but the story is good, gameplay is meh and most of the good waifus are not playable yet.
        Which game?
            Blue Archive
    Although it has one of the worst gacha rates in terms of pulls. I had to uninstall it cause all my SRR draws were spooks. Also the own Blue Archive reddit community agrees that you have always to spark if you want an specific unit (a statement shared with the Granblue community now i realize); if people agree that sparking is the only way, you know something is wrong. But the story is quite good and cute. If you don't mind getting spooked to hell when pulling for units, go ahead. Heck, I'm even reconsidering reinstalling it again.
        I am totally used to getting spooked and playing games with horrible rates like FGO (that game made me go insane sometimes)
            If you want a character you want to save 200 pulls to guarantee.
                Sounds like it has a similar pity system like FGO
                    Only difference is that in BA, you get gacha currencies often enough that as a max level player, you get those 200 pulls in an average of 2 months
                    fgo is 300 but you usually don't hit it unlike Blue Archives 200, 0.8% vs 0.5% does make a difference. Blue Archive is obviously better for spooks but that depends on your roster and what you need. 

For a f2p player spooks are usually good because you're skipping a lot of banners waiting for FES. 

Blue Archive is pretty much a Korean Princess Connect with a changed setting, nearly every system has been copied even down to 200 pity, FES with increased rates (mostly for spooks) and a festival character, gameplay systems etc.
                        it's 0.7% for the banner 3* and 2.3% for other 3*.
                    You have 75% chance to get the banner 3* before pity and on the average you should get 6 3* charterers with full pity 200 pulls. 0.7% for banner 3* and 2.3% for random 3*.
                    It might, it has been years since I played that one so Idk how similar it is. All I know is twice I have had to go to the 200 mark to get the character I wanted to get and that is out of 3 banners so not good rates in my experience.
        That is one of the reasons I dropped BA, it was my 2nd gacha after GFL but the drop rate was terrible. The characters looked gorgeous but actually getting them was a pain
        What do you mean by "spark"?
            It's like pity system, but you can't carry your points for next banner, and you need 200 pulls to "spark".
            What they said, only pull to reach pity. If i recall correctly, the term comes from Granblue's sparks, which is the currency you get for each pull until you reach the cap allowing you to get the unit you want.
            It's a terminology from GBF were you get a spark for a pull, and with 200 sparks you can basically get the character for free.

Think of Golden Mileage tickets, BUT the spark is only valid until the banner ends, so you can't really use those tickets once the banner goes away and a new one takes its place.
            200 pulls is spark
        Not as bad as Nikke where the more desirable units (pilgrims) have 0.5% rate. I used to actively play for around 7 months and never got a pilgrim unit, they do sometimes have pilgrim limited banners where I think the rate increases to 1%.
            But at the same time, nikke have transferable pity

Where you can use it on any banner
    Take their recommendations with a grain of salt. I played BA twice, can't get into the groove of things.
    It's free to try.
    low maintenance, f2p friendly, with a good story and fun event stories if you decide to read them
        Of course I will read them I enjoy stories
    Well it definitely doesn't earn a lot of money, lmao.

There is no gameplay and it's closer to a character collector than an actual game. Despite knowing people who enjoy it, there's nothing for me in that game.

Also the gacha rates are legitimately awful. If you want something, you pretty much have to hit pity for it.
    Looks boring gameplay-wise. Checkers looks more fun than it tbh
        I mean,the most time you have to use your brain is during boss raid or story boss battles.

Still alright but it's probably not for you.

wait, smol white was free???
    Yes, during anniversary. SSR welfares also had their spare bodies put into mileage shop and until treasure system is released, they're the only added characters to the shop.
        dang it, should have started playing sooner
            Well considering during 1.5 anni, they let us choose between Kilo & Rei. I would imagine 2nd anniversary will have same thing with Smol White and whoever the other SSR is.
                old white, to complete the 3 stages of human developement
                    Completely emotionless battle hardened Snow White. And the only thing she lives for is to destroy the queen and every single rapture.

Biggest shocking factor is that she doesn't care about eating anymore, because she is completely consumed by her hatred.
                        Or a happy Snow White who learnt to smile again and who eats for fun and not out of c-PTSD. Maybe she hangs out with Andersen and Red Hood once again.
                            I had the more depressing timeline, so this can be the happy timeline.
            You really should have she cheeses some of the story bosses
                I assume you cant pull for her anymore?
                    The best you can do is hope for a rerun like how rei will get for the 1.5 anniversary
        Thanks to that I basically max her out easily
Smol White has a killer body though
    You are so real for that
        It ain't a lie. The artist clearly was doing something with the shooting pose.

        Surprised no one has cross posted this meme on the BA sub yet
            i dont know hy but i feel BA sub was pretty tameish not wacky like what outside community see them
                Shame the copypasta chefs got bonked to oblivion
                    Cooking so good that the automods considered their food contraband.
    Ironic considering what happened to Azur Lane‚Äôs last loli in a swimsuit
        Can't be worse than Grand Order mods [forbade in-game loli lewds](https://old.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/15ob2kt/summer_8_summer_chloe_von_einzbern_avenger_skills/jvrs53w/)

[For BS reasons too](https://old.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/15nxjlz/subreddit_update_nsfw_servant_assets_and_curtain/jvoz6ot/)
            It was pretty bad. They essentially deleted Anson from her event release after the community backlash, which included Manjuu‚Äôs offices getting graffiti‚Äôd and shit, iirc.

Classic mod drama there though lol, can‚Äôt say how many times I‚Äôve seen mods just fuck off and do their own thing while the community goes ‚Äú???‚Äù
            I reckon it's a case of powertripping mods, and paranoia

FGO sub is possibly the 3rd most popular Gacha game sub out there, behind Genshin and HSR, so it's prone to have lots of Puritans. And it ran into a quite unfortunate case with the Reddit Admins when Abigail Williams (really lewd) swimsuit skin came out
(Fucking hell, it was even considered one of the major reason for Reddit's """Anti-Evil""" something that was dedicated to targeting loli shit and ban them) 

Oh and the mods are also powertripping high. A shitton of restrictions on the main sub caused the community to split into multiple other mini-subs for: non-OC fanarts, comics, OC Sprite comics, memes, etc..... and banning the slightest ""lewd"" or funny stuff there (A pretty good artist made a funny meme  ship, that apparently offended a mod, so they deleted it immediately)

Hell, the main sub is barely good for anything nowadays other than news update, a few good Reddit artists' works and discussions

Reminds me of when the Arknights mode scared away two comic posters for riske jokes

https://old.reddit.com/r/arknights/comments/uv8mts/im_sorry/

https://old.reddit.com/r/0sanitymemes/comments/xhcp5y/sexual_assaultpng/
                The FGO thing happened around the time Reddit was going crazy with its loli-hunt and just spray-banning everything that could've been possibly risky.

What other sub would you recommend? I did notice it's not as active as it used to be in the past.
                    r/FGOcomics is pretty active as far as I'm aware, but that place is more of a hot pile of mixture than anything: it frequently posts fan arts, porn, sometimes actual comics, porn comics, etc.... there's also specific Fate characters' dedicated subs 

r/fatestaynight more frequently feature FSN content, but also FGO from time to time. Or r/Fate , for that matter 

If you want braindead insane memes about raping and raping the rapists, go to r/Okbuddyrintard . It's better than it sounds, trust me
                        I see, thanks.
    I think FGO is still kinda toxic, but not necessarily in the way you might think. 

It's because it's inherently intertwined with pretty big fandoms that are not playing the gacha. People who like the anime/VNs/LNs etc.
        Tbf, that graph has it placed on the middle.

which world is the worst to live in? blue archive or Nikke?
    Blue archive‚Äôs kivotos is still surrounded by mystery since we don‚Äôt know whats outside the city whether or not there is still life out there/if thats where the adults are ect, but as long as you are in the cities and are part of a decent academy I think your life would be pretty chill, not to mention just being there you will have a halo that will protect you from injuries

Meanwhile nikke‚Äôs world is literal apocalypse and you are a helpless citizen stuck underground, and there is a non zero chance that the ark just gets invaded some random day soooo nikke‚Äôs world is probably a lot harsher to live in
        I mean in blue archive it really depends, sensei doesnt have an halo so an outsider will not just get one, they probably need to be born with one, but even without one, just dont be that adventurous and try to find a job and you will probably be okay, its not a shit hole like Nikke.
            yeah I was more thinking of it like a ‚Äúyou were always part of that world‚Äù type of situation.
    Blue Archive for sure.

    Isn't stellar blade the one being attacked right now, and still getting pushback though? I agree the 1.5 anni units aren't much to look at, and the 3 new skins for Modernia, Diesel and Snow White, while pretty and cool in their own regard are not that fanservicey, We just had Bay, Clay and Poli in cheer outfits.

It's fine to be cautious, but don't turn to dooming, doesn't help anyone. Voting with your wallet has more effect.

Haha. I play AL and I do spend money. Gotta have those skins. Oh and dock space.
    How much do skins typically cost on AL?
        They range from 780 gems to 1200 gems per skin. Depending if its L2D or not. How lewd it is (I think that affectd price) and the shipgirl's popularity.

You can buy gems for $1, $5, $10, $20  and all the way up $80. Always make the first purchase and wait till gem reset to buy again.

Because, lets say the $20 dollar purchase. First time buying will give you 1200 gems PLUS 1200 gems for free for a total 2400 gems. If you buy that pack again before the reset then you will get your 1200 gems BUT only like 120 free gems. So that is why it is worth to wait for reset.

So to answer your question short. Between 5 and 10 bucks. Not bad at all.
            >so to answer your question short. Between 5 and 10 bucks. Not bad at all.

Dawg we in here paying a baseline of 20 for a new spriteüò≠üò≠

                Yeah I know! I have a few Nikke skins I want to buy but dont want to drop 20 bucks just for that. Maybe if they bundled with 10 pull tickets or some resources.

In AL youcan interact with the skins and some have "hidden" touch features. New Jersey's swimsuit skin is so nice!

https://youtu.be/33I78p2Mkv4?feature=shared

Edit: love the One Piece Enel. Hahaha
                    Bruh New Jersey‚Äôs swimsuit is what all the skins in Nikke should be 

And that one‚Äôs also only 5-10$ right?
                        This was 1200 gems. So technically 10 bucks.
                    Is it possible to get old skins in this game?
                        Yes. Some that are older are added permanently to the shop. Others that came out during their event will go away but eventually you will have a chance to buy it again. Thanksgiving time for their "black friday" celebration, they make all skins available and reset the gems purchase so you can get the full amount of free gems.
                            Thanks, man!
                Yeah as someone who has been playing AL for a few years now this is the reason why I barely buy any of the nikke skins
            Akagi and Kaga's swimsuit skins are only 600
                Nice! I honestly forgot about that. So yeah. There you go. Skins even at 600 gems good catch!
            Arknights players: you guys pay for skins?
                I tried Arknights a long time ago. Just wasnt feeling it. How is it now? Do they have "quality" skins?
                    I only started a year ago so I don't know how it was day one, but in my time playing they did add a few quality of life features like skipping annihilation. 

Regarding the skins, if you're looking for the same level of fanservice as Azur Lane then Arknights can't compete. But if it's "cool or pretty" looking skins then we have those in spades.

Kal'tsit and Chen Alter's L2D skins come to mind as well as the upcoming Texas Alter and Mlynar skins.
    And how many gems do the devs give yearly again oh right enough to allow F2P players more then enough dock space
        Honestly. For the Chinese New Year they give the envelopes that contain gems and rarely for compensation after maintenance. And aside from that, that is pretty much it unless I missed something. But I can say if I did not spend money I would not have the dock space I have now. I have 605 ships and my dock space is 630 at the moment. I collect all the ladies.

My money is also goes to skins. I have most of the swimsuits, most of the race queens, some randoms that I like (lewd ones) and definitely all of Agir's. I wait for the gem reset so I can get double for my money. I also use Google Rewards which you asnwer a few surveys and it gives you money. I have bought most of my gems that way.
            I started playing about half a year after the game launched globally and I can tell you that before my degeneracy took over and started spending gems on skins, I always had enough gems to expand dock space as a f2p player.
                I started playing sice day one. Left a few times but came back. I have 605 ships and none are repeats. My collect percent is 95. I know being in a guild gives you dock space too after you upgrade that area. Thats cool though. Accept the pervy! Haha
                    Yeah guild gives me more space so that definitely helped me :D
Also Azur Lane players: spends money on skins
    I mean have you seen New Jersey's swimsuit skin?
        And Shinano's. I have them both
        I know, and I encourage it. Top tier skin.
            Devonshires new skin and Peresus skin has sex too lmao
        I have New Jersey skin, i don;t have New Jersey, man i just saw the special interaction and was an insta buy, i just need to get her XD.
            Can guarantee get her as pity in the heavy ship pool.
                The problem is that I don't have any UR to sacrifice without losing the the ship
                    Pardon but what do you mean by that? Like bulins?
                        Nope the pity doesn't give you one UR directly you need to exchange one UR for one UR.
                            Uh that's not how the pity works for the UR exchange. You need 400 pts through any pull on light, medium, heavy banners with 1 cube = 1 pt. Once you get 400 pts you can exchange for either NJ or shinano. Also if you get a UR on medium or heavy it doesn't count towards the points. I just exchanged, no need to exchange 1 UR for another UR
    I play Nikke and azur lane and I bought Shinano and Prinz Eugen's race queen skins...
        Eugen's and UvH's Race Queen skins are peak
    Counterside too. Some of them are spicy
Bro, as an AL Player myself, I call cap on yo stereotype of us! WE SPEND SHITLOADS ON DOCK SPACE ALONE!!!!


Oh and some of the Hardcore whales go for skins too I guess.
    Yes! That dock space is no joke. 200 gems for 10 more spots. I am currently sitting at 630 dock space and 605 of that is being used.
        Bruh, shut yo ass up, stop yo flexin! My ass is sitting on 440 dock space! And guess what! I HAVE 2 FREE SPOTS LEFT! IM USING UP 438 DOCK SPACE! AND THAT'S WITHOUT FUCKIN BULINS!

I have $8.71 available. But the $261.87 is the total since 2016 when I got the app. Its slow but it helps.
    Yeah, I left that game because of that bs. And I had been playing for a year and buying every skin of every character that came out. But that "You can't play if you don't buy more space, neither you can gacha" is pure bs
I play Azur Lane and I've spend way too much money just because the skins are top notch and they are not that expensive
Only skins lmao. I will always say that Nikke shoulda copied their homework. Their monetizations system is hotdog water.
    This is kind of a blessing in disguise, but all the bundles in the shop are such terrible value that I don‚Äôt feel even remotely tempted to get them. $80 for less than 30 pulls is crazy. $100 for 50 limited pulls is absurd when there‚Äôs a $20 for 20 limited pulls package.
        This is actually a marketing technique. Just having good deals doesn't sell as much as having a good deal and a bad deal.

The 20 pulls for $20 deal ends up looking and selling better because the 35 pulls for $55 deal exists and that one sells better because the 57 pulls for $100 deal exists.

The $20 monthly Mission and Event passes with skins work similarly due to the $20 shop skins existing. Skin plus goodies sells better than just skin.
        I honestly think that the majority of the shop is priced in such a way that people go for the mission passes. Makes them feel priced better in comparison. I'm sure they have a psychological consultant on these games haha.

And I mean, whales will buy whatever no matter what of course.
            I would be fine with mission pass if the skin had new animations and new voicelines  but thats almost never the case.
        True, theres no way I'm ever touching any of those "deals" lmao. Even the pass mission skins are a skip for me. I'd rather buy the skin outright for 20 bucks rather than having to jump through hoops to get them.

    Honestly, I see no discernible pattern here, at least from the appearance point of view. First thought is "characters with the most screentime in story/events", but then the lack of Shiroko kinda nullifies that. I guess it could be "characters with the most interesting personality+backstory". And Yuuka. She kinda doesn't fit in that definition, but we can just write it of as a "first girl privilege" (since you are forced to initiate her personal story as part of the tutorial).

Also seeing Swimsuit Hanako on the 8th place reminds me that she is practically Summer Helm, but kinda in reverse. While Helm's appearance was constantly mired in the censorship discussions, Hanako's design was like taking the same concept just to make it as lewd as possible, to the point that she is canonically "going commando" in it. I guess that the power of cute and funny game up and going 16+ to avoid censorship vs. an unabashed cummer game constantly trying to keep the game 12+. Hehe, you might just even say NIKKE COULD NEVE- \*gunshot sound\*
        Yuuka has lots of interactions, so she has lots of presence in the fanart community.

You got her dynamic with Sensei and Noa. (Gomen Yuuka)


You got her single mom dynamic with the entire GDD

You got her being the exasperated boss/authority/etc of C&C, Engineering Club, and Veritas.

You got her being the exasperated underling of Rio.

She's also attached to multiple memes. 100 kg, Gomen Yuuka, Calculator Wife...

She's been a fan favorite since forever. She's proof of the appeal of well done tsunderes.
        The only pattern I could see is "plot relevance + popularity". Base Yuuka is the exception since she's the first L2D everyone unlocks anyway, others are simply popular characters that appear in main story (maybe with exception of Kikyou who's relatively recent). Other than that, they all have different body types, playstyle, rarity (with some Aru or Hina that realistically most older players have since they're in base pool, or Mika/SHoshino that had higher 3* drop rate banners).

If anything, I'm surprised some like Mutsuki or Wakamo aren't higher.
            I mean, "popularity" is a bit of a moot point if we're trying to discern what makes character popular picks in the first place. As for "plot relevance" - once again it clashes with the fact that there is not a single Shiroko in that list. Honestly, with her story presence, popularity in both art and memes, and having 3 versions, with one of them being pvp meta pick - it's weird to not see her at least crack top 10.
                >once again it clashes with the fact that there is not a single Shiroko in that list.

You know that was one IS surprising. Moreso than Wakamo.
    Aru has been my L2D screen since forever. It's just so nice.
From what I recall, in the most recent popularity vote, the top two were Mika and Koharu so it is indeed both
The day Rio gets put in the gacha is the day BA might have a chance at topping genshin. The charts might just explode that day.
    Nah, there's plenty of people that hate Rio and wouldn't roll for her in any case. While the design may be hot, her personality and role in the story is very contentious.
        Putting aside the ‚Äúif evil why hot‚Äù crew, I think she has been humanized a lot, and I do not think a lot of the playerbase hates her anymore.
            A Rio banner would regardless not be that game changing. Take Kisaki for example, she had even less screentime than Rio, appeared later and yet has more fanart than her. Thus I'd expect a Kisaki banner to be more impactful personally.
                On a cursory search on Pixiv, Rio has 4,793 to Kisaki's 3,786 illustrations.

Rio being contentious is a strange argument to make as Mika is also incredibly contentious, and arguably, less reprimanded for her mistakes. There's also the possibility that her debut would coincide with an event or other story (perhaps Volume 2, Chapter 3) that goes into and further works on her issues.
                    Yeah but Mika is racist so she has that advantage
                    for me Rio is just a far more lonely and logical Nagisa. Heck even in the story before her amend with arisu in vol F i already forgive her. Since i knew her point of view, she just really do the right thing in her mind as the  council of seminar.
                    I think the case with Mika is that she had good intentions but was misled/manipulated, while Rio came up with her plans all on her own. People are more likely to forgive a dum dum than someone consciously willing to do bad things to further their goals.
                    You're using the wrong tag then. I'm getting 5,783 pixiv entries for Ryuuge Kisaki.
        Make her Mika-tier OP and even those people will pull for her.
And yet Hina is sensei's favourite.
We saw big booba fan art in typical social medias more just because it is safer.
Nah they are the most popular  amount BA and outsiders but if we talking BA only then characters like Hina are more popular
Uhh this guy is trying to cover up their cunny agenda

Wakamo, who is not flat, was also the first limited Anniversary unit.

Or Mika.
Protocol 3. Protect the Commander.
It's pretty low maintenance and unless you care about ranking high in raid unit pulling doesn't matter that much. All the story (the main reason for playing) is easily accessible.
    Is Blue Archive known for its story?
        Kind of. I mean it was a good enough to get an anime adaptation this season
            Oh then I'm playing it. I love gacha games where the story is it's best thing.
                Oh then BA is definitely a game that ud enjoy. The story is probably its main draw for me. Theres plenty of lore videos out as well in case u get confused.
                I would also chime in and recommend Limbus Company. Though it has a more darker story than most other gachas, so do consult with yourself if you want to play it.
                    I like when the story is dark so I will also try it out
                        Then make sure to!

Although technically the third game in the Project Moon (so far) Trilogy, the game doesn't require you to play the previous installments . If anything, not knowing the reasons or inner workings of everything that happens is a better experience, I'd say. Additionally, there's the in-game "lorebook" called Dante's Notes in which you are slowly introduced to things you might be confused on, all written in-character too!

The game doesn't require a lot of time either (the main progression is a weekly activity, which takes no more than 2-3 hours per week in the worst case; dailies take around 15 minutes, or even less if you have well-built teams), if that matters.
                            Drag him down the project moon rabbit hole, Wdym the trilogy isn‚Äôt required, it‚Äôs fucking mandatory to distort him into one of us
                                The knowledge of the past two games will certanly enhance the experience, but it isn't mandatory to enjoy the story of limbus. For now, at least.
                            I have vacation next week so I will definitely have time to play the game
                    hello pmoon fellow sleeper agent
                    And also very un-fanservicey. I'm ok with that, but it's probably a make or break thing for some new players.
                        I wouldn't say so. Its got quite a lot of fanservice, though mostly directed at players from previous games.

The word you're looking for is "ecchi", I'd say. Even that I'd argue that someone like Middle Don or Molar Ishmael could easily be a Nikke design with 0 changes, so its just rare, though with recent-ish developments it may be that they won't be doing anything like that again
                You should try R1999 then. Very f2p friendly, has the best QoL in all gacha games and the story is quite up there as well.
                    Thanks for the recommendation! I will give it a try too.
                        I do have to warn you that the energy system does get quite annoying when you're at the later part of grinding for character upgrades in that game (i went from loke 600 something energy down to 30 from I3ing a character and the dailies)
                            I am a patient person so it will be fine
                                Also, since you said you like story based gachas, i would recommend Limbus Company. The dailies are VERY short and optional and the story is really good (plus they give a shit ton of gacha currency)
        The opposite of Nikke. A lot of light hearted event stories and then it just drops the depreso bomb on your head.
        Story is split between main chapters (generally more serious) and events (a bit more light hearted, chaotic).
        Yes it's really good.
        Story is my favourite part about blue archive
        Yes
    when will they have pc client i cannot play in mobile anymore
Blue Archive is relatively a chill game and yes the devs know their player base so well. You should try to play it on Global, at least you know future banners since JP server came first
    Thanks! I will downloaded and give it a try. 
*
Yes, it's very good 

The only two cons I felt during the first time I tried BA are 
Gameplay and Not having a Voiced story both of which took some getting used to

It's a really lovely game with adorable characters and story that gives you goosebumps (even without it being voiced) ....also has wonderful bgms


I would totally recommend you to try it (also watch the PVs cuz they are amazing)
    I'll give a try, thanks!
As someone who plays both games, I'd say BA is the closest gacha game to NIKKE so if you like one you'll prob like the other one

If you like the music in NIKKE, BA has an equally banger OST (example: Unwelcome School, kitsunebi, Oxygen Destroyer). If you enjoy the story of NIKKE, BA is more light-hearted, but the main story has a similar tone and equally good writing as NIKKE (just ask any BA player about Eden Treaty). Character designs are really good and they're pretty generous with player rewards.

As for gameplay, this is completely subjective. Most people will say it's full auto (similar to NIKKE) but the core mechanic is teambuilding and timing bursts during high level boss fights, whereas the core mechanic in NIKKE I would say is teambuilding and recognizing boss attack patterns to hide behind cover.

Also, the 2 most popular characters in BA is arguably Asuna and Karin, aka Blanc and Noir (also please ShiftUp and Nexon make a collab between these 2 games, Tia and Naga for Asuna and Karin would be the perfect trade deal)
    BA is much closer to Priconne than Nikke.
    Sounds fun! I will download the game now!
Probably unpopular opinion but the story is good, gameplay is meh and most of the good waifus are not playable yet.
    Which game?
        Blue Archive
Although it has one of the worst gacha rates in terms of pulls. I had to uninstall it cause all my SRR draws were spooks. Also the own Blue Archive reddit community agrees that you have always to spark if you want an specific unit (a statement shared with the Granblue community now i realize); if people agree that sparking is the only way, you know something is wrong. But the story is quite good and cute. If you don't mind getting spooked to hell when pulling for units, go ahead. Heck, I'm even reconsidering reinstalling it again.
    I am totally used to getting spooked and playing games with horrible rates like FGO (that game made me go insane sometimes)
        If you want a character you want to save 200 pulls to guarantee.
            Sounds like it has a similar pity system like FGO
                Only difference is that in BA, you get gacha currencies often enough that as a max level player, you get those 200 pulls in an average of 2 months
                fgo is 300 but you usually don't hit it unlike Blue Archives 200, 0.8% vs 0.5% does make a difference. Blue Archive is obviously better for spooks but that depends on your roster and what you need. 

For a f2p player spooks are usually good because you're skipping a lot of banners waiting for FES. 

Blue Archive is pretty much a Korean Princess Connect with a changed setting, nearly every system has been copied even down to 200 pity, FES with increased rates (mostly for spooks) and a festival character, gameplay systems etc.
                    it's 0.7% for the banner 3* and 2.3% for other 3*.
                You have 75% chance to get the banner 3* before pity and on the average you should get 6 3* charterers with full pity 200 pulls. 0.7% for banner 3* and 2.3% for random 3*.
                It might, it has been years since I played that one so Idk how similar it is. All I know is twice I have had to go to the 200 mark to get the character I wanted to get and that is out of 3 banners so not good rates in my experience.
    That is one of the reasons I dropped BA, it was my 2nd gacha after GFL but the drop rate was terrible. The characters looked gorgeous but actually getting them was a pain
    What do you mean by "spark"?
        It's like pity system, but you can't carry your points for next banner, and you need 200 pulls to "spark".
        What they said, only pull to reach pity. If i recall correctly, the term comes from Granblue's sparks, which is the currency you get for each pull until you reach the cap allowing you to get the unit you want.
        It's a terminology from GBF were you get a spark for a pull, and with 200 sparks you can basically get the character for free.

Think of Golden Mileage tickets, BUT the spark is only valid until the banner ends, so you can't really use those tickets once the banner goes away and a new one takes its place.
        200 pulls is spark
    Not as bad as Nikke where the more desirable units (pilgrims) have 0.5% rate. I used to actively play for around 7 months and never got a pilgrim unit, they do sometimes have pilgrim limited banners where I think the rate increases to 1%.
        But at the same time, nikke have transferable pity

Where you can use it on any banner
Take their recommendations with a grain of salt. I played BA twice, can't get into the groove of things.
It's free to try.
low maintenance, f2p friendly, with a good story and fun event stories if you decide to read them
    Of course I will read them I enjoy stories
Well it definitely doesn't earn a lot of money, lmao.

There is no gameplay and it's closer to a character collector than an actual game. Despite knowing people who enjoy it, there's nothing for me in that game.

Also the gacha rates are legitimately awful. If you want something, you pretty much have to hit pity for it.
Looks boring gameplay-wise. Checkers looks more fun than it tbh
    I mean,the most time you have to use your brain is during boss raid or story boss battles.

Still alright but it's probably not for you.
        Booooooooooooring. It‚Äôs just not Nikke
Jokes on you, I only have two reasons.

Yes, during anniversary. SSR welfares also had their spare bodies put into mileage shop and until treasure system is released, they're the only added characters to the shop.
    dang it, should have started playing sooner
        Well considering during 1.5 anni, they let us choose between Kilo & Rei. I would imagine 2nd anniversary will have same thing with Smol White and whoever the other SSR is.
            old white, to complete the 3 stages of human developement
                Completely emotionless battle hardened Snow White. And the only thing she lives for is to destroy the queen and every single rapture.

Biggest shocking factor is that she doesn't care about eating anymore, because she is completely consumed by her hatred.
                    Or a happy Snow White who learnt to smile again and who eats for fun and not out of c-PTSD. Maybe she hangs out with Andersen and Red Hood once again.
                        I had the more depressing timeline, so this can be the happy timeline.
        You really should have she cheeses some of the story bosses
            I assume you cant pull for her anymore?
                The best you can do is hope for a rerun like how rei will get for the 1.5 anniversary
    Thanks to that I basically max her out easily
You are so real for that
    It ain't a lie. The artist clearly was doing something with the shooting pose.

    Surprised no one has cross posted this meme on the BA sub yet

                Cooking so good that the automods considered their food contraband.
Ironic considering what happened to Azur Lane‚Äôs last loli in a swimsuit
    Can't be worse than Grand Order mods [forbade in-game loli lewds](https://old.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/15ob2kt/summer_8_summer_chloe_von_einzbern_avenger_skills/jvrs53w/)

        It was pretty bad. They essentially deleted Anson from her event release after the community backlash, which included Manjuu‚Äôs offices getting graffiti‚Äôd and shit, iirc.

Classic mod drama there though lol, can‚Äôt say how many times I‚Äôve seen mods just fuck off and do their own thing while the community goes ‚Äú???‚Äù
        I reckon it's a case of powertripping mods, and paranoia

FGO sub is possibly the 3rd most popular Gacha game sub out there, behind Genshin and HSR, so it's prone to have lots of Puritans. And it ran into a quite unfortunate case with the Reddit Admins when Abigail Williams (really lewd) swimsuit skin came out
(Fucking hell, it was even considered one of the major reason for Reddit's """Anti-Evil""" something that was dedicated to targeting loli shit and ban them) 

Oh and the mods are also powertripping high. A shitton of restrictions on the main sub caused the community to split into multiple other mini-subs for: non-OC fanarts, comics, OC Sprite comics, memes, etc..... and banning the slightest ""lewd"" or funny stuff there (A pretty good artist made a funny meme  ship, that apparently offended a mod, so they deleted it immediately)

Hell, the main sub is barely good for anything nowadays other than news update, a few good Reddit artists' works and discussions
            > Hell, the main sub is barely good for anything nowadays other than news update, a few good Reddit artists' works and discussions

Reminds me of when the Arknights mode scared away two comic posters for riske jokes

https://old.reddit.com/r/arknights/comments/uv8mts/im_sorry/

https://old.reddit.com/r/0sanitymemes/comments/xhcp5y/sexual_assaultpng/
            The FGO thing happened around the time Reddit was going crazy with its loli-hunt and just spray-banning everything that could've been possibly risky.

What other sub would you recommend? I did notice it's not as active as it used to be in the past.
                r/FGOcomics is pretty active as far as I'm aware, but that place is more of a hot pile of mixture than anything: it frequently posts fan arts, porn, sometimes actual comics, porn comics, etc.... there's also specific Fate characters' dedicated subs 

r/fatestaynight more frequently feature FSN content, but also FGO from time to time. Or r/Fate , for that matter 

If you want braindead insane memes about raping and raping the rapists, go to r/Okbuddyrintard . It's better than it sounds, trust me
                    I see, thanks.
I think FGO is still kinda toxic, but not necessarily in the way you might think. 

It's because it's inherently intertwined with pretty big fandoms that are not playing the gacha. People who like the anime/VNs/LNs etc.
    Tbf, that graph has it placed on the middle.

So in other words your computer is really really old
Blue archive‚Äôs kivotos is still surrounded by mystery since we don‚Äôt know whats outside the city whether or not there is still life out there/if thats where the adults are ect, but as long as you are in the cities and are part of a decent academy I think your life would be pretty chill, not to mention just being there you will have a halo that will protect you from injuries

Meanwhile nikke‚Äôs world is literal apocalypse and you are a helpless citizen stuck underground, and there is a non zero chance that the ark just gets invaded some random day soooo nikke‚Äôs world is probably a lot harsher to live in
    I mean in blue archive it really depends, sensei doesnt have an halo so an outsider will not just get one, they probably need to be born with one, but even without one, just dont be that adventurous and try to find a job and you will probably be okay, its not a shit hole like Nikke.
        yeah I was more thinking of it like a ‚Äúyou were always part of that world‚Äù type of situation.
Blue Archive for sure.
Pretty fun for story and stuff imo üëç

Those aren't SSRs nor were they for half anni or anni, every half anni/anni we've gotten free MLB SSR lolis
I mean for many characters the fanservice is mostly centered in the front/chest even in the shooting pose. (ex Sr Anis & Summer Anis, Brid, Maiden, Nihilister). Not every single character is ass, but that's the main thing you'd expect tho

Isn't stellar blade the one being attacked right now, and still getting pushback though? I agree the 1.5 anni units aren't much to look at, and the 3 new skins for Modernia, Diesel and Snow White, while pretty and cool in their own regard are not that fanservicey, We just had Bay, Clay and Poli in cheer outfits.

It's fine to be cautious, but don't turn to dooming, doesn't help anyone. Voting with your wallet has more effect.

How much do skins typically cost on AL?
    They range from 780 gems to 1200 gems per skin. Depending if its L2D or not. How lewd it is (I think that affectd price) and the shipgirl's popularity.

You can buy gems for $1, $5, $10, $20  and all the way up $80. Always make the first purchase and wait till gem reset to buy again.

Because, lets say the $20 dollar purchase. First time buying will give you 1200 gems PLUS 1200 gems for free for a total 2400 gems. If you buy that pack again before the reset then you will get your 1200 gems BUT only like 120 free gems. So that is why it is worth to wait for reset.

So to answer your question short. Between 5 and 10 bucks. Not bad at all.
        >so to answer your question short. Between 5 and 10 bucks. Not bad at all.

Dawg we in here paying a baseline of 20 for a new spriteüò≠üò≠

https://i.redd.it/66t6r6bvlvvc1.gif
            Yeah I know! I have a few Nikke skins I want to buy but dont want to drop 20 bucks just for that. Maybe if they bundled with 10 pull tickets or some resources.

In AL youcan interact with the skins and some have "hidden" touch features. New Jersey's swimsuit skin is so nice!

https://youtu.be/33I78p2Mkv4?feature=shared

Edit: love the One Piece Enel. Hahaha
                Bruh New Jersey‚Äôs swimsuit is what all the skins in Nikke should be 

And that one‚Äôs also only 5-10$ right?
                    This was 1200 gems. So technically 10 bucks.
                Is it possible to get old skins in this game?
                    Yes. Some that are older are added permanently to the shop. Others that came out during their event will go away but eventually you will have a chance to buy it again. Thanksgiving time for their "black friday" celebration, they make all skins available and reset the gems purchase so you can get the full amount of free gems.
                        Thanks, man!
            Yeah as someone who has been playing AL for a few years now this is the reason why I barely buy any of the nikke skins
        Akagi and Kaga's swimsuit skins are only 600
            Nice! I honestly forgot about that. So yeah. There you go. Skins even at 600 gems good catch!
        Arknights players: you guys pay for skins?
            I tried Arknights a long time ago. Just wasnt feeling it. How is it now? Do they have "quality" skins?
                I only started a year ago so I don't know how it was day one, but in my time playing they did add a few quality of life features like skipping annihilation. 

Regarding the skins, if you're looking for the same level of fanservice as Azur Lane then Arknights can't compete. But if it's "cool or pretty" looking skins then we have those in spades.

Kal'tsit and Chen Alter's L2D skins come to mind as well as the upcoming Texas Alter and Mlynar skins.
And how many gems do the devs give yearly again oh right enough to allow F2P players more then enough dock space
    Honestly. For the Chinese New Year they give the envelopes that contain gems and rarely for compensation after maintenance. And aside from that, that is pretty much it unless I missed something. But I can say if I did not spend money I would not have the dock space I have now. I have 605 ships and my dock space is 630 at the moment. I collect all the ladies.

My money is also goes to skins. I have most of the swimsuits, most of the race queens, some randoms that I like (lewd ones) and definitely all of Agir's. I wait for the gem reset so I can get double for my money. I also use Google Rewards which you asnwer a few surveys and it gives you money. I have bought most of my gems that way.
        I started playing about half a year after the game launched globally and I can tell you that before my degeneracy took over and started spending gems on skins, I always had enough gems to expand dock space as a f2p player.
            I started playing sice day one. Left a few times but came back. I have 605 ships and none are repeats. My collect percent is 95. I know being in a guild gives you dock space too after you upgrade that area. Thats cool though. Accept the pervy! Haha
                Yeah guild gives me more space so that definitely helped me :D
I mean have you seen New Jersey's swimsuit skin?
    And Shinano's. I have them both
    I know, and I encourage it. Top tier skin.
        Devonshires new skin and Peresus skin has sex too lmao
    I have New Jersey skin, i don;t have New Jersey, man i just saw the special interaction and was an insta buy, i just need to get her XD.
        Can guarantee get her as pity in the heavy ship pool.
            The problem is that I don't have any UR to sacrifice without losing the the ship
                Pardon but what do you mean by that? Like bulins?
                    Nope the pity doesn't give you one UR directly you need to exchange one UR for one UR.
                        Uh that's not how the pity works for the UR exchange. You need 400 pts through any pull on light, medium, heavy banners with 1 cube = 1 pt. Once you get 400 pts you can exchange for either NJ or shinano. Also if you get a UR on medium or heavy it doesn't count towards the points. I just exchanged, no need to exchange 1 UR for another UR
I play Nikke and azur lane and I bought Shinano and Prinz Eugen's race queen skins...
    Eugen's and UvH's Race Queen skins are peak
Counterside too. Some of them are spicy
Yes! That dock space is no joke. 200 gems for 10 more spots. I am currently sitting at 630 dock space and 605 of that is being used.
    Bruh, shut yo ass up, stop yo flexin! My ass is sitting on 440 dock space! And guess what! I HAVE 2 FREE SPOTS LEFT! IM USING UP 438 DOCK SPACE! AND THAT'S WITHOUT FUCKIN BULINS!
        ü§£ü§£ü§£ my bad my guy! Download Google Rewards. You do little surveys based on places you been. Honestly that is how I got most of my gems.

I have $8.71 available. But the $261.87 is the total since 2016 when I got the app. Its slow but it helps.
Yeah, I left that game because of that bs. And I had been playing for a year and buying every skin of every character that came out. But that "You can't play if you don't buy more space, neither you can gacha" is pure bs
This is kind of a blessing in disguise, but all the bundles in the shop are such terrible value that I don‚Äôt feel even remotely tempted to get them. $80 for less than 30 pulls is crazy. $100 for 50 limited pulls is absurd when there‚Äôs a $20 for 20 limited pulls package.
    This is actually a marketing technique. Just having good deals doesn't sell as much as having a good deal and a bad deal.

The 20 pulls for $20 deal ends up looking and selling better because the 35 pulls for $55 deal exists and that one sells better because the 57 pulls for $100 deal exists.

The $20 monthly Mission and Event passes with skins work similarly due to the $20 shop skins existing. Skin plus goodies sells better than just skin.
    I honestly think that the majority of the shop is priced in such a way that people go for the mission passes. Makes them feel priced better in comparison. I'm sure they have a psychological consultant on these games haha.

And I mean, whales will buy whatever no matter what of course.
        I would be fine with mission pass if the skin had new animations and new voicelines  but thats almost never the case.
    True, theres no way I'm ever touching any of those "deals" lmao. Even the pass mission skins are a skip for me. I'd rather buy the skin outright for 20 bucks rather than having to jump through hoops to get them.

When is Rio playable? üí¢üí¢üí¢
Shiroko will grape any Sensei who doesn't vote for her
    Wolfseggs is non-negotiable
    Shiroko ü§ùMaxwell  
Grape
Shiroko goes both ways so automatically she is the best girl
Honestly, I see no discernible pattern here, at least from the appearance point of view. First thought is "characters with the most screentime in story/events", but then the lack of Shiroko kinda nullifies that. I guess it could be "characters with the most interesting personality+backstory". And Yuuka. She kinda doesn't fit in that definition, but we can just write it of as a "first girl privilege" (since you are forced to initiate her personal story as part of the tutorial).

Also seeing Swimsuit Hanako on the 8th place reminds me that she is practically Summer Helm, but kinda in reverse. While Helm's appearance was constantly mired in the censorship discussions, Hanako's design was like taking the same concept just to make it as lewd as possible, to the point that she is canonically "going commando" in it. I guess that the power of cute and funny game up and going 16+ to avoid censorship vs. an unabashed cummer game constantly trying to keep the game 12+. Hehe, you might just even say NIKKE COULD NEVE- \*gunshot sound\*
    Yuuka has lots of interactions, so she has lots of presence in the fanart community.

You got her dynamic with Sensei and Noa. (Gomen Yuuka)


You got her single mom dynamic with the entire GDD

You got her being the exasperated boss/authority/etc of C&C, Engineering Club, and Veritas.

You got her being the exasperated underling of Rio.

She's also attached to multiple memes. 100 kg, Gomen Yuuka, Calculator Wife...

She's been a fan favorite since forever. She's proof of the appeal of well done tsunderes.
    The only pattern I could see is "plot relevance + popularity". Base Yuuka is the exception since she's the first L2D everyone unlocks anyway, others are simply popular characters that appear in main story (maybe with exception of Kikyou who's relatively recent). Other than that, they all have different body types, playstyle, rarity (with some Aru or Hina that realistically most older players have since they're in base pool, or Mika/SHoshino that had higher 3* drop rate banners).

If anything, I'm surprised some like Mutsuki or Wakamo aren't higher.
        I mean, "popularity" is a bit of a moot point if we're trying to discern what makes character popular picks in the first place. As for "plot relevance" - once again it clashes with the fact that there is not a single Shiroko in that list. Honestly, with her story presence, popularity in both art and memes, and having 3 versions, with one of them being pvp meta pick - it's weird to not see her at least crack top 10.
            >once again it clashes with the fact that there is not a single Shiroko in that list.

You know that was one IS surprising. Moreso than Wakamo.
Aru has been my L2D screen since forever. It's just so nice.
Nah, there's plenty of people that hate Rio and wouldn't roll for her in any case. While the design may be hot, her personality and role in the story is very contentious.
    Putting aside the ‚Äúif evil why hot‚Äù crew, I think she has been humanized a lot, and I do not think a lot of the playerbase hates her anymore.
        A Rio banner would regardless not be that game changing. Take Kisaki for example, she had even less screentime than Rio, appeared later and yet has more fanart than her. Thus I'd expect a Kisaki banner to be more impactful personally.
            On a cursory search on Pixiv, Rio has 4,793 to Kisaki's 3,786 illustrations.

Rio being contentious is a strange argument to make as Mika is also incredibly contentious, and arguably, less reprimanded for her mistakes. There's also the possibility that her debut would coincide with an event or other story (perhaps Volume 2, Chapter 3) that goes into and further works on her issues.
                Yeah but Mika is racist so she has that advantage
                for me Rio is just a far more lonely and logical Nagisa. Heck even in the story before her amend with arisu in vol F i already forgive her. Since i knew her point of view, she just really do the right thing in her mind as the  council of seminar.
                I think the case with Mika is that she had good intentions but was misled/manipulated, while Rio came up with her plans all on her own. People are more likely to forgive a dum dum than someone consciously willing to do bad things to further their goals.
                You're using the wrong tag then. I'm getting 5,783 pixiv entries for Ryuuge Kisaki.
    Make her Mika-tier OP and even those people will pull for her.
Is Blue Archive known for its story?
    Kind of. I mean it was a good enough to get an anime adaptation this season
        Oh then I'm playing it. I love gacha games where the story is it's best thing.
            Oh then BA is definitely a game that ud enjoy. The story is probably its main draw for me. Theres plenty of lore videos out as well in case u get confused.
            I would also chime in and recommend Limbus Company. Though it has a more darker story than most other gachas, so do consult with yourself if you want to play it.
                I like when the story is dark so I will also try it out
                    Then make sure to!

Although technically the third game in the Project Moon (so far) Trilogy, the game doesn't require you to play the previous installments . If anything, not knowing the reasons or inner workings of everything that happens is a better experience, I'd say. Additionally, there's the in-game "lorebook" called Dante's Notes in which you are slowly introduced to things you might be confused on, all written in-character too!

The game doesn't require a lot of time either (the main progression is a weekly activity, which takes no more than 2-3 hours per week in the worst case; dailies take around 15 minutes, or even less if you have well-built teams), if that matters.
                        Drag him down the project moon rabbit hole, Wdym the trilogy isn‚Äôt required, it‚Äôs fucking mandatory to distort him into one of us
                            The knowledge of the past two games will certanly enhance the experience, but it isn't mandatory to enjoy the story of limbus. For now, at least.
                        I have vacation next week so I will definitely have time to play the game
                hello pmoon fellow sleeper agent
                And also very un-fanservicey. I'm ok with that, but it's probably a make or break thing for some new players.
                    I wouldn't say so. Its got quite a lot of fanservice, though mostly directed at players from previous games.

The word you're looking for is "ecchi", I'd say. Even that I'd argue that someone like Middle Don or Molar Ishmael could easily be a Nikke design with 0 changes, so its just rare, though with recent-ish developments it may be that they won't be doing anything like that again
            You should try R1999 then. Very f2p friendly, has the best QoL in all gacha games and the story is quite up there as well.
                Thanks for the recommendation! I will give it a try too.
                    I do have to warn you that the energy system does get quite annoying when you're at the later part of grinding for character upgrades in that game (i went from loke 600 something energy down to 30 from I3ing a character and the dailies)
                        I am a patient person so it will be fine
                            Also, since you said you like story based gachas, i would recommend Limbus Company. The dailies are VERY short and optional and the story is really good (plus they give a shit ton of gacha currency)
    The opposite of Nikke. A lot of light hearted event stories and then it just drops the depreso bomb on your head.
    Story is split between main chapters (generally more serious) and events (a bit more light hearted, chaotic).
    Yes it's really good.
    Story is my favourite part about blue archive
    Yes
when will they have pc client i cannot play in mobile anymore
Thanks! I will downloaded and give it a try.

I'll give a try, thanks!
BA is much closer to Priconne than Nikke.
Sounds fun! I will download the game now!
Which game?
    Blue Archive
I am totally used to getting spooked and playing games with horrible rates like FGO (that game made me go insane sometimes)
    If you want a character you want to save 200 pulls to guarantee.
        Sounds like it has a similar pity system like FGO
            Only difference is that in BA, you get gacha currencies often enough that as a max level player, you get those 200 pulls in an average of 2 months
            fgo is 300 but you usually don't hit it unlike Blue Archives 200, 0.8% vs 0.5% does make a difference. Blue Archive is obviously better for spooks but that depends on your roster and what you need. 

For a f2p player spooks are usually good because you're skipping a lot of banners waiting for FES. 

Blue Archive is pretty much a Korean Princess Connect with a changed setting, nearly every system has been copied even down to 200 pity, FES with increased rates (mostly for spooks) and a festival character, gameplay systems etc.
                it's 0.7% for the banner 3* and 2.3% for other 3*.
            You have 75% chance to get the banner 3* before pity and on the average you should get 6 3* charterers with full pity 200 pulls. 0.7% for banner 3* and 2.3% for random 3*.
            It might, it has been years since I played that one so Idk how similar it is. All I know is twice I have had to go to the 200 mark to get the character I wanted to get and that is out of 3 banners so not good rates in my experience.
That is one of the reasons I dropped BA, it was my 2nd gacha after GFL but the drop rate was terrible. The characters looked gorgeous but actually getting them was a pain
What do you mean by "spark"?
    It's like pity system, but you can't carry your points for next banner, and you need 200 pulls to "spark".
    What they said, only pull to reach pity. If i recall correctly, the term comes from Granblue's sparks, which is the currency you get for each pull until you reach the cap allowing you to get the unit you want.
    It's a terminology from GBF were you get a spark for a pull, and with 200 sparks you can basically get the character for free.

Think of Golden Mileage tickets, BUT the spark is only valid until the banner ends, so you can't really use those tickets once the banner goes away and a new one takes its place.
    200 pulls is spark
Not as bad as Nikke where the more desirable units (pilgrims) have 0.5% rate. I used to actively play for around 7 months and never got a pilgrim unit, they do sometimes have pilgrim limited banners where I think the rate increases to 1%.
    But at the same time, nikke have transferable pity

Where you can use it on any banner
Of course I will read them I enjoy stories
I mean,the most time you have to use your brain is during boss raid or story boss battles.

Still alright but it's probably not for you.
    Booooooooooooring. It‚Äôs just not Nikke
Left Mountain and Right Mountain
dang it, should have started playing sooner
    Well considering during 1.5 anni, they let us choose between Kilo & Rei. I would imagine 2nd anniversary will have same thing with Smol White and whoever the other SSR is.
        old white, to complete the 3 stages of human developement
            Completely emotionless battle hardened Snow White. And the only thing she lives for is to destroy the queen and every single rapture.

Biggest shocking factor is that she doesn't care about eating anymore, because she is completely consumed by her hatred.
                Or a happy Snow White who learnt to smile again and who eats for fun and not out of c-PTSD. Maybe she hangs out with Andersen and Red Hood once again.
                    I had the more depressing timeline, so this can be the happy timeline.
    You really should have she cheeses some of the story bosses
        I assume you cant pull for her anymore?
            The best you can do is hope for a rerun like how rei will get for the 1.5 anniversary
Thanks to that I basically max her out easily
It ain't a lie. The artist clearly was doing something with the shooting pose.
Surprised no one has cross posted this meme on the BA sub yet
    i dont know hy but i feel BA sub was pretty tameish not wacky like what outside community see them
        Shame the copypasta chefs got bonked to oblivion
            Cooking so good that the automods considered their food contraband.
Can't be worse than Grand Order mods [forbade in-game loli lewds](https://old.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/15ob2kt/summer_8_summer_chloe_von_einzbern_avenger_skills/jvrs53w/)

    It was pretty bad. They essentially deleted Anson from her event release after the community backlash, which included Manjuu‚Äôs offices getting graffiti‚Äôd and shit, iirc.

Classic mod drama there though lol, can‚Äôt say how many times I‚Äôve seen mods just fuck off and do their own thing while the community goes ‚Äú???‚Äù
    I reckon it's a case of powertripping mods, and paranoia

FGO sub is possibly the 3rd most popular Gacha game sub out there, behind Genshin and HSR, so it's prone to have lots of Puritans. And it ran into a quite unfortunate case with the Reddit Admins when Abigail Williams (really lewd) swimsuit skin came out
(Fucking hell, it was even considered one of the major reason for Reddit's """Anti-Evil""" something that was dedicated to targeting loli shit and ban them) 

Oh and the mods are also powertripping high. A shitton of restrictions on the main sub caused the community to split into multiple other mini-subs for: non-OC fanarts, comics, OC Sprite comics, memes, etc..... and banning the slightest ""lewd"" or funny stuff there (A pretty good artist made a funny meme  ship, that apparently offended a mod, so they deleted it immediately)

Hell, the main sub is barely good for anything nowadays other than news update, a few good Reddit artists' works and discussions
        > Hell, the main sub is barely good for anything nowadays other than news update, a few good Reddit artists' works and discussions

Reminds me of when the Arknights mode scared away two comic posters for riske jokes

https://old.reddit.com/r/arknights/comments/uv8mts/im_sorry/

https://old.reddit.com/r/0sanitymemes/comments/xhcp5y/sexual_assaultpng/
        The FGO thing happened around the time Reddit was going crazy with its loli-hunt and just spray-banning everything that could've been possibly risky.

What other sub would you recommend? I did notice it's not as active as it used to be in the past.
            r/FGOcomics is pretty active as far as I'm aware, but that place is more of a hot pile of mixture than anything: it frequently posts fan arts, porn, sometimes actual comics, porn comics, etc.... there's also specific Fate characters' dedicated subs 

r/fatestaynight more frequently feature FSN content, but also FGO from time to time. Or r/Fate , for that matter 

If you want braindead insane memes about raping and raping the rapists, go to r/Okbuddyrintard . It's better than it sounds, trust me
                I see, thanks.
Tbf, that graph has it placed on the middle.

~~They are also up there with Arknights players in elitism~~

I mean in blue archive it really depends, sensei doesnt have an halo so an outsider will not just get one, they probably need to be born with one, but even without one, just dont be that adventurous and try to find a job and you will probably be okay, its not a shit hole like Nikke.
    yeah I was more thinking of it like a ‚Äúyou were always part of that world‚Äù type of situation.

They range from 780 gems to 1200 gems per skin. Depending if its L2D or not. How lewd it is (I think that affectd price) and the shipgirl's popularity.

You can buy gems for $1, $5, $10, $20  and all the way up $80. Always make the first purchase and wait till gem reset to buy again.

Because, lets say the $20 dollar purchase. First time buying will give you 1200 gems PLUS 1200 gems for free for a total 2400 gems. If you buy that pack again before the reset then you will get your 1200 gems BUT only like 120 free gems. So that is why it is worth to wait for reset.

So to answer your question short. Between 5 and 10 bucks. Not bad at all.
    >so to answer your question short. Between 5 and 10 bucks. Not bad at all.

Dawg we in here paying a baseline of 20 for a new spriteüò≠üò≠

https://i.redd.it/66t6r6bvlvvc1.gif
        Yeah I know! I have a few Nikke skins I want to buy but dont want to drop 20 bucks just for that. Maybe if they bundled with 10 pull tickets or some resources.

In AL youcan interact with the skins and some have "hidden" touch features. New Jersey's swimsuit skin is so nice!

https://youtu.be/33I78p2Mkv4?feature=shared

Edit: love the One Piece Enel. Hahaha
            Bruh New Jersey‚Äôs swimsuit is what all the skins in Nikke should be 

And that one‚Äôs also only 5-10$ right?
                This was 1200 gems. So technically 10 bucks.
            Is it possible to get old skins in this game?
                Yes. Some that are older are added permanently to the shop. Others that came out during their event will go away but eventually you will have a chance to buy it again. Thanksgiving time for their "black friday" celebration, they make all skins available and reset the gems purchase so you can get the full amount of free gems.
                    Thanks, man!
        Yeah as someone who has been playing AL for a few years now this is the reason why I barely buy any of the nikke skins
    Akagi and Kaga's swimsuit skins are only 600
        Nice! I honestly forgot about that. So yeah. There you go. Skins even at 600 gems good catch!
    Arknights players: you guys pay for skins?
        I tried Arknights a long time ago. Just wasnt feeling it. How is it now? Do they have "quality" skins?
            I only started a year ago so I don't know how it was day one, but in my time playing they did add a few quality of life features like skipping annihilation. 

Regarding the skins, if you're looking for the same level of fanservice as Azur Lane then Arknights can't compete. But if it's "cool or pretty" looking skins then we have those in spades.

Kal'tsit and Chen Alter's L2D skins come to mind as well as the upcoming Texas Alter and Mlynar skins.
Honestly. For the Chinese New Year they give the envelopes that contain gems and rarely for compensation after maintenance. And aside from that, that is pretty much it unless I missed something. But I can say if I did not spend money I would not have the dock space I have now. I have 605 ships and my dock space is 630 at the moment. I collect all the ladies.

My money is also goes to skins. I have most of the swimsuits, most of the race queens, some randoms that I like (lewd ones) and definitely all of Agir's. I wait for the gem reset so I can get double for my money. I also use Google Rewards which you asnwer a few surveys and it gives you money. I have bought most of my gems that way.
    I started playing about half a year after the game launched globally and I can tell you that before my degeneracy took over and started spending gems on skins, I always had enough gems to expand dock space as a f2p player.
        I started playing sice day one. Left a few times but came back. I have 605 ships and none are repeats. My collect percent is 95. I know being in a guild gives you dock space too after you upgrade that area. Thats cool though. Accept the pervy! Haha
            Yeah guild gives me more space so that definitely helped me :D
And Shinano's. I have them both
I know, and I encourage it. Top tier skin.
    Devonshires new skin and Peresus skin has sex too lmao
I have New Jersey skin, i don;t have New Jersey, man i just saw the special interaction and was an insta buy, i just need to get her XD.
    Can guarantee get her as pity in the heavy ship pool.
        The problem is that I don't have any UR to sacrifice without losing the the ship
            Pardon but what do you mean by that? Like bulins?
                Nope the pity doesn't give you one UR directly you need to exchange one UR for one UR.
                    Uh that's not how the pity works for the UR exchange. You need 400 pts through any pull on light, medium, heavy banners with 1 cube = 1 pt. Once you get 400 pts you can exchange for either NJ or shinano. Also if you get a UR on medium or heavy it doesn't count towards the points. I just exchanged, no need to exchange 1 UR for another UR
Eugen's and UvH's Race Queen skins are peak
Bruh, shut yo ass up, stop yo flexin! My ass is sitting on 440 dock space! And guess what! I HAVE 2 FREE SPOTS LEFT! IM USING UP 438 DOCK SPACE! AND THAT'S WITHOUT FUCKIN BULINS!
    ü§£ü§£ü§£ my bad my guy! Download Google Rewards. You do little surveys based on places you been. Honestly that is how I got most of my gems.

I have $8.71 available. But the $261.87 is the total since 2016 when I got the app. Its slow but it helps.
This is actually a marketing technique. Just having good deals doesn't sell as much as having a good deal and a bad deal.

The 20 pulls for $20 deal ends up looking and selling better because the 35 pulls for $55 deal exists and that one sells better because the 57 pulls for $100 deal exists.

The $20 monthly Mission and Event passes with skins work similarly due to the $20 shop skins existing. Skin plus goodies sells better than just skin.
I honestly think that the majority of the shop is priced in such a way that people go for the mission passes. Makes them feel priced better in comparison. I'm sure they have a psychological consultant on these games haha.

And I mean, whales will buy whatever no matter what of course.
    I would be fine with mission pass if the skin had new animations and new voicelines  but thats almost never the case.
True, theres no way I'm ever touching any of those "deals" lmao. Even the pass mission skins are a skip for me. I'd rather buy the skin outright for 20 bucks rather than having to jump through hoops to get them.

Yuuka has lots of interactions, so she has lots of presence in the fanart community.

You got her dynamic with Sensei and Noa. (Gomen Yuuka)


You got her single mom dynamic with the entire GDD

You got her being the exasperated boss/authority/etc of C&C, Engineering Club, and Veritas.

You got her being the exasperated underling of Rio.

She's also attached to multiple memes. 100 kg, Gomen Yuuka, Calculator Wife...

She's been a fan favorite since forever. She's proof of the appeal of well done tsunderes.
The only pattern I could see is "plot relevance + popularity". Base Yuuka is the exception since she's the first L2D everyone unlocks anyway, others are simply popular characters that appear in main story (maybe with exception of Kikyou who's relatively recent). Other than that, they all have different body types, playstyle, rarity (with some Aru or Hina that realistically most older players have since they're in base pool, or Mika/SHoshino that had higher 3* drop rate banners).

If anything, I'm surprised some like Mutsuki or Wakamo aren't higher.
    I mean, "popularity" is a bit of a moot point if we're trying to discern what makes character popular picks in the first place. As for "plot relevance" - once again it clashes with the fact that there is not a single Shiroko in that list. Honestly, with her story presence, popularity in both art and memes, and having 3 versions, with one of them being pvp meta pick - it's weird to not see her at least crack top 10.
        >once again it clashes with the fact that there is not a single Shiroko in that list.

You know that was one IS surprising. Moreso than Wakamo.
Putting aside the ‚Äúif evil why hot‚Äù crew, I think she has been humanized a lot, and I do not think a lot of the playerbase hates her anymore.
    A Rio banner would regardless not be that game changing. Take Kisaki for example, she had even less screentime than Rio, appeared later and yet has more fanart than her. Thus I'd expect a Kisaki banner to be more impactful personally.
        On a cursory search on Pixiv, Rio has 4,793 to Kisaki's 3,786 illustrations.

Rio being contentious is a strange argument to make as Mika is also incredibly contentious, and arguably, less reprimanded for her mistakes. There's also the possibility that her debut would coincide with an event or other story (perhaps Volume 2, Chapter 3) that goes into and further works on her issues.
            Yeah but Mika is racist so she has that advantage
            for me Rio is just a far more lonely and logical Nagisa. Heck even in the story before her amend with arisu in vol F i already forgive her. Since i knew her point of view, she just really do the right thing in her mind as the  council of seminar.
            I think the case with Mika is that she had good intentions but was misled/manipulated, while Rio came up with her plans all on her own. People are more likely to forgive a dum dum than someone consciously willing to do bad things to further their goals.
            You're using the wrong tag then. I'm getting 5,783 pixiv entries for Ryuuge Kisaki.
Make her Mika-tier OP and even those people will pull for her.
Kind of. I mean it was a good enough to get an anime adaptation this season
    Oh then I'm playing it. I love gacha games where the story is it's best thing.
        Oh then BA is definitely a game that ud enjoy. The story is probably its main draw for me. Theres plenty of lore videos out as well in case u get confused.
        I would also chime in and recommend Limbus Company. Though it has a more darker story than most other gachas, so do consult with yourself if you want to play it.
            I like when the story is dark so I will also try it out
                Then make sure to!

Although technically the third game in the Project Moon (so far) Trilogy, the game doesn't require you to play the previous installments . If anything, not knowing the reasons or inner workings of everything that happens is a better experience, I'd say. Additionally, there's the in-game "lorebook" called Dante's Notes in which you are slowly introduced to things you might be confused on, all written in-character too!

The game doesn't require a lot of time either (the main progression is a weekly activity, which takes no more than 2-3 hours per week in the worst case; dailies take around 15 minutes, or even less if you have well-built teams), if that matters.
                    Drag him down the project moon rabbit hole, Wdym the trilogy isn‚Äôt required, it‚Äôs fucking mandatory to distort him into one of us
                        The knowledge of the past two games will certanly enhance the experience, but it isn't mandatory to enjoy the story of limbus. For now, at least.
                    I have vacation next week so I will definitely have time to play the game
            hello pmoon fellow sleeper agent
            And also very un-fanservicey. I'm ok with that, but it's probably a make or break thing for some new players.
                I wouldn't say so. Its got quite a lot of fanservice, though mostly directed at players from previous games.

The word you're looking for is "ecchi", I'd say. Even that I'd argue that someone like Middle Don or Molar Ishmael could easily be a Nikke design with 0 changes, so its just rare, though with recent-ish developments it may be that they won't be doing anything like that again
        You should try R1999 then. Very f2p friendly, has the best QoL in all gacha games and the story is quite up there as well.
            Thanks for the recommendation! I will give it a try too.
                I do have to warn you that the energy system does get quite annoying when you're at the later part of grinding for character upgrades in that game (i went from loke 600 something energy down to 30 from I3ing a character and the dailies)
                    I am a patient person so it will be fine
                        Also, since you said you like story based gachas, i would recommend Limbus Company. The dailies are VERY short and optional and the story is really good (plus they give a shit ton of gacha currency)
The opposite of Nikke. A lot of light hearted event stories and then it just drops the depreso bomb on your head.
Story is split between main chapters (generally more serious) and events (a bit more light hearted, chaotic).
Yes it's really good.
Story is my favourite part about blue archive
Yes
Blue Archive
If you want a character you want to save 200 pulls to guarantee.
    Sounds like it has a similar pity system like FGO
        Only difference is that in BA, you get gacha currencies often enough that as a max level player, you get those 200 pulls in an average of 2 months
        fgo is 300 but you usually don't hit it unlike Blue Archives 200, 0.8% vs 0.5% does make a difference. Blue Archive is obviously better for spooks but that depends on your roster and what you need. 

For a f2p player spooks are usually good because you're skipping a lot of banners waiting for FES. 

Blue Archive is pretty much a Korean Princess Connect with a changed setting, nearly every system has been copied even down to 200 pity, FES with increased rates (mostly for spooks) and a festival character, gameplay systems etc.
            it's 0.7% for the banner 3* and 2.3% for other 3*.
        You have 75% chance to get the banner 3* before pity and on the average you should get 6 3* charterers with full pity 200 pulls. 0.7% for banner 3* and 2.3% for random 3*.
        It might, it has been years since I played that one so Idk how similar it is. All I know is twice I have had to go to the 200 mark to get the character I wanted to get and that is out of 3 banners so not good rates in my experience.
It's like pity system, but you can't carry your points for next banner, and you need 200 pulls to "spark".
What they said, only pull to reach pity. If i recall correctly, the term comes from Granblue's sparks, which is the currency you get for each pull until you reach the cap allowing you to get the unit you want.
It's a terminology from GBF were you get a spark for a pull, and with 200 sparks you can basically get the character for free.

Think of Golden Mileage tickets, BUT the spark is only valid until the banner ends, so you can't really use those tickets once the banner goes away and a new one takes its place.
200 pulls is spark
But at the same time, nikke have transferable pity

Where you can use it on any banner
Booooooooooooring. It‚Äôs just not Nikke
Well considering during 1.5 anni, they let us choose between Kilo & Rei. I would imagine 2nd anniversary will have same thing with Smol White and whoever the other SSR is.
    old white, to complete the 3 stages of human developement
        Completely emotionless battle hardened Snow White. And the only thing she lives for is to destroy the queen and every single rapture.

Biggest shocking factor is that she doesn't care about eating anymore, because she is completely consumed by her hatred.
            Or a happy Snow White who learnt to smile again and who eats for fun and not out of c-PTSD. Maybe she hangs out with Andersen and Red Hood once again.
                I had the more depressing timeline, so this can be the happy timeline.
You really should have she cheeses some of the story bosses
    I assume you cant pull for her anymore?
        The best you can do is hope for a rerun like how rei will get for the 1.5 anniversary
i dont know hy but i feel BA sub was pretty tameish not wacky like what outside community see them
    Shame the copypasta chefs got bonked to oblivion
        Cooking so good that the automods considered their food contraband.
It was pretty bad. They essentially deleted Anson from her event release after the community backlash, which included Manjuu‚Äôs offices getting graffiti‚Äôd and shit, iirc.

Classic mod drama there though lol, can‚Äôt say how many times I‚Äôve seen mods just fuck off and do their own thing while the community goes ‚Äú???‚Äù
I reckon it's a case of powertripping mods, and paranoia

FGO sub is possibly the 3rd most popular Gacha game sub out there, behind Genshin and HSR, so it's prone to have lots of Puritans. And it ran into a quite unfortunate case with the Reddit Admins when Abigail Williams (really lewd) swimsuit skin came out
(Fucking hell, it was even considered one of the major reason for Reddit's """Anti-Evil""" something that was dedicated to targeting loli shit and ban them) 

Oh and the mods are also powertripping high. A shitton of restrictions on the main sub caused the community to split into multiple other mini-subs for: non-OC fanarts, comics, OC Sprite comics, memes, etc..... and banning the slightest ""lewd"" or funny stuff there (A pretty good artist made a funny meme  ship, that apparently offended a mod, so they deleted it immediately)

Hell, the main sub is barely good for anything nowadays other than news update, a few good Reddit artists' works and discussions

    The FGO thing happened around the time Reddit was going crazy with its loli-hunt and just spray-banning everything that could've been possibly risky.

What other sub would you recommend? I did notice it's not as active as it used to be in the past.
        r/FGOcomics is pretty active as far as I'm aware, but that place is more of a hot pile of mixture than anything: it frequently posts fan arts, porn, sometimes actual comics, porn comics, etc.... there's also specific Fate characters' dedicated subs 

r/fatestaynight more frequently feature FSN content, but also FGO from time to time. Or r/Fate , for that matter 

If you want braindead insane memes about raping and raping the rapists, go to r/Okbuddyrintard . It's better than it sounds, trust me
            I see, thanks.

    Yeah I know! I have a few Nikke skins I want to buy but dont want to drop 20 bucks just for that. Maybe if they bundled with 10 pull tickets or some resources.

In AL youcan interact with the skins and some have "hidden" touch features. New Jersey's swimsuit skin is so nice!

https://youtu.be/33I78p2Mkv4?feature=shared

Edit: love the One Piece Enel. Hahaha
        Bruh New Jersey‚Äôs swimsuit is what all the skins in Nikke should be 

And that one‚Äôs also only 5-10$ right?
            This was 1200 gems. So technically 10 bucks.
        Is it possible to get old skins in this game?
            Yes. Some that are older are added permanently to the shop. Others that came out during their event will go away but eventually you will have a chance to buy it again. Thanksgiving time for their "black friday" celebration, they make all skins available and reset the gems purchase so you can get the full amount of free gems.
                Thanks, man!
    Yeah as someone who has been playing AL for a few years now this is the reason why I barely buy any of the nikke skins
Akagi and Kaga's swimsuit skins are only 600
    Nice! I honestly forgot about that. So yeah. There you go. Skins even at 600 gems good catch!
Arknights players: you guys pay for skins?
    I tried Arknights a long time ago. Just wasnt feeling it. How is it now? Do they have "quality" skins?
        I only started a year ago so I don't know how it was day one, but in my time playing they did add a few quality of life features like skipping annihilation. 

Regarding the skins, if you're looking for the same level of fanservice as Azur Lane then Arknights can't compete. But if it's "cool or pretty" looking skins then we have those in spades.

Kal'tsit and Chen Alter's L2D skins come to mind as well as the upcoming Texas Alter and Mlynar skins.
I started playing about half a year after the game launched globally and I can tell you that before my degeneracy took over and started spending gems on skins, I always had enough gems to expand dock space as a f2p player.
    I started playing sice day one. Left a few times but came back. I have 605 ships and none are repeats. My collect percent is 95. I know being in a guild gives you dock space too after you upgrade that area. Thats cool though. Accept the pervy! Haha
        Yeah guild gives me more space so that definitely helped me :D
Devonshires new skin and Peresus skin has sex too lmao
Can guarantee get her as pity in the heavy ship pool.
    The problem is that I don't have any UR to sacrifice without losing the the ship
        Pardon but what do you mean by that? Like bulins?
            Nope the pity doesn't give you one UR directly you need to exchange one UR for one UR.
                Uh that's not how the pity works for the UR exchange. You need 400 pts through any pull on light, medium, heavy banners with 1 cube = 1 pt. Once you get 400 pts you can exchange for either NJ or shinano. Also if you get a UR on medium or heavy it doesn't count towards the points. I just exchanged, no need to exchange 1 UR for another UR

        Nope the pity doesn't give you one UR directly you need to exchange one UR for one UR.
            Uh that's not how the pity works for the UR exchange. You need 400 pts through any pull on light, medium, heavy banners with 1 cube = 1 pt. Once you get 400 pts you can exchange for either NJ or shinano. Also if you get a UR on medium or heavy it doesn't count towards the points. I just exchanged, no need to exchange 1 UR for another UR
>once again it clashes with the fact that there is not a single Shiroko in that list.

You know that was one IS surprising. Moreso than Wakamo.
On a cursory search on Pixiv, Rio has 4,793 to Kisaki's 3,786 illustrations.

Rio being contentious is a strange argument to make as Mika is also incredibly contentious, and arguably, less reprimanded for her mistakes. There's also the possibility that her debut would coincide with an event or other story (perhaps Volume 2, Chapter 3) that goes into and further works on her issues.
    Yeah but Mika is racist so she has that advantage
    for me Rio is just a far more lonely and logical Nagisa. Heck even in the story before her amend with arisu in vol F i already forgive her. Since i knew her point of view, she just really do the right thing in her mind as the  council of seminar.
    I think the case with Mika is that she had good intentions but was misled/manipulated, while Rio came up with her plans all on her own. People are more likely to forgive a dum dum than someone consciously willing to do bad things to further their goals.
    You're using the wrong tag then. I'm getting 5,783 pixiv entries for Ryuuge Kisaki.
Oh then BA is definitely a game that ud enjoy. The story is probably its main draw for me. Theres plenty of lore videos out as well in case u get confused.
I would also chime in and recommend Limbus Company. Though it has a more darker story than most other gachas, so do consult with yourself if you want to play it.
    I like when the story is dark so I will also try it out
        Then make sure to!

Although technically the third game in the Project Moon (so far) Trilogy, the game doesn't require you to play the previous installments . If anything, not knowing the reasons or inner workings of everything that happens is a better experience, I'd say. Additionally, there's the in-game "lorebook" called Dante's Notes in which you are slowly introduced to things you might be confused on, all written in-character too!

The game doesn't require a lot of time either (the main progression is a weekly activity, which takes no more than 2-3 hours per week in the worst case; dailies take around 15 minutes, or even less if you have well-built teams), if that matters.
            Drag him down the project moon rabbit hole, Wdym the trilogy isn‚Äôt required, it‚Äôs fucking mandatory to distort him into one of us
                The knowledge of the past two games will certanly enhance the experience, but it isn't mandatory to enjoy the story of limbus. For now, at least.
            I have vacation next week so I will definitely have time to play the game
    hello pmoon fellow sleeper agent
    And also very un-fanservicey. I'm ok with that, but it's probably a make or break thing for some new players.
        I wouldn't say so. Its got quite a lot of fanservice, though mostly directed at players from previous games.

The word you're looking for is "ecchi", I'd say. Even that I'd argue that someone like Middle Don or Molar Ishmael could easily be a Nikke design with 0 changes, so its just rare, though with recent-ish developments it may be that they won't be doing anything like that again
You should try R1999 then. Very f2p friendly, has the best QoL in all gacha games and the story is quite up there as well.
    Thanks for the recommendation! I will give it a try too.
        I do have to warn you that the energy system does get quite annoying when you're at the later part of grinding for character upgrades in that game (i went from loke 600 something energy down to 30 from I3ing a character and the dailies)
            I am a patient person so it will be fine
                Also, since you said you like story based gachas, i would recommend Limbus Company. The dailies are VERY short and optional and the story is really good (plus they give a shit ton of gacha currency)
Only difference is that in BA, you get gacha currencies often enough that as a max level player, you get those 200 pulls in an average of 2 months
fgo is 300 but you usually don't hit it unlike Blue Archives 200, 0.8% vs 0.5% does make a difference. Blue Archive is obviously better for spooks but that depends on your roster and what you need. 

For a f2p player spooks are usually good because you're skipping a lot of banners waiting for FES. 

Blue Archive is pretty much a Korean Princess Connect with a changed setting, nearly every system has been copied even down to 200 pity, FES with increased rates (mostly for spooks) and a festival character, gameplay systems etc.
    it's 0.7% for the banner 3* and 2.3% for other 3*.
You have 75% chance to get the banner 3* before pity and on the average you should get 6 3* charterers with full pity 200 pulls. 0.7% for banner 3* and 2.3% for random 3*.
It might, it has been years since I played that one so Idk how similar it is. All I know is twice I have had to go to the 200 mark to get the character I wanted to get and that is out of 3 banners so not good rates in my experience.
Completely emotionless battle hardened Snow White. And the only thing she lives for is to destroy the queen and every single rapture.

Biggest shocking factor is that she doesn't care about eating anymore, because she is completely consumed by her hatred.
    Or a happy Snow White who learnt to smile again and who eats for fun and not out of c-PTSD. Maybe she hangs out with Andersen and Red Hood once again.
        I had the more depressing timeline, so this can be the happy timeline.
The best you can do is hope for a rerun like how rei will get for the 1.5 anniversary
Cooking so good that the automods considered their food contraband.
r/FGOcomics is pretty active as far as I'm aware, but that place is more of a hot pile of mixture than anything: it frequently posts fan arts, porn, sometimes actual comics, porn comics, etc.... there's also specific Fate characters' dedicated subs 

r/fatestaynight more frequently feature FSN content, but also FGO from time to time. Or r/Fate , for that matter 

If you want braindead insane memes about raping and raping the rapists, go to r/Okbuddyrintard . It's better than it sounds, trust me
    I see, thanks.
Bruh New Jersey‚Äôs swimsuit is what all the skins in Nikke should be 

And that one‚Äôs also only 5-10$ right?
    This was 1200 gems. So technically 10 bucks.
Is it possible to get old skins in this game?
    Yes. Some that are older are added permanently to the shop. Others that came out during their event will go away but eventually you will have a chance to buy it again. Thanksgiving time for their "black friday" celebration, they make all skins available and reset the gems purchase so you can get the full amount of free gems.
        Thanks, man!
I only started a year ago so I don't know how it was day one, but in my time playing they did add a few quality of life features like skipping annihilation. 

Regarding the skins, if you're looking for the same level of fanservice as Azur Lane then Arknights can't compete. But if it's "cool or pretty" looking skins then we have those in spades.

Kal'tsit and Chen Alter's L2D skins come to mind as well as the upcoming Texas Alter and Mlynar skins.
Yeah guild gives me more space so that definitely helped me :D
