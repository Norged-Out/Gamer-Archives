[[I love this event background, it's such a good balance between badass & sexy imo]]


Side note, how did yall feel about the event story so far? Overall I liked it & I'm looking forward to seeing how they're going to end it when hardmode is released.


Completionist here, still waiting for hard stages to gulp it down in one go. But so far, folks her set it off as not so great. I'll be the judge of that!
I wish she was zoomed in a little more in the background, a lot of wasted space in the upper part.
    I thought the same thing when I first saw it lol. A little more soomed in would be perfect
What I'm sad about is that she isn't the kind of person to pull this face too often, she didn't want to do it at the expense that people may suffer from it. But as it may, people have to pay for their errors, especially if they can cause so much damage that it could potentially hurt everyone that is innocent in the outer rim, and even the Ark. 

We have to comfort her later guys, don't forget.

Total tone shift like a personality switch. She got all serious and ominous that thriller music plays again when something dreadful or suspenseful is happening.
Of course we know something did happen.
