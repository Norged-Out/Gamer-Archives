[[Neon Blue Ocean Balance Suggestion]]


Most of her kit seems ok for niche use, but her Burst is bad.  I think the philosophy behind her Burst is Aoe damage, so how about this:

Burst Skill:

Affects Self.

Change the weapon in use:

WATERPOWER(!!!!):  Each shot attacks up to X enemies *(Devs would need to balance this, I think at least 5 would be good)*  *(Uses existing Burst weapon change except hitting more targets.  Splash damage remains the same)*

Damage: X% *(devs would have to balance this)* of final ATK

Activates when the target belongs to Fire Code

Deals X% of final damage as additional damage.

For 10 seconds, allies damage convert to water damage.

I was so happy to finally see an SSR Counter join the roster, but try as I might I can't see Neon: Blue Ocean performing in any situation.  These were just my initial thoughts on how I'd tweak her kit while trying to keep her unique.  Her personal Burst weapon change stays with the initial design, and will still remain trash against single target encounters, while letting her WATERPOWER actually shine a little against packs of enemies.  For the second part of her Burst.. Neon's mood is infectious and against their better judgement later on, her squad signs up for Team WATERPOWER, at least for a few seconds.


tbh Neon Burst being AoE is an absolute non-sense. Her S1 and S2 are design against bosses, so WHY would her Burst for AoE and trash in single target when a Boss is pretty much always alone? Especially in Solo Raid / Union Raid.

Her Burst should be a Single Target Burst period.
    She's overspecialized on fighting Nihil, a fire boss which has a lot of parts close together. (And whaddya know, the event's Challenge stage is Nihil lol)

She would've been awesome on her niche if her burst weapon kept the fire rate of a machinegun, but nooooo....
        Except I tried her there and my damage dropped like a rock lol.
            Overspecialized but still failed at it. She really had a bruh moment there kek.
    S1 only affects bosses, S2 is a flat damage buff against fire enemies.  I agree the skills are problematic to work with, I was more focused on her burst skill with my post trying to make her underwhelming water balloons a bit more effective, I see your point though.

Even with my proposed change her personal burst skill would not perform against bosses unless devs up her damage values a lot during burst skill.  It would be nice to have her as a flex slot option for Fire bosses, but she would also need a pretty significant buff to her attack stat for it to be worthwhile if S1 and S2 remain as they are.

If her Burst skill were to change with a high bonus damage to Fire giant single target Hadouken, I'd also be fine with that!
        To add one thing to my point : you MUST burst if you want to activate her S1 (which only affects bosses like you said). So it makes even less sense that her Burst is dogshit against Boss. You lose more DPS Bursting than you gain with you S1... it's just hilarious.
Her burst should just be a barrage of rockets(water balloons) so that she can keep using her normal weapon. Her normal weapon will be better for taking out parts with her skill 1 anyway. I don't really care about Nier so I was going to mlb her, but not with her burst being like this.
From unplayable to only playable with summer Mary.
Not every nikke has to be good. They gave her super niche skills for a reason. People thinking it'll follow the same exact formula as destiny child are just shooting themselves in the foot. Crits are overpowered in dc for example, while they're almost as useless as defense here.

Heck, in dc, using a neutral element made you do practically 0 damage. In nikke, the bonus is only 10%. So there's no real reason to ever use elements unless the modifier far surpasses Liter's raw attack buffs.
    The problem here is that she's not that good in her niche either. I'm okay with her having super niche skills, but she should at least be SS tier in her niche.

The most frustrating thing is that her S1 and S2 are actually very strong, but her Burst spoiled everything. It's literally the worst burst in the game. Not only it's weak damage-wise, but is also cripple S-Neon DPS for 7 seconds. The effect could be "Stun Neon for 7 seconds" nobody would see the difference.

And if you don't Burst with Neon, well, she just have her S2 (since her S1 is tied to her Burst). And even if her S2 is strong, it's not enough to compete with other Nikke with a more coherent kit.
