[[What made you get into NIKKE]]


I had always known the game as a decent cover shooter, gacha that was F2P friendly. The waifu aspect didn‚Äôt do anything for me until‚Ä¶


I got into Nikke because of 2Booty

    Man, I really wish they would collab again with nier. I started playing on first anniv.
        They really should: Nier collab is what got me into this game in the first place.  I already had a budget set aside for a gacha game, and lucky for SU, FFRK quit NA service a year prior.
    Darn beat me to it

    Yup same here.

    This exact reason for me. I‚Äôm a degenerate, was playing GI with Mods and heard about this game. Day one player
    I‚Äôve watched this for 5 mins already. Thank you.
Came for the jiggle physics, got depression instead..

    Instead? Dude, on top of it like a bitter brandied cherry
    I mean, you still got the jiggle physics
Tits and ass
Never played a Gacha in my life but I was looking foward to Stellar Blade (Currently playing it and it's great), that put it on the map for me but what made me actually try it was Castle SuperBeast and Gene Park talking about how they like it. Currently a little over a week in and I'm really enjoying it.
    Yeah I forgot about that. Once Woolie mentioned a titan was getting added to the game and he got Pat to try it, that also put it on my radar
        Ah you also follow them? That explains the interest in the Titan interest. For me it was when Pat tried a bunch of games and said Nikke was the best one he had tried that evening, I thought to myself "well it has to have something of substance then". I'll be honest, I've kind of guided myself on what games to play based on their interests for the past 12 years.
            Been gaming for years but they got me to pay attention to how fucked the industry is
                Always remember the 3 B's. They'll never let us down. -Some guy circa 2013.
                    Lol. It gets funnier every year
    I'm also suffering Nikke Derangement Syndrome, brudda.
The ads. Never played a gatcha in my life, but somehow got interested in it after getting spammed with 1000 daily ads of Nikke (before it was released). So yeah, shift up, ads do work.
i saw an add on facebook reels; three years ago ¬Ø‚Å†\\‚Å†(‚Å†„ÉÑ‚Å†)‚Å†/‚Å†¬Ø

Maiden did. Damn but she fucking rocks that get up. :D
Looking for a game that was fun, had hot women/fan service, good story and the community was mostly straight guys or at least acts that way. The reason being for the last one is that all the fandoms that I am in that had any kind of shipping for yuri or yaoi always ends up super toxic.
Elegg got me, cause people brought doom along with her

https://preview.redd.it/n1z1etunz8xc1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25498cdeb24a5d553ea00de5508966fcf2978f04
Ass and luck, I didn't know snow white, my third SSR was rare until I looked at communies
This fanart was the first I saw of it and caught my interest.

https://i.redd.it/ub584bp95vyb1.jpg
I saw a bunch of fanarts of Elegg and fired up the game just to get her. Instead, I got invested in the story and absolutely kicking Indivilia's ass for the box incident.
I was looking for a game that's fun and enjoyable 

Saw a video of it , rememberd that I've heard of it before, laughed my ass out on 6:30 am because of the gameplay 

Decided to give it a shot for fun(was supposed to delete it after finishing the first 3 chapters at most), stopped playing and deleted it after Chapter 4 or 5.

Now I've been playing since its anniversary...I think everyone knows why
I got into nikke because I was advertised with rapi's booty. Stayed because of depression caused by story and D:killer wife's booty
Because of Destiny Child. When Shiftup announced Nikke, I was already in hype because I knew something good was coming. I still don't believe Nikke is better than DC, but with enough time It may be bigger and better.
2b‚Äôs ass, I was lured in by the ads and stayed for the story and gameplay, it‚Äôs good for any video game let alone a mobile game
I saw the gameplay footage for 3 sec and was immediately hooked
VOLUME
Anis plain and simple her and her meme face
The same way that i got into nier:automata: Came for the "plot", stayed for everything else (the intro chapter still gets me)
2B‚Äôs big üçë.üòÜ
...Volume
    Same
https://i.redd.it/cs4qcj2d29xc1.gif
I played Genshin before (I'm sorry) and want to try another gacha game. Suddenly, Nikke ad showed in my youtube recommendation. I stay to play Nikke because the story and music are really great
    One of the best things i find with Nikke is that you can play other games in tandom. (Do not be sorry to play Genshin, its a good game, there are just some rotten apples who spoil the bunch)

https://preview.redd.it/i5x1k2h6s9xc1.jpeg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af629230c1e02072094e3ab4b6a9887a811d91f4
Makima. Playing nonstop since csm collab
    Sameee
    The same. Even the weakest collab still did its job.
Lostpause
I saw the vid of the game yep
So I got hooked
mostly for the hot woman when i first saw it, but what make me kept playing is the story, how you get to get the characters better, the blabla chat, the commander actually gets laid unlike other gacha games.
A friend of discord who played nikke told me of the existence of Rapi and that she has Yui Ishikawa as seiyuu. As a Morgan simp from FGO i could't miss It. Stayed because of the serious story and the characters

https://preview.redd.it/b2cirq6fq8xc1.jpeg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f908b33c0bf58bed4c3ceb2515e1d5545f9e838f
    Same reason but mostly because of her ass along with Privaty

This is the review in question btw
Hard to tell. Just downloaded it out of boredome and liked. 

It's more like who are making me continue playing: Dorothy, Snow White and events like current or anything with Aniversary.
I kept seeing fanart of Blanc and Noir pop up on my main feed, around the time they were released I suppose. I loved Blanc in particular, but I didn't download the game then.

Eventually I was looking for a new mobile game to play, and having never played a gatcha before, I thought why not. I joined during the summer event and never looked back.
Story and big ass waifu
The re zero collab, even though I have never watched the anime, I just liked the ookie wookie Michi michi song, characters of the collab and decided to stay after pulling them..
    Lmao is that what the song is called? ü§£
    Ive fouund that the soundrtack nikke has is suprisingly bangers. One does not usualy look towards gatcha games for great soundrtracks.
Kilo's mech, I mean T.A.L.O.S..

Got bored of playing OPM The Strongest
Because the graphic didn't downgraded like other gacha games like FGO, from smokin hot girl turned into kinda smaller version when the gameplay on
I was looking for anime games that could run on my potato PC (and when I say potato, I MEAN potato, not these modern "potato" PCs that can run actual games. Seriously, I'm rocking an Intel Core i3-2310M that's locked at 2.10GHz (can't be overclocked), Intel HD 3000 graphics with literally no vram (I'm not joking, look it up) and the only saving grace is 8GB of RAM. Yes I still use a harddrive), and I saw advertisements for the game way back in 2022 and it intrigued me a lot. I forgot about it and then when I realised it was out, I tried to get it on my phone but it's not even on playstore for my potato phone lol so then I found out there was a PC version and my golly, the game is so well optimized it's insane. I can play it at max graphics with 47 FPS. :D
I was just looking for another Gacha game to play when i discovered you can play it on PC. It's probably one of the best F2P gacha games imo
looking for a gacha with official pc client, good artwork and tits. don't mind the cake either.
boobs
https://i.redd.it/cis6kf58e8xc1.gif

Any questions?
Random livestream from VTuber.
It's a gacha game and unique from other
Grew up playing time crisis so I have it a shot. Snow White is such a bad ass that I stayed.
By the time I snagged both members of 777, Blanc and Noir, I got hooked.
Ass

I saw Ass and I wanted in on the goods.
Got into gacha games thanks to BA so i tried some other gachas but i didn't enjoy them.
Then i started to see advice sessions videos of nikke and downloaded it out of curiosity.
Have been playing since the first summer event.
The Nier Collab. After the FGO event with Summer Kama, who was the last servant I desperately wanted for NA. I was looking for a fun game. Looked at gameplay of the other games like girls frontline, azur lane, blue archive. The gameplay all looked so boring. I hate chibi gameplay especially how it played‚Ä¶ then I saw 2B shooting a bunch of robots and thought ‚ÄúWow! That actually looks fun and engaging.‚Äù Downloaded it, spent like $1000 day one to max core 2B and MLB A2 and the rest is history
Saw a Waifus shooter animation compilation in YT back then and I got hooked since day 1 Waifus with guns are just neat
I went in for the 'plot' but stayed for the plot
Around the time of release my youtube recomendations were invaded by 1-2 minute videos showing an advice sessio from a nikke, thougjt that talking to your units gaining affection looked fun so decided to download it.
Saw a tik tok like stream of someone playing nikke and they had noir on their team.

Lets just say she caught my attention.
Hot characters.
Lovely designs.
Guns.

I play it on and off and am a little bummed I miss the perfect maid event which i hope joins the aechive pool soon cause I adore Ade. 

Kept playing cause characters touched my heart and i relate to them in a way.
Volume of course üòç
Volume ass,some dude i follow on twitter posted a gif of Volume and said the game was actually good and he didnt lie,kinda funny but he dropped the game not too long after
Ass
Nier automata collab.
Joined for Best Girl Anis
Came for the Automata collab, stayed because Over Zone... Well, the story in general, but if Over Zone hadn't been so good, I would've abandon the game really fast, because, as much as I like the game, one year later, the gameplay still doesn't click for me. I installed the game on the final days of April, just when Over Zone was starting, but I would've probably uninstall it, and download it again around September, which is when the collab actually happened. So yeah, basically I'm a sucker for depressing stories, and that's why I stayed lmao.
I knew about the game since launch but I thought it was was just coomer kingdom, Till watched n autoplayed video on youtube and bro showed me every thing fun about the game, story, gacha rates, free to play aspect, generosity of the devs, frequent events/co op, union raids and also server brackets so you wont be totally outclassed by day one players. Safe to say he was right, been vibing for like 2 - 3 weeks now.
leaving G.I and watching Snow White trailer
First got into it for the 2b event, Dropped it, than picked it back up after they announced Elegg and an artist I followed started making some really good fan art of the game
The gameplay.

No seriously.


I downloaded it because the gameplay looked so interesting
Feels like I'm the only person here who saw a trailer and thought the gameplay looked fun lmao.
A findom got me into it at launch for the horni now me here for the horni and depression and doro

Was hanging out hyping on the Stellar Blade subreddit in February when I learned about Shift Up's OTHER game. Had a short conversation with a player about it, talking about its great story and how that proved Shift Up can cook. It having a PC client with crossplay was the clincher (my phone at the time was a potato).

Got obsessed quickly, ended up upgrading my phone in part for Nikke, and the rest is history, lol.
never played gatcha game before, love the desing( :) ) the story. Googld what shift up made before bc Stellar blade,  gave it try and i love it. Its not pure money grab loots of free pulls and unusually generous for a gatcha game so am going to stick with it.
"Holy hell nier crossover"
Came for Volume's ass.


Stayed for Red Hood's smile.
butt
I saw chainsaw man downloaded the game thought it was alright. When the event ended I just kept it for fun and then it just really grew on me, the stories and characters are all great.
Nier Event especially 2B's Bootyü´∂
I started playing Day 1 because of all the hype and smoking hot chicks but what made me stay was the compelling storytelling and the amazing music. The storyline with Marian and saving her during her heratic phase was what truly got me hooked.
Saw a video online about what happens if you go offline for 1 week in Nikke. Was hesitant to download but i eventually did it during half anni and I‚Äôve been playing it almost every single day lol
Not quite 'get into' since I make a point to not play gacha games in case I get suckered into spending IRL money on them, I'd rather not take that risk, but I started following the game based on stumbling on a Youtube vid of the first chapter.

Wanted something to look at, so I decided to give it a watch.

Ending of the chapter threw me for a loop with Marian. I had her pegged as the game's Mash or Amiya, but it turned out she was more the Olga Marie or Ace of the story instead.

Kept following from there.
A friend reccomended it
I watched an add early in it's release and thought it looked like a light gun game adjacent gacha. Enjoyed ever since
Lost Pause's playthrough of the Alpha or Beta of the game which used Alice as the thumbnail.
My friends wouldn't stop talking about now I cant stop talking about it

I came for the lol's and the giggling physics. I have stayed for the sad
I am a sucker for post apocalyptic story's.  And the art style looked good to me . Soooo here I am.
Pseychie nikke cummander bootcamp guides lmao
Volume's ass, ngl (day 1 player)
Funnily enough, it was one of the.EXE videos.
I started playing Nikke after I completely finished raiding in FFXIV. I tried Nikke out of curiosity, but I got intensely hooked on it because of the story's prologue. I started back when they added Tia and Naga to the game. I haven't stopped playing the game since then haha.
I heard the story gets good at some point so I started it last week, simple as that
Never played a gatcha game in my life, so I wanted to try one. Initially was going to get into Genshin, but noped out because of the anniv rewards they gave.

Second option I had was Blue Archive, but the gameplay didn't seem that intriguing for me. Same goes for Arknights. Tower defense was and still is not up my alley.

And, since I was out of options, I got Nikke for the memes. And, safe to say, it got me hooked with the whole Marian part. Shit made me cry.
Ass jiggles and oh boy I'm proud of myself picking this game up because my morale has never been this high before after picking this game up
My friends recommended it. But unfortunately they don't play it much anymore. So now I just stick around for the ladies and story
Saw an ad for it on AppStore and thought the gameplay looked really cool. I‚Äôve always loved arcade shooters so it peaked my interest. Discovered the PLOT was NOICE and the plot was really well written and dark. Only gacha that has a story that hasn‚Äôt lost my interest and hopefully won‚Äôt for many years to come.
Got bored one night towards the end of summer vacation. Remembered seeing Sinder thirsting over this game, so I went ‚Äúscrew it, I‚Äôll try it‚Äù, didn‚Äôt expect it to become one of my favorite games

Joined during first half anni and thought ¬´¬†well hey events like that always have a lot of freebies so why not?¬†¬ª definitely didn‚Äôt regret as I got absorbed into the story immediately and overzone didn‚Äôt hit as hard as it could have since I didn‚Äôt have the necessary power. Needless to say it hit hard when it came into recollection
I was fully expecting to play this for a week, look at the cakes and then uninstall.
its very first trailer
Ass
And to be honest it has been mostly disappointing in that aspect üòï
Well stellar blade.
Booty of course 

After that, the story because I like post apocalyptic worlds and alien invasions
Seen a streamer played wanted to play for myself and end up liking the game so far.
When I saw the free Marian skin, I tried Nikke.

https://preview.redd.it/7gqc3balu8xc1.jpeg?width=415&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=824a5fa339418d53095c55162b472a4f46abd4cf
My friend and I were looking for a new Gacha game after Princess Connect shut down, and he jokingly recommended the ‚Äúbooty shooter game‚Äù. I‚Äôm not usually one for fan service, but it figured it would be really funny to record some goofy footage, and instead I was BLITZED and invested by the first couple chapters and stuck around. Now Diesel, Laplace, Dorothy, N102, and chime to name a few have become some of my favorite characters of all time :)
The soundtrack.
I was vibing out in an arcade with some mates while letting YT autoplay just do its thing, when eventually it came across one of Nikke‚Äôs OST (I think it was either Splinter or The Harvester), and it came on right as were racing. Wasn‚Äôt doing too well at the start, but as the music picked up I made a sick comeback in the race, going from last place to first place just as we all reached the finish line.
I was all ‚Äúdamn this music is fire, what artist is this?‚Äù, then checked out Cosmograph, realised that most of it was OST for some gacha game, decided to give it a try because a game with a banger soundtrack has to be good. Then I shot Marian in the head.
Came for the soundtrack
Stayed for the story.
Azur lane wasn‚Äôt available in my region and I wanted to try a gacha game.
I pre registered for the game back then but never even bothered to try it. Then around second summer event I ran across the OST Stronghold Landeater on youtube and was like ergmagawd this is no way a gachapoop soundtrack. Then I spent like a whole weekend finding all the other NiKKe soundtracks I liked and against my better judgement on gachas I splooged to get Summer Anis and Helm MLB'd and have been hooked since.
One hand game play and jiggle physics of cause.......
bunch of my friends already played, said fuck it I'll try it (got pressured bc the sister of one of my friends is Anis' EN VA) despite me really not being a "fanservice"....fan and ya


the story is ridiculously good, most of thr characters are super interesting and fun, the dev team seems like one of the only ones in recent gaming history to actually care about what the players have to say, I also heard that the game is also really generous in comparison to other gachas, but I can't confirm that, all in all i got hooked from the start lmao
I saw the chainsaw man collaboration and that it showcases FAT ASSES so I start playing it. Started getting invested into the story, and now I'm hooked.

I've heard of gatcha games, and lucky this was my 1st one.
My boyfriend played it first (he started with the Nier event) and watching him play it made me want to! We both play it everyday together now :) we call it our Booty McGun game üî•üçë
I saw ads for Red Hood and then I felt I had to have her.
I saw at some point years ago, they were showing very early gameplay in some Japanese/Korean event showcasing multiple games. So I kept my eye on it 1-2 years before it released having the feeling the game would be great. Been playing since day 1 and it has been great!
Only 2 gachas that have hooked me like this was Epic Seven (for a solid couple of months) and Brave Frontier (for the entirety of its run). I miss best girl Tilith...
Day 1 someone told me its Time Crisis/House of the Dead but gacha and I just rode the train from there
From the start.
Guns.

Yes, guns. Like literal guns
Was reading an article about stellar blade that popped up in my feed. I don‚Äôt have a ps5 but they mentioned shift up was known for their mobile game that had an emphasis on jiggle so I looked it up. 

Saw Elegg, downloaded it to try and got her with my first banner 10 pull. Been playing ever since.
Volumes ass
well like 90% of the community i was like "lets try the funny ass jiggle game i saw in the YT add, what could go wrong"
I pre-ordered. I left. I came back for Noir and Blanc. I stayed for Drake and the rest of Matis.
I wanted the Vtuber [obkatiekat](https://www.twitch.tv/obkatiekat?sr=a) stream it, and picked it up after that. I'm in her union too.
Nier automata collaboration
"Sis look at this coomer game lol big ass and tits let's play it" 

My sister who quit after overzone is the one who suggested me Nikke. Hook on ever since üòÇ
Until what, OP??? Tell us
    I think he's talking about until he saw kilo or atleast her mech
        Hmmmm, perhaps that is the answer. But we need more concrete data before rushing to a conclusion
            He only started talking on this sub 4 hours ago and his first comment was this:

https://preview.redd.it/9urlz00v59xc1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b60c4c9e56a1e6ba4bc628a1d13bd465306f4e0

Also he keeps talking about how he likes Kilo in his later comments.
                Excellent, this data is sufficient


Your payment is 1 upvote, it shall arrive in the mail in 2-3 business days (right now)
                    lol
    The mech is was sold me on the game. Now I feel like I‚Äôm in to deep but don‚Äôt want to get out
        Just make sure you're ready for


#MAXIMUM S A D N E S S
            I keep seeing people say the came for the ass and stayed for the depression so I‚Äôm equal parts aroused and afraid
                Good
I got burnt out of Arknights, and Nikke is about the same size so I had the space for it. Plus I play Azur Lane, so I like fanservice.
I just think androids and cyborgs are super cool. Anytime I see hot android or cyborg women I‚Äôm interested.
Csm Collab, i was obsessed with Power back then.
Came for ass stayed for the story
Booty

Then i started playing and enjoyed all of the characters
https://youtu.be/fcFuq_yVv84?si=aaM1ELB4J8srcg1f

I got recommended this vid so I gave the game a second try after playing it for a little bit at the start of 2023 and got hooked the second time
Alright so I originally knew it as ass the game, and I was curious but my phone was dookie at the time so I couldnt download it. So I spent a while scopping out the scene here.

Then I got a phone that could run it and got traumatized as all do when starting
The fan service. A game being so open to this in a time where some people treat it as a problem that should be rid of the industry. It really caught my attention. And the community being fine with that is a plus.
Honestly? Gameplay, I was really excited about the whole co-op squad stuff.
Followed it before release. Plenty of gacha games with focus on boobs. This seemed to be one of the few games that focused on ass. Not to mention the gameplay is unique

This
I saw some ads before and since i liked gacha games i wanted to play, sadly at the time Nikke got released my phone broke. Months after i saw it had a PC client, now im 1 year in since i started
Day 1 player - The game style plus waifus got me interested.
Boss monsters look so cool
Girls, Guns and Giant freak‚Äôn Robots. What more could anyone want to ask for? 

As we all know. üé∂ You dig Giant robots, I dig giant robots,We dig giant robots‚Ä¶
I saw it a while ago way before it was being released and wanted to play it I guess
Kept seeing ads for it and eventually gave in and downloaded it
https://preview.redd.it/htf0lfso49xc1.png?width=789&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=926cbeb8bbea430ed198c63228550a4794761dce

Was bored + was on a whim since I kinda was interested and had banter with a friend and we started playing it on New year's happy I started I love the games gameplay and story and don't think il quit for a while or ever.

PS: ignore the image just wanted to post an image.also begging for a SSR Rapi please shift up.
I watched this review ( [https://youtu.be/fcFuq\_yVv84?si=jMLnpHhUKfacR1sW](https://youtu.be/fcFuq_yVv84?si=jMLnpHhUKfacR1sW) ) and because it kept appearing in my recommended I just decided to watch it one day, and it made me want to play the game. I also recently got a new phone that finally allowed me to play high-quality mobile games (so It wouldn't have been possible for me to play this game earlier than this) so that's also why I got it. I didn't even see the ads of this game lol
When NIKKE was released, I was a university dropout and NEET. I had plety of spare time and when I saw a brand new game with cute/sexy character designs with my favorite VA (Rie Takahashi, Kana Hazawa) I thought hell yeah. Came for the fanservice, stayed for depression.
I was looking for another game like legends and dokkqn(gambling but legal)and found nikke
Rapi. They talked about this game for a few years before it released, but when I saw them cheeks I was ready.
Destiny Child. 
Awesome to find this as destiny child was near it's end.
I like robots, I like women, I like sci-fi, and Laplace is cool
Rezero
Looked for a game with nice jiggle physics stayed for the story, characters, and emotional damage
My girlfriend calls it Booty Click for a reason ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Got bored did some research and walla the best gacha game ever compared to any I played the rates, stroy, ass, community and ass agian what more can I say.

And because I liked their character designs and the chibis are so cute.
I saw a random advertisement and thought that making cool ladies shoot some robots might be fun, so I downloaded the game since I was quite bored at the time. Pretty sure that Volume and Maiden caught my eye specifically lmao.

Before downloading I honestly had no idea that this game even has a story and all the various functions but I ended up getting invested after reaching THAT moment in the prologue chapter.

Best girl in Ad, brought me in
Reddit advert with Rupee. I'm a sucker for Gyaru.
Bc of the melons
Watching A2 swing them hips
I saw the first trailer of being booty shooter and pre reg, then saw volumen ass jiggle and checked if I was pre reg only to pre reg again
I came for the hot babes, I stayed for the plot.
Saw the collaboration for CSM and just tried it out of pure curiosity. Didn‚Äôt know the gameplay or anything. Just thought CSM was cool lol

rapi and noise jiggle
Volume's Cake.
Major reason: Stellar Blade

Minor reason: I liked Elegg and her appearance when I saw her on the ad (I don't have her for now).
Woolie Madden is that you?
    No but him and Pat did force my hand
I got back into it because of sparkling summer Anis
I played it randomly for Content on my YouTube, and I‚Äôve  been hooked and played every single day since then. I don‚Äôt even post content for it anymore so that way it can be a game I play purely out of love.
I pre registered before it came out because it seemed interesting, but never got into it, didn't even downloaded it, I finally played it when the teaser of the nier collab came out, the campaign got me hooked up because of anis and the death of Marian, but what really make it enter into some of my favorite games was Overzone, I absolutely loved it.
Anticipated for it and we were in the middle of thesis production and staying in my classmate/friend's condo unit for like a month, we were bored then the game was just released November 2022 so we downloaded it immediately due to it's gameplay, thinking the tits & ass were just a bonus but realized later on that it's not
I played Shift Up previous game
Fan service, but I ended up needing psychological services ü•≤
I wanted a playable marian at the start. But got depression instead.
Rapi's butt.

But I honestly no longer care for any butt, I stayed because the game is really fun (that's a lie), the story is the main reason why I play daily (another lie, I'm preparing for SAnis to return) and the meta gameplay is really challenging which I really like tbh (not honest at all, I really really want ANIS: SPARKLING SUMMER).
I saw ads of it and I haven't found a gacha that I really liked since FFRK..so decided to give it a go. (I also like butts.) Fast forward, I'm now invested in the story and love the music. Scarlet, Alice and Privaty (Maid especially) are my favorites.

Butts are just a bonus now lol
The beautiful physics, obviously. And then it became my favorite gacha ever created. 

I love my girls!
Selen Tatsuki's sponsored stream near the game's launch. My mouse happened to be broken at the time (still is, I should really repair it soon), so I couldn't play my usual games and was in the market for a game that didn't need particularly precise inputs. Nikke fit the bill, so I tried it out on a whim, and I've been stuck here ever since.
The "plot", but it is the story that makes me remain
Wanted to see booty but ended up almost crying within the first couple of missionsüòî
I did it out of spite to flex on my friend who started earlier. And I did, I'm better than him, he has been surpassed hahagahahahahaha
When my friend played Nikke. 

I played Nikke before when it first released but quit on it the next day. After that, Nikke just snooped around me on the internet, with Summer Anis, 2B, Makima, and even Red Hood. And after seeing that my friend was playing Nikke, that made me cave in.

Fast forward to the near end of the new year, I miraculously got Modernia to start off my account. With the help of youtbers who are passionate about Nikke (GuitarRock, Zxous, Gogo, Pseychie, etc). And boy...have I regretted not playing Nikke from the start. 

I missed out on A LOT of shit that it ain't worth listing out, iykyk. The music is amazing, great, emotional, passionate. The characters are loveable. The animation, to the little details of their designs (the boob veins and squishes). Even the way they handle gacha currency for events, where it's genuinely generous than most gacha games.

I've said this before and I'll say it again. I'm sorry for losing faith in Nikke, for quitting on it, for not giving it a second chance before, and for not appreciating Nikke, and by extension Shift Up for what they are.

4 months in and I'm still loving it and from what I'm seeing, I'm seeign a bright future ahead of me. I'm even considering spending on this game because Shift Up deserves it.
Straight to the point.

The ads. Haven't stopped playing since starting in December 2022.
Saw an ad of Volume before release. Damn.
Cam for the booty, stayed for the sad. 
And gambling addiction.
The story has me locked in.
Saw ads for it and thought the gameplay actually looked pretty cool. At the time, was only playing Blue Archive and was looking for another gacha game to start on.

Needless to say, was hooked. Also, ass.
Came for the booty, stay for the story.

Not many game got me hooked after the tutorial‚Ä¶ ü•≤
Ass.


There's no other context, it's literally just because I love ass.
The community got me into this game!
The gyatt
Coz this game actually has a PC client. A really good one too. (Seriously tho..how tf there are only few notable gacha games with PC client?) My phone isn't strong enough to play some heavy mobile games like this. Not really a fan of using bluestack or any other simulators either since most of them are just some glorified Adsware.

Been playing on the PC for around 2 months and overall I'm having a really positive experience with this game. Wish there are more popular gacha games with a smooth PC client like this. (Looking at you Blue Archive. Where's your PC client ffs)
I signed up for pre-registration but I forgot why, most likely the mix of Anime, Shooter and Waifu. And then, I stuck with it. And it grew onto me
The waifus. Any similar games?
OP you joke but there's an entire subreddit that gained interest in Nikke(shoutouts to r/TwoBestFriendsPlay, jokingly referred to as "the second best subreddit for anything") after Kilo was announced. So yes, adding a mecha to the booty shooter gacha game brought in a whole new audience.
Saw the same ad of Elegg over and over again. Push came to shove i guess.
Marian‚Äôs death
Plot and "plot"
![gif](giphy|RdyfuV0v9CtemY9PZy)

This awesomely cool lady. Unfortunately the game does not want me to have her as of right now, and it sucks.
curiosity.
Know about game from the start, but got into it just recently by luck. And was sad to miss nier automata.
The fact that it was a decent mobile rail shooter not exclusive to iOS.
I saw the Elegg stuff in the Doom community and wanted to get into it. Couldn't fit it on my phone so I waited till the re zero collab to jump in when I deleted a bunch of stuff. It's been a blast. My only other current gatcha is dbz, this one is turning into my favriote
Honestly I downloaded the game out of boredom, curiosity, horniness for the designs but most importantly because it was a new Gacha and I which I would be able to play from the start.

  
I thought the game was going to be just a bit of fun with a boring story and nice characters but to my surprise I ended up loving their personalities and stories a lot. Under all the gyats and boobas was actually a very interesting and well made story. 

  
TLDR. I started to play because of the lewd, I ended up staying for the story. (The exact same thing happened to me with a different game)

https://preview.redd.it/0zl107fhi9xc1.jpeg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e446991106fbef6bf7ecda246c84390a2ce444ee
Started playing by the time the maid event was going on because i saw videos of the train fight and got interested,but left after only getting 1 SSR in 50 pulls and being disgusted by her design(Volume lmao).

Came back because T.A.L.O.S is best mech,dont regret it.
If you had asked like 4-6 Months ago \*big hint\* I would have been very detailed or at least been happy to tell you what exactly got me into NIKKE. 

Now though? The only thing I can say is that I saw a collab with two content creators who played this game when it was first released and this was a game they were advertised to play and I got interested when I got a more powerful tablet to actually play the game.
Ironically looking for an AFK game but this was much more involved than anticipated lol
The advertisements made me lol so I tried it for the hell of it. Stayed because I enjoyed the writing of the characters.
Came for the Nier Collab stayed for the story and depression
Saw a bunch of advertisement of booty when I was in Japan last year in spring. Downloaded it and gave it a try and fell in love.
https://preview.redd.it/n5iym97zl9xc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=935bc5ca4c8ae17e35518ea752e13ca53f5c870d
Honestly, I started playing it in February as a joke and out of curiosity after hearing the praises about the world building/story. Now, I am a Matis stan/on chapter 16.
I came for the story!
came for the booty

https://preview.redd.it/sb7qw3kxm9xc1.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c4b7a82ee48be5a10cf6c6a5657c2b9f3118da6

stayed for the story and the booty
2B.
I'm a refugee from Destiny Child and needed something to fill the void when I lost all my Childs and MC. Thankfully, I'm just as hooked on Nikke as I was DC, so it all worked out.

https://preview.redd.it/mtyum2e0n9xc1.jpeg?width=707&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=124e6026dd6b3000584ffcd76d8152d2f314ded7
    Fuck yeah fellow DC Refugee. That game did not respect your time at all and when they announced EoS, I felt like that meme of the guy breaking out of his chains
I am not into women, so for me it wasn't ass and tits, but rather the shooting gacha and I wanted to know what people meant by saying "a game of culture." Once I stepped into Nikke, I was bound to it. Imo the story is one of the best stories I ever played and the characters are so fun to use ^-^. I hope Nikke continues for a very long time
I honestly got interested from some of the ads I saw. So I signed up to get it installed and all right at release. I thought about playing it right at release but I though I would give it a month before I did so they could work out some major bugs first. After the one month went by I started playing. The minute I saw the animation after Chapter 1 I was hooked. I mean yeah the animation mouths arent synced for english but I dont care. I was expecting mediocre at best where its like live 2D models doing things in a 3D world environment only to get hit with one of the saddest scenes in the campaign that played out like a fucking triple A anime. We dont get many of those in the game but when you do they are top tier. Nyan Nyan Paradise made me bawl like a baby because it came out just a few days after I had lost one of my own cats. Now that we have stickers and I pulled the kitty from that event it now has a special place on my profile. As part of my coat of arms.
I like to look at hot anime girls - nothing more, nothing less - yes, I am not a degenerate
I love cozy gacha games‚Ä¶ plus the art and character designs are nice.
Alteisen boss gameplay video, Alice, and shooting pose showcase during the closed beta
Played a long time one piece treasure cruise and was really annoyed from the mechanics and then i heared from nikke, nah just kidding i'm for the girls.
Rapi. I saw the icon, and it made me downloaded the game.
I saw them advertise D: Killer Wife as the next character to pull for and...I lost. I haven't regretted the choice.
I seen ads before but when I saw the chainsaw man collab I downloaded it
I played it at anime expo and liked the mechanics for the game, ended up being reminded by my friends it was coming out and been playin since day 1. Storyline is great  and gameplay is a solid loop. I enjoy the designs but I only go crazy over a few (Mostly Noir, sweet merciful lucifer if she was real)
Ass
i was a verteran of Destiny Child and i liked it enough to support shiftup's next project. though i forgot and only got into the game slightly before the chainsaw man event.
I was looking for a game to sink my teeth into and wanted to try out something new. Never been into gatcha games in general. So i watched some videos to see which game to get in to, Stix made some tier list and i took a look at the top ones.

And Nikke was one who ticked the most boxes. Not to faar into so i wont be behind/miss too much and a combat system that i enjoy. After i started playing the story hooked me, and the music is now what i usualy blast when working. And with it being AFK friendly its a good game to play in tandom with other games
I heard it has good story and i saw it had great waifus and fan service
There was this random video I found on YouTube about a guy screaming from the top of his lungs saying how good the graphics were while playing a scene of Rapi shooting (The game wasn't even out yet)
2b and I hope you rerun this shit
It was maintenance for Genshin and was fumbling around on my phone. I saw a clip somewhere and my inner 90s kid escaped was like YO ANIME GIRL TIME CRISIS!?

And then the tutorial started and Rapi's dumper made me understand why most other people were playing.
All of the ass ads pre release. I really wasn't looking for a new gacha but gave in because the pure degeneracy was right up my alley. Now it's a year and a half later and I'm still playing every day.
The Volume advertisement
https://preview.redd.it/wpjopb0es9xc1.jpeg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5f731cee84d4d6b91efd7c8933e749ad5ec88f9

And the gameplay that gave me Time Crisis vibes.
Girl
I started playing NIKKE because Priconne global EOS.
Rapi Ass
1st anni. Saw a lot of rewards being given including Pilgrim SSR and decided to play.
elegg advertisement
Because of this ad, purely because the game looks fun from it

https://preview.redd.it/0ejr1pdfu9xc1.jpeg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea1ddb8241f9b77839b42adea86c8cbdd731f1b7

And stayed for both the lore and the "proportions".
I played Destiny child for a long time and saw they were doing a new game.
JanitorAi bots...
Scarlet's thighs in the yt ads, rerolled multiple times just to start with her even before knowing she was rare and/or meta
I thought it looked kinda mid, but I was looking for something to play and it was recommended. People said it was pretty good.

I was not prepared for how hard the story goes, and how good the music is. It‚Äôs been like 14 months now lol
I came looking for booty.
The game having an English dub also enticed me.
Random rapi ad
They killed off Destiny Child and I needed something to fill the hole in my heart
Great women of many gifts lured me in then losing Marian made me stay.
Isabel and maiden the two best girls
The music
I was watching a stream that mentioned the game also my HDMI adapter for my ps2 broke so I gave the game a chance and of course‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Rapi and as of late Yan been my favorites so far

I also regret didn‚Äôt downloading this game earlier
I remember when the game launched and one of my friends in class showed us a video of helm jiggles and then we all downloaded the game for shits and giggles. Seeing the Marian scene made me realize that the game was actually not just a random shitty gacha game with lots of coomerbait. And I just stuck with it since then, although I've quit the game for 1-2 months and came back in april 2023.
I‚Äôll be honest the YouTube ads, i just wanted to see how obscene it actually was after seeing so many of their bad ads. Turns out it‚Äôs actually a good game.
I wanted something with relatively brainless gameplay.  "Move mouse, hold down left click" is pretty much there.  The art design is a pretty good bonus.
ass
Booba
Guns with girls... The fan service is a plus and the gacha aspect is rather rewarding compared to other ones.
I had finished watching Dress Up Darling dubbed (AmaLee voices the female lead Marin and the show plus her acting is way too good).

Was experiencing college jetlag and saw she played Rupee in Nikke.

Bunny Rupee is now lvl 199 and has had 1 core enhancement.

(Been playing since the Chocolate Maid event)
The 3R:

Rosanna, Rupee and Rapunzel
I needed something to fill the hole in my heart that gbgw (aka gbm) left. Nikke does that and then some üëÄ
Came because of curiosity and because of the Nikkes themselves, strayed for the Actual Plot and the Red Ash event... gosh! I love Red Hood.
Overzone
I liked the gameplay style and kick-ass music. I've never cared much for fanservice or stuff like that so I thought the game would suck, but I was pleasantly surprised that the story was good and flowed well and some of the characters have awesome side stories like Rapi and Drake!
...Emotions? ü´£
Ass
Nihilister. Dragon girls are my weakness
Liked Destiny's Child and saw Shiftup is making a new game
It was a new gacha game
At first I was curious but now we are all already know
Depresso. 

My first 10 minutes into the game and Marian corruption scene.
The *Que buenos los gr√°ficos!* video. It was funny and the game looked good with good looking characters. Why not?  
Also I was looking for a new gacha after getting tired of grinding in EpicSeven.
The Nier event, then the story got really good
Saw Pippa simping for the Nier event. I love Nier, Nier Automata, and Pippa, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Came for the jiggle physics simulator, stayed for the crippling depression!

https://preview.redd.it/bp06tv7s9axc1.png?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b26704868f38e98593bc86962ff6a98260524472
It was a Halo Crossover fanfic I read that got me into NIKKE as I never so much have heard of it until I read that story. Give me a sec to find it. 


[ARES:The Gods of War](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14166772/1/ARES-The-Gods-of-War)


So yeah. Big halo fan, looked to the fans for better halo content and stumbled upon this. Read the story up to 27 at the time and then downloaded the game
Originally got into it because I had a deal with my friend, but I stayed for the depression and booty
The repeated ads for the csm even luckily I got all characters sadly I didn't max a single one
Looking for a new idle game so I did choose Nikke because of the Chainsaw Man collab, and it is a pretty good idle game.
Character designs and unique gameplay. Both the lewd part and the unique look of some characters.  I haven‚Äôt played in a while tho. I tend to try to escape gacha games
My reason might be a bit weird, but i saw the liars end april fools event that got recomended to me by the blessed YT algorythm and i thought it was funny, and despite thinking initially that this game is all ass and no substance i decided to give IT a go cause i was bored, now i stayed cause im a masochist and the game continues to find new ways to hurt me emotionally.
https://preview.redd.it/jtt4o05eeaxc1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8f6618213518c82cb4ea48348a4dc0965279ca4

Well, I played Destiny Child for YEARS prior to Nikke coming out. Khepri was my main. (God, I‚Äôm still so sad about EoS for DC) :(

But what made me start Nikke specifically? Best girl. Saw her as the face of the game. Then checked the vocal talent and knew ShiftUp was cooking yet again. Downloaded a few days after launch.
I Joined for the "Physics" and stayed for the music
Just started playing a week or so ago. I had only sorta heard of it before then. I decided to try it out after a discussion in another subreddit about gacha games. I was looking for a new gacha to try; I've never been that attracted to stuff like Genshin or Honkai. I considered Blue Archive, Arknights, Azur Lane, and NIKKE. Azur Lane and NIKKE had the best waifus from what I saw, but ultimately NIKKE sounded like it had gameplay I would enjoy more. I had no idea they did the faux 3D animated/jiggle physics thing at all until I started playing... I was like, "Oh shit, it's like that huh? Bonus!" Been loving the jiggle ever since. The game is actually pretty decent too.
Def Not that robot ü§£
This simple orcat VTuber that I like has gotten me into the game. From this video here. I don‚Äôt regret it but I regret going onto Nikke at Late Sea You Again.

https://preview.redd.it/y67u8gvifaxc1.jpeg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63c56dfb3232cac99e59a28bba0ad69a8ed1880e
Got into it for 2B Stayed for the ultimate villain
I came cuz I saw scarlet cutting down raptures in an Ad. Stayed because I was emotionally destroyed in the early chapters, felt like I had a bullet to the brain O V E R H E R E
A cosplayer.
Anis' thighs on a random gameplay I saw
Doro
I was surprised that so many big names were doing colabs, and the fact that ALL the main story is dubbed while also releasing as the same time as the KR server, the sold me
Came for the cultured content. Stayed for the gameplay and the tryhard
At first I was being a degen and was just getting it for tits and ass, that faded away and I became more invested in the music and story. The Characters are also really cool too
seeing it on the playstore when it launched
Nier collab, then I played the tutorial‚Ä¶
The ad when they were hyping up its release
The plot
The rest of the industry being shit. HOMM/MM is dead, Civ is dead GalCiv is dead, Disciples is dead, Doom is dead, Quake is dead, Max Payne is dead, Dungeon Siege is dead, Resident Evil, apart from Village, is dead, Silent Hill is dead, Fallout is dead, TES is dead, Evil Within is dead, Stellaris is dead, Dying Light is dead, Dead island is dead, etc.
Been a fan of Shiftup since Destiny Child from the start and is now EoS. The artstyle and gameplay is solid.
![gif](giphy|hyrRK3odiykZ3HluOu|downsized)
Oh you I forgot to add shoutout to Woolie from SBFC. He mentioned they were adding a Titan and that was enough for me.
[This](https://www.gamesradar.com/oh-dear-god-nier-automatas-next-collab-is-the-gacha-game-explicitly-built-for-staring-at-jiggling-butts/) somewhat click-baity article announcing the Nier collab. Being a fan of Nier I thought I would download Nikke beforehand and check it out and the story has kept me here since.
I‚Äôm so out of touch. I see people say Destiny Child and I kept thinking the music group until I searched it on the App Store.
Never played a gacha before. My friends all got into it while we met up, and I suppose it was half peer-pressure and half "I've never met these fuckers in person before I need SOMETHING to talk about."

It's also the main reason I still play.
Came for the booty and Booby but fell in love with the characters and the story for real. It‚Äôs so much more than just big boobs and butts though they are nice
Was playing Destiny Child at the time and when they showed Nikke, I wanted to play + the fact that it was Time Crisis but mobile
I saw the rapid shooting ad on instagram, got curious and played(almost) ever since
One number and one letter‚Ä¶2B
ass and titties.

but after seeing that the gameplay was pretty decent too, the good story and fantastic soundtrack made me stay. idoll sun and flower were the first ones tho that rly made me want to keep playing.
Boredom
There was a youtube short of Volume shooting demonstration,weeks before the game dropped. I saw it and immediately set a notification for the game release. Started clearing up space on my phone, game dropped, I downloaded it. Haven't looked back since.
The chainsaw man collab
Gunz
I came for the jiggly butts version of time crisis.

I stayed because this is some of the best storytelling in gaming and has genuine moments of heartbreak, victory, and love. And the devs are fucking awesome and give lotsa free stuff away randomly, and the music is just kino af.
I was bored on Fire emblem Heroes, saw a video from Kotora talking good about Nikke some time after the release, tried the tutorial and... uninstalled feh and still here to these days.
I only tried it cause my gf kept insisting for me to play it, since she had been doing so for over a month lol

In the end I actually stayed cause the game is actually pretty good
I honestly was very hesitant on playing this game due to the ads and that *one specific ad they took down*

I ended up playing after hearing Red Hood's theme in one of my Playlists and was pleasantly suprised to see that it had a bunch of bangers and isn't pure horny bait
Volume, then Absolute squad and Rapi
Rupee and Volume
Diesel üôÇ
Thos gacha life reactions so i searched the story of the game. And the story i read was fantastic, and the story made me play nikke
Because of the story even though it has a bunch of inconsistencys that I don't like
Blade & Soul. A fan of Kim Hyung-tae's style and aesthetics and was waiting for this to drop since it announced.
I saw their booth at an Anime convention where they were advertising the game before it came out.
Volume's ass. I got disinterested for a while until Noir's release and I saw her ass
Been playing since day one
OST, Always OST, Zekk, Cosmograph, NieN, Ajurika, All make total bangers. Plus the story for a Gacha game is really good,
I saw a video of an Japan only test beta‚Ä¶on discord and saw that it will come out in 1.5 years and thought‚Ä¶yeah I can wait!
Got in for the assets and got into it thanks to its amazing story telling and character building.
I got crippling depression from this game.
10/10
Didnt play Overzone yet.
The music actually.
Came across a AC6 vid where boss music was replaced with Nikke soundtracks from bosses.

And that sounded kinda neat and decided to check it out.

**That was 7 months ago**

Now here I am thouroughly invested in the story and having a blast.
2Booty

People were calling the game time crisis with waifus and that sold me mostly because time crisis is one of my favorite games also it was the first time I ever seen a good looking waifu shooter game details were dope and before you know years after here I am
Originally I thought it was a lulz booty jiggle physics game then I finished chapter 1
Came out of morbid curiosity stayed for the waifus
Same dude, same

Wanted to try it before for Scarlet, but I kept getting "login error", and couldn't login at all even after countless reinstall and restart

Saw T.A.L.O.S. and I know I gotta force myself in somehow and thankfully, after some reinstalling again this time, I managed to get in and get her :)

Mech best waifu

also she somehow deals more dmg than Rupee, an Attacker role, with one T4 and three T3 gears while Kilo only have two T3 gears, both limit break once

Like damn, 800k+ dmg while others in the team only 80k+ dmg, sheeshhhhhh

Submachinegun(?) supremacy
Same here!

Man, I really wish they would collab again with nier. I started playing on first anniv.
    They really should: Nier collab is what got me into this game in the first place.  I already had a budget set aside for a gacha game, and lucky for SU, FFRK quit NA service a year prior.
Darn beat me to it

Yup same here.
This exact reason for me. I‚Äôm a degenerate, was playing GI with Mods and heard about this game. Day one player
I‚Äôve watched this for 5 mins already. Thank you.

Instead? Dude, on top of it like a bitter brandied cherry
I mean, you still got the jiggle physics
Yeah I forgot about that. Once Woolie mentioned a titan was getting added to the game and he got Pat to try it, that also put it on my radar
    Ah you also follow them? That explains the interest in the Titan interest. For me it was when Pat tried a bunch of games and said Nikke was the best one he had tried that evening, I thought to myself "well it has to have something of substance then". I'll be honest, I've kind of guided myself on what games to play based on their interests for the past 12 years.
        Been gaming for years but they got me to pay attention to how fucked the industry is

                Lol. It gets funnier every year
I'm also suffering Nikke Derangement Syndrome, brudda.
Same
One of the best things i find with Nikke is that you can play other games in tandom. (Do not be sorry to play Genshin, its a good game, there are just some rotten apples who spoil the bunch)

Sameee
The same. Even the weakest collab still did its job.
Same reason but mostly because of her ass along with Privaty

This is the review in question btw
Lmao is that what the song is called? ü§£
Ive fouund that the soundrtack nikke has is suprisingly bangers. One does not usualy look towards gatcha games for great soundrtracks.

I think he's talking about until he saw kilo or atleast her mech
    Hmmmm, perhaps that is the answer. But we need more concrete data before rushing to a conclusion
        He only started talking on this sub 4 hours ago and his first comment was this:

Also he keeps talking about how he likes Kilo in his later comments.
            Excellent, this data is sufficient

No but him and Pat did force my hand
Fuck yeah fellow DC Refugee. That game did not respect your time at all and when they announced EoS, I felt like that meme of the guy breaking out of his chains

They really should: Nier collab is what got me into this game in the first place.  I already had a budget set aside for a gacha game, and lucky for SU, FFRK quit NA service a year prior.
