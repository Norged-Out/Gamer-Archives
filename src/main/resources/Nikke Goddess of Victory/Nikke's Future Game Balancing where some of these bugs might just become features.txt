[[Nikke's Future Game Balancing where some of these bugs might just become features]]





Hopefully people can start addressing these problems, or Nikke will just keep going downhill. Ive had the Advise bug were u get a error everytime i complete a story when u level the affection of your character since day one and it has not been fixed at all.
    Actually here's the neat part, they did fix it! In the one single maint we had, they fixed it completely.

However the very next day they did a hotfix for the exploiters that were changing SSR rates, and this broke advise again.
        So it's those cheaters fault.
You either have Scarlett + Harran  or you play in hard mode :*(
    If you have Liter + Rupee/Dolla you're also playing in easy mode
Lmao, pretty sure whales canâ€™t get their refund as it is stated in the terms n condition that it is non refundable unless stated by the law in the region
    Those ToS mean nothing, it's kinda common that people force a charge-back. They'll get their money back, they'll just be banned but it doesn't matter. Usually when you ask for refund you're ready to quit the game.
        Good to know since I never thought about refund until this game.
    But can't they just do a charge-back?
Hoping this game gets better if not DC will get more of my time even though i play that game casually.
