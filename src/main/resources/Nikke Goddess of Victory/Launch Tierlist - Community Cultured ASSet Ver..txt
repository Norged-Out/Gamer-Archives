[[Launch Tierlist - Community Cultured ASSet Ver.]]





More than half of the roster got their ass covered. It could have been worse, but that's not encouraging either (given the sudden redesign of the characters).
    Just a question

Sadly I just got aware of NIKKE existence after the CBT2.

Were there more characters redesigned to cover their butts like Isabel, compared to their original designs?
        Emma, judging by the old design (has been flashing on Japanese Twitter for a long time), was without a shirt.  
Judging by the datamining, the gal girl’s skirt (I don’t remember the name) was shorter and you could almost completely see the panties.  
This is the first thing I remembered.
            I though [bra-only Emma](https://i.redd.it/mnzvg4qmf6o81.jpg) was just a Photoshop edit or something.

Well but let's see how the game is released. Some games unlock skins when you LVL up a character to a certain degree. I hope this is the case.
                After that there was Emma, who was in a shirt but with a small boob window.
        Didn’t play the CBT’s but as far as I know that the covered characters have always been that way( I have been actively following up on any news) unless someone can confirm that they weren’t.

Not really complaining as they might get uncovered with future skins from events. 

I fully expected the game to not come out with all characters looking lewd. There is enough eye candy for release date and probably all characters in the future will have at least one lewd skin. 

My expectations are really low however but at least we have Volume.
    It’s to sell future skins that’ll most likely be more revealing
Volume has the best “physics” in the game, hands down. But my favorite body and overall appearance goes to Alice. I’m going to try to get them both by rerolling and hopefully get lucky. That way I’ll have my favorite booty shaker Volume and my favorite character Alice.
    Alice is a top 5, but I think  my favorite design so far is Noise. Skins in this game is probably gonna be crazy
        There are so many good waifus in this game. I have narrowed down my favorites, and that was no easy task. Noise is in my top 5. Design-wise, she would probably be my 2nd favorite. Noise and Alice are very close in terms of their overall design. I have Noise at 5th overall because while it's not too bad, her booty is a bit covered, which loses her some points. I am glad they are making skins. That could shake up my rankings quite a bit.
        Same, I really like Noise. Will reroll for her when the game is available.
At this point, I'm unsure if I should just wait for the uncensored version to drop in the future or just skip it entirely. I've been waiting for so goddamn long for this game only for this shit to happen. Fuuuuucking hell.
K, so it’s censored. That’s fine.  Who am I to complain about a company spending years to develop something I won’t drop $1 on or click on a single add? Their QA is ran by a nun and they don’t mind that adding a few pixels will cause them to miss out on hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in unrealized gains.

On a side note, what troglodyte is running Shift Up quality control?? Seriously, … the marketing figured it out, the parent company figured it out, but the god damn publisher just won’t listen!  Look, the reason Destiny Child didn’t do so well in terms of revenue is because economy is going to shit and you’re charging $60 for a skin; are you stupid?!  Further, censoring will *not* resolve this issue. In fact, you are alienating your player base. Do these dimwits study history at all or were they all sucking on their mama’s titties when it was unraveling?  

A lot of us started in Blade & Soul because of Hyung Tae Kim’s legendary art.  Seriously this guy is GOAT! He creates the epitome of sex appeal and perfection when it comes to character design and anything else out there mares in comparison.  So, one day Hyung Tae Kim goes “fuck it”, leaves Blade & Soul, and the game goes to shit. His fan base follows him and flock to his new studio Shift Up. A game is released called Destiny Child with massive hype, and boy did the game deliver!  It’s one of the best graphically designed games on the market. It’s only flaw is greed. Now, I am not talking about penny pinching greed, I mean a fucking leprechaun “where me pot o’ gold” level of greed.  Nonetheless, content is breathtakingly sexy; palpable smooth ass and boobies, vixen characters, kinky content, etc.  

So, now we hear that Shift Up is making a new game. Nike or Rebook or something, but the imbeciles are trying to make this game conservative. Dude! Do you go to a rock concert to listen to fucking Beethoven?? No, you’re there for loud music! Similarly you go to Shift Up titles to watch ass and titties!  What IIIIIIDIOT thought it would be a good idea to change that?!
    > Do you go to a rock concert to listen to fucking Beethoven??

I get what you mean, but I won't lie. Hearing a rock band do their rendition of some Beethoven would be pretty great.
    This man is preaching... I am with you. If they censor, I am not spending cent
    One of ShiftUp's greatest mistakes was partnering up with Level Infinite to publish it, because it's run by Tencent, the company right under the control of China's Communist Party.

Now I'm unsure if LI is toning down the lewd on Tencent's/CCP's demand for strict censorship, or if they want to reach a broader audience worldwide to milk money out of as many players as possible, or even to make rolling for more lewd skins more appealing.

I will play the game because there are still plenty of default skins that are great, and I might forgive them if they at least make the skins more accessible, but yes, they are losing a chance of becoming an even greater product.
Folkwang and Privaty much lower than deserved tbh
In bigger and more ‘robust’ we trust! 😤
Anyone have a link to the tier list used in the video?
