        That's what upsets him. In his mind he's supposed to be a "real actor" and not a cartoon or whatever tf he calls it.
            Well, he is a real actor. GTA was a high profile job but it was just that, a job. Some actors want to be known for their body of work because we train in different disciplines to show off that range. Some like being one hit wonders, some don‚Äôt. 

Especially screen actors. I don‚Äôt think gamers should take that as an insult anymore than a coworker who likes their job is offended by someone resigning
                Fair but unfortunately for him he got involved in one of the like 3 most popular single game titles of all time lmao
                LOL he‚Äôs no damn actor! Ray liotta was an actor
                    Ogg‚Äôs performance as Trevor is a million times what Liotta‚Äôs as Tommy was. Love Tommy and Liotta but the dude is so checked out in VC (starts showing more enthusiasm after shakedown though)
                        Who was Tommy‚Äôs competition? A mute cluade‚Ä¶ pretty sure if Tommy was a methed out over the top character with as much dialogue as Trevor, ray liotta would of done a better job simply because he‚Äôs the better actor
                            I mean to my point, Tommy kinda already IS an over the top maniac, it just doesn‚Äôt always come across. He‚Äôs one of the most evil GTA protags (next to Trevor and maybe Toni C) and one of the only ones to show no form of remorse whatsoever. The game literally ends with him calling himself a mass murdering psychotic killer with a big cheese-eating grin on his face watching the sunset (it‚Äôs fucking hysterical, and perfect for the game‚Äôs themes for the record)

But he doesn‚Äôt always come across that way because half the time Liotta‚Äôs screaming his angry lines like a maniac (as he should imo) and the other half it sounds like he‚Äôs been at the nyquil. Tommy‚Äôs calm wise-guy thing is only surface deep. He‚Äôs clearly fiercely intelligent but his uncontrollable rage makes him slightly unhinged
                            I won‚Äôt argue with you that Liotta is the better actor, but Liotta didn‚Äôt respect the material enough to do anything more than royally phone it in, regardless of what he was given to work with.
            Yeah it‚Äôs actually so disrespectful towards the gaming industry tbh

                    Stop disrespecting my vidya gane, Steve üò°üò°üò°
            If he wanted to be a "real actor" why the hell would he take a job as a voice actor?
        He sees himself as an artist and one body of work being recognized over the rest is seen as an insult to the rest of their work. It‚Äôs in the same vein as the disdain Thom Yorke holds for the song ‚ÄúCreep‚Äù.
            Or how Alec Guinness felt about Star Wars.
                Alex Guinness is fantastic in Lawrence of Arabia.
                    I thought he was great in the role of Marley‚Äôs ghost in Scrooge as well
                        It's so rare for someone to reference that particular version of A Christmas Carol!
                Toss Ford in too. Dude hates star wars lol
                    He doesn‚Äôt hate Star Wars, just doesn‚Äôt like how they handled it and Han after the first movie more than anything. Definitely doesn‚Äôt hate it like Alec Guinness lol
                    At least he's also Indy. He's known for *two* acts of work.
                Didn't stop him from making a ton of money on the movie
            There's a really good video where they play Creep in 2016, and the lead guitarist has this horrified look on his face because nobody told him they were doing it.
            I've heard Kenny Loggins never accepted being the guy who did Danger Zone and loathes that it's his #1 song. Makes sense I guess, he was just the performer for a track made by the movie studio, but being the guy behind Footloose or Caddyshack isn't any better to me.
            Yeah, I don't understand people who hate on him
        What makes you think he doesn't "accept" that? I'm sure he's well aware of it, he just has other things to do instead

Just because he's not still focusing his career on a project he worked on 12 years ago, doesn't mean he doesn't appreciate the impact it had on his life
            He had some cameos recently where people asked him to essentially play Trevor in the cameo, and he was clearly not into it and throwing shade at the request, saying Trevor is a cartoon character. That's probably what they're referring to
                Eh, that‚Äôs also his sense of humour, based on previous interviews with him. Plus, it‚Äôs logical that he doesn‚Äôt care much to imitate a performance he did once 12 years ago
                    He took money for doing a half assed comission in which he complained about being remebered as Trevor for like 5 minutes. He shouldn't take the money if he doesn't like it
        Not going to say that being in GTA didn't help him, but he did other stuff, and for me, he is Simon from the walking dead. As much as his likeness is in the game, his actual face was in the show. You hear KJ Simmons in BG3 and probably you are gonna spot his voice at any time, Jason Isaacs is in that too, and didn't notice... I was like "damn this guy sounds familiar".
            That's fair but he 100% got that roll in TWD because of gta
        Gta 5 was a decade ago, and Steven is an actor. You wouldn't still call Andrew Garfield Spiderman, right? I think we can give him the respect he deserves by acknowledging the amazing performance he did and allowing him to be an actor and not The guy who plays Trevor.
        Insufferable account
    I come to write this
Dude I follow Steven Ogg on instagram and he posta some weird shit sometimes‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how much he likes being the ‚ÄúGTA‚Äù guy
    Yeh. Dude that played Franklin said Steven Ogg gets pissed off whenever someone calls him Trevor. I get it, but it‚Äôs inevitable so you might as well own it.
        Ask him that question again in 15 years, he‚Äôll be telling everyone!
            Books by Stephen Ogg:  
I am not Trevor!  
I am Trevor!  
I am also Lamar!
            It's almost been 15 yrs, lol. In 4 more years, believe it or not, it'll be 2028. GTA 5 gon be 15 yrs, old by then.
                He meant ask him 15 years from now.
        That was michael's voice actor who said that statement afaik
            They've both stated as such.
        It's like mark hamill being pissed for being Luke. Most actors dream of having that role that imprints you into everyone's minds.
            thats what i really respect about Mark. He's had an incredible career in spite of being "typecast" for a large part of it, yet never lost reverence for the character and the films that made him a star in the first place. He gladly engages with fans about Star Wars all the time, despite the fact that on the downlow he's probably sick of it. Ogg is a great actor and I will always adore his role as Trevor but I wish he could accept that it's not a bad thing to have a role so iconic that people wanna talk about it 10 years later.
                I don't think he's sick of Luke l, just why Disney made him into
                    outwardsly, no, of course not. and he clearly takes a lot of pride in the role, i think he will always love Luke and his Star Wars films. But realistically, talking about the same thing every day, no matter how much you love that thing, will wear on you. But Hamill takes it in stride and we'd never be the wiser if he ever is feeling "Star-Wars'd-out" because he always happily engages with his fans about Star Wars, online and in person. What a stud.
                        Hamill is actually open about the fact that he's never been a Star Wars fan. What he *is* a fan of is fandoms, the joy of engaging with a fictional setting or fictional characters. He is himself a fan of many "geeky" things and understands how it works on a deep, personal level. Hamill isn't a fan of Luke Skywalker, but he has deep respect and love for others who are, and he will go out of his way to brighten the day for people who geek out over him being Luke. 

Mark Hamill is a treasure.
                    It‚Äôs probably the countless star wars fans who never grew up harassing the poor guy
                Mark is also incre√≠ble famous because of The Joker
                    yes i am well aware haha. didnt really apply in this context since were mainly talking about the role that typecast Mark, which was Luke. Joker didn't come until later in his career
            Mark Hamill was disappointed when movie producers wont cast him because he is often associated with Luke Skywalker. He turned to voice acting where he is also famous for his roles like the Joker in the Batman animated series
                It was that and the car accident. He‚Äôs talked about it quite a bit and been very open about it.
            Isn‚Äôt it a bit like Harrison Ford being so curmudgeonly about being Han Solo?
                At least Ford is seen as Han Solo and Indiana Jones.
                Harrison Ford is curmudgeonly about everything.
                If I‚Äôd crashed as many antique planes as Ford has I‚Äôd be a general curmudgeon too. That man couldn‚Äôt keep a helium balloon airborne.
            I really appreciate his voice work more than anything. Him and Alan Tudyk are the best Jokers. I think of Mark as a VA before I do Luke Skywalker.
                Mark as the joker is literally peak voice acting. He will always be joker before Luke Skywalker to me
            Mark never said he hated being Luke he hated what Disney turned Luke into for the sequels
        He doesn't have to own anything just because other ppl like it. He don't like it, so respect that of him
    I always wondered how many Rockstar paid they for the whole work in GTA V.  A lot of money?
        I think I heard they each got 200k. Would love getting a source here. If this is true I think it's way less than they should have gotten
        No way. They probably got paid peanuts. I‚Äôd be surprised if they each got more than like 10-25 thousand for the whole game.

And of course, no residuals whatsoever.
            If the actor for Nico Bellic got paid 100k then the actors for GTA V definitely got more than just 10-25k
                I have no idea about Bellic V.A money. 100.000 dollars for his job? Sounds good for me.
                    GTA 4 made hundreds of millions lol
                        It‚Äôs extremely uncommon for video game actors to make residuals on the games. Typically they‚Äôre paid a flat fee for their work and that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs also typically not that much, which is bananas since video games are more profitable than film and television combined.
                            Exactly, And this series is HUGE. GTA 5 had records from being the highest earning not just games but in ALL media. 

You‚Äôd think even minor characters would be living large. That‚Äôs happened with plenty of tv shows and movies. GoT actors were making enough to buy a Aventador per episode
                        he accepted the job and the pay, then when the game was succesful he started bitching. His problem
                            That was a rumor. He never had beef with rockstar.

But that isn‚Äôt my point. I was making fun of saying 100K sounds good. 

If you were part of a project that literally made 100s of millions, and you only got a 10th of a million, is that really ‚Äúgood‚Äù? üòÇ
                                It's not but if that's what you agree on then that's what you agree on. Also I didn't know it was just a rumor, my bad in that case.
                                    Eh don‚Äôt feel bad. I believed it once too especially considering the percentages lmfao. 

He did have beef but it was with his union. He blamed his union entirely since it was their job to take care of him.

When it comes to gta 5 I got no idea how much the actors got for that. 

One thing even though it‚Äôs a bit off topic that really interests me is that no one except rockstar knows who voices Agatha Baker from the casino dlcs. I love mysteries like this but it makes me wonder if it was a large payday
                            god people like you are why scumbags can get away with being scumbags
                                >god people like you are why scumbags can get away with being scumbags

No, it's just literally the facts. He signed a contract guaranteeing him X amount of money for his work, and stipulated no such bonus for game sales or residuals etc. If he wanted those things he should have negotiated them. That's how contracts work. It's not a scumbag move to not pay someone more money they they were contractually guaranteed. It's not like anybody was tricked into being in these games.
                                    same thing happened to the writer of the Witcher books, he didn't think the games would make money so he only took the initial pay for the rights and that was that, and then he also started bitching lol
                                    Still feel like Rockstar shouldve paid him more for what an awesome job he did. He didnt "bitch" about rockstar. From what i remember he said he blamed his union.

Edit: Just found out he even asked about residuals while negotiating but rockstar said it wasnt a possibility. Thats weird...
                        They did do that amount, it's a risk they all take. They couldn't know the game would be a success. They had a indication but couldn't know for sure, so I would say 100K is a fair deal considering your own personal avatar will be in a massive game like this. Just cause of the ladder, I know some who would have done it for less.

If you look deeply through the budget, I would assume that the split is fair. People who have more responsibility need to get payed more, that's how things are these days.
                            "personal avatar" is pretty bad reasoning for low pay though, ignoring everything else about contracts, it's still a job in the end, it would be like starring in a movie but one of the reasonings for the pay not being as high as it could be is because "well your character is in the movie".

Especially when considering the fact that some of these actors aren't interested in games.

Not arguing whether their pay was justified or not just saying having your avatar in a game doesn't excuse a certain pay.
                        >GTA 4 made hundreds of millions lol

Yeah, but he accepted a contract that said "You get X amount of money for this work and nothing else." That's what he gets. And it's not as though GTA wasn't already a massive gaming franchise by the time GTAIV released. If Nico's actor wanted more money, or residuals from the game sales, he should have negotiated that before signing a contract. Samuel L Jackson had the foresight to do exactly that.
                I read that, so sure they could‚Äôve got around 100K each. 

But you could also argue Niko was one lead, and with three leads they could dilute the pay among the three. 

My main point was they didn‚Äôt get rich off this alone. 25K was too low. But more than 100K each? I don‚Äôt know about that. Unknown actors usually aren‚Äôt paid much no matter how big the project or role. 

Depends on hours worked, days, maybe it was weekly, or maybe it was a lump sum, etc. 

Of course this is all speculation, before anyone gets absolutely outraged that I dare think these guys didn‚Äôt get rich lol
                    They did all the acting work for like 2-3 years. Most movies takes a year or a half to film so $100k+ seems more than likely what they were paid.

 Obviously they were most likely paid more after the game released like when actors are paid a certain percent of the box office. Than again that‚Äôs why Nico‚Äôs voice actor was angry with rockstar for not giving him that percent of cash for being the protagonist
            you are completely delusional
                It's very possible
                    no, it‚Äôs not. they were without any doubt paid a very competitive rate for the countless hours they spent working on the project
                        You would think they did that for the main voice actor niko Nellie but reportedly id was paid I believe 100K according to some reports without any residuals.
                            sometimes i think people forget how much money 100k really is.
                How so? Why would Rockstar pay these no names a lot of money?
                    Luke has been acting for nearly 40 fucking years üíÄ just because YOU never heard of him before GTA doesn't mean nobody else did. Same for Fanteno
                        Luke, while a solid actor, was mainly in T.V. shows before GTA gave him his big break.

People only knew Michael was Ned Luke after that first trailer dropped because one of Ned‚Äôs old acting class buddies said so on Twitter. Suffice to say he was more or less undiscovered talent.
                        Well Ned has specifically said himself that no one knew him or Shawn or Steven til GTA 5.
                Why do you sound so offended? We‚Äôll never know, and there‚Äôs a dozen variables that could‚Äôve affected their pay. 

In totality, what do you think they made? Certainly not millions. If they each made around 100K, that would be very high. I can definitely see it if it‚Äôs a weekly or hourly pay for all those hours, but I highly doubt they made more than 100K. 

That would probably be the upper limit. 

As far as residuals, that‚Äôs pretty rare for unknown actors in video games. Even if they lead the game. And it‚Äôs usually not disclosed anyway.
                    i can‚Äôt help if you think i sound a certain way, but you are simply delusional to be positing the numbers you are and speculating on residuals as if you have any idea
                        Have you ever been to an internet forum‚Ä¶ speculating about shit is 99 percent of what we do. You also responded to someone else as if you definitely knew they got paid a lot of money.

Hypocrite lol
    >Dude I follow Steven Ogg on instagram and he posta some weird shit sometimes‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how much he likes being the ‚ÄúGTA‚Äù guy

My problem with Steven Ogg isn't that he doesn't like being recognized from GTA. It's that he still expects to make money off of the game and the character while being angry about being recognized for it.
        >It's that he still expects to make money off of the game and the character while being angry about being recognized for it.

I mean I would be a bit pissed if I played a main character in one of the highest grossing entertainment products of all time and got no residuals, too. CJ and Niko's VA's have both said similar things. It is kind of shitty he was in something like one of the biggest summer blockbusters of all time and maybe got 100k.
            >I mean I would be a bit pissed if I played a main character in one of the highest grossing entertainment products of all time and got no residuals, too.

Then you would have to be pissed at your own agents, or yourself, for not negotiating that into your contract. Samuel L Jackson managed it just fine.
                Wow established multimillionaire A list actor Samuel L. Jackson had the money and connections to get a good contract? That's wild why couldn't Steven Ogg? 

The entire reason they were hired is because they didn't have an agent protecting their interests. The second they try asking for residuals is the second they're replaced. Niko/CJ VA's were both used specifically because they weren't in the VA union. That's just stupid as shit to blame the predatory behavior of a multibillion company on the actors they took advantage of.
                    and if you want the royalties and they wont' give them to you then you have two options. Take the job for the money being offered and don't bitch about it after the fact because you signed the contract, or don't take the job.
                        "And if you want some royalties from the highest grossing entertainment product of all time, you need to know it's going to be the highest grossing entertainment product of all time beforehand and include it in your contract" okay so Steve invents a time machine like you said and asks for royalties in his contract. Rockstar recasts Trevor.   Gee, great thinking man, why didn't he do that? You're really smart.
                            >"And if you want some royalties from the highest grossing entertainment product of all time, you need to know it's going to be the highest grossing entertainment product of all time beforehand and include it in your contract" okay so Steve invents a time machine like you said and asks for royalties in his contract.

Samuel L Jackson managed to have that kind of foresight and business acumen.

Also, by the way, literally nobody was talking about Steven being upset he didn't get enough money for GTAV. You're conflating the issues of two entirely different people.
                                
>Samuel L Jackson managed to have that kind of hindsight

And why didn't Steve use his millions of dollars and any of the connections he has from his career as an A list actor to get a good contract like Sam L.? Why didn't he do that? Do you know I can't figure this out???

>You're conflating the issues of two entirely different people.

I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to think someone may have negative feelings about a company paying them like $100k and turning around and making $1,000,000,000 off it, but apparently it is for you lol.
                                    >I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to think someone may have negative feelings about a company paying them like $100k and turning around and making $1,000,000,000 off it, but apparently it is for you lol.

They knew that was going to be the case before they ever signed on to the game. By the time GTAIV released it was already one of the most successful game franchises in history and was already massively popular. It's not like the actor playing Nico didn't know what GTA was when he signed his contract. 

And again, STEVEN OGG IS NOT THE ONE WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT MONEY FROM ROCKSTAR. You're conflating two entirely people and two entirely different stories.
                    Samual Jackson was an established a list celebrity/actor, what movie had Trevor actor been in let alone main character üòÇ? That‚Äôs the difference gta needed Sam Jackson and Trevor‚Äôs actor needed GTA‚Ä¶

                                You should look up the difference between voice acting and performance capture.
                Holy shit you have literally zero clue about how the vg voice acting industry actually works.
            So regular people who put in work into any industry that makes money off their work continually should be paid retirement benefits before their of age? If Trevor‚Äôs actor was a real actor then why wasn‚Äôt ray liotta always mentioned for playing Tommy verceti‚Ä¶
                [deleted]
                    He was already paid for said work thought, so by your point of view we should buy games/GTAV every month and not own them because we don‚Äôt ‚Äúpay residuals‚Äù ???

                                    They're saying that we should in that case pay monthly fee's to rent games so that everyone who worked on them can make ongoing money from it.
            >I mean I would be a bit pissed if I played a main character in one of the highest grossing entertainment products of all time

It's understandable if they got payed peanuts. But if they got 100k for a few weeks/months work, I'd say that's reasonable compensation. 

Cuz let's be honest, the voice actors are only a very small reason that game made billions. Yes they were excellent, but (except for maybe Trevor) hardly irreplaceable, and myriad engineers played a more important role.
                > they got *paid* peanuts. But

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*

                as long as rockstar is making a dollar on the game, the key contributors should be pulling in some cents too.

so bonkers when redditors stan for gigantic corporations.

                    >what do the stars in a billion dollar movie make? Usually millions.

Yeah but only if they're well known and their name is likely to sell the film. I agree with your point that Vidya actors are underappreciated, but their reputations (unless they've achieved fame in film) almost never contribute to a game's sale.
                        [deleted]
                            Yeah *now* she's worth millions because now she's recognizable. Do you think she got paid more than a mil for the first film? I doubt it. I imagine she got paid less than a quarter mil, as is the norm for unknown leads in indies and horror films.
            That‚Äôs how work for hire works though. Every VA knows that.
        But it‚Äôs the same with a music artist hating their most popular song cause they have to keep performing it & feel they‚Äôve done better since. It‚Äôs no foreign concept and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs grateful, just irritated by aspects of it
        Why is that a problem though? He's far from the only case of an actor hating that they're *only* known for one popular thing, rather than their diverse portfolio that often includes roles they liked more. And many of those would be people getting paid residuals years or even decades after the initial showing.

Steven Ogg does not appear to get residuals, or royalties from this game. He stopped making money the day he recorded his last session. Where did you get the idea he still "expects" to make money from it?
            >Where did you get the idea he still "expects" to make money from it?

When he accepted money on Cameo from people asking him to do a Trevor impersonation for them and instead he took the opportunity to chastise said individuals for not recognizing him as an actor who does other things besides Trevor and refused to do the "impersonation." 

Taking the money and then bitching about it made me lose a ton of respect for him.
                So because he did something on cameo, which is clearly him *not* wanting to be associated with Trevor...that means he still wants to be associated with Trevor?

If he actually just took the money then he'd be shut down. I've read an article about the incident (one incident, btw, you're saying "people" like it's a recurring theme) and the implication is that he did the cameo, he just put the rant in front of it.
    His posts are wild though, I‚Äôve seen some things on his page that I wouldn‚Äôt wish for my worse enemy to see
    Same here, as far as I can tell Steven Ogg is basically Boyd Crowder from Justified, just without the white supremacy and domestic terrorism. He's even got the crazyman hair and blinding smile down pat. 

&#x200B;

But if he did maintain those 2 attributes, I feel like I wouldn't be surprised to find out about it.
Apparently the guy who voiced Franklin also voiced one of the homies of Grove Street in GTA sa. That overweight homie with the green hoodie
    And during friendship activity with Michael Franklin says that he was fat before. I always thought it's a reference to that.
        Damnnnnnnnnnnnn
    Afaik Shawn Fonteno (Franklin's actor) and Young Maylay (CJ's VA) are cousins in real life.
        He was also in The Wash with DJ Pooh as the kidnappers.
        Ahhh, nepotism.  Isn't it wonderful?
    not only that. His cousin is then same guy who voiced CJ in San Andreas(if you guys didn't know about it)
sucks steven is distancing away from v
    I'm happy for him because he's developing an acting career instead of being known as that guy from a videogame.
        Which I think was his hang up. I think he loved playing Trevor but he didn‚Äôt want to be exclusively associated with him. Even though he always will be to a point.
            The shows I‚Äôve seen him in he just plays a downplayed version of Trevor.
                Because so often he gets type casted as a villain. He was unknown before GTA 5 and it will take a very different role for him to break that mould

Aaron Paul will always be Jesse Pinkman

Kit Harington will always be Jon Snow

Some actors can change things up but what made them famous often sticks.
                    Daniel Radcliffe will always be Weird Al Yankovic.
                        You mean that guy from Guns Akimbo? Man, what a chameleon.
                            I think you‚Äôre meaning that guy from Horns
                                Isn't he the little guy from Lord of the Rings?
                                    I think they call them Ewoks
                            Swiss Army Man, really shows his range ü§£
                        Incidentally, I think he purposely went for the most anti-harry potter roles he could find, just so he wouldn't be known as Harry Potter.
                            He was once quoted saying the best thing he bought with his Harry Potter money was his career. He's set for life, so he literally just acts for fun now and exclusively picks roles and movies he has a strong interest in.
                            That‚Äôs called ‚Äúworking against type‚Äù. Will Smith tried to do it with Hancock; when you‚Äôve been typecast as a certain archetype, doing the reverse shows that range.

It‚Äôs like when wrestlers go heel to face also!
                                Yep. Steven Ogg got typecast for a while because of it. I think, he's also frustrated that he can't move on from that sort of role because his most succcessful one is GTAV.
                        Idk man whenever I see him I think if that time he played a magical farting corpse.
                            Fans of *Everything, Everywhere, All At Once* really ought to see *Swiss Army Man* since its by the same Daniels.
                                It even includes a bonus Daniel
                        He also played Sam Houser
                        I think you misspelled *‚Äúa flatulent corpse‚Äù*
                    Jerry Seinfeld will always be Jerry Seinfeld
                    Aaron Paul played Todd in Bojack Horseman, and I didn't realize until my second or third watch. I honestly couldn't tell.
                    So he doesn't want to be associated with trevor but actively chooses roles that have him play trevor-lite. No one is forcing this man to take these roles.
                        Roles that aren‚Äôt exactly what you want are better than no roles I would assume, but I‚Äôm not his manager who knows what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes.
                            He‚Äôs probably just pissed that he‚Äôll forever be known as trailer park trash man instead of Daniel Day Lewis or something. It‚Äôs pretty stupid because at the end of the day it doesn‚Äôt really matter.
                                To him it‚Äôs a big deal. He‚Äôs said himself Trevor is the exact opposite of his personality and that irl he thinks he‚Äôs a pretty nice guy. Imagine you go your whole life not being rude and mean to people unnecessarily but then every time someone recognizes you they want you to call them a slur or scream at them.
                        Money
                    I wonder if he was cast in the walking dead before or after V?
                        It was after, probably by about 3 or 4 years or so iirc.
                            Yeah I just looked up that s7 dropped in 2016 so something like that
                        Before(?)
                            I never followed TWD when it was airing so I wasn't sure
                        I was trying to figure out how the protagonist from Cyberpunk 2077 fit into all of this before I realized you guys are just shortening GTAV. 


Jesus
                    Chris evans as captain America and Tom Middleton as Loki
                Yep. Simon (The Walking Dead) was basically Trevor if Trevor didn‚Äôt mind taking orders
                    His character in Better Call Saul is Trevor if he was a bit more cleaned up.
                >The shows I‚Äôve seen him in he just plays a downplayed version of Trevor.

Because he's not really that good of an actor. He has basically the one performance that he can do, and a few variations on that same performance, and that's it. Every character he ends up playing just becomes Trevor.
                THIS.
        Yeah, he was great in Better Call Saul.
            Shhhh careful saying that. Some people on this sub think because he hasn't got a role bigger than Trevor then he doesn't have an acting career.
                How long was his arc on Better Call Saul? Let me know how that is a bigger role than Trevor. I‚Äôll wait.
                    Fuck you got me I guess he doesn't have an acting career.
                        Just pointing out the flawed argument. Trevor is still his biggest role and it‚Äôs not even close.
                            You should've kept reading what I posted. I acknowledge Trevor is his biggest role but people on this sub think that means he doesn't have an acting career.
                    How long was his arc? Bro, use proper industry terminology lmao. He was BILLED/(hired) as a guest star, which has limited episode appearances as opposed to recurring or a series regular. 

And that character arc was him trying to show up Mike and being humbled by the end of the scene. That‚Äôs a literal character arc. Source: Syd Fields
        What acting career? Dude was in two shows and basically played the same character in both. He should be thankful for GTA and take advantage of it.
            Yeah he's not a leading man but he's been getting consistent work (more than the two shows you've seen. Check his imdb). I think that qualifies as a career. As oppose to say doing a voice for a video game character then just doing conventions and tik tok videos for the next 10 years.
                Say the line Bart.
                    You forgot a thou-
                        ![gif](giphy|G9Kj87gLF8Z4A)
                Exactly. People seem to think that if you‚Äôre not headlining a show as an actor than that automatically means you‚Äôre not doing anything. I‚Äôm glad Ogg is doing stuff instead of riding the convention train but more power to Luke and Fonteno if they want to do that .
                    Reminds me of Kirsten Dunst in an interview a few years back: Where they asked her where‚Äôs she been and she‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been in a bunch of stuff. It‚Äôs not like you have to be in major blockbusters for every movie
                Exactly, if I was Steven I‚Äôd pursue my own career too instead of the other route.
                Ehhh i wouldn‚Äôt say consistent. He hasn‚Äôt actually done all thar much but he appeared in some big shows/films in the last 2 years that rated well. But as i said to someone else, Steven doesn‚Äôt care all thar much about all about the role of Trevor. It was clearly just another job to him but it did well for him. He is a bit crazy it seems judging by his Instagram but he does have his own business and does have a cameo too. Though he isn‚Äôt the first actor to be known for one thing and just completely forget about it after a period of time has gone by, look at Daniel Radcliffe, that dude has done everything he possibly can to avoid being only represented as Harry Potter even though it will ONLY be his most famous role
            He's been in 26 films and 17 TV shows what the fuck are you talking about?
                He's been in Witness Protection from a certain australian who is known for a lack of sleeves and paying seven hundred and two dollars for a big mac.
                They mean the stuff that they watch. Regulars ever accounts indie work as actual work
            Do you think all actors are major movie stars?
            Just because someone wasn't in some big budget marvel movie doesn't mean they dont have a career
            I think he is thankful for sure. Between the shows I've seen him in (The Walking Dead, Better Call Saul, and Westworld) you're right that he's played a very similar, unhinged asshole kind of character. Each has been similar to Trevor in their own right, but I think he's an actor that doesn't want to be pigeonholed by a single role. Similar to Rainn Wilson and Dwight. They're thankful for the fans and the experience of the role, but they don't want to be "known" as Dwight or Trevor. They want to be known for their work.
            He can do whatever he wants
            2 shows that you‚Äôve saw. He‚Äôs got a lot in the pipeline as well. Just because he wants to distance himself from it doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt thankful.
                Is he thankful though? He set up a cameo, and when people told him to act like Trevor he was a huge jerk and got annoyed. Like why even accept that then, what else were people going to request? He obviously has an ego problem and some extremely negative view of the video game industry as an art medium.

Only role anyone else knows him for is that tiny one in better call Saul and Simon in walking dead.
                    Yep. Dude is a straight up asshole.
                        Bit harsh.
                            I can only go by from what I‚Äôve seen of him in interviews and such. Maybe he‚Äôs a great dude but he doesn‚Äôt have a favorable image to his biggest fan base.
                    He was in westworld and boiling point as well off the top off my head. About the cameo thing, haven‚Äôt seen it, but wasn‚Äôt Trevor a huge jerk and got really annoyed?
                        Yeah but he was genuinely pissed for the cameo, it wasn‚Äôt acting or a part of it

https://youtu.be/nK_EpVPHPF0?feature=shared
                    Probably wanted people to think he, himself was cool and impressive, not just his character he plays idk
                    Trevor is one of the most mediocre characters in the history of gta, and you just like him because of the surprise factor and the contrast with the other two boring clich√©s, I can see how you can get to hate playing such a character, even Claude is much more interesting, and he doesn't even need to talk.
            Exactly. The dude has NO versatility in his acting. He gets on these shows and acts exactly like Trevor then has the audacity to get upset at people for thinking he‚Äôs some great actor. Dude just whines about it he sucks
            I didn't even know that guy was Trevor. You'd be surprised out how many people don't play GTAV, or only played through it, put it away, and never thought about it again.

I'm sure he is thankful for GTA, maybe not so thankful for the people that think if he doesn't pop into his Trevor character whenever they see him he's an asshole.
            But window licking morons shouldn't be calling him Trevor when meeting him in person because that's not his name üôÑ I'd find it irritating too.
            This kind of ignorant arrogance from the community is why he's in the right for distancing himself.
            Someone whos never heard of typecasting i see
            Shut up, idiot.
        I think he didn't know how much of an impact that game was going to have on his career. And when you get overshadowed by your own self and find it hard to get a career because you're known as the Trevor guy I could see how that could be aggravating.
        Yeah but he‚Äôs being a complete dick about it by borderline mocking fans who talk to him about it
            I'll agree that's not cool. But I wonder how long he had to deal with belligerent fans before he had enough or maybe he was always a dick.
                You should never mock your fans in that line of work people like Steven need to realise that it‚Äôs partly the fans who made us career and got him famous and he may not like being Trevor but he should still realise that‚Äôs what made him and that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs most known for
                    The ironic part is him being a dick to fans is a Trevor move.
                        While that is true it doesn‚Äôt make it right or maybe one day he‚Äôll come out and say that he was just acting the entire time
        what do you think was more popular . gta 5 or the walking dead tv show
            Gta 5
            I'm not debating which is more popular. I'm giving him credit for not sitting back and riding the gta 5 popularity. He's out trying to work.
            I mean, Walking Dead is pretty huge.
                thats why i think ogg has been established as an actor . he was in the show awhile ago .
                    Oh I apologize I thought you were making the opposite point.
        You can still keep up with your older work and still progress your career. The fact is Steven just doesn‚Äôt care enough about his role as Trevor. And if you have seen his Instagram, you would see he has gone a bit doolally wile also running his own business of sorts. He does have a cameo though so it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if he does do Trevor content on there.
        How is that a bad thing?
        What acting career never seen him on anything except you tube where he cry‚Äôs about being asked to play Trevor
            Ah so because youve never seen him on anything that means he's not acting. I've never seen an Alfred Hitchcock movie so I guess he's not a director.
                But you know who he is like everybody does next to no one knows who Steven ogg is who hasn‚Äôt played gta
                    So he's not a big name. Doesn't mean he's not working.
                        Still only known for Trevor
                            Still acting...
    He's not obliged to be enthusiastic about a video game he did ten years ago.
    In fairness he must find it annoying to just be known as Trevor.
        He‚Äôs lucky he‚Äôs known for anything. Fame is fame.
            Are you joking.  Do you seriously not know who Stephen Ogg is?
        He's a great actor that's been in several major shows and movies, wtf are y'all talking about?
            That's the issue, GTA made him be known as Trevor Phillips when I think, at the end of the day, he just wants to be known as Steven Ogg and not constantly hounded for Trevor quotes. I think, he enjoyed being trevor for the first few years but got fed up with the constantly requests to tell people to fuck off or act like Trevor when he has moved on.

Though, the cameo stuff is a bit iffy.
                He can be Steven Ogg all he wants.  His problem is that nobody cares and he's bitter about it.
        He was a nobody before trevor.
            He was in 7 films and 4 shows before Trevor. Just because that's the role you know him most as doesn't mean he needs to hold that role up amongst all the others.  He's a working actor and owes you And GTA nothing.
                He doesn't owe me shit but acting like he was al pacino before gta is delusional. He owes everything to gta.

>7 films and 4 shows

Basically nothing and guess what he played the exact same character 12 times including gta.
                    Ahh so you're now claiming to have seen all of his roles.  You're a joke and I'm out.

Also GTA is a blip on his career. Not all actors are stars.  But he's been a successful working actor for decades.
                        Oh fuck off he was no al pacino before he still isn't. He is just some asshole who yells at people because to his surprise people know him as one of the most popular character ever created.
                            The fact that I say working actor and Al Pacino is the only guy you think of shows you don't know enough about the industry to have this conversation. 

Have a good one dude.  You'll laugh at this when you grow up.
                                I was saying al pacino because you know scarface.

Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, Christian Bale, Ryan Reynolds anybody on game of thrones when it aired are vastly more succesful than him and still working. He is an asshole with nothing significant except gta.
                                    Not a single one of those people is what the industry calls a "working actor". Thank you for confirming you don't know what you're talking about.  I'm out.
                    He owes absolutely nothing to GTA or to GTA fans. He's a human being.
                        He owes his fame and a shit ton of money he got from rockstar for that project. I don't mean he should actually give money to people but he is standing on that and you know it as well.
                            lol Knowing how R* pays their VA‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not so sure about that
                                Yeah I exaggerated about a shit tone lets say a fairly good amount due to residual and along the fame he got. Whether he likes it or not he owes his popularity to gta he should stop acting like an asshole saying he doesn't like it and then post nasty shit on ig just like trevor would. Both actors for Michael and Franklin says this too.
    He always has been, he says he never played GTA V and never will cause he‚Äôs not a gamer. People were constantly degrading him by calling him Trevor, it‚Äôs understandable he doesn‚Äôt want to be seen in the same light
    Why does it suck? It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre doing any DLC for the game or that his character is going to show up in GTA6. They aren‚Äôt doing any press tours or media events for GTA5. The game came out over a decade ago. Why on earth would it matter in the slightest if the voice actor for Trevor doesn‚Äôt want to somehow be ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù with a game that isn‚Äôt doing ANYTHING new?

The obsession with the voice actor ‚Äúdistancing‚Äù himself from GTA5 is fucking weird lmao. No ones freaking out that the voice actors for ‚ÄúA Bugs Life‚Äù aren‚Äôt actively talking about that film every chance they get more than 25 years after it came out
    Is he? Just googled him and went back through about a years worth of news articles about it and I can‚Äôt find anything?
    He‚Äôs a cartoon now
    The comments ITT are sending me! ü§£

"He's no longer Trevor! He's building an acting career! He's been in dozens of productions already!"

"Yeah, like...?"

"Uhh... Look at his IMDB!"
    he's a moron. if he just embraced that people love him as trevor he could probably come back as a side character or even the villain of GTA 7
Not sure if this is a well known fact, but the actor who plays Franklin is older than the actor who plays Trevor
    Black don't crack
        But that hairline go back.
            Man that shits whack

I believe Steven Ogg did like playing Trevor, but he hates simply being known as Trevor and having GTA fans come up to him and act like Trevor for them. Ned and Shawn are more than fine simply being known as Michael and Franklin and love to interact with the community. Hell. both of them have played the game they've starred in (Ogg has not, he admits he is not a gamer).
    I think that's the case. I think, Steven said in an interview, he got fed up because he never gets asked to say anything nice whilst the other two gets asked to do all sorts of nice stuff. He is just asked to tell people to fuck off or go on a rant when really, he just wants to say something nice. NOT expensive.
        Oh fuck off steven ogg. boo hoo you signed up for a massive role as a mean crazy guy and you‚Äôre surprised that‚Äôs how people know you.
            [removed]
                Well maybe he shouldn't portray himself that way in every piece of media he's involved with including his own deranged social media. Guy is unintentionally stuck playing Trevor. His fault.
                    Still no reason to be rude
                        Tell him that. He thinks games are for nerds and losers. Fuck this douchebag ass actor that can only play one role
                            Again, no reason to be rude
                                No reason not to... guys making money and never gonna see it who gives a fuck
                                    Meh
Even steven doesnt like trevor he still acts like him in the videos he post online
    He has been getting weirder and weirder on IG lol. And people make Trevor comments because it truly is how Trevor would act.
        Maybe he‚Äôs doing an Andy Kaufman and cultivating a persona to openly troll people with.
            I hope so. But it is kind of sad that Ned Luke and Shawn Fonteno no longer follow Steven Ogg on IG and vice versa. It has been going on for a while but last time I checked Steve and Shawn were still following each other but not anymore. I understand not wanting to ge typecast but to have disdain for a character you portrayed is odd to me.
                I think he posted about some mental health stuff on Twitter back in 2017-2018. I don't about the ig stuff but that's a thing too.
                    Some of his posts are concerning....his mannerisms, the way he talks. As someone who faces severe depression every now and then, I guess I can kind of see it in him. Or he is that good of an actor.
        I had to go check it out based on what others have said about it too. It's got like borderline schizo energy. I wonder if Ogg is doing okay. I feel bad for the guy being so widely known as only Trevor. But at the same time, he did such a killer job that it's almost impossible to not be associated with such a huge character. 

I was really excited to see him on Better Call Saul even though it was brief.
            I too am a bit concerned about his mannerisms and body language in some of his posts. Either that or he is just that good of an actor. 

Loved his minor appearance in Better Call Saul. Also The Walking Dead declined but I watched the episodes he was in and he was great, even in the Negan spinoffs. He is a great actor with a lot of potential and I wish him the best.
                Yeah, for all we know, it could be a huge trolling thing. Or it could be performance art. Who really knows but him?

I never watch Walking Dead so I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. Lol
                    In The Walking Dead (show declined but I kept watching for some reason), Steven Ogg plays the right-hand man of a major villain and it was great. He pretty much out-villains the main villain. Pretty much a more serious, more evil Trevor lol.
                        Oh dang. That sounds badass haha. I just don't know if I could get into the Walking Dead. I'm not really into the whole zombie thing.
        He Calls it art. Which I can see.
Steven Ogg can do whatever he wants, but i just hope he doesn't decline an offer if Rockstar wants to bring back Trevor in the future
    Steven and Ned both came back in rdr2 for minor roles so for sure they probably will no doubt if Rockstar ask them too
        Wait who were they?
        Ogg never actually was in the game
>[ogg](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Laramie_gang_leader#:~:text=Despite%20speculation%20that%20the%20Laramie,did%20not%20voice%20the%20character.)
            That wasn't Steven Ogg
                that's what I meant, the website I linked talks about how it's not him lol
        Actually no he didn't it's a common misconception simply because the voice sounds similar but that guy in the RDR 2 epilogue isn't Steven ogg
        Did they do new roles or like ancestors of their GTA V characters?
            new roles.
    Rockstar very rarely brings mainline characters back, they might get a brief cameo see Johnny K from GTA IV in GTA V. But even if they wanted to bring Trevor back in any capacity I doubt Steven Ogg would be open to it.
        They brought Claude back in San Andreas and had multiple missions relating around him
            "***rarely***" not never.
                Victor

And Johnny

I just realized that most times when rockstar brings back protagonists from previous games it's normally to kill them off
    I rather him get replaced and Trevor carry a voice box! That would be a legendary fuck you by rockstar to the man who hates Trevor
    I hope exactly for that. Trevor represents everything wrong with writing in GTAV. Inconsistant mess for cheap memes sake.
        Wdym? If you mean his unhinged-ness, it was there to show how dangerous Trevor coming back into Michael's life was- at any minute, Trevor could find out Michael's lies and do something to put his family in danger. It also served as a contrast where somehow, the most dangerous and off the handle character was the most loyal.
There you have it, ending A is canon.
Michael got younger
    somehow michael looks more like michael the older he got
[deleted]
    The actors for CJ and Niko have both said they feel they deserve residual payments since the games were so successful and they played a big part in that. I think Steven probably feels a bit like that.

He was probably the most popular/impactful character in the biggest entertainment product of all time and was universally praised for his acting. And made like 100k for it. 

When an actor stars in a movie that makes $1 billion that usually gives them a lot of money and work offers. That didn't seem to happen for Steve.
Steven just doesn't like being type casted.
    From the actors perspective I get that. But that‚Äôs what happens when you give literally one of the best performances in one of the top selling single pieces of media of all time. 

I don‚Äôt think ogg really understands just how popular gta is, then again Trevor is literally a terrible human being and not the best person to be associated with. I hope he lands a major role in something he‚Äôs truly passionate about.
        It‚Äôs because he‚Äôs one of those Gen Xers that just doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù video games so he doesn‚Äôt respect it as a media form. I think he said as much himself that he doesn‚Äôt understand why people would ‚Äúsit in front of a TV and play a cartoon instead of doing something else‚Äù. My dad is about his age and is the same way.
            It‚Äôs kinda funny that his job literally requires people to sit in front of a TV tho lol
            Imagine claiming Gen X doesn't get videogames
                Most do, but there‚Äôs still a decent subset of them that just don‚Äôt- which makes sense because they‚Äôre the last generation alive that didn‚Äôt really have more the immersive games in their childhood like we all got from like 2000 onwards. 

Listen to Steven himself if you don‚Äôt believe me: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8sHaUYD/
                    My sibling in Christ, we literally grew up playing Atari, Coleco, Nintendo, Sega, PlayStation, Xbox, suped up PCs, every possible chance we got, not to mention all the quarters we spent at video arcades. Even older 1960s-born Gen X were hip to the latest video game tech. I absolutely can NOT with this
                         Well I didn‚Äôt say EVERY Gen Xer did I? I said a subset of you all- SOME of you. My father was born in 68 and is just like Steven in terms of seeing games as child‚Äôs toys.

Whereas for the 30 and younger crowd, video games are almost a universal activity- I would wager it‚Äôs probably like over 90% of the <30 crowd regularly play  games to like 60% of Gen Xers or something, just guessing.
                        And the people who did that shit back then were called nerds, losers, and bullied because of it. Just because it existed back then doesn‚Äôt mean everyone who lived concurrently accepted or understood it.
    Steven basically is Trevor though.
Steven: I don't want to be known as Trevor

Steven: Does Trevor activity on ig
Steven don‚Äôt wanna be known as Trevor, can‚Äôt blame him tbf üò¨
Looks like Ned Luke got himself a hair transplant from that GTA V money.
Steven ogg isn‚Äôt the first nor the last actor to want to distance themself from a role because of type casting and who gets annoyed at always being attached to said character ‚Äúbut he was a nobody‚Äù ‚Äúthat role made him‚Äù I mean it definitely put him on the map but if he‚Äôs outgrown the schtick let him be, if I was always seen as one role and wanted a more serious direction in my career I‚Äôd be mad too.
    it‚Äôs more the disrespect he casts on it. steven ogg didn‚Äôt have to play trevor phillips, he could‚Äôve turned the role down. he did because he knew it would be a launch pad for his career, which it was. he got typecast, which happens to every actor. he dislikes his typecast, and places the blame on GTA as a whole, taking any chance he can to shit talk it, up to and including taking peoples money on cameo. 

GTA was absolutely all three protagonists launch off point, and they wouldn‚Äôt be where they are without it. you don‚Äôt have to love your character, but that deserves respect
        I mean no he didn‚Äôt have to play Trevor but I can‚Äôt image he fore saw how his character would take off. 

I‚Äôm not saying I agree with him basically saying fuck off to the character as someone whose been a fan of Trevor but looking at it from an objective standpoint i do get why he isn‚Äôt too fond of the character after a decade and wanting to move on. 

Hell there was even a point Toby Maguire hated being attached to Spider-Man but came around on his own free will. 

We can‚Äôt make the man like the role he played and I‚Äôll even play devils advocate and say he doesn‚Äôt owe it to anyone to do so. 

He ain‚Äôt the first gta voice actor who had beef with the role / company later down the line (ray liotta) he might not be the last either and at this point we gotta separate the art from the artist.

I can enjoy Trevor and just not attach it to Steven because while he was the voice and model he‚Äôs not him and has moved on in his career which he deserves to do. 

He ain‚Äôt the first typecast actor to end up hating the character that put him on the map and he is far from the last.

Who knows maybe in the future with enough time he‚Äôll come back around to the character but regardless I appreciate Trevor as a character and I‚Äôm glad steven was apart of the game, I don‚Äôt think anyone else could of delivered the level of unhinged needed like he did lol
            The fella who played Obi Wan in the original Star Wars was warned that he would be known for it. He got annoyed that people overlooked his other works.
    What do you mean he's "outgrown" the role? What other things has he been in that aren't just a watered down Trevor? I understand not wanting to be known as just Trevor, but the guy acts like he's going to be a major heart throb in a movie anytime soon. What does he expect?
Wait what‚Äôs the issue with Trevor not being there? Is it beef? Or he just doesn‚Äôt care to be there?
    Steven Ogg (Trevor) is actively distancing himself from the character of Trevor to try and avoid being type cast or just known as Trevor. As far as I know he‚Äôs not on bad terms with the voice actors of Michael and Franklin.
        Ah okay - thanks for filling me in, had no idea he felt that way.
        Lol stevens actually coming back at a game expo with Ned and Shawn ppl need to stay up to date
    The actor Steven is distancing himself from the franchise. He doesn‚Äôt like being known as ‚Äúthat gta guy Trevor‚Äù
Next time I play GTA5, I'm choosing the option to kill Trevor
steven ogg is one of the lamest guys. dude is mad that one of the character's he's played is beloved? wtf
Yes because i killed trevor in gta5
Imagine not wanting to be associated with one of the greatest pieces of media in the history of the world lol this is Terrance Howard walking away from marvel levels of unawareness
    It's completely understandable not to want people calling you the name of a character you played or asking you to act like said character for them. I believe he once said that he disliked that the other main characters' actors get requests to do nice things, while he mostly gets requests to act like Trevor, so aka be a dick. 

You are the one that has a terminal case of unawareness if you can't understand why he doesn't like being known as trevor.
        Sure thing Trev
Now and then

I miss you

Oh, now and then

I want you to be there for me
So ending A was canonical?
Honestly... being a voice actor for an installment in the GTA franchise is kind of a career killer in a way. On its face, it seems like the opportunity of a lifetime, right? 

But how can Roger Clark or Ned luke or rob wiethoff ever really do any voice acting again? They are so iconic in their roles, unless they can do really different accents, you will always hear Arthur Morgan in anything else Roger Clark does, you'll always hear John marston in any role Rob wiethoff takes. I guess it's not impossible but their rockstar roles would be a constant distraction in anything else they do going forward. 

It's kind of a double edged sword in the long term. On the one hand, millions and millions of people recognize you for your big role! On the other hand, *millions and millions of people will recognize you for your big role. And only that role.*

People don't typically watch a movie for example for as many hours as they play a vidja game. Sure some people may watch a movie 12 times a year maybe, but gamers spend hundreds sometimes thousands of hours in a video game universe, hearing and controlling a character. Voice actors for triple A games get engraved in your memory in a way that movie actors typically do not just by sheer amount of time spent with the character. 

I've played gtav for 100s of hours, I can't say I've watched any movie for hundreds of hours in total. 

In short, being a big time voice actor for games is a perfect recipe for getting typecast forever.
    Good voice actors will be able to do mutiple people without someone knowing. The Mario voice actors is an example of that
        For real, I was shocked when I found out that he was the voice of paarthurnax in Skyrim
Ned kinda look like he aged backwards if he didn't have that grey hair
Ogg was one of the protagonists in the most successful piece of media ever created and still brushes it off like video games are something only super nerds partake in like some 80‚Äôs stereotype
He went Vinewood on everyone.
Steven can‚Äôt comprehend video games at all and it‚Äôs annoying lol
I guess killing Trevor was the right ending
I understand that he wants to be recognized as himself but he also should understand that no one knew who he was before GTAV
Scre2 Steven Ogg. Dude is an egotistical douche bag
Ned Luke is certainly ‚Äòwanted‚Äô on Twitter right now after the recent AI drama.
    Pls someone explain
        He was [defending AI art](https://x.com/ned_luke/status/1749222539161653458?s=46&t=XZMzrBA_-x-90DRCAvWuQQ) and people called him out for it.
            Ai art really isn't a bad thing like maybe if a guys disabled he could use it or someone who sucks at drawing but has a great imagination and ai art makes it come true so it's not completely bad ü§∑
            Huh, okay
Steven Ogg managed to build himself a good career after GTA V. The Walking Dead, Westworld and other roles in various movies and series.

He was always open about not being into video games himself, I think it's fair enough. He has done his job well and moved on. Not every actor needs to be in love with every role of theirs.
He forgor
It‚Äôs because the guy hates his character it‚Äôs not who he is so people ask him to beat the shit out of them or like piss on their face something like that he just doesn‚Äôt like it
that means the ending where we kill trevor is canon
I guess Franklin picked A
Ok, its mean that right choice is for Trevor die.
Under Armour!
Dude no way Steven Ogg turned into a micüò≠
Who tf choose option A?
Steven Ogg, hates being seen as Trevor from Gta, cause thats where he literally recognized the most from. He wants to be seen for himself as a actor and not for just that one role from over 10 years ago, understand why he isn't there now
Current cast is the skeleton crew operating our drip fed dlc.   


So like, the guy voicing Pavel and Amal.
Sucks that Steven Ogg hates that chapter of his life
Yeah Steven Ogg just doesn't only want his career to be known for GTA 5. But it shouldn't matter as it's just one piece of his career.
What happend to trev
Ned grew hair
I can't believe they 50, 55 and 65 years old.
What happened to that famous voice actor Trevor from that cartoon GTA?
Steven the only one that let gta go
Is that the OG milf hunter?
ned luke looks like he deaged by 10 years lol
Ending A moment
Rest in peace Steven Ogg‚Ä¶..gone but never forgotten
Proof that Something Sensible is the canon ending of GTA V.
I didn‚Äôt know they casted Jon Cena into GTA üòé
Then need to totally make a movie version with them. Or a show
Did Trevor die?
People shit on Steven for the truly unforgivable crime of not being deeply in love with this one role he did over a decade ago but if we're being really honest...Ned and Solo have nothing else going on in their careers so I'm not surprised they've thrown themselves into milking the GTA thing. 

Steven is hardly one of Hollywood's biggest stars but he's had stable, consistent work on all sorts of shows for years now. The combination of actually having a worthwhile career and not being a gamer makes it unlikely that he would want to milk it dry the way the others do. That's not even a dis against Ned and Shawn but literally what else are they doing right now?
I feel bad for Steven, he's been a dick sometimes about GTA for sure, but I can't really blame him.

Ask Young Malay what it's like having douchey fans always spewing memes at you.  Don't actually ask him that though
Sad to see Trevor got stuck hustling in the Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul universe.
I really don't blame Steven Ogg for getting fed up with people asking him to be Trevor or calling him Trevor. He never got asked to say something nice or do nice things. The other two? They got to be nice, be asked to be heartwarming and aren't referred to as Micheal and Franklin. Steven? Trevor. Even in other roles he did prior to GTA.

Fans would just constantly call him it and he just snapped. I think, he terminated his contract with Rockstar because of it.
i think the steven is just butthurt he doesnt know video games and expected an oscar for his portrayal as Trevor. when he found out its a video game he disconnected all ties.
Fuck Travors actor and his lame acting career! He thinks he‚Äôs above gta
Better for it.
I guess to took the option to kill Trevor
"The way i see it man, you gonna get us all fucking killed-"
Steven Ogg is not Trevor you guys, he‚Äôs not a cartoon üòÇ
I think their supposed to do a tour this year in ign interview they talked about how shocked they were seven og even got on board so stop the narrative 
He def doesn‚Äôt like being called Trevor tho lmfao
I miss ogg, wish he was still between us
Steven is not dead by the way he's just busy with other stuff (and doesn't want to be remembered ONLY as Trevor).
Ogg really got the shortest stick playing this barely likeable character. No wonder he wants to distance himself from the cartoon
Its good to see that steven stepped back from gta 5 and pursed onto other projects
that guy trevor is a dumb prick. how u gonna hate the only thing that ever made u relevant lmao dickweed
Where's Steven
Cos time
Trevor‚Äôs not going to be in GTA6‚Ä¶
Is Steven Ogg dead or did I totally miss the joke?

&#x200B;

I feel like I did miss the joke.
Sucks that Steven Ogg won't return to GTA. I enjoyed playing as Trevor!
He dead?
Bro I thought he died fucking hell I need a moment
The look better now than they did then
DAMMIT MAN, I thought Ogg died or something.
I guess someone chose option B
Dammit, Franklin. You chose Option A.
Steve was sick of gta I guess
Where the fuck is Trevor you divvy
Looking forward to seeing the three at Comic Con in a couple months. Was really surprised to see Steven Ogg would appear.
Steven is normal in real life lol. He and I are regulars at the same bar.
I love to think the names of the anniversary outfits are subtle jabs at Steven. Michael‚Äôs is like the professional or something franklins is the homie and Trevor‚Äôs is the groupie lmao
It's sad that he hate being associated with Trevor, I would have expected that from Micah Bell's actor who got a lot of hating during those years from the stupids, but Trevor was very loved
**Why are there only two of them? What happened to Steven?**
Would not be surprised if Trevor gets killed in the beginning of GTA 6 in either the worst or most embarrassing way.
    Hopefully. He‚Äôs such an overrated character and it annoys me when people theorize he killed Niko Niko would wreck Trevor. Trevor‚Äôs some annoying asshole who screams a lot. Nikos a trained soldier in a real direct combat war. Niko would decimate him in any form of fighting. 

Yes, I know Trevor flew. In the Candian Airforce. Might as well be in the National Guard when it comes to actual ground combat.
Damn, they chose option B.
Steven?
Soo, option A is also canon?
Immortality achieved
Bro shouldn't look like Trevor and take roles for Trevor style characters if he doesn't like it
Hey it‚Äôs Steven Ogg next to Franklin and Micheal! Fr though  I saw a video and it‚Äôs Ned Luke talking about how he wouldn‚Äôt be where he is today without the fans ‚ù§Ô∏è he disagrees with Mr. Ogg. I get it though you want to be known for your acting career especially if that‚Äôs what you do. Video games still isn‚Äôt getting the recognition and respect so being known as a video game character is a knock on you but they weren‚Äôt voice actors. They are in the video game the characters in the game is to mimic the actors they are supposed to represent. Steven is in the game, he‚Äôs just called Trevor and not Steven. I bet if they named the characters, Steven, and Shawn he wouldn‚Äôt mind it.
they picked A
Michael looks much younger somehow
This makes it look like steven died lol
Ill always think of Steven Ogg was 70% Trevor, 20% Simon from TWD, and 10% that one appearance in BetterCallSaul.
Steven Hollywood but Ned did the Bron and grew a hairline.
Lamar is better and more successful anyway
Steven ironically hates the very character that garnered his fame in the first place

He‚Äôs slowly becoming him too
The canon ending
The destiny raid team when one decides to play he will just playing be COD forever cause destiny is a cartoon
Someone went to Turkey for hair implants
Heard that Ned Luke got into some drama on Twitter apparently defending the use of AI
Ogg ant even dead

![gif](giphy|74xVEuCoCYbAs)
Well, he's done other stuff. He's even said he's not a gamer, so it was just a job to him. Just because it means a lot to gamers constantly being called a character link to a media he doesn't particularly like is annoying, especially when you do other shit. This "i know you as this person, so I'm gonna call you that person" is disrespectful. He clearly doesn't like it and asks for it to stop, but doing so still is basically saying screw what you want
Steven Ogg doesn't even like video games. Plus he's and actor who knows that it would end his career if he sticks to one thing over and over. 

His mentality for doing a "Cartoon Character" actually worked out a lot and a genius move.

What I wish is that he could of seen GTA 5 as an in for more video games roles. It just a different branch of entertainment. He may not like playing video games, but he can sure act in one.
No shot that he doesn‚Äôt return in gta6. No shot
oh jesus christ. i thought steven ogg was dead. don‚Äôt do that
Yo who the fuck chose A
the dude who voices Michael looks like he actually got younger somehow
I‚Äôm saying option A was the canon ending
What Steven Ogg not being there now tells me that he only did it for the money and the 15 minutes of fame, and not 'cause he had a passion for video game voice acting or the GTA franchise as a whole.
    Which is fine
But Steven Ogg will still do personalized cameo videos acting like Trevor
Wtf happened to Trevor
Ogg is too famous to hang out now. =[
Yo
Wassud y‚Äôall
They picked option B
I get why Ogg hates that people only associate him with Trevor, but it‚Äôs just typical of other actors too, people will remember them for what they enjoyed them in or what was a big hit. 

It‚Äôs like Daniel Radcliffe being Harry Potter, RDJ as Stark, Hemsworth as Thor, Kit Harrington as Jon Snow etc etc. I still remember Ogg as Trevor but also Simon from The Walking Dead. It‚Äôs like thinking of Patrick Stewart as Professor X but some people will think of him as Picard or Ian McKellen as Magneto or Gandalf.

Point being, it‚Äôs understandable he gets annoyed by it, but on the other hand it should be expected as it‚Äôs just so common, no point him getting so bent out of shape about it.

[deleted]
    That's what upsets him. In his mind he's supposed to be a "real actor" and not a cartoon or whatever tf he calls it.
        Well, he is a real actor. GTA was a high profile job but it was just that, a job. Some actors want to be known for their body of work because we train in different disciplines to show off that range. Some like being one hit wonders, some don‚Äôt. 

Especially screen actors. I don‚Äôt think gamers should take that as an insult anymore than a coworker who likes their job is offended by someone resigning
            Fair but unfortunately for him he got involved in one of the like 3 most popular single game titles of all time lmao
            LOL he‚Äôs no damn actor! Ray liotta was an actor
                Ogg‚Äôs performance as Trevor is a million times what Liotta‚Äôs as Tommy was. Love Tommy and Liotta but the dude is so checked out in VC (starts showing more enthusiasm after shakedown though)
                    Who was Tommy‚Äôs competition? A mute cluade‚Ä¶ pretty sure if Tommy was a methed out over the top character with as much dialogue as Trevor, ray liotta would of done a better job simply because he‚Äôs the better actor
                        I mean to my point, Tommy kinda already IS an over the top maniac, it just doesn‚Äôt always come across. He‚Äôs one of the most evil GTA protags (next to Trevor and maybe Toni C) and one of the only ones to show no form of remorse whatsoever. The game literally ends with him calling himself a mass murdering psychotic killer with a big cheese-eating grin on his face watching the sunset (it‚Äôs fucking hysterical, and perfect for the game‚Äôs themes for the record)

But he doesn‚Äôt always come across that way because half the time Liotta‚Äôs screaming his angry lines like a maniac (as he should imo) and the other half it sounds like he‚Äôs been at the nyquil. Tommy‚Äôs calm wise-guy thing is only surface deep. He‚Äôs clearly fiercely intelligent but his uncontrollable rage makes him slightly unhinged
                        I won‚Äôt argue with you that Liotta is the better actor, but Liotta didn‚Äôt respect the material enough to do anything more than royally phone it in, regardless of what he was given to work with.
        Yeah it‚Äôs actually so disrespectful towards the gaming industry tbh
            [deleted]
                Stop disrespecting my vidya gane, Steve üò°üò°üò°
        If he wanted to be a "real actor" why the hell would he take a job as a voice actor?
    He sees himself as an artist and one body of work being recognized over the rest is seen as an insult to the rest of their work. It‚Äôs in the same vein as the disdain Thom Yorke holds for the song ‚ÄúCreep‚Äù.
        Or how Alec Guinness felt about Star Wars.
            Alex Guinness is fantastic in Lawrence of Arabia.
                I thought he was great in the role of Marley‚Äôs ghost in Scrooge as well
                    It's so rare for someone to reference that particular version of A Christmas Carol!
            Toss Ford in too. Dude hates star wars lol
                He doesn‚Äôt hate Star Wars, just doesn‚Äôt like how they handled it and Han after the first movie more than anything. Definitely doesn‚Äôt hate it like Alec Guinness lol
                At least he's also Indy. He's known for *two* acts of work.
            Didn't stop him from making a ton of money on the movie
        There's a really good video where they play Creep in 2016, and the lead guitarist has this horrified look on his face because nobody told him they were doing it.
        I've heard Kenny Loggins never accepted being the guy who did Danger Zone and loathes that it's his #1 song. Makes sense I guess, he was just the performer for a track made by the movie studio, but being the guy behind Footloose or Caddyshack isn't any better to me.
        Yeah, I don't understand people who hate on him
    What makes you think he doesn't "accept" that? I'm sure he's well aware of it, he just has other things to do instead

Just because he's not still focusing his career on a project he worked on 12 years ago, doesn't mean he doesn't appreciate the impact it had on his life
        He had some cameos recently where people asked him to essentially play Trevor in the cameo, and he was clearly not into it and throwing shade at the request, saying Trevor is a cartoon character. That's probably what they're referring to
            Eh, that‚Äôs also his sense of humour, based on previous interviews with him. Plus, it‚Äôs logical that he doesn‚Äôt care much to imitate a performance he did once 12 years ago
                He took money for doing a half assed comission in which he complained about being remebered as Trevor for like 5 minutes. He shouldn't take the money if he doesn't like it
    Not going to say that being in GTA didn't help him, but he did other stuff, and for me, he is Simon from the walking dead. As much as his likeness is in the game, his actual face was in the show. You hear KJ Simmons in BG3 and probably you are gonna spot his voice at any time, Jason Isaacs is in that too, and didn't notice... I was like "damn this guy sounds familiar".
        That's fair but he 100% got that roll in TWD because of gta
    Gta 5 was a decade ago, and Steven is an actor. You wouldn't still call Andrew Garfield Spiderman, right? I think we can give him the respect he deserves by acknowledging the amazing performance he did and allowing him to be an actor and not The guy who plays Trevor.
    Insufferable account
I come to write this
Yeh. Dude that played Franklin said Steven Ogg gets pissed off whenever someone calls him Trevor. I get it, but it‚Äôs inevitable so you might as well own it.
    Ask him that question again in 15 years, he‚Äôll be telling everyone!
        Books by Stephen Ogg:  
I am not Trevor!  
I am Trevor!  
I am also Lamar!
        It's almost been 15 yrs, lol. In 4 more years, believe it or not, it'll be 2028. GTA 5 gon be 15 yrs, old by then.
            He meant ask him 15 years from now.
    That was michael's voice actor who said that statement afaik
        They've both stated as such.
    It's like mark hamill being pissed for being Luke. Most actors dream of having that role that imprints you into everyone's minds.
        thats what i really respect about Mark. He's had an incredible career in spite of being "typecast" for a large part of it, yet never lost reverence for the character and the films that made him a star in the first place. He gladly engages with fans about Star Wars all the time, despite the fact that on the downlow he's probably sick of it. Ogg is a great actor and I will always adore his role as Trevor but I wish he could accept that it's not a bad thing to have a role so iconic that people wanna talk about it 10 years later.
            I don't think he's sick of Luke l, just why Disney made him into
                outwardsly, no, of course not. and he clearly takes a lot of pride in the role, i think he will always love Luke and his Star Wars films. But realistically, talking about the same thing every day, no matter how much you love that thing, will wear on you. But Hamill takes it in stride and we'd never be the wiser if he ever is feeling "Star-Wars'd-out" because he always happily engages with his fans about Star Wars, online and in person. What a stud.
                    Hamill is actually open about the fact that he's never been a Star Wars fan. What he *is* a fan of is fandoms, the joy of engaging with a fictional setting or fictional characters. He is himself a fan of many "geeky" things and understands how it works on a deep, personal level. Hamill isn't a fan of Luke Skywalker, but he has deep respect and love for others who are, and he will go out of his way to brighten the day for people who geek out over him being Luke. 

Mark Hamill is a treasure.
                It‚Äôs probably the countless star wars fans who never grew up harassing the poor guy
            Mark is also incre√≠ble famous because of The Joker
                yes i am well aware haha. didnt really apply in this context since were mainly talking about the role that typecast Mark, which was Luke. Joker didn't come until later in his career
        Mark Hamill was disappointed when movie producers wont cast him because he is often associated with Luke Skywalker. He turned to voice acting where he is also famous for his roles like the Joker in the Batman animated series
            It was that and the car accident. He‚Äôs talked about it quite a bit and been very open about it.
        Isn‚Äôt it a bit like Harrison Ford being so curmudgeonly about being Han Solo?
            At least Ford is seen as Han Solo and Indiana Jones.
            Harrison Ford is curmudgeonly about everything.
            If I‚Äôd crashed as many antique planes as Ford has I‚Äôd be a general curmudgeon too. That man couldn‚Äôt keep a helium balloon airborne.
        I really appreciate his voice work more than anything. Him and Alan Tudyk are the best Jokers. I think of Mark as a VA before I do Luke Skywalker.
            Mark as the joker is literally peak voice acting. He will always be joker before Luke Skywalker to me
        Mark never said he hated being Luke he hated what Disney turned Luke into for the sequels
    He doesn't have to own anything just because other ppl like it. He don't like it, so respect that of him
I always wondered how many Rockstar paid they for the whole work in GTA V.  A lot of money?
    I think I heard they each got 200k. Would love getting a source here. If this is true I think it's way less than they should have gotten
    No way. They probably got paid peanuts. I‚Äôd be surprised if they each got more than like 10-25 thousand for the whole game.

And of course, no residuals whatsoever.
        If the actor for Nico Bellic got paid 100k then the actors for GTA V definitely got more than just 10-25k
            I have no idea about Bellic V.A money. 100.000 dollars for his job? Sounds good for me.
                GTA 4 made hundreds of millions lol
                    It‚Äôs extremely uncommon for video game actors to make residuals on the games. Typically they‚Äôre paid a flat fee for their work and that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs also typically not that much, which is bananas since video games are more profitable than film and television combined.
                        Exactly, And this series is HUGE. GTA 5 had records from being the highest earning not just games but in ALL media. 

You‚Äôd think even minor characters would be living large. That‚Äôs happened with plenty of tv shows and movies. GoT actors were making enough to buy a Aventador per episode
                    he accepted the job and the pay, then when the game was succesful he started bitching. His problem
                        That was a rumor. He never had beef with rockstar.

But that isn‚Äôt my point. I was making fun of saying 100K sounds good. 

If you were part of a project that literally made 100s of millions, and you only got a 10th of a million, is that really ‚Äúgood‚Äù? üòÇ
                            It's not but if that's what you agree on then that's what you agree on. Also I didn't know it was just a rumor, my bad in that case.
                                Eh don‚Äôt feel bad. I believed it once too especially considering the percentages lmfao. 

He did have beef but it was with his union. He blamed his union entirely since it was their job to take care of him.

When it comes to gta 5 I got no idea how much the actors got for that. 

One thing even though it‚Äôs a bit off topic that really interests me is that no one except rockstar knows who voices Agatha Baker from the casino dlcs. I love mysteries like this but it makes me wonder if it was a large payday
                        god people like you are why scumbags can get away with being scumbags
                            >god people like you are why scumbags can get away with being scumbags

No, it's just literally the facts. He signed a contract guaranteeing him X amount of money for his work, and stipulated no such bonus for game sales or residuals etc. If he wanted those things he should have negotiated them. That's how contracts work. It's not a scumbag move to not pay someone more money they they were contractually guaranteed. It's not like anybody was tricked into being in these games.
                                same thing happened to the writer of the Witcher books, he didn't think the games would make money so he only took the initial pay for the rights and that was that, and then he also started bitching lol
                                Still feel like Rockstar shouldve paid him more for what an awesome job he did. He didnt "bitch" about rockstar. From what i remember he said he blamed his union.

Edit: Just found out he even asked about residuals while negotiating but rockstar said it wasnt a possibility. Thats weird...
                    They did do that amount, it's a risk they all take. They couldn't know the game would be a success. They had a indication but couldn't know for sure, so I would say 100K is a fair deal considering your own personal avatar will be in a massive game like this. Just cause of the ladder, I know some who would have done it for less.

If you look deeply through the budget, I would assume that the split is fair. People who have more responsibility need to get payed more, that's how things are these days.
                        "personal avatar" is pretty bad reasoning for low pay though, ignoring everything else about contracts, it's still a job in the end, it would be like starring in a movie but one of the reasonings for the pay not being as high as it could be is because "well your character is in the movie".

Especially when considering the fact that some of these actors aren't interested in games.

Not arguing whether their pay was justified or not just saying having your avatar in a game doesn't excuse a certain pay.
                    >GTA 4 made hundreds of millions lol

Yeah, but he accepted a contract that said "You get X amount of money for this work and nothing else." That's what he gets. And it's not as though GTA wasn't already a massive gaming franchise by the time GTAIV released. If Nico's actor wanted more money, or residuals from the game sales, he should have negotiated that before signing a contract. Samuel L Jackson had the foresight to do exactly that.
            I read that, so sure they could‚Äôve got around 100K each. 

But you could also argue Niko was one lead, and with three leads they could dilute the pay among the three. 

My main point was they didn‚Äôt get rich off this alone. 25K was too low. But more than 100K each? I don‚Äôt know about that. Unknown actors usually aren‚Äôt paid much no matter how big the project or role. 

Depends on hours worked, days, maybe it was weekly, or maybe it was a lump sum, etc. 

Of course this is all speculation, before anyone gets absolutely outraged that I dare think these guys didn‚Äôt get rich lol
                They did all the acting work for like 2-3 years. Most movies takes a year or a half to film so $100k+ seems more than likely what they were paid.

 Obviously they were most likely paid more after the game released like when actors are paid a certain percent of the box office. Than again that‚Äôs why Nico‚Äôs voice actor was angry with rockstar for not giving him that percent of cash for being the protagonist
        you are completely delusional
            It's very possible
                no, it‚Äôs not. they were without any doubt paid a very competitive rate for the countless hours they spent working on the project
                    You would think they did that for the main voice actor niko Nellie but reportedly id was paid I believe 100K according to some reports without any residuals.
                        sometimes i think people forget how much money 100k really is.
            How so? Why would Rockstar pay these no names a lot of money?
                Luke has been acting for nearly 40 fucking years üíÄ just because YOU never heard of him before GTA doesn't mean nobody else did. Same for Fanteno
                    Luke, while a solid actor, was mainly in T.V. shows before GTA gave him his big break.

People only knew Michael was Ned Luke after that first trailer dropped because one of Ned‚Äôs old acting class buddies said so on Twitter. Suffice to say he was more or less undiscovered talent.
                    Well Ned has specifically said himself that no one knew him or Shawn or Steven til GTA 5.
            Why do you sound so offended? We‚Äôll never know, and there‚Äôs a dozen variables that could‚Äôve affected their pay. 

In totality, what do you think they made? Certainly not millions. If they each made around 100K, that would be very high. I can definitely see it if it‚Äôs a weekly or hourly pay for all those hours, but I highly doubt they made more than 100K. 

That would probably be the upper limit. 

As far as residuals, that‚Äôs pretty rare for unknown actors in video games. Even if they lead the game. And it‚Äôs usually not disclosed anyway.
                i can‚Äôt help if you think i sound a certain way, but you are simply delusional to be positing the numbers you are and speculating on residuals as if you have any idea
                    Have you ever been to an internet forum‚Ä¶ speculating about shit is 99 percent of what we do. You also responded to someone else as if you definitely knew they got paid a lot of money.

Hypocrite lol
>Dude I follow Steven Ogg on instagram and he posta some weird shit sometimes‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how much he likes being the ‚ÄúGTA‚Äù guy

My problem with Steven Ogg isn't that he doesn't like being recognized from GTA. It's that he still expects to make money off of the game and the character while being angry about being recognized for it.
    >It's that he still expects to make money off of the game and the character while being angry about being recognized for it.

I mean I would be a bit pissed if I played a main character in one of the highest grossing entertainment products of all time and got no residuals, too. CJ and Niko's VA's have both said similar things. It is kind of shitty he was in something like one of the biggest summer blockbusters of all time and maybe got 100k.
        >I mean I would be a bit pissed if I played a main character in one of the highest grossing entertainment products of all time and got no residuals, too.

Then you would have to be pissed at your own agents, or yourself, for not negotiating that into your contract. Samuel L Jackson managed it just fine.
            Wow established multimillionaire A list actor Samuel L. Jackson had the money and connections to get a good contract? That's wild why couldn't Steven Ogg? 

The entire reason they were hired is because they didn't have an agent protecting their interests. The second they try asking for residuals is the second they're replaced. Niko/CJ VA's were both used specifically because they weren't in the VA union. That's just stupid as shit to blame the predatory behavior of a multibillion company on the actors they took advantage of.
                and if you want the royalties and they wont' give them to you then you have two options. Take the job for the money being offered and don't bitch about it after the fact because you signed the contract, or don't take the job.
                    "And if you want some royalties from the highest grossing entertainment product of all time, you need to know it's going to be the highest grossing entertainment product of all time beforehand and include it in your contract" okay so Steve invents a time machine like you said and asks for royalties in his contract. Rockstar recasts Trevor.   Gee, great thinking man, why didn't he do that? You're really smart.
                        >"And if you want some royalties from the highest grossing entertainment product of all time, you need to know it's going to be the highest grossing entertainment product of all time beforehand and include it in your contract" okay so Steve invents a time machine like you said and asks for royalties in his contract.

Samuel L Jackson managed to have that kind of foresight and business acumen.

Also, by the way, literally nobody was talking about Steven being upset he didn't get enough money for GTAV. You're conflating the issues of two entirely different people.
                            
>Samuel L Jackson managed to have that kind of hindsight

And why didn't Steve use his millions of dollars and any of the connections he has from his career as an A list actor to get a good contract like Sam L.? Why didn't he do that? Do you know I can't figure this out???

>You're conflating the issues of two entirely different people.

I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to think someone may have negative feelings about a company paying them like $100k and turning around and making $1,000,000,000 off it, but apparently it is for you lol.
                                >I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to think someone may have negative feelings about a company paying them like $100k and turning around and making $1,000,000,000 off it, but apparently it is for you lol.

They knew that was going to be the case before they ever signed on to the game. By the time GTAIV released it was already one of the most successful game franchises in history and was already massively popular. It's not like the actor playing Nico didn't know what GTA was when he signed his contract. 

And again, STEVEN OGG IS NOT THE ONE WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT MONEY FROM ROCKSTAR. You're conflating two entirely people and two entirely different stories.
                Samual Jackson was an established a list celebrity/actor, what movie had Trevor actor been in let alone main character üòÇ? That‚Äôs the difference gta needed Sam Jackson and Trevor‚Äôs actor needed GTA‚Ä¶

                            You should look up the difference between voice acting and performance capture.
            Holy shit you have literally zero clue about how the vg voice acting industry actually works.
        So regular people who put in work into any industry that makes money off their work continually should be paid retirement benefits before their of age? If Trevor‚Äôs actor was a real actor then why wasn‚Äôt ray liotta always mentioned for playing Tommy verceti‚Ä¶

                                They're saying that we should in that case pay monthly fee's to rent games so that everyone who worked on them can make ongoing money from it.
        >I mean I would be a bit pissed if I played a main character in one of the highest grossing entertainment products of all time

It's understandable if they got payed peanuts. But if they got 100k for a few weeks/months work, I'd say that's reasonable compensation. 

Cuz let's be honest, the voice actors are only a very small reason that game made billions. Yes they were excellent, but (except for maybe Trevor) hardly irreplaceable, and myriad engineers played a more important role.
            > they got *paid* peanuts. But

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*
                Stfu grammar Nazi bot
            as long as rockstar is making a dollar on the game, the key contributors should be pulling in some cents too.

so bonkers when redditors stan for gigantic corporations.

                >what do the stars in a billion dollar movie make? Usually millions.

Yeah but only if they're well known and their name is likely to sell the film. I agree with your point that Vidya actors are underappreciated, but their reputations (unless they've achieved fame in film) almost never contribute to a game's sale.
                    [deleted]
                        Yeah *now* she's worth millions because now she's recognizable. Do you think she got paid more than a mil for the first film? I doubt it. I imagine she got paid less than a quarter mil, as is the norm for unknown leads in indies and horror films.
        That‚Äôs how work for hire works though. Every VA knows that.
    But it‚Äôs the same with a music artist hating their most popular song cause they have to keep performing it & feel they‚Äôve done better since. It‚Äôs no foreign concept and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs grateful, just irritated by aspects of it
    Why is that a problem though? He's far from the only case of an actor hating that they're *only* known for one popular thing, rather than their diverse portfolio that often includes roles they liked more. And many of those would be people getting paid residuals years or even decades after the initial showing.

Steven Ogg does not appear to get residuals, or royalties from this game. He stopped making money the day he recorded his last session. Where did you get the idea he still "expects" to make money from it?
        >Where did you get the idea he still "expects" to make money from it?

When he accepted money on Cameo from people asking him to do a Trevor impersonation for them and instead he took the opportunity to chastise said individuals for not recognizing him as an actor who does other things besides Trevor and refused to do the "impersonation." 

Taking the money and then bitching about it made me lose a ton of respect for him.
            So because he did something on cameo, which is clearly him *not* wanting to be associated with Trevor...that means he still wants to be associated with Trevor?

If he actually just took the money then he'd be shut down. I've read an article about the incident (one incident, btw, you're saying "people" like it's a recurring theme) and the implication is that he did the cameo, he just put the rant in front of it.
His posts are wild though, I‚Äôve seen some things on his page that I wouldn‚Äôt wish for my worse enemy to see
Same here, as far as I can tell Steven Ogg is basically Boyd Crowder from Justified, just without the white supremacy and domestic terrorism. He's even got the crazyman hair and blinding smile down pat. 

&#x200B;

But if he did maintain those 2 attributes, I feel like I wouldn't be surprised to find out about it.
And during friendship activity with Michael Franklin says that he was fat before. I always thought it's a reference to that.
    Damnnnnnnnnnnnn
Afaik Shawn Fonteno (Franklin's actor) and Young Maylay (CJ's VA) are cousins in real life.
    He was also in The Wash with DJ Pooh as the kidnappers.
    Ahhh, nepotism.  Isn't it wonderful?
not only that. His cousin is then same guy who voiced CJ in San Andreas(if you guys didn't know about it)
I'm happy for him because he's developing an acting career instead of being known as that guy from a videogame.
    Which I think was his hang up. I think he loved playing Trevor but he didn‚Äôt want to be exclusively associated with him. Even though he always will be to a point.
        The shows I‚Äôve seen him in he just plays a downplayed version of Trevor.
            Because so often he gets type casted as a villain. He was unknown before GTA 5 and it will take a very different role for him to break that mould

Aaron Paul will always be Jesse Pinkman

Kit Harington will always be Jon Snow

Some actors can change things up but what made them famous often sticks.
                Daniel Radcliffe will always be Weird Al Yankovic.
                    You mean that guy from Guns Akimbo? Man, what a chameleon.
                        I think you‚Äôre meaning that guy from Horns
                            Isn't he the little guy from Lord of the Rings?
                                I think they call them Ewoks
                        Swiss Army Man, really shows his range ü§£
                    Incidentally, I think he purposely went for the most anti-harry potter roles he could find, just so he wouldn't be known as Harry Potter.
                        He was once quoted saying the best thing he bought with his Harry Potter money was his career. He's set for life, so he literally just acts for fun now and exclusively picks roles and movies he has a strong interest in.
                        That‚Äôs called ‚Äúworking against type‚Äù. Will Smith tried to do it with Hancock; when you‚Äôve been typecast as a certain archetype, doing the reverse shows that range.

It‚Äôs like when wrestlers go heel to face also!
                            Yep. Steven Ogg got typecast for a while because of it. I think, he's also frustrated that he can't move on from that sort of role because his most succcessful one is GTAV.
                    Idk man whenever I see him I think if that time he played a magical farting corpse.
                        Fans of *Everything, Everywhere, All At Once* really ought to see *Swiss Army Man* since its by the same Daniels.
                            It even includes a bonus Daniel
                    He also played Sam Houser
                    I think you misspelled *‚Äúa flatulent corpse‚Äù*
                Jerry Seinfeld will always be Jerry Seinfeld
                Aaron Paul played Todd in Bojack Horseman, and I didn't realize until my second or third watch. I honestly couldn't tell.
                So he doesn't want to be associated with trevor but actively chooses roles that have him play trevor-lite. No one is forcing this man to take these roles.
                    Roles that aren‚Äôt exactly what you want are better than no roles I would assume, but I‚Äôm not his manager who knows what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes.
                        He‚Äôs probably just pissed that he‚Äôll forever be known as trailer park trash man instead of Daniel Day Lewis or something. It‚Äôs pretty stupid because at the end of the day it doesn‚Äôt really matter.
                            To him it‚Äôs a big deal. He‚Äôs said himself Trevor is the exact opposite of his personality and that irl he thinks he‚Äôs a pretty nice guy. Imagine you go your whole life not being rude and mean to people unnecessarily but then every time someone recognizes you they want you to call them a slur or scream at them.
                    Money
                I wonder if he was cast in the walking dead before or after V?
                    It was after, probably by about 3 or 4 years or so iirc.
                        Yeah I just looked up that s7 dropped in 2016 so something like that
                    Before(?)
                        I never followed TWD when it was airing so I wasn't sure
                    I was trying to figure out how the protagonist from Cyberpunk 2077 fit into all of this before I realized you guys are just shortening GTAV. 


Jesus
                Chris evans as captain America and Tom Middleton as Loki
            Yep. Simon (The Walking Dead) was basically Trevor if Trevor didn‚Äôt mind taking orders
                His character in Better Call Saul is Trevor if he was a bit more cleaned up.
            >The shows I‚Äôve seen him in he just plays a downplayed version of Trevor.

Because he's not really that good of an actor. He has basically the one performance that he can do, and a few variations on that same performance, and that's it. Every character he ends up playing just becomes Trevor.
            THIS.
    Yeah, he was great in Better Call Saul.
        Shhhh careful saying that. Some people on this sub think because he hasn't got a role bigger than Trevor then he doesn't have an acting career.
            How long was his arc on Better Call Saul? Let me know how that is a bigger role than Trevor. I‚Äôll wait.
                Fuck you got me I guess he doesn't have an acting career.
                    Just pointing out the flawed argument. Trevor is still his biggest role and it‚Äôs not even close.
                        You should've kept reading what I posted. I acknowledge Trevor is his biggest role but people on this sub think that means he doesn't have an acting career.
                How long was his arc? Bro, use proper industry terminology lmao. He was BILLED/(hired) as a guest star, which has limited episode appearances as opposed to recurring or a series regular. 

And that character arc was him trying to show up Mike and being humbled by the end of the scene. That‚Äôs a literal character arc. Source: Syd Fields
    What acting career? Dude was in two shows and basically played the same character in both. He should be thankful for GTA and take advantage of it.
        Yeah he's not a leading man but he's been getting consistent work (more than the two shows you've seen. Check his imdb). I think that qualifies as a career. As oppose to say doing a voice for a video game character then just doing conventions and tik tok videos for the next 10 years.
            Say the line Bart.
                You forgot a thou-
                    ![gif](giphy|G9Kj87gLF8Z4A)
            Exactly. People seem to think that if you‚Äôre not headlining a show as an actor than that automatically means you‚Äôre not doing anything. I‚Äôm glad Ogg is doing stuff instead of riding the convention train but more power to Luke and Fonteno if they want to do that .
                Reminds me of Kirsten Dunst in an interview a few years back: Where they asked her where‚Äôs she been and she‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been in a bunch of stuff. It‚Äôs not like you have to be in major blockbusters for every movie
            Exactly, if I was Steven I‚Äôd pursue my own career too instead of the other route.
            Ehhh i wouldn‚Äôt say consistent. He hasn‚Äôt actually done all thar much but he appeared in some big shows/films in the last 2 years that rated well. But as i said to someone else, Steven doesn‚Äôt care all thar much about all about the role of Trevor. It was clearly just another job to him but it did well for him. He is a bit crazy it seems judging by his Instagram but he does have his own business and does have a cameo too. Though he isn‚Äôt the first actor to be known for one thing and just completely forget about it after a period of time has gone by, look at Daniel Radcliffe, that dude has done everything he possibly can to avoid being only represented as Harry Potter even though it will ONLY be his most famous role
        He's been in 26 films and 17 TV shows what the fuck are you talking about?
            He's been in Witness Protection from a certain australian who is known for a lack of sleeves and paying seven hundred and two dollars for a big mac.
            They mean the stuff that they watch. Regulars ever accounts indie work as actual work
        Do you think all actors are major movie stars?
        Just because someone wasn't in some big budget marvel movie doesn't mean they dont have a career
        I think he is thankful for sure. Between the shows I've seen him in (The Walking Dead, Better Call Saul, and Westworld) you're right that he's played a very similar, unhinged asshole kind of character. Each has been similar to Trevor in their own right, but I think he's an actor that doesn't want to be pigeonholed by a single role. Similar to Rainn Wilson and Dwight. They're thankful for the fans and the experience of the role, but they don't want to be "known" as Dwight or Trevor. They want to be known for their work.
        He can do whatever he wants
        2 shows that you‚Äôve saw. He‚Äôs got a lot in the pipeline as well. Just because he wants to distance himself from it doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt thankful.
            Is he thankful though? He set up a cameo, and when people told him to act like Trevor he was a huge jerk and got annoyed. Like why even accept that then, what else were people going to request? He obviously has an ego problem and some extremely negative view of the video game industry as an art medium.

Only role anyone else knows him for is that tiny one in better call Saul and Simon in walking dead.
                Yep. Dude is a straight up asshole.
                    Bit harsh.
                        I can only go by from what I‚Äôve seen of him in interviews and such. Maybe he‚Äôs a great dude but he doesn‚Äôt have a favorable image to his biggest fan base.
                He was in westworld and boiling point as well off the top off my head. About the cameo thing, haven‚Äôt seen it, but wasn‚Äôt Trevor a huge jerk and got really annoyed?
                    Yeah but he was genuinely pissed for the cameo, it wasn‚Äôt acting or a part of it

https://youtu.be/nK_EpVPHPF0?feature=shared
                Probably wanted people to think he, himself was cool and impressive, not just his character he plays idk
                Trevor is one of the most mediocre characters in the history of gta, and you just like him because of the surprise factor and the contrast with the other two boring clich√©s, I can see how you can get to hate playing such a character, even Claude is much more interesting, and he doesn't even need to talk.
        Exactly. The dude has NO versatility in his acting. He gets on these shows and acts exactly like Trevor then has the audacity to get upset at people for thinking he‚Äôs some great actor. Dude just whines about it he sucks
        I didn't even know that guy was Trevor. You'd be surprised out how many people don't play GTAV, or only played through it, put it away, and never thought about it again.

I'm sure he is thankful for GTA, maybe not so thankful for the people that think if he doesn't pop into his Trevor character whenever they see him he's an asshole.
        But window licking morons shouldn't be calling him Trevor when meeting him in person because that's not his name üôÑ I'd find it irritating too.
        This kind of ignorant arrogance from the community is why he's in the right for distancing himself.
        Someone whos never heard of typecasting i see
        Shut up, idiot.
    I think he didn't know how much of an impact that game was going to have on his career. And when you get overshadowed by your own self and find it hard to get a career because you're known as the Trevor guy I could see how that could be aggravating.
    Yeah but he‚Äôs being a complete dick about it by borderline mocking fans who talk to him about it
        I'll agree that's not cool. But I wonder how long he had to deal with belligerent fans before he had enough or maybe he was always a dick.
            You should never mock your fans in that line of work people like Steven need to realise that it‚Äôs partly the fans who made us career and got him famous and he may not like being Trevor but he should still realise that‚Äôs what made him and that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs most known for
                The ironic part is him being a dick to fans is a Trevor move.
                    While that is true it doesn‚Äôt make it right or maybe one day he‚Äôll come out and say that he was just acting the entire time
    what do you think was more popular . gta 5 or the walking dead tv show
        Gta 5
        I'm not debating which is more popular. I'm giving him credit for not sitting back and riding the gta 5 popularity. He's out trying to work.
        I mean, Walking Dead is pretty huge.
            thats why i think ogg has been established as an actor . he was in the show awhile ago .
                Oh I apologize I thought you were making the opposite point.
    You can still keep up with your older work and still progress your career. The fact is Steven just doesn‚Äôt care enough about his role as Trevor. And if you have seen his Instagram, you would see he has gone a bit doolally wile also running his own business of sorts. He does have a cameo though so it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if he does do Trevor content on there.
    How is that a bad thing?
    What acting career never seen him on anything except you tube where he cry‚Äôs about being asked to play Trevor
        Ah so because youve never seen him on anything that means he's not acting. I've never seen an Alfred Hitchcock movie so I guess he's not a director.
            But you know who he is like everybody does next to no one knows who Steven ogg is who hasn‚Äôt played gta
                So he's not a big name. Doesn't mean he's not working.
                    Still only known for Trevor
                        Still acting...
He's not obliged to be enthusiastic about a video game he did ten years ago.
In fairness he must find it annoying to just be known as Trevor.
    He‚Äôs lucky he‚Äôs known for anything. Fame is fame.
        Are you joking.  Do you seriously not know who Stephen Ogg is?
    He's a great actor that's been in several major shows and movies, wtf are y'all talking about?
        That's the issue, GTA made him be known as Trevor Phillips when I think, at the end of the day, he just wants to be known as Steven Ogg and not constantly hounded for Trevor quotes. I think, he enjoyed being trevor for the first few years but got fed up with the constantly requests to tell people to fuck off or act like Trevor when he has moved on.

Though, the cameo stuff is a bit iffy.
            He can be Steven Ogg all he wants.  His problem is that nobody cares and he's bitter about it.
    He was a nobody before trevor.
        He was in 7 films and 4 shows before Trevor. Just because that's the role you know him most as doesn't mean he needs to hold that role up amongst all the others.  He's a working actor and owes you And GTA nothing.
            He doesn't owe me shit but acting like he was al pacino before gta is delusional. He owes everything to gta.

>7 films and 4 shows

Basically nothing and guess what he played the exact same character 12 times including gta.
                Ahh so you're now claiming to have seen all of his roles.  You're a joke and I'm out.

Also GTA is a blip on his career. Not all actors are stars.  But he's been a successful working actor for decades.
                    Oh fuck off he was no al pacino before he still isn't. He is just some asshole who yells at people because to his surprise people know him as one of the most popular character ever created.
                        The fact that I say working actor and Al Pacino is the only guy you think of shows you don't know enough about the industry to have this conversation. 

Have a good one dude.  You'll laugh at this when you grow up.
                            I was saying al pacino because you know scarface.

Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, Christian Bale, Ryan Reynolds anybody on game of thrones when it aired are vastly more succesful than him and still working. He is an asshole with nothing significant except gta.
                                Not a single one of those people is what the industry calls a "working actor". Thank you for confirming you don't know what you're talking about.  I'm out.
                He owes absolutely nothing to GTA or to GTA fans. He's a human being.
                    He owes his fame and a shit ton of money he got from rockstar for that project. I don't mean he should actually give money to people but he is standing on that and you know it as well.
                        lol Knowing how R* pays their VA‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not so sure about that
                            Yeah I exaggerated about a shit tone lets say a fairly good amount due to residual and along the fame he got. Whether he likes it or not he owes his popularity to gta he should stop acting like an asshole saying he doesn't like it and then post nasty shit on ig just like trevor would. Both actors for Michael and Franklin says this too.
He always has been, he says he never played GTA V and never will cause he‚Äôs not a gamer. People were constantly degrading him by calling him Trevor, it‚Äôs understandable he doesn‚Äôt want to be seen in the same light
Why does it suck? It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre doing any DLC for the game or that his character is going to show up in GTA6. They aren‚Äôt doing any press tours or media events for GTA5. The game came out over a decade ago. Why on earth would it matter in the slightest if the voice actor for Trevor doesn‚Äôt want to somehow be ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù with a game that isn‚Äôt doing ANYTHING new?

The obsession with the voice actor ‚Äúdistancing‚Äù himself from GTA5 is fucking weird lmao. No ones freaking out that the voice actors for ‚ÄúA Bugs Life‚Äù aren‚Äôt actively talking about that film every chance they get more than 25 years after it came out
Is he? Just googled him and went back through about a years worth of news articles about it and I can‚Äôt find anything?
He‚Äôs a cartoon now
The comments ITT are sending me! ü§£

"He's no longer Trevor! He's building an acting career! He's been in dozens of productions already!"

"Yeah, like...?"

"Uhh... Look at his IMDB!"
he's a moron. if he just embraced that people love him as trevor he could probably come back as a side character or even the villain of GTA 7
Black don't crack
    But that hairline go back.
        Man that shits whack
        They nerfed us in the patch. Can't have youthful skin AND a great hairline
            My bald spot lookin like Jupiter's Great Brown Spot.
    That's because crack is whack
He also snatched Ice Cube‚Äôs chain
    Really? When
        Check this out https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DSDzDJS4LFc
He is also the cousin of the guy who played CJ in San Andreas
I think that's the case. I think, Steven said in an interview, he got fed up because he never gets asked to say anything nice whilst the other two gets asked to do all sorts of nice stuff. He is just asked to tell people to fuck off or go on a rant when really, he just wants to say something nice. NOT expensive.
    Oh fuck off steven ogg. boo hoo you signed up for a massive role as a mean crazy guy and you‚Äôre surprised that‚Äôs how people know you.
        [removed]
            Well maybe he shouldn't portray himself that way in every piece of media he's involved with including his own deranged social media. Guy is unintentionally stuck playing Trevor. His fault.
                Still no reason to be rude
                    Tell him that. He thinks games are for nerds and losers. Fuck this douchebag ass actor that can only play one role
                        Again, no reason to be rude
                            No reason not to... guys making money and never gonna see it who gives a fuck
                                Meh
He has been getting weirder and weirder on IG lol. And people make Trevor comments because it truly is how Trevor would act.
    Maybe he‚Äôs doing an Andy Kaufman and cultivating a persona to openly troll people with.
        I hope so. But it is kind of sad that Ned Luke and Shawn Fonteno no longer follow Steven Ogg on IG and vice versa. It has been going on for a while but last time I checked Steve and Shawn were still following each other but not anymore. I understand not wanting to ge typecast but to have disdain for a character you portrayed is odd to me.
            I think he posted about some mental health stuff on Twitter back in 2017-2018. I don't about the ig stuff but that's a thing too.
                Some of his posts are concerning....his mannerisms, the way he talks. As someone who faces severe depression every now and then, I guess I can kind of see it in him. Or he is that good of an actor.
    I had to go check it out based on what others have said about it too. It's got like borderline schizo energy. I wonder if Ogg is doing okay. I feel bad for the guy being so widely known as only Trevor. But at the same time, he did such a killer job that it's almost impossible to not be associated with such a huge character. 

I was really excited to see him on Better Call Saul even though it was brief.
        I too am a bit concerned about his mannerisms and body language in some of his posts. Either that or he is just that good of an actor. 

Loved his minor appearance in Better Call Saul. Also The Walking Dead declined but I watched the episodes he was in and he was great, even in the Negan spinoffs. He is a great actor with a lot of potential and I wish him the best.
            Yeah, for all we know, it could be a huge trolling thing. Or it could be performance art. Who really knows but him?

I never watch Walking Dead so I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. Lol
                In The Walking Dead (show declined but I kept watching for some reason), Steven Ogg plays the right-hand man of a major villain and it was great. He pretty much out-villains the main villain. Pretty much a more serious, more evil Trevor lol.
                    Oh dang. That sounds badass haha. I just don't know if I could get into the Walking Dead. I'm not really into the whole zombie thing.
    He Calls it art. Which I can see.
Steven and Ned both came back in rdr2 for minor roles so for sure they probably will no doubt if Rockstar ask them too
    Wait who were they?
    Ogg never actually was in the game
>[ogg](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Laramie_gang_leader#:~:text=Despite%20speculation%20that%20the%20Laramie,did%20not%20voice%20the%20character.)
        That wasn't Steven Ogg
            that's what I meant, the website I linked talks about how it's not him lol
    Actually no he didn't it's a common misconception simply because the voice sounds similar but that guy in the RDR 2 epilogue isn't Steven ogg
    Did they do new roles or like ancestors of their GTA V characters?
        new roles.
Rockstar very rarely brings mainline characters back, they might get a brief cameo see Johnny K from GTA IV in GTA V. But even if they wanted to bring Trevor back in any capacity I doubt Steven Ogg would be open to it.
    They brought Claude back in San Andreas and had multiple missions relating around him
        "***rarely***" not never.
            Victor

And Johnny

I just realized that most times when rockstar brings back protagonists from previous games it's normally to kill them off
I rather him get replaced and Trevor carry a voice box! That would be a legendary fuck you by rockstar to the man who hates Trevor
I hope exactly for that. Trevor represents everything wrong with writing in GTAV. Inconsistant mess for cheap memes sake.
    Wdym? If you mean his unhinged-ness, it was there to show how dangerous Trevor coming back into Michael's life was- at any minute, Trevor could find out Michael's lies and do something to put his family in danger. It also served as a contrast where somehow, the most dangerous and off the handle character was the most loyal.
somehow michael looks more like michael the older he got
The actors for CJ and Niko have both said they feel they deserve residual payments since the games were so successful and they played a big part in that. I think Steven probably feels a bit like that.

He was probably the most popular/impactful character in the biggest entertainment product of all time and was universally praised for his acting. And made like 100k for it. 

When an actor stars in a movie that makes $1 billion that usually gives them a lot of money and work offers. That didn't seem to happen for Steve.
From the actors perspective I get that. But that‚Äôs what happens when you give literally one of the best performances in one of the top selling single pieces of media of all time. 

I don‚Äôt think ogg really understands just how popular gta is, then again Trevor is literally a terrible human being and not the best person to be associated with. I hope he lands a major role in something he‚Äôs truly passionate about.
    It‚Äôs because he‚Äôs one of those Gen Xers that just doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù video games so he doesn‚Äôt respect it as a media form. I think he said as much himself that he doesn‚Äôt understand why people would ‚Äúsit in front of a TV and play a cartoon instead of doing something else‚Äù. My dad is about his age and is the same way.
        It‚Äôs kinda funny that his job literally requires people to sit in front of a TV tho lol
        Imagine claiming Gen X doesn't get videogames
            Most do, but there‚Äôs still a decent subset of them that just don‚Äôt- which makes sense because they‚Äôre the last generation alive that didn‚Äôt really have more the immersive games in their childhood like we all got from like 2000 onwards. 

Listen to Steven himself if you don‚Äôt believe me: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8sHaUYD/
                My sibling in Christ, we literally grew up playing Atari, Coleco, Nintendo, Sega, PlayStation, Xbox, suped up PCs, every possible chance we got, not to mention all the quarters we spent at video arcades. Even older 1960s-born Gen X were hip to the latest video game tech. I absolutely can NOT with this
                     Well I didn‚Äôt say EVERY Gen Xer did I? I said a subset of you all- SOME of you. My father was born in 68 and is just like Steven in terms of seeing games as child‚Äôs toys.

Whereas for the 30 and younger crowd, video games are almost a universal activity- I would wager it‚Äôs probably like over 90% of the <30 crowd regularly play  games to like 60% of Gen Xers or something, just guessing.
                    And the people who did that shit back then were called nerds, losers, and bullied because of it. Just because it existed back then doesn‚Äôt mean everyone who lived concurrently accepted or understood it.
Steven basically is Trevor though.
it‚Äôs more the disrespect he casts on it. steven ogg didn‚Äôt have to play trevor phillips, he could‚Äôve turned the role down. he did because he knew it would be a launch pad for his career, which it was. he got typecast, which happens to every actor. he dislikes his typecast, and places the blame on GTA as a whole, taking any chance he can to shit talk it, up to and including taking peoples money on cameo. 

GTA was absolutely all three protagonists launch off point, and they wouldn‚Äôt be where they are without it. you don‚Äôt have to love your character, but that deserves respect
    I mean no he didn‚Äôt have to play Trevor but I can‚Äôt image he fore saw how his character would take off. 

I‚Äôm not saying I agree with him basically saying fuck off to the character as someone whose been a fan of Trevor but looking at it from an objective standpoint i do get why he isn‚Äôt too fond of the character after a decade and wanting to move on. 

Hell there was even a point Toby Maguire hated being attached to Spider-Man but came around on his own free will. 

We can‚Äôt make the man like the role he played and I‚Äôll even play devils advocate and say he doesn‚Äôt owe it to anyone to do so. 

He ain‚Äôt the first gta voice actor who had beef with the role / company later down the line (ray liotta) he might not be the last either and at this point we gotta separate the art from the artist.

I can enjoy Trevor and just not attach it to Steven because while he was the voice and model he‚Äôs not him and has moved on in his career which he deserves to do. 

He ain‚Äôt the first typecast actor to end up hating the character that put him on the map and he is far from the last.

Who knows maybe in the future with enough time he‚Äôll come back around to the character but regardless I appreciate Trevor as a character and I‚Äôm glad steven was apart of the game, I don‚Äôt think anyone else could of delivered the level of unhinged needed like he did lol
        The fella who played Obi Wan in the original Star Wars was warned that he would be known for it. He got annoyed that people overlooked his other works.
What do you mean he's "outgrown" the role? What other things has he been in that aren't just a watered down Trevor? I understand not wanting to be known as just Trevor, but the guy acts like he's going to be a major heart throb in a movie anytime soon. What does he expect?
Steven Ogg (Trevor) is actively distancing himself from the character of Trevor to try and avoid being type cast or just known as Trevor. As far as I know he‚Äôs not on bad terms with the voice actors of Michael and Franklin.
    Ah okay - thanks for filling me in, had no idea he felt that way.
    Lol stevens actually coming back at a game expo with Ned and Shawn ppl need to stay up to date
The actor Steven is distancing himself from the franchise. He doesn‚Äôt like being known as ‚Äúthat gta guy Trevor‚Äù
It's completely understandable not to want people calling you the name of a character you played or asking you to act like said character for them. I believe he once said that he disliked that the other main characters' actors get requests to do nice things, while he mostly gets requests to act like Trevor, so aka be a dick. 

You are the one that has a terminal case of unawareness if you can't understand why he doesn't like being known as trevor.
    Sure thing Trev
Good voice actors will be able to do mutiple people without someone knowing. The Mario voice actors is an example of that
    For real, I was shocked when I found out that he was the voice of paarthurnax in Skyrim
Pls someone explain
    He was [defending AI art](https://x.com/ned_luke/status/1749222539161653458?s=46&t=XZMzrBA_-x-90DRCAvWuQQ) and people called him out for it.
        Ai art really isn't a bad thing like maybe if a guys disabled he could use it or someone who sucks at drawing but has a great imagination and ai art makes it come true so it's not completely bad ü§∑
        Huh, okay
Hopefully. He‚Äôs such an overrated character and it annoys me when people theorize he killed Niko Niko would wreck Trevor. Trevor‚Äôs some annoying asshole who screams a lot. Nikos a trained soldier in a real direct combat war. Niko would decimate him in any form of fighting. 

Yes, I know Trevor flew. In the Candian Airforce. Might as well be in the National Guard when it comes to actual ground combat.
Which is fine
You are protowater Trevor!
These damn method actors, take their roles way too far.  But I'm sure he'll make a damn fine micro plastic in the new BBC Documentary.

    Facts dude my bad I should have commented something funnier and more original like literally just linking another subreddit and nothing else
        That's right, you b-blithering fool!
        No problem i think i was a dick with that comment, nice joke btw.
That's what upsets him. In his mind he's supposed to be a "real actor" and not a cartoon or whatever tf he calls it.
    Well, he is a real actor. GTA was a high profile job but it was just that, a job. Some actors want to be known for their body of work because we train in different disciplines to show off that range. Some like being one hit wonders, some don‚Äôt. 

Especially screen actors. I don‚Äôt think gamers should take that as an insult anymore than a coworker who likes their job is offended by someone resigning
        Fair but unfortunately for him he got involved in one of the like 3 most popular single game titles of all time lmao
        LOL he‚Äôs no damn actor! Ray liotta was an actor
            Ogg‚Äôs performance as Trevor is a million times what Liotta‚Äôs as Tommy was. Love Tommy and Liotta but the dude is so checked out in VC (starts showing more enthusiasm after shakedown though)
                Who was Tommy‚Äôs competition? A mute cluade‚Ä¶ pretty sure if Tommy was a methed out over the top character with as much dialogue as Trevor, ray liotta would of done a better job simply because he‚Äôs the better actor
                    I mean to my point, Tommy kinda already IS an over the top maniac, it just doesn‚Äôt always come across. He‚Äôs one of the most evil GTA protags (next to Trevor and maybe Toni C) and one of the only ones to show no form of remorse whatsoever. The game literally ends with him calling himself a mass murdering psychotic killer with a big cheese-eating grin on his face watching the sunset (it‚Äôs fucking hysterical, and perfect for the game‚Äôs themes for the record)

But he doesn‚Äôt always come across that way because half the time Liotta‚Äôs screaming his angry lines like a maniac (as he should imo) and the other half it sounds like he‚Äôs been at the nyquil. Tommy‚Äôs calm wise-guy thing is only surface deep. He‚Äôs clearly fiercely intelligent but his uncontrollable rage makes him slightly unhinged
                    I won‚Äôt argue with you that Liotta is the better actor, but Liotta didn‚Äôt respect the material enough to do anything more than royally phone it in, regardless of what he was given to work with.
    Yeah it‚Äôs actually so disrespectful towards the gaming industry tbh
        [deleted]
            Stop disrespecting my vidya gane, Steve üò°üò°üò°
    If he wanted to be a "real actor" why the hell would he take a job as a voice actor?
He sees himself as an artist and one body of work being recognized over the rest is seen as an insult to the rest of their work. It‚Äôs in the same vein as the disdain Thom Yorke holds for the song ‚ÄúCreep‚Äù.
    Or how Alec Guinness felt about Star Wars.
        Alex Guinness is fantastic in Lawrence of Arabia.
            I thought he was great in the role of Marley‚Äôs ghost in Scrooge as well
                It's so rare for someone to reference that particular version of A Christmas Carol!
        Toss Ford in too. Dude hates star wars lol
            He doesn‚Äôt hate Star Wars, just doesn‚Äôt like how they handled it and Han after the first movie more than anything. Definitely doesn‚Äôt hate it like Alec Guinness lol
            At least he's also Indy. He's known for *two* acts of work.
        Didn't stop him from making a ton of money on the movie
    There's a really good video where they play Creep in 2016, and the lead guitarist has this horrified look on his face because nobody told him they were doing it.
    I've heard Kenny Loggins never accepted being the guy who did Danger Zone and loathes that it's his #1 song. Makes sense I guess, he was just the performer for a track made by the movie studio, but being the guy behind Footloose or Caddyshack isn't any better to me.
    Yeah, I don't understand people who hate on him
What makes you think he doesn't "accept" that? I'm sure he's well aware of it, he just has other things to do instead

Just because he's not still focusing his career on a project he worked on 12 years ago, doesn't mean he doesn't appreciate the impact it had on his life
    He had some cameos recently where people asked him to essentially play Trevor in the cameo, and he was clearly not into it and throwing shade at the request, saying Trevor is a cartoon character. That's probably what they're referring to
        Eh, that‚Äôs also his sense of humour, based on previous interviews with him. Plus, it‚Äôs logical that he doesn‚Äôt care much to imitate a performance he did once 12 years ago
            He took money for doing a half assed comission in which he complained about being remebered as Trevor for like 5 minutes. He shouldn't take the money if he doesn't like it
Not going to say that being in GTA didn't help him, but he did other stuff, and for me, he is Simon from the walking dead. As much as his likeness is in the game, his actual face was in the show. You hear KJ Simmons in BG3 and probably you are gonna spot his voice at any time, Jason Isaacs is in that too, and didn't notice... I was like "damn this guy sounds familiar".
    That's fair but he 100% got that roll in TWD because of gta
Gta 5 was a decade ago, and Steven is an actor. You wouldn't still call Andrew Garfield Spiderman, right? I think we can give him the respect he deserves by acknowledging the amazing performance he did and allowing him to be an actor and not The guy who plays Trevor.
Insufferable account
Ask him that question again in 15 years, he‚Äôll be telling everyone!
    Books by Stephen Ogg:  
I am not Trevor!  
I am Trevor!  
I am also Lamar!
    It's almost been 15 yrs, lol. In 4 more years, believe it or not, it'll be 2028. GTA 5 gon be 15 yrs, old by then.
        He meant ask him 15 years from now.
That was michael's voice actor who said that statement afaik
    They've both stated as such.
It's like mark hamill being pissed for being Luke. Most actors dream of having that role that imprints you into everyone's minds.
    thats what i really respect about Mark. He's had an incredible career in spite of being "typecast" for a large part of it, yet never lost reverence for the character and the films that made him a star in the first place. He gladly engages with fans about Star Wars all the time, despite the fact that on the downlow he's probably sick of it. Ogg is a great actor and I will always adore his role as Trevor but I wish he could accept that it's not a bad thing to have a role so iconic that people wanna talk about it 10 years later.
        I don't think he's sick of Luke l, just why Disney made him into
            outwardsly, no, of course not. and he clearly takes a lot of pride in the role, i think he will always love Luke and his Star Wars films. But realistically, talking about the same thing every day, no matter how much you love that thing, will wear on you. But Hamill takes it in stride and we'd never be the wiser if he ever is feeling "Star-Wars'd-out" because he always happily engages with his fans about Star Wars, online and in person. What a stud.
                Hamill is actually open about the fact that he's never been a Star Wars fan. What he *is* a fan of is fandoms, the joy of engaging with a fictional setting or fictional characters. He is himself a fan of many "geeky" things and understands how it works on a deep, personal level. Hamill isn't a fan of Luke Skywalker, but he has deep respect and love for others who are, and he will go out of his way to brighten the day for people who geek out over him being Luke. 

Mark Hamill is a treasure.
            It‚Äôs probably the countless star wars fans who never grew up harassing the poor guy
        Mark is also incre√≠ble famous because of The Joker
            yes i am well aware haha. didnt really apply in this context since were mainly talking about the role that typecast Mark, which was Luke. Joker didn't come until later in his career
    Mark Hamill was disappointed when movie producers wont cast him because he is often associated with Luke Skywalker. He turned to voice acting where he is also famous for his roles like the Joker in the Batman animated series
        It was that and the car accident. He‚Äôs talked about it quite a bit and been very open about it.
    Isn‚Äôt it a bit like Harrison Ford being so curmudgeonly about being Han Solo?
        At least Ford is seen as Han Solo and Indiana Jones.
        Harrison Ford is curmudgeonly about everything.
        If I‚Äôd crashed as many antique planes as Ford has I‚Äôd be a general curmudgeon too. That man couldn‚Äôt keep a helium balloon airborne.
    I really appreciate his voice work more than anything. Him and Alan Tudyk are the best Jokers. I think of Mark as a VA before I do Luke Skywalker.
        Mark as the joker is literally peak voice acting. He will always be joker before Luke Skywalker to me
    Mark never said he hated being Luke he hated what Disney turned Luke into for the sequels
He doesn't have to own anything just because other ppl like it. He don't like it, so respect that of him
I think I heard they each got 200k. Would love getting a source here. If this is true I think it's way less than they should have gotten
No way. They probably got paid peanuts. I‚Äôd be surprised if they each got more than like 10-25 thousand for the whole game.

And of course, no residuals whatsoever.
    If the actor for Nico Bellic got paid 100k then the actors for GTA V definitely got more than just 10-25k
        I have no idea about Bellic V.A money. 100.000 dollars for his job? Sounds good for me.
            GTA 4 made hundreds of millions lol
                It‚Äôs extremely uncommon for video game actors to make residuals on the games. Typically they‚Äôre paid a flat fee for their work and that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs also typically not that much, which is bananas since video games are more profitable than film and television combined.
                    Exactly, And this series is HUGE. GTA 5 had records from being the highest earning not just games but in ALL media. 

You‚Äôd think even minor characters would be living large. That‚Äôs happened with plenty of tv shows and movies. GoT actors were making enough to buy a Aventador per episode
                he accepted the job and the pay, then when the game was succesful he started bitching. His problem
                    That was a rumor. He never had beef with rockstar.

But that isn‚Äôt my point. I was making fun of saying 100K sounds good. 

If you were part of a project that literally made 100s of millions, and you only got a 10th of a million, is that really ‚Äúgood‚Äù? üòÇ
                        It's not but if that's what you agree on then that's what you agree on. Also I didn't know it was just a rumor, my bad in that case.
                            Eh don‚Äôt feel bad. I believed it once too especially considering the percentages lmfao. 

He did have beef but it was with his union. He blamed his union entirely since it was their job to take care of him.

When it comes to gta 5 I got no idea how much the actors got for that. 

One thing even though it‚Äôs a bit off topic that really interests me is that no one except rockstar knows who voices Agatha Baker from the casino dlcs. I love mysteries like this but it makes me wonder if it was a large payday
                    god people like you are why scumbags can get away with being scumbags
                        >god people like you are why scumbags can get away with being scumbags

No, it's just literally the facts. He signed a contract guaranteeing him X amount of money for his work, and stipulated no such bonus for game sales or residuals etc. If he wanted those things he should have negotiated them. That's how contracts work. It's not a scumbag move to not pay someone more money they they were contractually guaranteed. It's not like anybody was tricked into being in these games.
                            same thing happened to the writer of the Witcher books, he didn't think the games would make money so he only took the initial pay for the rights and that was that, and then he also started bitching lol
                            Still feel like Rockstar shouldve paid him more for what an awesome job he did. He didnt "bitch" about rockstar. From what i remember he said he blamed his union.

Edit: Just found out he even asked about residuals while negotiating but rockstar said it wasnt a possibility. Thats weird...
                They did do that amount, it's a risk they all take. They couldn't know the game would be a success. They had a indication but couldn't know for sure, so I would say 100K is a fair deal considering your own personal avatar will be in a massive game like this. Just cause of the ladder, I know some who would have done it for less.

If you look deeply through the budget, I would assume that the split is fair. People who have more responsibility need to get payed more, that's how things are these days.
                    "personal avatar" is pretty bad reasoning for low pay though, ignoring everything else about contracts, it's still a job in the end, it would be like starring in a movie but one of the reasonings for the pay not being as high as it could be is because "well your character is in the movie".

Especially when considering the fact that some of these actors aren't interested in games.

Not arguing whether their pay was justified or not just saying having your avatar in a game doesn't excuse a certain pay.
                >GTA 4 made hundreds of millions lol

Yeah, but he accepted a contract that said "You get X amount of money for this work and nothing else." That's what he gets. And it's not as though GTA wasn't already a massive gaming franchise by the time GTAIV released. If Nico's actor wanted more money, or residuals from the game sales, he should have negotiated that before signing a contract. Samuel L Jackson had the foresight to do exactly that.
        I read that, so sure they could‚Äôve got around 100K each. 

But you could also argue Niko was one lead, and with three leads they could dilute the pay among the three. 

My main point was they didn‚Äôt get rich off this alone. 25K was too low. But more than 100K each? I don‚Äôt know about that. Unknown actors usually aren‚Äôt paid much no matter how big the project or role. 

Depends on hours worked, days, maybe it was weekly, or maybe it was a lump sum, etc. 

Of course this is all speculation, before anyone gets absolutely outraged that I dare think these guys didn‚Äôt get rich lol
            They did all the acting work for like 2-3 years. Most movies takes a year or a half to film so $100k+ seems more than likely what they were paid.

 Obviously they were most likely paid more after the game released like when actors are paid a certain percent of the box office. Than again that‚Äôs why Nico‚Äôs voice actor was angry with rockstar for not giving him that percent of cash for being the protagonist
    you are completely delusional
        It's very possible
            no, it‚Äôs not. they were without any doubt paid a very competitive rate for the countless hours they spent working on the project
                You would think they did that for the main voice actor niko Nellie but reportedly id was paid I believe 100K according to some reports without any residuals.
                    sometimes i think people forget how much money 100k really is.
        How so? Why would Rockstar pay these no names a lot of money?
            Luke has been acting for nearly 40 fucking years üíÄ just because YOU never heard of him before GTA doesn't mean nobody else did. Same for Fanteno
                Luke, while a solid actor, was mainly in T.V. shows before GTA gave him his big break.

People only knew Michael was Ned Luke after that first trailer dropped because one of Ned‚Äôs old acting class buddies said so on Twitter. Suffice to say he was more or less undiscovered talent.
                Well Ned has specifically said himself that no one knew him or Shawn or Steven til GTA 5.
        Why do you sound so offended? We‚Äôll never know, and there‚Äôs a dozen variables that could‚Äôve affected their pay. 

In totality, what do you think they made? Certainly not millions. If they each made around 100K, that would be very high. I can definitely see it if it‚Äôs a weekly or hourly pay for all those hours, but I highly doubt they made more than 100K. 

That would probably be the upper limit. 

As far as residuals, that‚Äôs pretty rare for unknown actors in video games. Even if they lead the game. And it‚Äôs usually not disclosed anyway.
            i can‚Äôt help if you think i sound a certain way, but you are simply delusional to be positing the numbers you are and speculating on residuals as if you have any idea
                Have you ever been to an internet forum‚Ä¶ speculating about shit is 99 percent of what we do. You also responded to someone else as if you definitely knew they got paid a lot of money.

Hypocrite lol
>It's that he still expects to make money off of the game and the character while being angry about being recognized for it.

I mean I would be a bit pissed if I played a main character in one of the highest grossing entertainment products of all time and got no residuals, too. CJ and Niko's VA's have both said similar things. It is kind of shitty he was in something like one of the biggest summer blockbusters of all time and maybe got 100k.
    >I mean I would be a bit pissed if I played a main character in one of the highest grossing entertainment products of all time and got no residuals, too.

Then you would have to be pissed at your own agents, or yourself, for not negotiating that into your contract. Samuel L Jackson managed it just fine.
        Wow established multimillionaire A list actor Samuel L. Jackson had the money and connections to get a good contract? That's wild why couldn't Steven Ogg? 

The entire reason they were hired is because they didn't have an agent protecting their interests. The second they try asking for residuals is the second they're replaced. Niko/CJ VA's were both used specifically because they weren't in the VA union. That's just stupid as shit to blame the predatory behavior of a multibillion company on the actors they took advantage of.
            and if you want the royalties and they wont' give them to you then you have two options. Take the job for the money being offered and don't bitch about it after the fact because you signed the contract, or don't take the job.
                "And if you want some royalties from the highest grossing entertainment product of all time, you need to know it's going to be the highest grossing entertainment product of all time beforehand and include it in your contract" okay so Steve invents a time machine like you said and asks for royalties in his contract. Rockstar recasts Trevor.   Gee, great thinking man, why didn't he do that? You're really smart.
                    >"And if you want some royalties from the highest grossing entertainment product of all time, you need to know it's going to be the highest grossing entertainment product of all time beforehand and include it in your contract" okay so Steve invents a time machine like you said and asks for royalties in his contract.

Samuel L Jackson managed to have that kind of foresight and business acumen.

Also, by the way, literally nobody was talking about Steven being upset he didn't get enough money for GTAV. You're conflating the issues of two entirely different people.
                        
>Samuel L Jackson managed to have that kind of hindsight

And why didn't Steve use his millions of dollars and any of the connections he has from his career as an A list actor to get a good contract like Sam L.? Why didn't he do that? Do you know I can't figure this out???

>You're conflating the issues of two entirely different people.

I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to think someone may have negative feelings about a company paying them like $100k and turning around and making $1,000,000,000 off it, but apparently it is for you lol.
                            >I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to think someone may have negative feelings about a company paying them like $100k and turning around and making $1,000,000,000 off it, but apparently it is for you lol.

They knew that was going to be the case before they ever signed on to the game. By the time GTAIV released it was already one of the most successful game franchises in history and was already massively popular. It's not like the actor playing Nico didn't know what GTA was when he signed his contract. 

And again, STEVEN OGG IS NOT THE ONE WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT MONEY FROM ROCKSTAR. You're conflating two entirely people and two entirely different stories.

                        You should look up the difference between voice acting and performance capture.
        Holy shit you have literally zero clue about how the vg voice acting industry actually works.
    So regular people who put in work into any industry that makes money off their work continually should be paid retirement benefits before their of age? If Trevor‚Äôs actor was a real actor then why wasn‚Äôt ray liotta always mentioned for playing Tommy verceti‚Ä¶

                            They're saying that we should in that case pay monthly fee's to rent games so that everyone who worked on them can make ongoing money from it.
    >I mean I would be a bit pissed if I played a main character in one of the highest grossing entertainment products of all time

It's understandable if they got payed peanuts. But if they got 100k for a few weeks/months work, I'd say that's reasonable compensation. 

Cuz let's be honest, the voice actors are only a very small reason that game made billions. Yes they were excellent, but (except for maybe Trevor) hardly irreplaceable, and myriad engineers played a more important role.
        > they got *paid* peanuts. But

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

        as long as rockstar is making a dollar on the game, the key contributors should be pulling in some cents too.

so bonkers when redditors stan for gigantic corporations.

            >what do the stars in a billion dollar movie make? Usually millions.

Yeah but only if they're well known and their name is likely to sell the film. I agree with your point that Vidya actors are underappreciated, but their reputations (unless they've achieved fame in film) almost never contribute to a game's sale.
                [deleted]
                    Yeah *now* she's worth millions because now she's recognizable. Do you think she got paid more than a mil for the first film? I doubt it. I imagine she got paid less than a quarter mil, as is the norm for unknown leads in indies and horror films.
    That‚Äôs how work for hire works though. Every VA knows that.
But it‚Äôs the same with a music artist hating their most popular song cause they have to keep performing it & feel they‚Äôve done better since. It‚Äôs no foreign concept and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs grateful, just irritated by aspects of it
Why is that a problem though? He's far from the only case of an actor hating that they're *only* known for one popular thing, rather than their diverse portfolio that often includes roles they liked more. And many of those would be people getting paid residuals years or even decades after the initial showing.

Steven Ogg does not appear to get residuals, or royalties from this game. He stopped making money the day he recorded his last session. Where did you get the idea he still "expects" to make money from it?
    >Where did you get the idea he still "expects" to make money from it?

When he accepted money on Cameo from people asking him to do a Trevor impersonation for them and instead he took the opportunity to chastise said individuals for not recognizing him as an actor who does other things besides Trevor and refused to do the "impersonation." 

Taking the money and then bitching about it made me lose a ton of respect for him.
        So because he did something on cameo, which is clearly him *not* wanting to be associated with Trevor...that means he still wants to be associated with Trevor?

If he actually just took the money then he'd be shut down. I've read an article about the incident (one incident, btw, you're saying "people" like it's a recurring theme) and the implication is that he did the cameo, he just put the rant in front of it.
Damnnnnnnnnnnnn
He was also in The Wash with DJ Pooh as the kidnappers.
Ahhh, nepotism.  Isn't it wonderful?
Which I think was his hang up. I think he loved playing Trevor but he didn‚Äôt want to be exclusively associated with him. Even though he always will be to a point.
    The shows I‚Äôve seen him in he just plays a downplayed version of Trevor.
        Because so often he gets type casted as a villain. He was unknown before GTA 5 and it will take a very different role for him to break that mould

Aaron Paul will always be Jesse Pinkman

Kit Harington will always be Jon Snow

Some actors can change things up but what made them famous often sticks.
            Daniel Radcliffe will always be Weird Al Yankovic.
                You mean that guy from Guns Akimbo? Man, what a chameleon.
                    I think you‚Äôre meaning that guy from Horns
                        Isn't he the little guy from Lord of the Rings?
                            I think they call them Ewoks
                    Swiss Army Man, really shows his range ü§£
                Incidentally, I think he purposely went for the most anti-harry potter roles he could find, just so he wouldn't be known as Harry Potter.
                    He was once quoted saying the best thing he bought with his Harry Potter money was his career. He's set for life, so he literally just acts for fun now and exclusively picks roles and movies he has a strong interest in.
                    That‚Äôs called ‚Äúworking against type‚Äù. Will Smith tried to do it with Hancock; when you‚Äôve been typecast as a certain archetype, doing the reverse shows that range.

It‚Äôs like when wrestlers go heel to face also!
                        Yep. Steven Ogg got typecast for a while because of it. I think, he's also frustrated that he can't move on from that sort of role because his most succcessful one is GTAV.
                Idk man whenever I see him I think if that time he played a magical farting corpse.
                    Fans of *Everything, Everywhere, All At Once* really ought to see *Swiss Army Man* since its by the same Daniels.
                        It even includes a bonus Daniel
                He also played Sam Houser
                I think you misspelled *‚Äúa flatulent corpse‚Äù*
            Jerry Seinfeld will always be Jerry Seinfeld
            Aaron Paul played Todd in Bojack Horseman, and I didn't realize until my second or third watch. I honestly couldn't tell.
            So he doesn't want to be associated with trevor but actively chooses roles that have him play trevor-lite. No one is forcing this man to take these roles.
                Roles that aren‚Äôt exactly what you want are better than no roles I would assume, but I‚Äôm not his manager who knows what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes.
                    He‚Äôs probably just pissed that he‚Äôll forever be known as trailer park trash man instead of Daniel Day Lewis or something. It‚Äôs pretty stupid because at the end of the day it doesn‚Äôt really matter.
                        To him it‚Äôs a big deal. He‚Äôs said himself Trevor is the exact opposite of his personality and that irl he thinks he‚Äôs a pretty nice guy. Imagine you go your whole life not being rude and mean to people unnecessarily but then every time someone recognizes you they want you to call them a slur or scream at them.
                Money
            I wonder if he was cast in the walking dead before or after V?
                It was after, probably by about 3 or 4 years or so iirc.
                    Yeah I just looked up that s7 dropped in 2016 so something like that
                Before(?)
                    I never followed TWD when it was airing so I wasn't sure
                I was trying to figure out how the protagonist from Cyberpunk 2077 fit into all of this before I realized you guys are just shortening GTAV. 


Jesus
            Chris evans as captain America and Tom Middleton as Loki
        Yep. Simon (The Walking Dead) was basically Trevor if Trevor didn‚Äôt mind taking orders
            His character in Better Call Saul is Trevor if he was a bit more cleaned up.
        >The shows I‚Äôve seen him in he just plays a downplayed version of Trevor.

Because he's not really that good of an actor. He has basically the one performance that he can do, and a few variations on that same performance, and that's it. Every character he ends up playing just becomes Trevor.
        THIS.
Yeah, he was great in Better Call Saul.
    Shhhh careful saying that. Some people on this sub think because he hasn't got a role bigger than Trevor then he doesn't have an acting career.
        How long was his arc on Better Call Saul? Let me know how that is a bigger role than Trevor. I‚Äôll wait.
            Fuck you got me I guess he doesn't have an acting career.
                Just pointing out the flawed argument. Trevor is still his biggest role and it‚Äôs not even close.
                    You should've kept reading what I posted. I acknowledge Trevor is his biggest role but people on this sub think that means he doesn't have an acting career.
            How long was his arc? Bro, use proper industry terminology lmao. He was BILLED/(hired) as a guest star, which has limited episode appearances as opposed to recurring or a series regular. 

And that character arc was him trying to show up Mike and being humbled by the end of the scene. That‚Äôs a literal character arc. Source: Syd Fields
What acting career? Dude was in two shows and basically played the same character in both. He should be thankful for GTA and take advantage of it.
    Yeah he's not a leading man but he's been getting consistent work (more than the two shows you've seen. Check his imdb). I think that qualifies as a career. As oppose to say doing a voice for a video game character then just doing conventions and tik tok videos for the next 10 years.
        Say the line Bart.
            You forgot a thou-
                ![gif](giphy|G9Kj87gLF8Z4A)
        Exactly. People seem to think that if you‚Äôre not headlining a show as an actor than that automatically means you‚Äôre not doing anything. I‚Äôm glad Ogg is doing stuff instead of riding the convention train but more power to Luke and Fonteno if they want to do that .
            Reminds me of Kirsten Dunst in an interview a few years back: Where they asked her where‚Äôs she been and she‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been in a bunch of stuff. It‚Äôs not like you have to be in major blockbusters for every movie
        Exactly, if I was Steven I‚Äôd pursue my own career too instead of the other route.
        Ehhh i wouldn‚Äôt say consistent. He hasn‚Äôt actually done all thar much but he appeared in some big shows/films in the last 2 years that rated well. But as i said to someone else, Steven doesn‚Äôt care all thar much about all about the role of Trevor. It was clearly just another job to him but it did well for him. He is a bit crazy it seems judging by his Instagram but he does have his own business and does have a cameo too. Though he isn‚Äôt the first actor to be known for one thing and just completely forget about it after a period of time has gone by, look at Daniel Radcliffe, that dude has done everything he possibly can to avoid being only represented as Harry Potter even though it will ONLY be his most famous role
    He's been in 26 films and 17 TV shows what the fuck are you talking about?
        He's been in Witness Protection from a certain australian who is known for a lack of sleeves and paying seven hundred and two dollars for a big mac.
        They mean the stuff that they watch. Regulars ever accounts indie work as actual work
    Do you think all actors are major movie stars?
    Just because someone wasn't in some big budget marvel movie doesn't mean they dont have a career
    I think he is thankful for sure. Between the shows I've seen him in (The Walking Dead, Better Call Saul, and Westworld) you're right that he's played a very similar, unhinged asshole kind of character. Each has been similar to Trevor in their own right, but I think he's an actor that doesn't want to be pigeonholed by a single role. Similar to Rainn Wilson and Dwight. They're thankful for the fans and the experience of the role, but they don't want to be "known" as Dwight or Trevor. They want to be known for their work.
    He can do whatever he wants
    2 shows that you‚Äôve saw. He‚Äôs got a lot in the pipeline as well. Just because he wants to distance himself from it doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt thankful.
        Is he thankful though? He set up a cameo, and when people told him to act like Trevor he was a huge jerk and got annoyed. Like why even accept that then, what else were people going to request? He obviously has an ego problem and some extremely negative view of the video game industry as an art medium.

Only role anyone else knows him for is that tiny one in better call Saul and Simon in walking dead.
            Yep. Dude is a straight up asshole.
                Bit harsh.
                    I can only go by from what I‚Äôve seen of him in interviews and such. Maybe he‚Äôs a great dude but he doesn‚Äôt have a favorable image to his biggest fan base.
            He was in westworld and boiling point as well off the top off my head. About the cameo thing, haven‚Äôt seen it, but wasn‚Äôt Trevor a huge jerk and got really annoyed?
                Yeah but he was genuinely pissed for the cameo, it wasn‚Äôt acting or a part of it

https://youtu.be/nK_EpVPHPF0?feature=shared
            Probably wanted people to think he, himself was cool and impressive, not just his character he plays idk
            Trevor is one of the most mediocre characters in the history of gta, and you just like him because of the surprise factor and the contrast with the other two boring clich√©s, I can see how you can get to hate playing such a character, even Claude is much more interesting, and he doesn't even need to talk.
    Exactly. The dude has NO versatility in his acting. He gets on these shows and acts exactly like Trevor then has the audacity to get upset at people for thinking he‚Äôs some great actor. Dude just whines about it he sucks
    I didn't even know that guy was Trevor. You'd be surprised out how many people don't play GTAV, or only played through it, put it away, and never thought about it again.

I'm sure he is thankful for GTA, maybe not so thankful for the people that think if he doesn't pop into his Trevor character whenever they see him he's an asshole.
    But window licking morons shouldn't be calling him Trevor when meeting him in person because that's not his name üôÑ I'd find it irritating too.
    This kind of ignorant arrogance from the community is why he's in the right for distancing himself.
    Someone whos never heard of typecasting i see
    Shut up, idiot.
I think he didn't know how much of an impact that game was going to have on his career. And when you get overshadowed by your own self and find it hard to get a career because you're known as the Trevor guy I could see how that could be aggravating.
Yeah but he‚Äôs being a complete dick about it by borderline mocking fans who talk to him about it
    I'll agree that's not cool. But I wonder how long he had to deal with belligerent fans before he had enough or maybe he was always a dick.
        You should never mock your fans in that line of work people like Steven need to realise that it‚Äôs partly the fans who made us career and got him famous and he may not like being Trevor but he should still realise that‚Äôs what made him and that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs most known for
            The ironic part is him being a dick to fans is a Trevor move.
                While that is true it doesn‚Äôt make it right or maybe one day he‚Äôll come out and say that he was just acting the entire time
what do you think was more popular . gta 5 or the walking dead tv show
    Gta 5
    I'm not debating which is more popular. I'm giving him credit for not sitting back and riding the gta 5 popularity. He's out trying to work.
    I mean, Walking Dead is pretty huge.
        thats why i think ogg has been established as an actor . he was in the show awhile ago .
            Oh I apologize I thought you were making the opposite point.
You can still keep up with your older work and still progress your career. The fact is Steven just doesn‚Äôt care enough about his role as Trevor. And if you have seen his Instagram, you would see he has gone a bit doolally wile also running his own business of sorts. He does have a cameo though so it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if he does do Trevor content on there.
How is that a bad thing?
What acting career never seen him on anything except you tube where he cry‚Äôs about being asked to play Trevor
    Ah so because youve never seen him on anything that means he's not acting. I've never seen an Alfred Hitchcock movie so I guess he's not a director.
        But you know who he is like everybody does next to no one knows who Steven ogg is who hasn‚Äôt played gta
            So he's not a big name. Doesn't mean he's not working.
                Still only known for Trevor
                    Still acting...
He‚Äôs lucky he‚Äôs known for anything. Fame is fame.
    Are you joking.  Do you seriously not know who Stephen Ogg is?
He's a great actor that's been in several major shows and movies, wtf are y'all talking about?
    That's the issue, GTA made him be known as Trevor Phillips when I think, at the end of the day, he just wants to be known as Steven Ogg and not constantly hounded for Trevor quotes. I think, he enjoyed being trevor for the first few years but got fed up with the constantly requests to tell people to fuck off or act like Trevor when he has moved on.

Though, the cameo stuff is a bit iffy.
        He can be Steven Ogg all he wants.  His problem is that nobody cares and he's bitter about it.
He was a nobody before trevor.
    He was in 7 films and 4 shows before Trevor. Just because that's the role you know him most as doesn't mean he needs to hold that role up amongst all the others.  He's a working actor and owes you And GTA nothing.
        He doesn't owe me shit but acting like he was al pacino before gta is delusional. He owes everything to gta.

>7 films and 4 shows

Basically nothing and guess what he played the exact same character 12 times including gta.
            Ahh so you're now claiming to have seen all of his roles.  You're a joke and I'm out.

Also GTA is a blip on his career. Not all actors are stars.  But he's been a successful working actor for decades.
                Oh fuck off he was no al pacino before he still isn't. He is just some asshole who yells at people because to his surprise people know him as one of the most popular character ever created.
                    The fact that I say working actor and Al Pacino is the only guy you think of shows you don't know enough about the industry to have this conversation. 

Have a good one dude.  You'll laugh at this when you grow up.
                        I was saying al pacino because you know scarface.

Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, Christian Bale, Ryan Reynolds anybody on game of thrones when it aired are vastly more succesful than him and still working. He is an asshole with nothing significant except gta.
                            Not a single one of those people is what the industry calls a "working actor". Thank you for confirming you don't know what you're talking about.  I'm out.
            He owes absolutely nothing to GTA or to GTA fans. He's a human being.
                He owes his fame and a shit ton of money he got from rockstar for that project. I don't mean he should actually give money to people but he is standing on that and you know it as well.
                    lol Knowing how R* pays their VA‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not so sure about that
                        Yeah I exaggerated about a shit tone lets say a fairly good amount due to residual and along the fame he got. Whether he likes it or not he owes his popularity to gta he should stop acting like an asshole saying he doesn't like it and then post nasty shit on ig just like trevor would. Both actors for Michael and Franklin says this too.
But that hairline go back.
    Man that shits whack
    They nerfed us in the patch. Can't have youthful skin AND a great hairline
        My bald spot lookin like Jupiter's Great Brown Spot.
That's because crack is whack

Oh fuck off steven ogg. boo hoo you signed up for a massive role as a mean crazy guy and you‚Äôre surprised that‚Äôs how people know you.
    [removed]
        Well maybe he shouldn't portray himself that way in every piece of media he's involved with including his own deranged social media. Guy is unintentionally stuck playing Trevor. His fault.
            Still no reason to be rude
                Tell him that. He thinks games are for nerds and losers. Fuck this douchebag ass actor that can only play one role
                    Again, no reason to be rude
                        No reason not to... guys making money and never gonna see it who gives a fuck
                            Meh
Maybe he‚Äôs doing an Andy Kaufman and cultivating a persona to openly troll people with.
    I hope so. But it is kind of sad that Ned Luke and Shawn Fonteno no longer follow Steven Ogg on IG and vice versa. It has been going on for a while but last time I checked Steve and Shawn were still following each other but not anymore. I understand not wanting to ge typecast but to have disdain for a character you portrayed is odd to me.
        I think he posted about some mental health stuff on Twitter back in 2017-2018. I don't about the ig stuff but that's a thing too.
            Some of his posts are concerning....his mannerisms, the way he talks. As someone who faces severe depression every now and then, I guess I can kind of see it in him. Or he is that good of an actor.
I had to go check it out based on what others have said about it too. It's got like borderline schizo energy. I wonder if Ogg is doing okay. I feel bad for the guy being so widely known as only Trevor. But at the same time, he did such a killer job that it's almost impossible to not be associated with such a huge character. 

I was really excited to see him on Better Call Saul even though it was brief.
    I too am a bit concerned about his mannerisms and body language in some of his posts. Either that or he is just that good of an actor. 

Loved his minor appearance in Better Call Saul. Also The Walking Dead declined but I watched the episodes he was in and he was great, even in the Negan spinoffs. He is a great actor with a lot of potential and I wish him the best.
        Yeah, for all we know, it could be a huge trolling thing. Or it could be performance art. Who really knows but him?

I never watch Walking Dead so I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. Lol
            In The Walking Dead (show declined but I kept watching for some reason), Steven Ogg plays the right-hand man of a major villain and it was great. He pretty much out-villains the main villain. Pretty much a more serious, more evil Trevor lol.
                Oh dang. That sounds badass haha. I just don't know if I could get into the Walking Dead. I'm not really into the whole zombie thing.
He Calls it art. Which I can see.
Wait who were they?
Ogg never actually was in the game
>[ogg](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Laramie_gang_leader#:~:text=Despite%20speculation%20that%20the%20Laramie,did%20not%20voice%20the%20character.)
    That wasn't Steven Ogg
        that's what I meant, the website I linked talks about how it's not him lol
Actually no he didn't it's a common misconception simply because the voice sounds similar but that guy in the RDR 2 epilogue isn't Steven ogg
Did they do new roles or like ancestors of their GTA V characters?
    new roles.
They brought Claude back in San Andreas and had multiple missions relating around him
    "***rarely***" not never.
        Victor

And Johnny

I just realized that most times when rockstar brings back protagonists from previous games it's normally to kill them off
Wdym? If you mean his unhinged-ness, it was there to show how dangerous Trevor coming back into Michael's life was- at any minute, Trevor could find out Michael's lies and do something to put his family in danger. It also served as a contrast where somehow, the most dangerous and off the handle character was the most loyal.
It‚Äôs because he‚Äôs one of those Gen Xers that just doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù video games so he doesn‚Äôt respect it as a media form. I think he said as much himself that he doesn‚Äôt understand why people would ‚Äúsit in front of a TV and play a cartoon instead of doing something else‚Äù. My dad is about his age and is the same way.
    It‚Äôs kinda funny that his job literally requires people to sit in front of a TV tho lol
    Imagine claiming Gen X doesn't get videogames
        Most do, but there‚Äôs still a decent subset of them that just don‚Äôt- which makes sense because they‚Äôre the last generation alive that didn‚Äôt really have more the immersive games in their childhood like we all got from like 2000 onwards. 

Listen to Steven himself if you don‚Äôt believe me: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8sHaUYD/
            My sibling in Christ, we literally grew up playing Atari, Coleco, Nintendo, Sega, PlayStation, Xbox, suped up PCs, every possible chance we got, not to mention all the quarters we spent at video arcades. Even older 1960s-born Gen X were hip to the latest video game tech. I absolutely can NOT with this
                 Well I didn‚Äôt say EVERY Gen Xer did I? I said a subset of you all- SOME of you. My father was born in 68 and is just like Steven in terms of seeing games as child‚Äôs toys.

Whereas for the 30 and younger crowd, video games are almost a universal activity- I would wager it‚Äôs probably like over 90% of the <30 crowd regularly play  games to like 60% of Gen Xers or something, just guessing.
                And the people who did that shit back then were called nerds, losers, and bullied because of it. Just because it existed back then doesn‚Äôt mean everyone who lived concurrently accepted or understood it.
I mean no he didn‚Äôt have to play Trevor but I can‚Äôt image he fore saw how his character would take off. 

I‚Äôm not saying I agree with him basically saying fuck off to the character as someone whose been a fan of Trevor but looking at it from an objective standpoint i do get why he isn‚Äôt too fond of the character after a decade and wanting to move on. 

Hell there was even a point Toby Maguire hated being attached to Spider-Man but came around on his own free will. 

We can‚Äôt make the man like the role he played and I‚Äôll even play devils advocate and say he doesn‚Äôt owe it to anyone to do so. 

He ain‚Äôt the first gta voice actor who had beef with the role / company later down the line (ray liotta) he might not be the last either and at this point we gotta separate the art from the artist.

I can enjoy Trevor and just not attach it to Steven because while he was the voice and model he‚Äôs not him and has moved on in his career which he deserves to do. 

He ain‚Äôt the first typecast actor to end up hating the character that put him on the map and he is far from the last.

Who knows maybe in the future with enough time he‚Äôll come back around to the character but regardless I appreciate Trevor as a character and I‚Äôm glad steven was apart of the game, I don‚Äôt think anyone else could of delivered the level of unhinged needed like he did lol
    The fella who played Obi Wan in the original Star Wars was warned that he would be known for it. He got annoyed that people overlooked his other works.
Ah okay - thanks for filling me in, had no idea he felt that way.
Lol stevens actually coming back at a game expo with Ned and Shawn ppl need to stay up to date
Sure thing Trev
For real, I was shocked when I found out that he was the voice of paarthurnax in Skyrim
He was [defending AI art](https://x.com/ned_luke/status/1749222539161653458?s=46&t=XZMzrBA_-x-90DRCAvWuQQ) and people called him out for it.
    Ai art really isn't a bad thing like maybe if a guys disabled he could use it or someone who sucks at drawing but has a great imagination and ai art makes it come true so it's not completely bad ü§∑
    Huh, okay

Facts dude my bad I should have commented something funnier and more original like literally just linking another subreddit and nothing else
    That's right, you b-blithering fool!
    No problem i think i was a dick with that comment, nice joke btw.
Well, he is a real actor. GTA was a high profile job but it was just that, a job. Some actors want to be known for their body of work because we train in different disciplines to show off that range. Some like being one hit wonders, some don‚Äôt. 

Especially screen actors. I don‚Äôt think gamers should take that as an insult anymore than a coworker who likes their job is offended by someone resigning
    Fair but unfortunately for him he got involved in one of the like 3 most popular single game titles of all time lmao
    LOL he‚Äôs no damn actor! Ray liotta was an actor
        Ogg‚Äôs performance as Trevor is a million times what Liotta‚Äôs as Tommy was. Love Tommy and Liotta but the dude is so checked out in VC (starts showing more enthusiasm after shakedown though)
            Who was Tommy‚Äôs competition? A mute cluade‚Ä¶ pretty sure if Tommy was a methed out over the top character with as much dialogue as Trevor, ray liotta would of done a better job simply because he‚Äôs the better actor
                I mean to my point, Tommy kinda already IS an over the top maniac, it just doesn‚Äôt always come across. He‚Äôs one of the most evil GTA protags (next to Trevor and maybe Toni C) and one of the only ones to show no form of remorse whatsoever. The game literally ends with him calling himself a mass murdering psychotic killer with a big cheese-eating grin on his face watching the sunset (it‚Äôs fucking hysterical, and perfect for the game‚Äôs themes for the record)

But he doesn‚Äôt always come across that way because half the time Liotta‚Äôs screaming his angry lines like a maniac (as he should imo) and the other half it sounds like he‚Äôs been at the nyquil. Tommy‚Äôs calm wise-guy thing is only surface deep. He‚Äôs clearly fiercely intelligent but his uncontrollable rage makes him slightly unhinged
                I won‚Äôt argue with you that Liotta is the better actor, but Liotta didn‚Äôt respect the material enough to do anything more than royally phone it in, regardless of what he was given to work with.
Yeah it‚Äôs actually so disrespectful towards the gaming industry tbh

If he wanted to be a "real actor" why the hell would he take a job as a voice actor?
Or how Alec Guinness felt about Star Wars.
    Alex Guinness is fantastic in Lawrence of Arabia.
        I thought he was great in the role of Marley‚Äôs ghost in Scrooge as well
            It's so rare for someone to reference that particular version of A Christmas Carol!
    Toss Ford in too. Dude hates star wars lol
        He doesn‚Äôt hate Star Wars, just doesn‚Äôt like how they handled it and Han after the first movie more than anything. Definitely doesn‚Äôt hate it like Alec Guinness lol
        At least he's also Indy. He's known for *two* acts of work.
    Didn't stop him from making a ton of money on the movie
There's a really good video where they play Creep in 2016, and the lead guitarist has this horrified look on his face because nobody told him they were doing it.
I've heard Kenny Loggins never accepted being the guy who did Danger Zone and loathes that it's his #1 song. Makes sense I guess, he was just the performer for a track made by the movie studio, but being the guy behind Footloose or Caddyshack isn't any better to me.
Yeah, I don't understand people who hate on him
He had some cameos recently where people asked him to essentially play Trevor in the cameo, and he was clearly not into it and throwing shade at the request, saying Trevor is a cartoon character. That's probably what they're referring to
    Eh, that‚Äôs also his sense of humour, based on previous interviews with him. Plus, it‚Äôs logical that he doesn‚Äôt care much to imitate a performance he did once 12 years ago
        He took money for doing a half assed comission in which he complained about being remebered as Trevor for like 5 minutes. He shouldn't take the money if he doesn't like it
That's fair but he 100% got that roll in TWD because of gta
Books by Stephen Ogg:  
I am not Trevor!  
I am Trevor!  
I am also Lamar!
It's almost been 15 yrs, lol. In 4 more years, believe it or not, it'll be 2028. GTA 5 gon be 15 yrs, old by then.
    He meant ask him 15 years from now.
They've both stated as such.
thats what i really respect about Mark. He's had an incredible career in spite of being "typecast" for a large part of it, yet never lost reverence for the character and the films that made him a star in the first place. He gladly engages with fans about Star Wars all the time, despite the fact that on the downlow he's probably sick of it. Ogg is a great actor and I will always adore his role as Trevor but I wish he could accept that it's not a bad thing to have a role so iconic that people wanna talk about it 10 years later.
    I don't think he's sick of Luke l, just why Disney made him into
        outwardsly, no, of course not. and he clearly takes a lot of pride in the role, i think he will always love Luke and his Star Wars films. But realistically, talking about the same thing every day, no matter how much you love that thing, will wear on you. But Hamill takes it in stride and we'd never be the wiser if he ever is feeling "Star-Wars'd-out" because he always happily engages with his fans about Star Wars, online and in person. What a stud.
            Hamill is actually open about the fact that he's never been a Star Wars fan. What he *is* a fan of is fandoms, the joy of engaging with a fictional setting or fictional characters. He is himself a fan of many "geeky" things and understands how it works on a deep, personal level. Hamill isn't a fan of Luke Skywalker, but he has deep respect and love for others who are, and he will go out of his way to brighten the day for people who geek out over him being Luke. 

Mark Hamill is a treasure.
        It‚Äôs probably the countless star wars fans who never grew up harassing the poor guy
    Mark is also incre√≠ble famous because of The Joker
        yes i am well aware haha. didnt really apply in this context since were mainly talking about the role that typecast Mark, which was Luke. Joker didn't come until later in his career
Mark Hamill was disappointed when movie producers wont cast him because he is often associated with Luke Skywalker. He turned to voice acting where he is also famous for his roles like the Joker in the Batman animated series
    It was that and the car accident. He‚Äôs talked about it quite a bit and been very open about it.
Isn‚Äôt it a bit like Harrison Ford being so curmudgeonly about being Han Solo?
    At least Ford is seen as Han Solo and Indiana Jones.
    Harrison Ford is curmudgeonly about everything.
    If I‚Äôd crashed as many antique planes as Ford has I‚Äôd be a general curmudgeon too. That man couldn‚Äôt keep a helium balloon airborne.
I really appreciate his voice work more than anything. Him and Alan Tudyk are the best Jokers. I think of Mark as a VA before I do Luke Skywalker.
    Mark as the joker is literally peak voice acting. He will always be joker before Luke Skywalker to me
Mark never said he hated being Luke he hated what Disney turned Luke into for the sequels
If the actor for Nico Bellic got paid 100k then the actors for GTA V definitely got more than just 10-25k
    I have no idea about Bellic V.A money. 100.000 dollars for his job? Sounds good for me.
        GTA 4 made hundreds of millions lol
            It‚Äôs extremely uncommon for video game actors to make residuals on the games. Typically they‚Äôre paid a flat fee for their work and that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs also typically not that much, which is bananas since video games are more profitable than film and television combined.
                Exactly, And this series is HUGE. GTA 5 had records from being the highest earning not just games but in ALL media. 

You‚Äôd think even minor characters would be living large. That‚Äôs happened with plenty of tv shows and movies. GoT actors were making enough to buy a Aventador per episode
            he accepted the job and the pay, then when the game was succesful he started bitching. His problem
                That was a rumor. He never had beef with rockstar.

But that isn‚Äôt my point. I was making fun of saying 100K sounds good. 

If you were part of a project that literally made 100s of millions, and you only got a 10th of a million, is that really ‚Äúgood‚Äù? üòÇ
                    It's not but if that's what you agree on then that's what you agree on. Also I didn't know it was just a rumor, my bad in that case.
                        Eh don‚Äôt feel bad. I believed it once too especially considering the percentages lmfao. 

He did have beef but it was with his union. He blamed his union entirely since it was their job to take care of him.

When it comes to gta 5 I got no idea how much the actors got for that. 

One thing even though it‚Äôs a bit off topic that really interests me is that no one except rockstar knows who voices Agatha Baker from the casino dlcs. I love mysteries like this but it makes me wonder if it was a large payday
                god people like you are why scumbags can get away with being scumbags
                    >god people like you are why scumbags can get away with being scumbags

No, it's just literally the facts. He signed a contract guaranteeing him X amount of money for his work, and stipulated no such bonus for game sales or residuals etc. If he wanted those things he should have negotiated them. That's how contracts work. It's not a scumbag move to not pay someone more money they they were contractually guaranteed. It's not like anybody was tricked into being in these games.
                        same thing happened to the writer of the Witcher books, he didn't think the games would make money so he only took the initial pay for the rights and that was that, and then he also started bitching lol
                        Still feel like Rockstar shouldve paid him more for what an awesome job he did. He didnt "bitch" about rockstar. From what i remember he said he blamed his union.

Edit: Just found out he even asked about residuals while negotiating but rockstar said it wasnt a possibility. Thats weird...
            They did do that amount, it's a risk they all take. They couldn't know the game would be a success. They had a indication but couldn't know for sure, so I would say 100K is a fair deal considering your own personal avatar will be in a massive game like this. Just cause of the ladder, I know some who would have done it for less.

If you look deeply through the budget, I would assume that the split is fair. People who have more responsibility need to get payed more, that's how things are these days.
                "personal avatar" is pretty bad reasoning for low pay though, ignoring everything else about contracts, it's still a job in the end, it would be like starring in a movie but one of the reasonings for the pay not being as high as it could be is because "well your character is in the movie".

Especially when considering the fact that some of these actors aren't interested in games.

Not arguing whether their pay was justified or not just saying having your avatar in a game doesn't excuse a certain pay.
            >GTA 4 made hundreds of millions lol

Yeah, but he accepted a contract that said "You get X amount of money for this work and nothing else." That's what he gets. And it's not as though GTA wasn't already a massive gaming franchise by the time GTAIV released. If Nico's actor wanted more money, or residuals from the game sales, he should have negotiated that before signing a contract. Samuel L Jackson had the foresight to do exactly that.
    I read that, so sure they could‚Äôve got around 100K each. 

But you could also argue Niko was one lead, and with three leads they could dilute the pay among the three. 

My main point was they didn‚Äôt get rich off this alone. 25K was too low. But more than 100K each? I don‚Äôt know about that. Unknown actors usually aren‚Äôt paid much no matter how big the project or role. 

Depends on hours worked, days, maybe it was weekly, or maybe it was a lump sum, etc. 

Of course this is all speculation, before anyone gets absolutely outraged that I dare think these guys didn‚Äôt get rich lol
        They did all the acting work for like 2-3 years. Most movies takes a year or a half to film so $100k+ seems more than likely what they were paid.

 Obviously they were most likely paid more after the game released like when actors are paid a certain percent of the box office. Than again that‚Äôs why Nico‚Äôs voice actor was angry with rockstar for not giving him that percent of cash for being the protagonist
you are completely delusional
    It's very possible
        no, it‚Äôs not. they were without any doubt paid a very competitive rate for the countless hours they spent working on the project
            You would think they did that for the main voice actor niko Nellie but reportedly id was paid I believe 100K according to some reports without any residuals.
                sometimes i think people forget how much money 100k really is.
    How so? Why would Rockstar pay these no names a lot of money?
        Luke has been acting for nearly 40 fucking years üíÄ just because YOU never heard of him before GTA doesn't mean nobody else did. Same for Fanteno
            Luke, while a solid actor, was mainly in T.V. shows before GTA gave him his big break.

People only knew Michael was Ned Luke after that first trailer dropped because one of Ned‚Äôs old acting class buddies said so on Twitter. Suffice to say he was more or less undiscovered talent.
            Well Ned has specifically said himself that no one knew him or Shawn or Steven til GTA 5.
    Why do you sound so offended? We‚Äôll never know, and there‚Äôs a dozen variables that could‚Äôve affected their pay. 

In totality, what do you think they made? Certainly not millions. If they each made around 100K, that would be very high. I can definitely see it if it‚Äôs a weekly or hourly pay for all those hours, but I highly doubt they made more than 100K. 

That would probably be the upper limit. 

As far as residuals, that‚Äôs pretty rare for unknown actors in video games. Even if they lead the game. And it‚Äôs usually not disclosed anyway.
        i can‚Äôt help if you think i sound a certain way, but you are simply delusional to be positing the numbers you are and speculating on residuals as if you have any idea
            Have you ever been to an internet forum‚Ä¶ speculating about shit is 99 percent of what we do. You also responded to someone else as if you definitely knew they got paid a lot of money.

Hypocrite lol
>I mean I would be a bit pissed if I played a main character in one of the highest grossing entertainment products of all time and got no residuals, too.

Then you would have to be pissed at your own agents, or yourself, for not negotiating that into your contract. Samuel L Jackson managed it just fine.
    Wow established multimillionaire A list actor Samuel L. Jackson had the money and connections to get a good contract? That's wild why couldn't Steven Ogg? 

The entire reason they were hired is because they didn't have an agent protecting their interests. The second they try asking for residuals is the second they're replaced. Niko/CJ VA's were both used specifically because they weren't in the VA union. That's just stupid as shit to blame the predatory behavior of a multibillion company on the actors they took advantage of.
        and if you want the royalties and they wont' give them to you then you have two options. Take the job for the money being offered and don't bitch about it after the fact because you signed the contract, or don't take the job.
            "And if you want some royalties from the highest grossing entertainment product of all time, you need to know it's going to be the highest grossing entertainment product of all time beforehand and include it in your contract" okay so Steve invents a time machine like you said and asks for royalties in his contract. Rockstar recasts Trevor.   Gee, great thinking man, why didn't he do that? You're really smart.
                >"And if you want some royalties from the highest grossing entertainment product of all time, you need to know it's going to be the highest grossing entertainment product of all time beforehand and include it in your contract" okay so Steve invents a time machine like you said and asks for royalties in his contract.

Samuel L Jackson managed to have that kind of foresight and business acumen.

Also, by the way, literally nobody was talking about Steven being upset he didn't get enough money for GTAV. You're conflating the issues of two entirely different people.
                    
>Samuel L Jackson managed to have that kind of hindsight

And why didn't Steve use his millions of dollars and any of the connections he has from his career as an A list actor to get a good contract like Sam L.? Why didn't he do that? Do you know I can't figure this out???

>You're conflating the issues of two entirely different people.

I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to think someone may have negative feelings about a company paying them like $100k and turning around and making $1,000,000,000 off it, but apparently it is for you lol.
                        >I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to think someone may have negative feelings about a company paying them like $100k and turning around and making $1,000,000,000 off it, but apparently it is for you lol.

They knew that was going to be the case before they ever signed on to the game. By the time GTAIV released it was already one of the most successful game franchises in history and was already massively popular. It's not like the actor playing Nico didn't know what GTA was when he signed his contract. 

And again, STEVEN OGG IS NOT THE ONE WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT MONEY FROM ROCKSTAR. You're conflating two entirely people and two entirely different stories.
        Samual Jackson was an established a list celebrity/actor, what movie had Trevor actor been in let alone main character üòÇ? That‚Äôs the difference gta needed Sam Jackson and Trevor‚Äôs actor needed GTA‚Ä¶

                    You should look up the difference between voice acting and performance capture.
    Holy shit you have literally zero clue about how the vg voice acting industry actually works.
So regular people who put in work into any industry that makes money off their work continually should be paid retirement benefits before their of age? If Trevor‚Äôs actor was a real actor then why wasn‚Äôt ray liotta always mentioned for playing Tommy verceti‚Ä¶

        He was already paid for said work thought, so by your point of view we should buy games/GTAV every month and not own them because we don‚Äôt ‚Äúpay residuals‚Äù ???

                        They're saying that we should in that case pay monthly fee's to rent games so that everyone who worked on them can make ongoing money from it.
>I mean I would be a bit pissed if I played a main character in one of the highest grossing entertainment products of all time

It's understandable if they got payed peanuts. But if they got 100k for a few weeks/months work, I'd say that's reasonable compensation. 

Cuz let's be honest, the voice actors are only a very small reason that game made billions. Yes they were excellent, but (except for maybe Trevor) hardly irreplaceable, and myriad engineers played a more important role.
    > they got *paid* peanuts. But

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*
        Stfu grammar Nazi bot
    as long as rockstar is making a dollar on the game, the key contributors should be pulling in some cents too.

so bonkers when redditors stan for gigantic corporations.
    [deleted]
        >what do the stars in a billion dollar movie make? Usually millions.

Yeah but only if they're well known and their name is likely to sell the film. I agree with your point that Vidya actors are underappreciated, but their reputations (unless they've achieved fame in film) almost never contribute to a game's sale.
            [deleted]
                Yeah *now* she's worth millions because now she's recognizable. Do you think she got paid more than a mil for the first film? I doubt it. I imagine she got paid less than a quarter mil, as is the norm for unknown leads in indies and horror films.
That‚Äôs how work for hire works though. Every VA knows that.
>Where did you get the idea he still "expects" to make money from it?

When he accepted money on Cameo from people asking him to do a Trevor impersonation for them and instead he took the opportunity to chastise said individuals for not recognizing him as an actor who does other things besides Trevor and refused to do the "impersonation." 

Taking the money and then bitching about it made me lose a ton of respect for him.
    So because he did something on cameo, which is clearly him *not* wanting to be associated with Trevor...that means he still wants to be associated with Trevor?

If he actually just took the money then he'd be shut down. I've read an article about the incident (one incident, btw, you're saying "people" like it's a recurring theme) and the implication is that he did the cameo, he just put the rant in front of it.
The shows I‚Äôve seen him in he just plays a downplayed version of Trevor.
    Because so often he gets type casted as a villain. He was unknown before GTA 5 and it will take a very different role for him to break that mould

Aaron Paul will always be Jesse Pinkman

Kit Harington will always be Jon Snow

Some actors can change things up but what made them famous often sticks.
        Daniel Radcliffe will always be Weird Al Yankovic.
            You mean that guy from Guns Akimbo? Man, what a chameleon.
                I think you‚Äôre meaning that guy from Horns
                    Isn't he the little guy from Lord of the Rings?
                        I think they call them Ewoks
                Swiss Army Man, really shows his range ü§£
            Incidentally, I think he purposely went for the most anti-harry potter roles he could find, just so he wouldn't be known as Harry Potter.
                He was once quoted saying the best thing he bought with his Harry Potter money was his career. He's set for life, so he literally just acts for fun now and exclusively picks roles and movies he has a strong interest in.
                That‚Äôs called ‚Äúworking against type‚Äù. Will Smith tried to do it with Hancock; when you‚Äôve been typecast as a certain archetype, doing the reverse shows that range.

It‚Äôs like when wrestlers go heel to face also!
                    Yep. Steven Ogg got typecast for a while because of it. I think, he's also frustrated that he can't move on from that sort of role because his most succcessful one is GTAV.
            Idk man whenever I see him I think if that time he played a magical farting corpse.
                Fans of *Everything, Everywhere, All At Once* really ought to see *Swiss Army Man* since its by the same Daniels.
                    It even includes a bonus Daniel
            He also played Sam Houser
            I think you misspelled *‚Äúa flatulent corpse‚Äù*
        Jerry Seinfeld will always be Jerry Seinfeld
        Aaron Paul played Todd in Bojack Horseman, and I didn't realize until my second or third watch. I honestly couldn't tell.
        So he doesn't want to be associated with trevor but actively chooses roles that have him play trevor-lite. No one is forcing this man to take these roles.
            Roles that aren‚Äôt exactly what you want are better than no roles I would assume, but I‚Äôm not his manager who knows what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes.
                He‚Äôs probably just pissed that he‚Äôll forever be known as trailer park trash man instead of Daniel Day Lewis or something. It‚Äôs pretty stupid because at the end of the day it doesn‚Äôt really matter.
                    To him it‚Äôs a big deal. He‚Äôs said himself Trevor is the exact opposite of his personality and that irl he thinks he‚Äôs a pretty nice guy. Imagine you go your whole life not being rude and mean to people unnecessarily but then every time someone recognizes you they want you to call them a slur or scream at them.
            Money
        I wonder if he was cast in the walking dead before or after V?
            It was after, probably by about 3 or 4 years or so iirc.
                Yeah I just looked up that s7 dropped in 2016 so something like that
            Before(?)
                I never followed TWD when it was airing so I wasn't sure
            I was trying to figure out how the protagonist from Cyberpunk 2077 fit into all of this before I realized you guys are just shortening GTAV. 


Jesus
        Chris evans as captain America and Tom Middleton as Loki
    Yep. Simon (The Walking Dead) was basically Trevor if Trevor didn‚Äôt mind taking orders
        His character in Better Call Saul is Trevor if he was a bit more cleaned up.
    >The shows I‚Äôve seen him in he just plays a downplayed version of Trevor.

Because he's not really that good of an actor. He has basically the one performance that he can do, and a few variations on that same performance, and that's it. Every character he ends up playing just becomes Trevor.
    THIS.
Shhhh careful saying that. Some people on this sub think because he hasn't got a role bigger than Trevor then he doesn't have an acting career.
    How long was his arc on Better Call Saul? Let me know how that is a bigger role than Trevor. I‚Äôll wait.
        Fuck you got me I guess he doesn't have an acting career.
            Just pointing out the flawed argument. Trevor is still his biggest role and it‚Äôs not even close.
                You should've kept reading what I posted. I acknowledge Trevor is his biggest role but people on this sub think that means he doesn't have an acting career.
        How long was his arc? Bro, use proper industry terminology lmao. He was BILLED/(hired) as a guest star, which has limited episode appearances as opposed to recurring or a series regular. 

And that character arc was him trying to show up Mike and being humbled by the end of the scene. That‚Äôs a literal character arc. Source: Syd Fields
Yeah he's not a leading man but he's been getting consistent work (more than the two shows you've seen. Check his imdb). I think that qualifies as a career. As oppose to say doing a voice for a video game character then just doing conventions and tik tok videos for the next 10 years.
    Say the line Bart.
        You forgot a thou-
            ![gif](giphy|G9Kj87gLF8Z4A)
    Exactly. People seem to think that if you‚Äôre not headlining a show as an actor than that automatically means you‚Äôre not doing anything. I‚Äôm glad Ogg is doing stuff instead of riding the convention train but more power to Luke and Fonteno if they want to do that .
        Reminds me of Kirsten Dunst in an interview a few years back: Where they asked her where‚Äôs she been and she‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been in a bunch of stuff. It‚Äôs not like you have to be in major blockbusters for every movie
    Exactly, if I was Steven I‚Äôd pursue my own career too instead of the other route.
    Ehhh i wouldn‚Äôt say consistent. He hasn‚Äôt actually done all thar much but he appeared in some big shows/films in the last 2 years that rated well. But as i said to someone else, Steven doesn‚Äôt care all thar much about all about the role of Trevor. It was clearly just another job to him but it did well for him. He is a bit crazy it seems judging by his Instagram but he does have his own business and does have a cameo too. Though he isn‚Äôt the first actor to be known for one thing and just completely forget about it after a period of time has gone by, look at Daniel Radcliffe, that dude has done everything he possibly can to avoid being only represented as Harry Potter even though it will ONLY be his most famous role
He's been in 26 films and 17 TV shows what the fuck are you talking about?
    He's been in Witness Protection from a certain australian who is known for a lack of sleeves and paying seven hundred and two dollars for a big mac.
    They mean the stuff that they watch. Regulars ever accounts indie work as actual work
Do you think all actors are major movie stars?
Just because someone wasn't in some big budget marvel movie doesn't mean they dont have a career
I think he is thankful for sure. Between the shows I've seen him in (The Walking Dead, Better Call Saul, and Westworld) you're right that he's played a very similar, unhinged asshole kind of character. Each has been similar to Trevor in their own right, but I think he's an actor that doesn't want to be pigeonholed by a single role. Similar to Rainn Wilson and Dwight. They're thankful for the fans and the experience of the role, but they don't want to be "known" as Dwight or Trevor. They want to be known for their work.
He can do whatever he wants
2 shows that you‚Äôve saw. He‚Äôs got a lot in the pipeline as well. Just because he wants to distance himself from it doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt thankful.
    Is he thankful though? He set up a cameo, and when people told him to act like Trevor he was a huge jerk and got annoyed. Like why even accept that then, what else were people going to request? He obviously has an ego problem and some extremely negative view of the video game industry as an art medium.

Only role anyone else knows him for is that tiny one in better call Saul and Simon in walking dead.
        Yep. Dude is a straight up asshole.
            Bit harsh.
                I can only go by from what I‚Äôve seen of him in interviews and such. Maybe he‚Äôs a great dude but he doesn‚Äôt have a favorable image to his biggest fan base.
        He was in westworld and boiling point as well off the top off my head. About the cameo thing, haven‚Äôt seen it, but wasn‚Äôt Trevor a huge jerk and got really annoyed?
            Yeah but he was genuinely pissed for the cameo, it wasn‚Äôt acting or a part of it

https://youtu.be/nK_EpVPHPF0?feature=shared
        Probably wanted people to think he, himself was cool and impressive, not just his character he plays idk
        Trevor is one of the most mediocre characters in the history of gta, and you just like him because of the surprise factor and the contrast with the other two boring clich√©s, I can see how you can get to hate playing such a character, even Claude is much more interesting, and he doesn't even need to talk.
Exactly. The dude has NO versatility in his acting. He gets on these shows and acts exactly like Trevor then has the audacity to get upset at people for thinking he‚Äôs some great actor. Dude just whines about it he sucks
I didn't even know that guy was Trevor. You'd be surprised out how many people don't play GTAV, or only played through it, put it away, and never thought about it again.

I'm sure he is thankful for GTA, maybe not so thankful for the people that think if he doesn't pop into his Trevor character whenever they see him he's an asshole.
But window licking morons shouldn't be calling him Trevor when meeting him in person because that's not his name üôÑ I'd find it irritating too.
This kind of ignorant arrogance from the community is why he's in the right for distancing himself.
Someone whos never heard of typecasting i see
Shut up, idiot.
I'll agree that's not cool. But I wonder how long he had to deal with belligerent fans before he had enough or maybe he was always a dick.
    You should never mock your fans in that line of work people like Steven need to realise that it‚Äôs partly the fans who made us career and got him famous and he may not like being Trevor but he should still realise that‚Äôs what made him and that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs most known for
        The ironic part is him being a dick to fans is a Trevor move.
            While that is true it doesn‚Äôt make it right or maybe one day he‚Äôll come out and say that he was just acting the entire time
Gta 5
I'm not debating which is more popular. I'm giving him credit for not sitting back and riding the gta 5 popularity. He's out trying to work.
I mean, Walking Dead is pretty huge.
    thats why i think ogg has been established as an actor . he was in the show awhile ago .
        Oh I apologize I thought you were making the opposite point.
Ah so because youve never seen him on anything that means he's not acting. I've never seen an Alfred Hitchcock movie so I guess he's not a director.
    But you know who he is like everybody does next to no one knows who Steven ogg is who hasn‚Äôt played gta
        So he's not a big name. Doesn't mean he's not working.
            Still only known for Trevor
                Still acting...
Are you joking.  Do you seriously not know who Stephen Ogg is?
That's the issue, GTA made him be known as Trevor Phillips when I think, at the end of the day, he just wants to be known as Steven Ogg and not constantly hounded for Trevor quotes. I think, he enjoyed being trevor for the first few years but got fed up with the constantly requests to tell people to fuck off or act like Trevor when he has moved on.

Though, the cameo stuff is a bit iffy.
    He can be Steven Ogg all he wants.  His problem is that nobody cares and he's bitter about it.
He was in 7 films and 4 shows before Trevor. Just because that's the role you know him most as doesn't mean he needs to hold that role up amongst all the others.  He's a working actor and owes you And GTA nothing.
    He doesn't owe me shit but acting like he was al pacino before gta is delusional. He owes everything to gta.

>7 films and 4 shows

Basically nothing and guess what he played the exact same character 12 times including gta.
        Ahh so you're now claiming to have seen all of his roles.  You're a joke and I'm out.

Also GTA is a blip on his career. Not all actors are stars.  But he's been a successful working actor for decades.
            Oh fuck off he was no al pacino before he still isn't. He is just some asshole who yells at people because to his surprise people know him as one of the most popular character ever created.
                The fact that I say working actor and Al Pacino is the only guy you think of shows you don't know enough about the industry to have this conversation. 

Have a good one dude.  You'll laugh at this when you grow up.
                    I was saying al pacino because you know scarface.

Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, Christian Bale, Ryan Reynolds anybody on game of thrones when it aired are vastly more succesful than him and still working. He is an asshole with nothing significant except gta.
                        Not a single one of those people is what the industry calls a "working actor". Thank you for confirming you don't know what you're talking about.  I'm out.
        He owes absolutely nothing to GTA or to GTA fans. He's a human being.
            He owes his fame and a shit ton of money he got from rockstar for that project. I don't mean he should actually give money to people but he is standing on that and you know it as well.
                lol Knowing how R* pays their VA‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not so sure about that
                    Yeah I exaggerated about a shit tone lets say a fairly good amount due to residual and along the fame he got. Whether he likes it or not he owes his popularity to gta he should stop acting like an asshole saying he doesn't like it and then post nasty shit on ig just like trevor would. Both actors for Michael and Franklin says this too.
Man that shits whack

    Well maybe he shouldn't portray himself that way in every piece of media he's involved with including his own deranged social media. Guy is unintentionally stuck playing Trevor. His fault.
        Still no reason to be rude
            Tell him that. He thinks games are for nerds and losers. Fuck this douchebag ass actor that can only play one role
                Again, no reason to be rude
                    No reason not to... guys making money and never gonna see it who gives a fuck
                        Meh
I hope so. But it is kind of sad that Ned Luke and Shawn Fonteno no longer follow Steven Ogg on IG and vice versa. It has been going on for a while but last time I checked Steve and Shawn were still following each other but not anymore. I understand not wanting to ge typecast but to have disdain for a character you portrayed is odd to me.
    I think he posted about some mental health stuff on Twitter back in 2017-2018. I don't about the ig stuff but that's a thing too.
        Some of his posts are concerning....his mannerisms, the way he talks. As someone who faces severe depression every now and then, I guess I can kind of see it in him. Or he is that good of an actor.
I too am a bit concerned about his mannerisms and body language in some of his posts. Either that or he is just that good of an actor. 

Loved his minor appearance in Better Call Saul. Also The Walking Dead declined but I watched the episodes he was in and he was great, even in the Negan spinoffs. He is a great actor with a lot of potential and I wish him the best.
    Yeah, for all we know, it could be a huge trolling thing. Or it could be performance art. Who really knows but him?

I never watch Walking Dead so I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. Lol
        In The Walking Dead (show declined but I kept watching for some reason), Steven Ogg plays the right-hand man of a major villain and it was great. He pretty much out-villains the main villain. Pretty much a more serious, more evil Trevor lol.
            Oh dang. That sounds badass haha. I just don't know if I could get into the Walking Dead. I'm not really into the whole zombie thing.
That wasn't Steven Ogg
    that's what I meant, the website I linked talks about how it's not him lol
new roles.
"***rarely***" not never.
    Victor

And Johnny

I just realized that most times when rockstar brings back protagonists from previous games it's normally to kill them off
It‚Äôs kinda funny that his job literally requires people to sit in front of a TV tho lol
Imagine claiming Gen X doesn't get videogames
    Most do, but there‚Äôs still a decent subset of them that just don‚Äôt- which makes sense because they‚Äôre the last generation alive that didn‚Äôt really have more the immersive games in their childhood like we all got from like 2000 onwards. 

Listen to Steven himself if you don‚Äôt believe me: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8sHaUYD/
        My sibling in Christ, we literally grew up playing Atari, Coleco, Nintendo, Sega, PlayStation, Xbox, suped up PCs, every possible chance we got, not to mention all the quarters we spent at video arcades. Even older 1960s-born Gen X were hip to the latest video game tech. I absolutely can NOT with this
             Well I didn‚Äôt say EVERY Gen Xer did I? I said a subset of you all- SOME of you. My father was born in 68 and is just like Steven in terms of seeing games as child‚Äôs toys.

Whereas for the 30 and younger crowd, video games are almost a universal activity- I would wager it‚Äôs probably like over 90% of the <30 crowd regularly play  games to like 60% of Gen Xers or something, just guessing.
            And the people who did that shit back then were called nerds, losers, and bullied because of it. Just because it existed back then doesn‚Äôt mean everyone who lived concurrently accepted or understood it.
The fella who played Obi Wan in the original Star Wars was warned that he would be known for it. He got annoyed that people overlooked his other works.
Ai art really isn't a bad thing like maybe if a guys disabled he could use it or someone who sucks at drawing but has a great imagination and ai art makes it come true so it's not completely bad ü§∑

That's right, you b-blithering fool!
No problem i think i was a dick with that comment, nice joke btw.
Fair but unfortunately for him he got involved in one of the like 3 most popular single game titles of all time lmao
LOL he‚Äôs no damn actor! Ray liotta was an actor
    Ogg‚Äôs performance as Trevor is a million times what Liotta‚Äôs as Tommy was. Love Tommy and Liotta but the dude is so checked out in VC (starts showing more enthusiasm after shakedown though)
        Who was Tommy‚Äôs competition? A mute cluade‚Ä¶ pretty sure if Tommy was a methed out over the top character with as much dialogue as Trevor, ray liotta would of done a better job simply because he‚Äôs the better actor
            I mean to my point, Tommy kinda already IS an over the top maniac, it just doesn‚Äôt always come across. He‚Äôs one of the most evil GTA protags (next to Trevor and maybe Toni C) and one of the only ones to show no form of remorse whatsoever. The game literally ends with him calling himself a mass murdering psychotic killer with a big cheese-eating grin on his face watching the sunset (it‚Äôs fucking hysterical, and perfect for the game‚Äôs themes for the record)

But he doesn‚Äôt always come across that way because half the time Liotta‚Äôs screaming his angry lines like a maniac (as he should imo) and the other half it sounds like he‚Äôs been at the nyquil. Tommy‚Äôs calm wise-guy thing is only surface deep. He‚Äôs clearly fiercely intelligent but his uncontrollable rage makes him slightly unhinged
            I won‚Äôt argue with you that Liotta is the better actor, but Liotta didn‚Äôt respect the material enough to do anything more than royally phone it in, regardless of what he was given to work with.

    Stop disrespecting my vidya gane, Steve üò°üò°üò°
Alex Guinness is fantastic in Lawrence of Arabia.
    I thought he was great in the role of Marley‚Äôs ghost in Scrooge as well
        It's so rare for someone to reference that particular version of A Christmas Carol!
Toss Ford in too. Dude hates star wars lol
    He doesn‚Äôt hate Star Wars, just doesn‚Äôt like how they handled it and Han after the first movie more than anything. Definitely doesn‚Äôt hate it like Alec Guinness lol
    At least he's also Indy. He's known for *two* acts of work.
Didn't stop him from making a ton of money on the movie
Eh, that‚Äôs also his sense of humour, based on previous interviews with him. Plus, it‚Äôs logical that he doesn‚Äôt care much to imitate a performance he did once 12 years ago
    He took money for doing a half assed comission in which he complained about being remebered as Trevor for like 5 minutes. He shouldn't take the money if he doesn't like it
He meant ask him 15 years from now.
I don't think he's sick of Luke l, just why Disney made him into
    outwardsly, no, of course not. and he clearly takes a lot of pride in the role, i think he will always love Luke and his Star Wars films. But realistically, talking about the same thing every day, no matter how much you love that thing, will wear on you. But Hamill takes it in stride and we'd never be the wiser if he ever is feeling "Star-Wars'd-out" because he always happily engages with his fans about Star Wars, online and in person. What a stud.
        Hamill is actually open about the fact that he's never been a Star Wars fan. What he *is* a fan of is fandoms, the joy of engaging with a fictional setting or fictional characters. He is himself a fan of many "geeky" things and understands how it works on a deep, personal level. Hamill isn't a fan of Luke Skywalker, but he has deep respect and love for others who are, and he will go out of his way to brighten the day for people who geek out over him being Luke. 

Mark Hamill is a treasure.
    It‚Äôs probably the countless star wars fans who never grew up harassing the poor guy
Mark is also incre√≠ble famous because of The Joker
    yes i am well aware haha. didnt really apply in this context since were mainly talking about the role that typecast Mark, which was Luke. Joker didn't come until later in his career
It was that and the car accident. He‚Äôs talked about it quite a bit and been very open about it.
At least Ford is seen as Han Solo and Indiana Jones.
Harrison Ford is curmudgeonly about everything.
If I‚Äôd crashed as many antique planes as Ford has I‚Äôd be a general curmudgeon too. That man couldn‚Äôt keep a helium balloon airborne.
Mark as the joker is literally peak voice acting. He will always be joker before Luke Skywalker to me
I have no idea about Bellic V.A money. 100.000 dollars for his job? Sounds good for me.
    GTA 4 made hundreds of millions lol
        It‚Äôs extremely uncommon for video game actors to make residuals on the games. Typically they‚Äôre paid a flat fee for their work and that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs also typically not that much, which is bananas since video games are more profitable than film and television combined.
            Exactly, And this series is HUGE. GTA 5 had records from being the highest earning not just games but in ALL media. 

You‚Äôd think even minor characters would be living large. That‚Äôs happened with plenty of tv shows and movies. GoT actors were making enough to buy a Aventador per episode
        he accepted the job and the pay, then when the game was succesful he started bitching. His problem
            That was a rumor. He never had beef with rockstar.

But that isn‚Äôt my point. I was making fun of saying 100K sounds good. 

If you were part of a project that literally made 100s of millions, and you only got a 10th of a million, is that really ‚Äúgood‚Äù? üòÇ
                It's not but if that's what you agree on then that's what you agree on. Also I didn't know it was just a rumor, my bad in that case.
                    Eh don‚Äôt feel bad. I believed it once too especially considering the percentages lmfao. 

He did have beef but it was with his union. He blamed his union entirely since it was their job to take care of him.

When it comes to gta 5 I got no idea how much the actors got for that. 

One thing even though it‚Äôs a bit off topic that really interests me is that no one except rockstar knows who voices Agatha Baker from the casino dlcs. I love mysteries like this but it makes me wonder if it was a large payday
            god people like you are why scumbags can get away with being scumbags
                >god people like you are why scumbags can get away with being scumbags

No, it's just literally the facts. He signed a contract guaranteeing him X amount of money for his work, and stipulated no such bonus for game sales or residuals etc. If he wanted those things he should have negotiated them. That's how contracts work. It's not a scumbag move to not pay someone more money they they were contractually guaranteed. It's not like anybody was tricked into being in these games.
                    same thing happened to the writer of the Witcher books, he didn't think the games would make money so he only took the initial pay for the rights and that was that, and then he also started bitching lol
                    Still feel like Rockstar shouldve paid him more for what an awesome job he did. He didnt "bitch" about rockstar. From what i remember he said he blamed his union.

Edit: Just found out he even asked about residuals while negotiating but rockstar said it wasnt a possibility. Thats weird...
        They did do that amount, it's a risk they all take. They couldn't know the game would be a success. They had a indication but couldn't know for sure, so I would say 100K is a fair deal considering your own personal avatar will be in a massive game like this. Just cause of the ladder, I know some who would have done it for less.

If you look deeply through the budget, I would assume that the split is fair. People who have more responsibility need to get payed more, that's how things are these days.
            "personal avatar" is pretty bad reasoning for low pay though, ignoring everything else about contracts, it's still a job in the end, it would be like starring in a movie but one of the reasonings for the pay not being as high as it could be is because "well your character is in the movie".

Especially when considering the fact that some of these actors aren't interested in games.

Not arguing whether their pay was justified or not just saying having your avatar in a game doesn't excuse a certain pay.
        >GTA 4 made hundreds of millions lol

Yeah, but he accepted a contract that said "You get X amount of money for this work and nothing else." That's what he gets. And it's not as though GTA wasn't already a massive gaming franchise by the time GTAIV released. If Nico's actor wanted more money, or residuals from the game sales, he should have negotiated that before signing a contract. Samuel L Jackson had the foresight to do exactly that.
I read that, so sure they could‚Äôve got around 100K each. 

But you could also argue Niko was one lead, and with three leads they could dilute the pay among the three. 

My main point was they didn‚Äôt get rich off this alone. 25K was too low. But more than 100K each? I don‚Äôt know about that. Unknown actors usually aren‚Äôt paid much no matter how big the project or role. 

Depends on hours worked, days, maybe it was weekly, or maybe it was a lump sum, etc. 

Of course this is all speculation, before anyone gets absolutely outraged that I dare think these guys didn‚Äôt get rich lol
    They did all the acting work for like 2-3 years. Most movies takes a year or a half to film so $100k+ seems more than likely what they were paid.

 Obviously they were most likely paid more after the game released like when actors are paid a certain percent of the box office. Than again that‚Äôs why Nico‚Äôs voice actor was angry with rockstar for not giving him that percent of cash for being the protagonist
It's very possible
    no, it‚Äôs not. they were without any doubt paid a very competitive rate for the countless hours they spent working on the project
        You would think they did that for the main voice actor niko Nellie but reportedly id was paid I believe 100K according to some reports without any residuals.
            sometimes i think people forget how much money 100k really is.
How so? Why would Rockstar pay these no names a lot of money?
    Luke has been acting for nearly 40 fucking years üíÄ just because YOU never heard of him before GTA doesn't mean nobody else did. Same for Fanteno
        Luke, while a solid actor, was mainly in T.V. shows before GTA gave him his big break.

People only knew Michael was Ned Luke after that first trailer dropped because one of Ned‚Äôs old acting class buddies said so on Twitter. Suffice to say he was more or less undiscovered talent.
        Well Ned has specifically said himself that no one knew him or Shawn or Steven til GTA 5.
Why do you sound so offended? We‚Äôll never know, and there‚Äôs a dozen variables that could‚Äôve affected their pay. 

In totality, what do you think they made? Certainly not millions. If they each made around 100K, that would be very high. I can definitely see it if it‚Äôs a weekly or hourly pay for all those hours, but I highly doubt they made more than 100K. 

That would probably be the upper limit. 

As far as residuals, that‚Äôs pretty rare for unknown actors in video games. Even if they lead the game. And it‚Äôs usually not disclosed anyway.
    i can‚Äôt help if you think i sound a certain way, but you are simply delusional to be positing the numbers you are and speculating on residuals as if you have any idea
        Have you ever been to an internet forum‚Ä¶ speculating about shit is 99 percent of what we do. You also responded to someone else as if you definitely knew they got paid a lot of money.

Hypocrite lol
Wow established multimillionaire A list actor Samuel L. Jackson had the money and connections to get a good contract? That's wild why couldn't Steven Ogg? 

The entire reason they were hired is because they didn't have an agent protecting their interests. The second they try asking for residuals is the second they're replaced. Niko/CJ VA's were both used specifically because they weren't in the VA union. That's just stupid as shit to blame the predatory behavior of a multibillion company on the actors they took advantage of.
    and if you want the royalties and they wont' give them to you then you have two options. Take the job for the money being offered and don't bitch about it after the fact because you signed the contract, or don't take the job.
        "And if you want some royalties from the highest grossing entertainment product of all time, you need to know it's going to be the highest grossing entertainment product of all time beforehand and include it in your contract" okay so Steve invents a time machine like you said and asks for royalties in his contract. Rockstar recasts Trevor.   Gee, great thinking man, why didn't he do that? You're really smart.
            >"And if you want some royalties from the highest grossing entertainment product of all time, you need to know it's going to be the highest grossing entertainment product of all time beforehand and include it in your contract" okay so Steve invents a time machine like you said and asks for royalties in his contract.

Samuel L Jackson managed to have that kind of foresight and business acumen.

Also, by the way, literally nobody was talking about Steven being upset he didn't get enough money for GTAV. You're conflating the issues of two entirely different people.
                
>Samuel L Jackson managed to have that kind of hindsight

And why didn't Steve use his millions of dollars and any of the connections he has from his career as an A list actor to get a good contract like Sam L.? Why didn't he do that? Do you know I can't figure this out???

>You're conflating the issues of two entirely different people.

I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to think someone may have negative feelings about a company paying them like $100k and turning around and making $1,000,000,000 off it, but apparently it is for you lol.

They knew that was going to be the case before they ever signed on to the game. By the time GTAIV released it was already one of the most successful game franchises in history and was already massively popular. It's not like the actor playing Nico didn't know what GTA was when he signed his contract. 

And again, STEVEN OGG IS NOT THE ONE WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT MONEY FROM ROCKSTAR. You're conflating two entirely people and two entirely different stories.

                You should look up the difference between voice acting and performance capture.
Holy shit you have literally zero clue about how the vg voice acting industry actually works.

                    They're saying that we should in that case pay monthly fee's to rent games so that everyone who worked on them can make ongoing money from it.
> they got *paid* peanuts. But

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

as long as rockstar is making a dollar on the game, the key contributors should be pulling in some cents too.

so bonkers when redditors stan for gigantic corporations.
[deleted]
    >what do the stars in a billion dollar movie make? Usually millions.

Yeah but only if they're well known and their name is likely to sell the film. I agree with your point that Vidya actors are underappreciated, but their reputations (unless they've achieved fame in film) almost never contribute to a game's sale.
        [deleted]
            Yeah *now* she's worth millions because now she's recognizable. Do you think she got paid more than a mil for the first film? I doubt it. I imagine she got paid less than a quarter mil, as is the norm for unknown leads in indies and horror films.
So because he did something on cameo, which is clearly him *not* wanting to be associated with Trevor...that means he still wants to be associated with Trevor?

If he actually just took the money then he'd be shut down. I've read an article about the incident (one incident, btw, you're saying "people" like it's a recurring theme) and the implication is that he did the cameo, he just put the rant in front of it.
Because so often he gets type casted as a villain. He was unknown before GTA 5 and it will take a very different role for him to break that mould

Aaron Paul will always be Jesse Pinkman

Kit Harington will always be Jon Snow

Some actors can change things up but what made them famous often sticks.
    Daniel Radcliffe will always be Weird Al Yankovic.
        You mean that guy from Guns Akimbo? Man, what a chameleon.
            I think you‚Äôre meaning that guy from Horns
                Isn't he the little guy from Lord of the Rings?
                    I think they call them Ewoks
            Swiss Army Man, really shows his range ü§£
        Incidentally, I think he purposely went for the most anti-harry potter roles he could find, just so he wouldn't be known as Harry Potter.
            He was once quoted saying the best thing he bought with his Harry Potter money was his career. He's set for life, so he literally just acts for fun now and exclusively picks roles and movies he has a strong interest in.
            That‚Äôs called ‚Äúworking against type‚Äù. Will Smith tried to do it with Hancock; when you‚Äôve been typecast as a certain archetype, doing the reverse shows that range.

It‚Äôs like when wrestlers go heel to face also!
                Yep. Steven Ogg got typecast for a while because of it. I think, he's also frustrated that he can't move on from that sort of role because his most succcessful one is GTAV.
        Idk man whenever I see him I think if that time he played a magical farting corpse.
            Fans of *Everything, Everywhere, All At Once* really ought to see *Swiss Army Man* since its by the same Daniels.
                It even includes a bonus Daniel
        He also played Sam Houser
        I think you misspelled *‚Äúa flatulent corpse‚Äù*
    Jerry Seinfeld will always be Jerry Seinfeld
    Aaron Paul played Todd in Bojack Horseman, and I didn't realize until my second or third watch. I honestly couldn't tell.
    So he doesn't want to be associated with trevor but actively chooses roles that have him play trevor-lite. No one is forcing this man to take these roles.
        Roles that aren‚Äôt exactly what you want are better than no roles I would assume, but I‚Äôm not his manager who knows what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes.
            He‚Äôs probably just pissed that he‚Äôll forever be known as trailer park trash man instead of Daniel Day Lewis or something. It‚Äôs pretty stupid because at the end of the day it doesn‚Äôt really matter.
                To him it‚Äôs a big deal. He‚Äôs said himself Trevor is the exact opposite of his personality and that irl he thinks he‚Äôs a pretty nice guy. Imagine you go your whole life not being rude and mean to people unnecessarily but then every time someone recognizes you they want you to call them a slur or scream at them.
        Money
    I wonder if he was cast in the walking dead before or after V?
        It was after, probably by about 3 or 4 years or so iirc.
            Yeah I just looked up that s7 dropped in 2016 so something like that
        Before(?)
            I never followed TWD when it was airing so I wasn't sure
        I was trying to figure out how the protagonist from Cyberpunk 2077 fit into all of this before I realized you guys are just shortening GTAV. 


Jesus
    Chris evans as captain America and Tom Middleton as Loki
Yep. Simon (The Walking Dead) was basically Trevor if Trevor didn‚Äôt mind taking orders
    His character in Better Call Saul is Trevor if he was a bit more cleaned up.
>The shows I‚Äôve seen him in he just plays a downplayed version of Trevor.

Because he's not really that good of an actor. He has basically the one performance that he can do, and a few variations on that same performance, and that's it. Every character he ends up playing just becomes Trevor.
THIS.
How long was his arc on Better Call Saul? Let me know how that is a bigger role than Trevor. I‚Äôll wait.
    Fuck you got me I guess he doesn't have an acting career.
        Just pointing out the flawed argument. Trevor is still his biggest role and it‚Äôs not even close.
            You should've kept reading what I posted. I acknowledge Trevor is his biggest role but people on this sub think that means he doesn't have an acting career.
    How long was his arc? Bro, use proper industry terminology lmao. He was BILLED/(hired) as a guest star, which has limited episode appearances as opposed to recurring or a series regular. 

And that character arc was him trying to show up Mike and being humbled by the end of the scene. That‚Äôs a literal character arc. Source: Syd Fields
Say the line Bart.
    You forgot a thou-
        ![gif](giphy|G9Kj87gLF8Z4A)
Exactly. People seem to think that if you‚Äôre not headlining a show as an actor than that automatically means you‚Äôre not doing anything. I‚Äôm glad Ogg is doing stuff instead of riding the convention train but more power to Luke and Fonteno if they want to do that .
    Reminds me of Kirsten Dunst in an interview a few years back: Where they asked her where‚Äôs she been and she‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been in a bunch of stuff. It‚Äôs not like you have to be in major blockbusters for every movie
Exactly, if I was Steven I‚Äôd pursue my own career too instead of the other route.
Ehhh i wouldn‚Äôt say consistent. He hasn‚Äôt actually done all thar much but he appeared in some big shows/films in the last 2 years that rated well. But as i said to someone else, Steven doesn‚Äôt care all thar much about all about the role of Trevor. It was clearly just another job to him but it did well for him. He is a bit crazy it seems judging by his Instagram but he does have his own business and does have a cameo too. Though he isn‚Äôt the first actor to be known for one thing and just completely forget about it after a period of time has gone by, look at Daniel Radcliffe, that dude has done everything he possibly can to avoid being only represented as Harry Potter even though it will ONLY be his most famous role
He's been in Witness Protection from a certain australian who is known for a lack of sleeves and paying seven hundred and two dollars for a big mac.
They mean the stuff that they watch. Regulars ever accounts indie work as actual work
Is he thankful though? He set up a cameo, and when people told him to act like Trevor he was a huge jerk and got annoyed. Like why even accept that then, what else were people going to request? He obviously has an ego problem and some extremely negative view of the video game industry as an art medium.

Only role anyone else knows him for is that tiny one in better call Saul and Simon in walking dead.
    Yep. Dude is a straight up asshole.
        Bit harsh.
            I can only go by from what I‚Äôve seen of him in interviews and such. Maybe he‚Äôs a great dude but he doesn‚Äôt have a favorable image to his biggest fan base.
    He was in westworld and boiling point as well off the top off my head. About the cameo thing, haven‚Äôt seen it, but wasn‚Äôt Trevor a huge jerk and got really annoyed?
        Yeah but he was genuinely pissed for the cameo, it wasn‚Äôt acting or a part of it

https://youtu.be/nK_EpVPHPF0?feature=shared
    Probably wanted people to think he, himself was cool and impressive, not just his character he plays idk
    Trevor is one of the most mediocre characters in the history of gta, and you just like him because of the surprise factor and the contrast with the other two boring clich√©s, I can see how you can get to hate playing such a character, even Claude is much more interesting, and he doesn't even need to talk.
You should never mock your fans in that line of work people like Steven need to realise that it‚Äôs partly the fans who made us career and got him famous and he may not like being Trevor but he should still realise that‚Äôs what made him and that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs most known for
    The ironic part is him being a dick to fans is a Trevor move.
        While that is true it doesn‚Äôt make it right or maybe one day he‚Äôll come out and say that he was just acting the entire time
thats why i think ogg has been established as an actor . he was in the show awhile ago .
    Oh I apologize I thought you were making the opposite point.
But you know who he is like everybody does next to no one knows who Steven ogg is who hasn‚Äôt played gta
    So he's not a big name. Doesn't mean he's not working.
        Still only known for Trevor
            Still acting...
He can be Steven Ogg all he wants.  His problem is that nobody cares and he's bitter about it.
He doesn't owe me shit but acting like he was al pacino before gta is delusional. He owes everything to gta.

>7 films and 4 shows

Basically nothing and guess what he played the exact same character 12 times including gta.
    Ahh so you're now claiming to have seen all of his roles.  You're a joke and I'm out.

Also GTA is a blip on his career. Not all actors are stars.  But he's been a successful working actor for decades.
        Oh fuck off he was no al pacino before he still isn't. He is just some asshole who yells at people because to his surprise people know him as one of the most popular character ever created.
            The fact that I say working actor and Al Pacino is the only guy you think of shows you don't know enough about the industry to have this conversation. 

Have a good one dude.  You'll laugh at this when you grow up.
                I was saying al pacino because you know scarface.

Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, Christian Bale, Ryan Reynolds anybody on game of thrones when it aired are vastly more succesful than him and still working. He is an asshole with nothing significant except gta.
                    Not a single one of those people is what the industry calls a "working actor". Thank you for confirming you don't know what you're talking about.  I'm out.
    He owes absolutely nothing to GTA or to GTA fans. He's a human being.
        He owes his fame and a shit ton of money he got from rockstar for that project. I don't mean he should actually give money to people but he is standing on that and you know it as well.
            lol Knowing how R* pays their VA‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not so sure about that
                Yeah I exaggerated about a shit tone lets say a fairly good amount due to residual and along the fame he got. Whether he likes it or not he owes his popularity to gta he should stop acting like an asshole saying he doesn't like it and then post nasty shit on ig just like trevor would. Both actors for Michael and Franklin says this too.
My bald spot lookin like Jupiter's Great Brown Spot.
Well maybe he shouldn't portray himself that way in every piece of media he's involved with including his own deranged social media. Guy is unintentionally stuck playing Trevor. His fault.
    Still no reason to be rude
        Tell him that. He thinks games are for nerds and losers. Fuck this douchebag ass actor that can only play one role
            Again, no reason to be rude
                No reason not to... guys making money and never gonna see it who gives a fuck
                    Meh
I think he posted about some mental health stuff on Twitter back in 2017-2018. I don't about the ig stuff but that's a thing too.
    Some of his posts are concerning....his mannerisms, the way he talks. As someone who faces severe depression every now and then, I guess I can kind of see it in him. Or he is that good of an actor.
Yeah, for all we know, it could be a huge trolling thing. Or it could be performance art. Who really knows but him?

I never watch Walking Dead so I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. Lol
    In The Walking Dead (show declined but I kept watching for some reason), Steven Ogg plays the right-hand man of a major villain and it was great. He pretty much out-villains the main villain. Pretty much a more serious, more evil Trevor lol.
        Oh dang. That sounds badass haha. I just don't know if I could get into the Walking Dead. I'm not really into the whole zombie thing.
that's what I meant, the website I linked talks about how it's not him lol
Victor

And Johnny

I just realized that most times when rockstar brings back protagonists from previous games it's normally to kill them off
Most do, but there‚Äôs still a decent subset of them that just don‚Äôt- which makes sense because they‚Äôre the last generation alive that didn‚Äôt really have more the immersive games in their childhood like we all got from like 2000 onwards. 

Listen to Steven himself if you don‚Äôt believe me: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8sHaUYD/
    My sibling in Christ, we literally grew up playing Atari, Coleco, Nintendo, Sega, PlayStation, Xbox, suped up PCs, every possible chance we got, not to mention all the quarters we spent at video arcades. Even older 1960s-born Gen X were hip to the latest video game tech. I absolutely can NOT with this
         Well I didn‚Äôt say EVERY Gen Xer did I? I said a subset of you all- SOME of you. My father was born in 68 and is just like Steven in terms of seeing games as child‚Äôs toys.

Whereas for the 30 and younger crowd, video games are almost a universal activity- I would wager it‚Äôs probably like over 90% of the <30 crowd regularly play  games to like 60% of Gen Xers or something, just guessing.
        And the people who did that shit back then were called nerds, losers, and bullied because of it. Just because it existed back then doesn‚Äôt mean everyone who lived concurrently accepted or understood it.
![gif](giphy|ka0BMy4DLmN8hNCg0Q)
Ogg‚Äôs performance as Trevor is a million times what Liotta‚Äôs as Tommy was. Love Tommy and Liotta but the dude is so checked out in VC (starts showing more enthusiasm after shakedown though)
    Who was Tommy‚Äôs competition? A mute cluade‚Ä¶ pretty sure if Tommy was a methed out over the top character with as much dialogue as Trevor, ray liotta would of done a better job simply because he‚Äôs the better actor
        I mean to my point, Tommy kinda already IS an over the top maniac, it just doesn‚Äôt always come across. He‚Äôs one of the most evil GTA protags (next to Trevor and maybe Toni C) and one of the only ones to show no form of remorse whatsoever. The game literally ends with him calling himself a mass murdering psychotic killer with a big cheese-eating grin on his face watching the sunset (it‚Äôs fucking hysterical, and perfect for the game‚Äôs themes for the record)

But he doesn‚Äôt always come across that way because half the time Liotta‚Äôs screaming his angry lines like a maniac (as he should imo) and the other half it sounds like he‚Äôs been at the nyquil. Tommy‚Äôs calm wise-guy thing is only surface deep. He‚Äôs clearly fiercely intelligent but his uncontrollable rage makes him slightly unhinged
        I won‚Äôt argue with you that Liotta is the better actor, but Liotta didn‚Äôt respect the material enough to do anything more than royally phone it in, regardless of what he was given to work with.
Stop disrespecting my vidya gane, Steve üò°üò°üò°
I thought he was great in the role of Marley‚Äôs ghost in Scrooge as well
    It's so rare for someone to reference that particular version of A Christmas Carol!
He doesn‚Äôt hate Star Wars, just doesn‚Äôt like how they handled it and Han after the first movie more than anything. Definitely doesn‚Äôt hate it like Alec Guinness lol
At least he's also Indy. He's known for *two* acts of work.
He took money for doing a half assed comission in which he complained about being remebered as Trevor for like 5 minutes. He shouldn't take the money if he doesn't like it
outwardsly, no, of course not. and he clearly takes a lot of pride in the role, i think he will always love Luke and his Star Wars films. But realistically, talking about the same thing every day, no matter how much you love that thing, will wear on you. But Hamill takes it in stride and we'd never be the wiser if he ever is feeling "Star-Wars'd-out" because he always happily engages with his fans about Star Wars, online and in person. What a stud.
    Hamill is actually open about the fact that he's never been a Star Wars fan. What he *is* a fan of is fandoms, the joy of engaging with a fictional setting or fictional characters. He is himself a fan of many "geeky" things and understands how it works on a deep, personal level. Hamill isn't a fan of Luke Skywalker, but he has deep respect and love for others who are, and he will go out of his way to brighten the day for people who geek out over him being Luke. 

Mark Hamill is a treasure.
It‚Äôs probably the countless star wars fans who never grew up harassing the poor guy
yes i am well aware haha. didnt really apply in this context since were mainly talking about the role that typecast Mark, which was Luke. Joker didn't come until later in his career
GTA 4 made hundreds of millions lol
    It‚Äôs extremely uncommon for video game actors to make residuals on the games. Typically they‚Äôre paid a flat fee for their work and that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs also typically not that much, which is bananas since video games are more profitable than film and television combined.
        Exactly, And this series is HUGE. GTA 5 had records from being the highest earning not just games but in ALL media. 

You‚Äôd think even minor characters would be living large. That‚Äôs happened with plenty of tv shows and movies. GoT actors were making enough to buy a Aventador per episode
    he accepted the job and the pay, then when the game was succesful he started bitching. His problem
        That was a rumor. He never had beef with rockstar.

But that isn‚Äôt my point. I was making fun of saying 100K sounds good. 

If you were part of a project that literally made 100s of millions, and you only got a 10th of a million, is that really ‚Äúgood‚Äù? üòÇ
            It's not but if that's what you agree on then that's what you agree on. Also I didn't know it was just a rumor, my bad in that case.
                Eh don‚Äôt feel bad. I believed it once too especially considering the percentages lmfao. 

He did have beef but it was with his union. He blamed his union entirely since it was their job to take care of him.

When it comes to gta 5 I got no idea how much the actors got for that. 

One thing even though it‚Äôs a bit off topic that really interests me is that no one except rockstar knows who voices Agatha Baker from the casino dlcs. I love mysteries like this but it makes me wonder if it was a large payday
        god people like you are why scumbags can get away with being scumbags
            >god people like you are why scumbags can get away with being scumbags

No, it's just literally the facts. He signed a contract guaranteeing him X amount of money for his work, and stipulated no such bonus for game sales or residuals etc. If he wanted those things he should have negotiated them. That's how contracts work. It's not a scumbag move to not pay someone more money they they were contractually guaranteed. It's not like anybody was tricked into being in these games.
                same thing happened to the writer of the Witcher books, he didn't think the games would make money so he only took the initial pay for the rights and that was that, and then he also started bitching lol
                Still feel like Rockstar shouldve paid him more for what an awesome job he did. He didnt "bitch" about rockstar. From what i remember he said he blamed his union.

Edit: Just found out he even asked about residuals while negotiating but rockstar said it wasnt a possibility. Thats weird...
    They did do that amount, it's a risk they all take. They couldn't know the game would be a success. They had a indication but couldn't know for sure, so I would say 100K is a fair deal considering your own personal avatar will be in a massive game like this. Just cause of the ladder, I know some who would have done it for less.

If you look deeply through the budget, I would assume that the split is fair. People who have more responsibility need to get payed more, that's how things are these days.
        "personal avatar" is pretty bad reasoning for low pay though, ignoring everything else about contracts, it's still a job in the end, it would be like starring in a movie but one of the reasonings for the pay not being as high as it could be is because "well your character is in the movie".

Especially when considering the fact that some of these actors aren't interested in games.

Not arguing whether their pay was justified or not just saying having your avatar in a game doesn't excuse a certain pay.
    >GTA 4 made hundreds of millions lol

Yeah, but he accepted a contract that said "You get X amount of money for this work and nothing else." That's what he gets. And it's not as though GTA wasn't already a massive gaming franchise by the time GTAIV released. If Nico's actor wanted more money, or residuals from the game sales, he should have negotiated that before signing a contract. Samuel L Jackson had the foresight to do exactly that.
They did all the acting work for like 2-3 years. Most movies takes a year or a half to film so $100k+ seems more than likely what they were paid.

 Obviously they were most likely paid more after the game released like when actors are paid a certain percent of the box office. Than again that‚Äôs why Nico‚Äôs voice actor was angry with rockstar for not giving him that percent of cash for being the protagonist
no, it‚Äôs not. they were without any doubt paid a very competitive rate for the countless hours they spent working on the project
    You would think they did that for the main voice actor niko Nellie but reportedly id was paid I believe 100K according to some reports without any residuals.
        sometimes i think people forget how much money 100k really is.
Luke has been acting for nearly 40 fucking years üíÄ just because YOU never heard of him before GTA doesn't mean nobody else did. Same for Fanteno
    Luke, while a solid actor, was mainly in T.V. shows before GTA gave him his big break.

People only knew Michael was Ned Luke after that first trailer dropped because one of Ned‚Äôs old acting class buddies said so on Twitter. Suffice to say he was more or less undiscovered talent.
    Well Ned has specifically said himself that no one knew him or Shawn or Steven til GTA 5.
i can‚Äôt help if you think i sound a certain way, but you are simply delusional to be positing the numbers you are and speculating on residuals as if you have any idea
    Have you ever been to an internet forum‚Ä¶ speculating about shit is 99 percent of what we do. You also responded to someone else as if you definitely knew they got paid a lot of money.

Hypocrite lol
and if you want the royalties and they wont' give them to you then you have two options. Take the job for the money being offered and don't bitch about it after the fact because you signed the contract, or don't take the job.
    "And if you want some royalties from the highest grossing entertainment product of all time, you need to know it's going to be the highest grossing entertainment product of all time beforehand and include it in your contract" okay so Steve invents a time machine like you said and asks for royalties in his contract. Rockstar recasts Trevor.   Gee, great thinking man, why didn't he do that? You're really smart.
        >"And if you want some royalties from the highest grossing entertainment product of all time, you need to know it's going to be the highest grossing entertainment product of all time beforehand and include it in your contract" okay so Steve invents a time machine like you said and asks for royalties in his contract.

Samuel L Jackson managed to have that kind of foresight and business acumen.

Also, by the way, literally nobody was talking about Steven being upset he didn't get enough money for GTAV. You're conflating the issues of two entirely different people.
            
>Samuel L Jackson managed to have that kind of hindsight

And why didn't Steve use his millions of dollars and any of the connections he has from his career as an A list actor to get a good contract like Sam L.? Why didn't he do that? Do you know I can't figure this out???

>You're conflating the issues of two entirely different people.

I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to think someone may have negative feelings about a company paying them like $100k and turning around and making $1,000,000,000 off it, but apparently it is for you lol.
                >I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to think someone may have negative feelings about a company paying them like $100k and turning around and making $1,000,000,000 off it, but apparently it is for you lol.

They knew that was going to be the case before they ever signed on to the game. By the time GTAIV released it was already one of the most successful game franchises in history and was already massively popular. It's not like the actor playing Nico didn't know what GTA was when he signed his contract. 

And again, STEVEN OGG IS NOT THE ONE WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT MONEY FROM ROCKSTAR. You're conflating two entirely people and two entirely different stories.

Being a VA, not joining a VA union, working for a company that would only hire non-union VA's... Then not getting a good deal for their worik.

            You should look up the difference between voice acting and performance capture.
He was already paid for said work thought, so by your point of view we should buy games/GTAV every month and not own them because we don‚Äôt ‚Äúpay residuals‚Äù ???

>what do the stars in a billion dollar movie make? Usually millions.

Yeah but only if they're well known and their name is likely to sell the film. I agree with your point that Vidya actors are underappreciated, but their reputations (unless they've achieved fame in film) almost never contribute to a game's sale.
    [deleted]
        Yeah *now* she's worth millions because now she's recognizable. Do you think she got paid more than a mil for the first film? I doubt it. I imagine she got paid less than a quarter mil, as is the norm for unknown leads in indies and horror films.
Daniel Radcliffe will always be Weird Al Yankovic.
    You mean that guy from Guns Akimbo? Man, what a chameleon.
        I think you‚Äôre meaning that guy from Horns
            Isn't he the little guy from Lord of the Rings?
                I think they call them Ewoks
        Swiss Army Man, really shows his range ü§£
    Incidentally, I think he purposely went for the most anti-harry potter roles he could find, just so he wouldn't be known as Harry Potter.
        He was once quoted saying the best thing he bought with his Harry Potter money was his career. He's set for life, so he literally just acts for fun now and exclusively picks roles and movies he has a strong interest in.
        That‚Äôs called ‚Äúworking against type‚Äù. Will Smith tried to do it with Hancock; when you‚Äôve been typecast as a certain archetype, doing the reverse shows that range.

It‚Äôs like when wrestlers go heel to face also!
            Yep. Steven Ogg got typecast for a while because of it. I think, he's also frustrated that he can't move on from that sort of role because his most succcessful one is GTAV.
    Idk man whenever I see him I think if that time he played a magical farting corpse.
        Fans of *Everything, Everywhere, All At Once* really ought to see *Swiss Army Man* since its by the same Daniels.
            It even includes a bonus Daniel
    He also played Sam Houser
    I think you misspelled *‚Äúa flatulent corpse‚Äù*
Jerry Seinfeld will always be Jerry Seinfeld
Aaron Paul played Todd in Bojack Horseman, and I didn't realize until my second or third watch. I honestly couldn't tell.
So he doesn't want to be associated with trevor but actively chooses roles that have him play trevor-lite. No one is forcing this man to take these roles.
    Roles that aren‚Äôt exactly what you want are better than no roles I would assume, but I‚Äôm not his manager who knows what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes.
        He‚Äôs probably just pissed that he‚Äôll forever be known as trailer park trash man instead of Daniel Day Lewis or something. It‚Äôs pretty stupid because at the end of the day it doesn‚Äôt really matter.
            To him it‚Äôs a big deal. He‚Äôs said himself Trevor is the exact opposite of his personality and that irl he thinks he‚Äôs a pretty nice guy. Imagine you go your whole life not being rude and mean to people unnecessarily but then every time someone recognizes you they want you to call them a slur or scream at them.
    Money
I wonder if he was cast in the walking dead before or after V?
    It was after, probably by about 3 or 4 years or so iirc.
        Yeah I just looked up that s7 dropped in 2016 so something like that
    Before(?)
        I never followed TWD when it was airing so I wasn't sure
    I was trying to figure out how the protagonist from Cyberpunk 2077 fit into all of this before I realized you guys are just shortening GTAV. 


Jesus
Chris evans as captain America and Tom Middleton as Loki
His character in Better Call Saul is Trevor if he was a bit more cleaned up.
Fuck you got me I guess he doesn't have an acting career.
    Just pointing out the flawed argument. Trevor is still his biggest role and it‚Äôs not even close.
        You should've kept reading what I posted. I acknowledge Trevor is his biggest role but people on this sub think that means he doesn't have an acting career.
How long was his arc? Bro, use proper industry terminology lmao. He was BILLED/(hired) as a guest star, which has limited episode appearances as opposed to recurring or a series regular. 

And that character arc was him trying to show up Mike and being humbled by the end of the scene. That‚Äôs a literal character arc. Source: Syd Fields

Reminds me of Kirsten Dunst in an interview a few years back: Where they asked her where‚Äôs she been and she‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been in a bunch of stuff. It‚Äôs not like you have to be in major blockbusters for every movie
Yep. Dude is a straight up asshole.
    Bit harsh.
        I can only go by from what I‚Äôve seen of him in interviews and such. Maybe he‚Äôs a great dude but he doesn‚Äôt have a favorable image to his biggest fan base.
He was in westworld and boiling point as well off the top off my head. About the cameo thing, haven‚Äôt seen it, but wasn‚Äôt Trevor a huge jerk and got really annoyed?
    Yeah but he was genuinely pissed for the cameo, it wasn‚Äôt acting or a part of it

https://youtu.be/nK_EpVPHPF0?feature=shared
Probably wanted people to think he, himself was cool and impressive, not just his character he plays idk
Trevor is one of the most mediocre characters in the history of gta, and you just like him because of the surprise factor and the contrast with the other two boring clich√©s, I can see how you can get to hate playing such a character, even Claude is much more interesting, and he doesn't even need to talk.
The ironic part is him being a dick to fans is a Trevor move.
    While that is true it doesn‚Äôt make it right or maybe one day he‚Äôll come out and say that he was just acting the entire time
Oh I apologize I thought you were making the opposite point.
So he's not a big name. Doesn't mean he's not working.
    Still only known for Trevor
        Still acting...
Ahh so you're now claiming to have seen all of his roles.  You're a joke and I'm out.

Also GTA is a blip on his career. Not all actors are stars.  But he's been a successful working actor for decades.
    Oh fuck off he was no al pacino before he still isn't. He is just some asshole who yells at people because to his surprise people know him as one of the most popular character ever created.
        The fact that I say working actor and Al Pacino is the only guy you think of shows you don't know enough about the industry to have this conversation. 

Have a good one dude.  You'll laugh at this when you grow up.
            I was saying al pacino because you know scarface.

Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, Christian Bale, Ryan Reynolds anybody on game of thrones when it aired are vastly more succesful than him and still working. He is an asshole with nothing significant except gta.
                Not a single one of those people is what the industry calls a "working actor". Thank you for confirming you don't know what you're talking about.  I'm out.
He owes absolutely nothing to GTA or to GTA fans. He's a human being.
    He owes his fame and a shit ton of money he got from rockstar for that project. I don't mean he should actually give money to people but he is standing on that and you know it as well.
        lol Knowing how R* pays their VA‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not so sure about that
            Yeah I exaggerated about a shit tone lets say a fairly good amount due to residual and along the fame he got. Whether he likes it or not he owes his popularity to gta he should stop acting like an asshole saying he doesn't like it and then post nasty shit on ig just like trevor would. Both actors for Michael and Franklin says this too.
Still no reason to be rude
    Tell him that. He thinks games are for nerds and losers. Fuck this douchebag ass actor that can only play one role
        Again, no reason to be rude
            No reason not to... guys making money and never gonna see it who gives a fuck
                Meh
Some of his posts are concerning....his mannerisms, the way he talks. As someone who faces severe depression every now and then, I guess I can kind of see it in him. Or he is that good of an actor.
In The Walking Dead (show declined but I kept watching for some reason), Steven Ogg plays the right-hand man of a major villain and it was great. He pretty much out-villains the main villain. Pretty much a more serious, more evil Trevor lol.
    Oh dang. That sounds badass haha. I just don't know if I could get into the Walking Dead. I'm not really into the whole zombie thing.
My sibling in Christ, we literally grew up playing Atari, Coleco, Nintendo, Sega, PlayStation, Xbox, suped up PCs, every possible chance we got, not to mention all the quarters we spent at video arcades. Even older 1960s-born Gen X were hip to the latest video game tech. I absolutely can NOT with this
     Well I didn‚Äôt say EVERY Gen Xer did I? I said a subset of you all- SOME of you. My father was born in 68 and is just like Steven in terms of seeing games as child‚Äôs toys.

Whereas for the 30 and younger crowd, video games are almost a universal activity- I would wager it‚Äôs probably like over 90% of the <30 crowd regularly play  games to like 60% of Gen Xers or something, just guessing.
    And the people who did that shit back then were called nerds, losers, and bullied because of it. Just because it existed back then doesn‚Äôt mean everyone who lived concurrently accepted or understood it.
Who was Tommy‚Äôs competition? A mute cluade‚Ä¶ pretty sure if Tommy was a methed out over the top character with as much dialogue as Trevor, ray liotta would of done a better job simply because he‚Äôs the better actor
    I mean to my point, Tommy kinda already IS an over the top maniac, it just doesn‚Äôt always come across. He‚Äôs one of the most evil GTA protags (next to Trevor and maybe Toni C) and one of the only ones to show no form of remorse whatsoever. The game literally ends with him calling himself a mass murdering psychotic killer with a big cheese-eating grin on his face watching the sunset (it‚Äôs fucking hysterical, and perfect for the game‚Äôs themes for the record)

But he doesn‚Äôt always come across that way because half the time Liotta‚Äôs screaming his angry lines like a maniac (as he should imo) and the other half it sounds like he‚Äôs been at the nyquil. Tommy‚Äôs calm wise-guy thing is only surface deep. He‚Äôs clearly fiercely intelligent but his uncontrollable rage makes him slightly unhinged
    I won‚Äôt argue with you that Liotta is the better actor, but Liotta didn‚Äôt respect the material enough to do anything more than royally phone it in, regardless of what he was given to work with.
It's so rare for someone to reference that particular version of A Christmas Carol!
Hamill is actually open about the fact that he's never been a Star Wars fan. What he *is* a fan of is fandoms, the joy of engaging with a fictional setting or fictional characters. He is himself a fan of many "geeky" things and understands how it works on a deep, personal level. Hamill isn't a fan of Luke Skywalker, but he has deep respect and love for others who are, and he will go out of his way to brighten the day for people who geek out over him being Luke. 

Mark Hamill is a treasure.
It‚Äôs extremely uncommon for video game actors to make residuals on the games. Typically they‚Äôre paid a flat fee for their work and that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs also typically not that much, which is bananas since video games are more profitable than film and television combined.
    Exactly, And this series is HUGE. GTA 5 had records from being the highest earning not just games but in ALL media. 

You‚Äôd think even minor characters would be living large. That‚Äôs happened with plenty of tv shows and movies. GoT actors were making enough to buy a Aventador per episode
he accepted the job and the pay, then when the game was succesful he started bitching. His problem
    That was a rumor. He never had beef with rockstar.

But that isn‚Äôt my point. I was making fun of saying 100K sounds good. 

If you were part of a project that literally made 100s of millions, and you only got a 10th of a million, is that really ‚Äúgood‚Äù? üòÇ
        It's not but if that's what you agree on then that's what you agree on. Also I didn't know it was just a rumor, my bad in that case.
            Eh don‚Äôt feel bad. I believed it once too especially considering the percentages lmfao. 

He did have beef but it was with his union. He blamed his union entirely since it was their job to take care of him.

When it comes to gta 5 I got no idea how much the actors got for that. 

One thing even though it‚Äôs a bit off topic that really interests me is that no one except rockstar knows who voices Agatha Baker from the casino dlcs. I love mysteries like this but it makes me wonder if it was a large payday
    god people like you are why scumbags can get away with being scumbags
        >god people like you are why scumbags can get away with being scumbags

No, it's just literally the facts. He signed a contract guaranteeing him X amount of money for his work, and stipulated no such bonus for game sales or residuals etc. If he wanted those things he should have negotiated them. That's how contracts work. It's not a scumbag move to not pay someone more money they they were contractually guaranteed. It's not like anybody was tricked into being in these games.
            same thing happened to the writer of the Witcher books, he didn't think the games would make money so he only took the initial pay for the rights and that was that, and then he also started bitching lol
            Still feel like Rockstar shouldve paid him more for what an awesome job he did. He didnt "bitch" about rockstar. From what i remember he said he blamed his union.

Edit: Just found out he even asked about residuals while negotiating but rockstar said it wasnt a possibility. Thats weird...
They did do that amount, it's a risk they all take. They couldn't know the game would be a success. They had a indication but couldn't know for sure, so I would say 100K is a fair deal considering your own personal avatar will be in a massive game like this. Just cause of the ladder, I know some who would have done it for less.

If you look deeply through the budget, I would assume that the split is fair. People who have more responsibility need to get payed more, that's how things are these days.
    "personal avatar" is pretty bad reasoning for low pay though, ignoring everything else about contracts, it's still a job in the end, it would be like starring in a movie but one of the reasonings for the pay not being as high as it could be is because "well your character is in the movie".

Especially when considering the fact that some of these actors aren't interested in games.

Not arguing whether their pay was justified or not just saying having your avatar in a game doesn't excuse a certain pay.
>GTA 4 made hundreds of millions lol

Yeah, but he accepted a contract that said "You get X amount of money for this work and nothing else." That's what he gets. And it's not as though GTA wasn't already a massive gaming franchise by the time GTAIV released. If Nico's actor wanted more money, or residuals from the game sales, he should have negotiated that before signing a contract. Samuel L Jackson had the foresight to do exactly that.
You would think they did that for the main voice actor niko Nellie but reportedly id was paid I believe 100K according to some reports without any residuals.
    sometimes i think people forget how much money 100k really is.
Luke, while a solid actor, was mainly in T.V. shows before GTA gave him his big break.

People only knew Michael was Ned Luke after that first trailer dropped because one of Ned‚Äôs old acting class buddies said so on Twitter. Suffice to say he was more or less undiscovered talent.
Well Ned has specifically said himself that no one knew him or Shawn or Steven til GTA 5.
Have you ever been to an internet forum‚Ä¶ speculating about shit is 99 percent of what we do. You also responded to someone else as if you definitely knew they got paid a lot of money.

Hypocrite lol
"And if you want some royalties from the highest grossing entertainment product of all time, you need to know it's going to be the highest grossing entertainment product of all time beforehand and include it in your contract" okay so Steve invents a time machine like you said and asks for royalties in his contract. Rockstar recasts Trevor.   Gee, great thinking man, why didn't he do that? You're really smart.
    >"And if you want some royalties from the highest grossing entertainment product of all time, you need to know it's going to be the highest grossing entertainment product of all time beforehand and include it in your contract" okay so Steve invents a time machine like you said and asks for royalties in his contract.

Samuel L Jackson managed to have that kind of foresight and business acumen.

Also, by the way, literally nobody was talking about Steven being upset he didn't get enough money for GTAV. You're conflating the issues of two entirely different people.
        
>Samuel L Jackson managed to have that kind of hindsight

And why didn't Steve use his millions of dollars and any of the connections he has from his career as an A list actor to get a good contract like Sam L.? Why didn't he do that? Do you know I can't figure this out???

>You're conflating the issues of two entirely different people.

I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to think someone may have negative feelings about a company paying them like $100k and turning around and making $1,000,000,000 off it, but apparently it is for you lol.
            >I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to think someone may have negative feelings about a company paying them like $100k and turning around and making $1,000,000,000 off it, but apparently it is for you lol.

They knew that was going to be the case before they ever signed on to the game. By the time GTAIV released it was already one of the most successful game franchises in history and was already massively popular. It's not like the actor playing Nico didn't know what GTA was when he signed his contract. 

And again, STEVEN OGG IS NOT THE ONE WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT MONEY FROM ROCKSTAR. You're conflating two entirely people and two entirely different stories.

Also, by the way, literally nobody was talking about Steven being upset he didn't get enough money for GTAV. You're conflating the issues of two entirely different people.
    
>Samuel L Jackson managed to have that kind of hindsight

And why didn't Steve use his millions of dollars and any of the connections he has from his career as an A list actor to get a good contract like Sam L.? Why didn't he do that? Do you know I can't figure this out???

>You're conflating the issues of two entirely different people.

I don't think it's a stretch of the imagination to think someone may have negative feelings about a company paying them like $100k and turning around and making $1,000,000,000 off it, but apparently it is for you lol.

They knew that was going to be the case before they ever signed on to the game. By the time GTAIV released it was already one of the most successful game franchises in history and was already massively popular. It's not like the actor playing Nico didn't know what GTA was when he signed his contract. 

And again, STEVEN OGG IS NOT THE ONE WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT MONEY FROM ROCKSTAR. You're conflating two entirely people and two entirely different stories.
Because I forgot the ‚Äús‚Äù after Trevor‚Äôs name?‚ò†Ô∏è
It doesn't, but how are any single one VA stand up against them if they're not on a union?
    You should look up the difference between voice acting and performance capture.
i didn‚Äôt understand what he said either, blud is cookedüíÄ
English must not be your first language

        They're saying that we should in that case pay monthly fee's to rent games so that everyone who worked on them can make ongoing money from it.
Yeah *now* she's worth millions because now she's recognizable. Do you think she got paid more than a mil for the first film? I doubt it. I imagine she got paid less than a quarter mil, as is the norm for unknown leads in indies and horror films.
I think you‚Äôre meaning that guy from Horns
    Isn't he the little guy from Lord of the Rings?
        I think they call them Ewoks
Swiss Army Man, really shows his range ü§£
He was once quoted saying the best thing he bought with his Harry Potter money was his career. He's set for life, so he literally just acts for fun now and exclusively picks roles and movies he has a strong interest in.
That‚Äôs called ‚Äúworking against type‚Äù. Will Smith tried to do it with Hancock; when you‚Äôve been typecast as a certain archetype, doing the reverse shows that range.

It‚Äôs like when wrestlers go heel to face also!
    Yep. Steven Ogg got typecast for a while because of it. I think, he's also frustrated that he can't move on from that sort of role because his most succcessful one is GTAV.
Fans of *Everything, Everywhere, All At Once* really ought to see *Swiss Army Man* since its by the same Daniels.
    It even includes a bonus Daniel
He‚Äôs probably just pissed that he‚Äôll forever be known as trailer park trash man instead of Daniel Day Lewis or something. It‚Äôs pretty stupid because at the end of the day it doesn‚Äôt really matter.
    To him it‚Äôs a big deal. He‚Äôs said himself Trevor is the exact opposite of his personality and that irl he thinks he‚Äôs a pretty nice guy. Imagine you go your whole life not being rude and mean to people unnecessarily but then every time someone recognizes you they want you to call them a slur or scream at them.
Yeah I just looked up that s7 dropped in 2016 so something like that
I never followed TWD when it was airing so I wasn't sure
You should've kept reading what I posted. I acknowledge Trevor is his biggest role but people on this sub think that means he doesn't have an acting career.
I can only go by from what I‚Äôve seen of him in interviews and such. Maybe he‚Äôs a great dude but he doesn‚Äôt have a favorable image to his biggest fan base.
Still acting...
The fact that I say working actor and Al Pacino is the only guy you think of shows you don't know enough about the industry to have this conversation. 

Have a good one dude.  You'll laugh at this when you grow up.
    I was saying al pacino because you know scarface.

Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, Christian Bale, Ryan Reynolds anybody on game of thrones when it aired are vastly more succesful than him and still working. He is an asshole with nothing significant except gta.
        Not a single one of those people is what the industry calls a "working actor". Thank you for confirming you don't know what you're talking about.  I'm out.
lol Knowing how R* pays their VA‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not so sure about that
    Yeah I exaggerated about a shit tone lets say a fairly good amount due to residual and along the fame he got. Whether he likes it or not he owes his popularity to gta he should stop acting like an asshole saying he doesn't like it and then post nasty shit on ig just like trevor would. Both actors for Michael and Franklin says this too.
Again, no reason to be rude
    No reason not to... guys making money and never gonna see it who gives a fuck
        Meh
It's not but if that's what you agree on then that's what you agree on. Also I didn't know it was just a rumor, my bad in that case.
    Eh don‚Äôt feel bad. I believed it once too especially considering the percentages lmfao. 

He did have beef but it was with his union. He blamed his union entirely since it was their job to take care of him.

When it comes to gta 5 I got no idea how much the actors got for that. 

One thing even though it‚Äôs a bit off topic that really interests me is that no one except rockstar knows who voices Agatha Baker from the casino dlcs. I love mysteries like this but it makes me wonder if it was a large payday
>god people like you are why scumbags can get away with being scumbags

No, it's just literally the facts. He signed a contract guaranteeing him X amount of money for his work, and stipulated no such bonus for game sales or residuals etc. If he wanted those things he should have negotiated them. That's how contracts work. It's not a scumbag move to not pay someone more money they they were contractually guaranteed. It's not like anybody was tricked into being in these games.
    same thing happened to the writer of the Witcher books, he didn't think the games would make money so he only took the initial pay for the rights and that was that, and then he also started bitching lol
    Still feel like Rockstar shouldve paid him more for what an awesome job he did. He didnt "bitch" about rockstar. From what i remember he said he blamed his union.

Edit: Just found out he even asked about residuals while negotiating but rockstar said it wasnt a possibility. Thats weird...
