[[Rockstar predicted Rockstar]]





Holy fuck
    Holy shit
        Holy shit*sticks*
            Ohhh shit...


GTA. My moneymaking machine. At least it was before I fucked everythin' up.
                All we had to do, was follow the damn train, C111tla!!
            Holy fucking shit
        Holy fuck üñï shit.
        Holy fucking shit
    I also remember being 18 and being blown away by the greed and hypocrisy of life lol. You'll get used to it.
        *Holy Shitsnacks!*
        Walking around a big city a big city after dark is what broke me. Homeless people everywhere. They can't even make eye contact they're so fucked up. Thousand yard stare straight through your face, while asking for money. I wish I had the cash, lady. I really did.
            Damn I wish I had your upbringing where any of this was new to me. I grew up in a big city and I remember walking through a really bad part of town to get something for my dad from the store. I had the money in my hand and this homeless guy stopped me and told me "never walk around with your money out. A guy like me could just take it from a little guy like you".  And he absolutely could have. But he didn't. In hindsight, I bet he really thought about it but I guess he couldn't do it to a kid. He seemed almost annoyed with me for having to tell me that.
    Holy fuck hole
    Oh my fuck!
    Holy fuck face
    Holy fucking fuck
    Happy Cake Day!
        Thank you! Didn‚Äôt even realize lol.
The announcement of expanded and enhanced really made me realize that rockstar is exactly what they make fun of.
    I always get reminded of the ingame ifruit ad

"iFruit 9IX

3% thinner 3% faster 30 hour queue"

They were making fun of companies releasing new phones for full price while barely changing anything, yet now they are doing that themsekf with expanded and enhanced and to an extent even the trilogy remastered
        Or Righteous slaughter 7
        They also had a Digifarm Spinoffs ad 

"Digi-Gangsta .... buy an expensive digital sports car, and increase the length and girth of your sprite's penis with experience points"

They were literally making fun of GTA Online without even knowing it lol
        but they have fast character switching now
    ‚ÄúYou either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.‚Äù
        Every good company isn't good for life
            No king rules forever, my son.
        What a great quote by Two-Face, really is malleable to be used in almost any situation
        Art imitates life and life imitates art
    After 2018 the rockstar employees were gone they were no true rockstar employees after that year only take 2 employees that infected rockstar and turned them into money hungry termites
    I honestly think it‚Äôs just Take2 making them milk it as much as possible
    Projecting, projecting.
    I never understood why you're all so upset, but don't shit on Howard for releasing Skyrim literally 7 or 8 times in 10 years.

R* gave us RDR2 in 2018. Before that, GTA 5 was 2013.  These MASSIVE open world games take TIME to make.

Yes, they keep GTA online going. Wouldn't you? if you were making boatloads of money off of one service, you'd keep that mule going for as long as possible, would you not?  and it pads their revenue so they can afford to work on their next project.

But no, you guys don't get a game from R* every year and you're frothing at the fucking mouth.

Give them some time.  Don't buy E&E if you don't fucking like it but stop pretending like R* owes you shit
        People criticise Skyrim re-releases all the time - just not on the GTA sub, because it's about GTA.
            [removed]
                so... my hate for r\* isnt justified just because people like me, who dont care about elder scrolls, arent angry skyrim gets re-released
                    if thats what you took from my comment then god help you
        Dude... is this really the hill you wish to die upon?
            Absolutely.  Fuck all of you.  Y'all are just children wanting what you don't have and then blaming your parents when things don't go your way.  Keep your fucking mouth shut.
        You had me until the end. Rock* owes me a functional fucking game lmao. But yeah I don‚Äôt begrudge them for not yet releasing gta 6.
            What do they owe you exactly you decide to buy the game it was your option to also not buy and wait for reviews they don‚Äôt owe you shit because is there after they mad the game and can do whatever they want with it
                You know, for hundreds of years we used to have these things called refunds. Corporations didn't like refunds though because they had to give money back to people. Many internet came along, the internet was this new and crazy thing that needed new laws for it. We decided not to make new laws for it. As such corporations realize they could make their own laws for it, so now they can sell you items with absolutely no chance of getting a refund even if the object they sold you wasn't what was advertised in the slightest. I mean let's be real here, what if I don't have access to things like game reviews. How was I supposed to know the game was crap? It's not like the Rockstar launcher has any way to look at the reviews of the games.
                    How can you have a console or a pc and don‚Äôt have access to reviews also you know there is something call steam that actually do refunds
        [deleted]
            It's entirely your fault for paying for this dog shit lmao

in an age where video reviews come out days before or literal hours after a game releases, live streams of the game from the moment it's available to play a plethora of media telling you what this was, it's 100% your own fault for paying for this.

If you pre-ordered it, you're even worse and I have nothing left to say to you. You should know better.
Devin Weston is a parody of Strauss Zlenick who owns Take 2 which owns Rockstar.
    Wtf, that actually checks out! How did I not know this?
        \+ Leopold Strauss from Red Dead Redemption 2 is named after him.
Well that aged like milk. Michael literally shitting on the rockstar CEO
    Pretty sure Trevor would‚Äôve been the one to do that lol
        Pretty sure Trevor would first boot fuck, then turn around and skull fuck the CEO. After he‚Äôs done he will shit on him and go spoon Mr. Raspberry Jam.
    This applies to every fucking game today‚Ä¶ why actually put work into a game when people will buy it regardless and you can just issue an apology and promise that you‚Äôll fix the game in future updates. All while hiding behind the millions you made from the shitty, unfinished video game.
        Seriously these days, companies are all just so disconnected from reality it's insane. From Blizzard's W3 reforged to GTA trilogy definitive edition or whatever it's called, they just expect to make a quick buck while spending nothing on the product. When I watched that video of the CEO of Chewy talking about how he came up with the idea of just pretty much PROVIDING A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE TO HIS CUSTOMERS to be successful, it was as if it was a novelty to everyone. We're just so used to shitty customer service, shitty products that are often overpriced, that Chewy was instantly successful. And it was supposed to be for jewelry too at first. The CEO pretty much said "it could have been about ANYTHING and it would have been successful". And he was 100% right. Provide good service and a good or even just decent product and you will be successful. Seriously, they could have just provided the new GTA edition at the older cost along with the older version and they would 100% have made more profit (or well will make I suppose) to begin with and people wouldn't have been upset. But nope it's going for a full AAA price instead.
            Especially because nobody needed this so soon‚Ä¶ you have an infinite amount of time to remaster a game, it‚Äôs clear that companies just want to make a quick buck when you release something in such a shitty condition. I understand releasing a game from a franchise that people are expecting. But people could‚Äôve waited a couple more years for these GTA games to be remastered and released, nobody needed these RIGHT NOW.
                Yeah! At the end of the day it's pretty much the good old saying "the customer is always right". When you take a look at a remake like Diablo 2 remastered, they literally did what everyone wanted; the exact same game with better graphics (and 1080p). This is what we got and I have enjoyed it since the release. Sure, there's no tci/ip support and sure I'd love to have some mods and whatnot, but even the graphics themselves are just EXACTLY like what it used to be but better. And it actually looks pretty damn good. When I look at someone streaming any of the definitive edition, it just looks like the same old game but with some mods on top. Definitely not what I would expect for a fully priced bundled.
        [removed]
            I agree but it‚Äôs sadly not a viable option‚Ä¶ the amount of people on the internet that actually care about quality pales in comparison to the people who will just buy the new COD because it‚Äôs COD (same goes for any triple A studio)

I think the workers need to strike or something‚Ä¶ refuse to make your shitty game and meet the shitty demands until quality control is taken more seriously. No more crunching.
    Take 2 ceo*
Honestly though things like this could be another jab from the writers room. GTA is notorious for talking real shit about everyone, including people like themselves.
    This was 8 years ago though, was it relevant then?
        Well there was supposed to be add-ons and DLC to GTA5 story mode that never came, so possibly.

Also one year after GTA5 they did that PS4 port of San Andreas everyone hated.

It's been a long time but I'm pretty sure I've had some distaste for Rockstars ways since around the time this game came out.
            Actually that was the PS3/Xbox 360 port. The PS4 rerelease was much more positively received and true to the PS2 version.
                Yeah the PS4 version is great. I was lucky enough to buy it before the OG games were taken off the psstore for the new trilogy and I have to say, it feels like a direct port of the ps2 version.
                    Same. That and the Vice City PS4 release. If they had all the songs intact they‚Äôd probably be the best versions of the games.
                        I wish I would've got all 3 when I had the chance. I'm grateful I atleast had the sense to buy San Andreas but not having 3 and VC really sucks now that they're gone... that's the worst part of the "definitive" trilogy imo, that they replaced the OG games altogether. Wtf was R* thinking?
                            R\* was thinking that people would buy it.

turns out they were right.
                                Well this is my first experience with something made by Grove Street Games. I missed the San Andreas port they screwed up and only heard about it recently. At first I didn't think the trilogy was actually that bad, but the more I played it, the worse it got. Then they "updated" the trilogy and now my Switch version is so much worse than it was before. It's comically bad now. 

I've always supported R* and as long as it's first party R* , I most likely always will. I'll never touch a damn thing GSG was a part of again though and my love for R* will change if they ever work with that garbage company again. GSG is a f'in joke.
                    Us Xbox people don‚Äôt get the good PS4 port of SA. Only the 360 port and now the definitive editionüòÇüòÇ
                        Yeah but you can still buy a good version of SA for the 360 and play it on all Xbox consoles right now, Playstation players are kinda screwed when it comes to the GTA franchise, especially now that the original games have been pulled down. We can't play Gta4 at all,  there's no physical or digital version we can play on ps4 or ps5 lol
                            damn.. ill launch myself from the swingset for ya, homieüôè
                Was there a ps4 release of San Andreas? That I could play on my ps5. I was so excited for the trilogy until it released.
                    Unfortunately no, not at the moment since they were taken down from the Playstation store. I heard the original games are being relisted on PC so hopefully console versions will be next. The version on PS4 was very good so if you don't want to try the trilogy, keep an eye out for the originals going back up and grab it as soon as they do
                    There was. It was digital only and was pretty faithful other than a few songs removed for copyright.
                        That's because it was literally just the PS2 version emulated on a PS4
            I think you're talking about the Xbox version the PS4 version is literally the PS2 original game upscaled.
            They hate the ps4 port because they're xbox fanboys
            ive had some distaste for Rockstar since max payne 3 days :)
        Probably. That's when they started squeezing out money from Online, so the developers might have known ahead of time.
            Nope, only after 2015 they really 'squeezed money out of online'
Read this somewhere and it made sense. Rockstar's situation is similar to the RDR2. A gang (company) in a land (video game industry) becoming more civilized (rinse and repeat, battle pass, same game every year). A money hungry man named Strauss that goes against the ideals of the company. This next part wasn't in the original theory, but even the blindly loyal members of the gang represent the blindly loyal people who praise Rockstar despite the constant failure.
    Yeah I always felt like RDR2 was a self realising tragedy, its like just before rockstar lost all semblance of their soul, they released that banger. One last time
Outsourcing is not the problem. Releasing a game without minimum testing and quality it is. Look at Bluepoint Games's Demons Souls... how could be Rockstar series like L.A. Noire, Max Payne or even Bully at Bluepoint hands? They just need to demand the necessary quality, supervising the project all the time. It's not really a big deal.
    Who ever said there can only be one problem?
Outsourcing to a company with a poor track record is a problem. Lack of quality control is a problem. People pre-ordering games is a problem.

The big over-arching problem is the system where it's more profitable to release a game like this half-baked. They could do extra development and quality control, but that costs money and I'm guessing they struck a balance between cutting costs and losing sales.

Rockstar's priority is T2 share prices over all else unfortunately. Games are just a tool for them to drive share prices.
    [removed]
        You wouldn't call it good cuz you're an xbox fanboy and would praise anything Phil releases even 69 bangers lol.
    they created only third max payne game and it was not that good compared to first two ones (made by Remedy entertainmet )
"You paid a private company to do the dirty work for you" 

That's totally the case with Rockstar Games with Grove Street Games.
    r/thatsthejoke
        Not just me then
    And the dirty work was sloppy
        Because they were underpaid, due to Rockstar thinking they were big enough and bad enough that they didn't need to play by the rules.
            lmao
    No shit sherlock.
    What other deductions have you made Sherlock?
    Yes..  that's the joke
    Thanks Peter
    Whooooooosh
    Welcome to "youtube comment section".
I feel like since Dan Houser left Rockstar dipped hard
    That‚Äôs why ppl should limit their expectations for gta6.. which is probably gonna be gta online part 2 with a single player slapped on to it as a checklist item
        This! This is exactly what I've been trying to tell people.
        From what I‚Äôve heard on YouTube  they‚Äôre gonna get rid of offensive jokes and be pc
            They won't as GTA's main paying audience are little children or teenagers who still think that being offensive for the sake of being offensive is funny.
                You sure about that?  


\*cough\* Hot coffee mod \*cough\*
                    Precisely
                        What? I was disagreeing with you lol. I was using that "mod" as an example of rockstar not willing to go that far anymore. They already have a bad rep now, the media will eat them alive if they do anything considered too offensive, sadly.  


2013 was a different time.
                            Case in point
    >I feel like since Dan Houser left Rockstar dipped hard

Nah, he started the outsourcing actually. The awful remaster of GTA San Andreas and the lackluster mobile ports by War Drum all happened under Dan Houser's watch.
        I wonder if the definitive trilogy would've been better if he actually helped with it instead of delegating it off.

A few high up producers from the originals did actually help Grove Street Games, but I don't think Dan was involved at all. Which is odd honestly. Almost that entire universe was designed by him and Lazlow, and neither of them were there to make sure GSG filled in the blanks properly.
[deleted]
Wowww haha this is very accurate
It takes one to know one. And they're Take Two. Go figure.
Won‚Äôt buy shit until GTA 6
    At this point I don‚Äôt even want GTA 6 anymore. They‚Äôre going to have to make an unbelievable game to satisfy even a fraction of the hype and with how they‚Äôve been acting it‚Äôs not looking good.
        They're probably gonna make some goofy shit to please their 5-15 yo audience, the only ones who like what Rockstar did with GTA online. I just hope that it feels/look as revolutionary as RDR2, when it came out. But to be honest and realist, my expectations aren't very high with Rockstar. I saw Rockstar as a company with high standards, love for games and their fans. That thought is slowly fading away tbh.
            I don't want gta to be realistic just grounded
                literally the same thing
                If that shit means drive and kill missions like gta 3 and 4, I don't want it
                    Yea same
        Talk about being entitled.
            I never understood why people who critisize a game/developer get called "entitled" by people like you. People literally pay R* for the game, so they have every right to call it shit. If they would hand the game out for free, You'd have a point.
                Entitled because unrealistic expectations.
                    Wanting something to happen because it would be nice is not being entitled.

I would like for my team to win the championship this Sunday, it doesn't mean I feel entitled to the happiness I'd derive from that.
    I'd either 6 or Bully 2. Why do i get the feeling Bully 2 would be a soulless sequel? I feel like respect for the series would become 0.
        Good thing theres never gonna be another bully. Rockstar only focuses on gta and red dead now smh
            We dont know that just yet. Gotta gave hope but again this is Rockstar soo, hope is nearly gone
Be the satire that you want to see in this world.
You became the very thing you swore to destroy
The writing was self aware in GTAV though. There are a good amount of comments about outsourcing development etc i think on the lifeinvader missions that are definitely self aware about video game development etc
Just need to track the Rockstar logo over the hostages face to complete the meme.
RDR2 was Dan Houser's last game with Rockstar. I've got a horrible feeling that the quality of their games is going to drop significantly from now on. I know a lot of people dislike GTA 5 but it was still a fantastic game and RDR2 was nothing short of a masterpiece. The whole story of RDR2 revolves around the end of an era and that's what it feels like with Rockstar. They put out masterpiece after masterpiece since GTA 3 and now it seems like one of the original founders leaving the company is a sign that it's all downhill from here on out.

And words cannot describe how sad it is. San Andreas was my childhood. Every time I play the intro and go back to Grove Street it feels like coming home. VC and 3 also give me those nostalgic vibes and RDR2 is quite simply the greatest game I have ever played. It's so sad to see a company that has given you some of your greatest gaming experiences completely implode.
"The same things that make us laugh, make us cry." They knew before any of us did.
It‚Äôs probably Dan Houser who wrote this, he did something very similar in RDR2 to point out how greedy the company got.
Lmao, they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúpredict‚Äù it. They had already done that to Team Bondi, the studio behind L.A. Noire, which came out before GTA V.
someone should email this clip to rockstar
DO NOT PREORDER GTA6
Don‚Äôt forget about that message on the Righteous Slaughter loading screen that says ‚ÄúBuy DLC to get better at the game‚Äù
    It's not about skills anymore, it's all about greed and power to do things that other can't and other don't give a fuck about the game
Takes one to know one
    *takes 2
USA üá∫üá∏ government in a nutshell
    Corporations
        Same shit
Rockstar became exactly the type of company they made fun of
More like Dan Houser predicted Rockstar and bounced.
Devin Weston is indeed STRAUSS ZELNICK! WOW!
Well looking at the game that was originally made back in 2013, this makes a whole lot of sense now.
And number 2,offshoring your profits
    Offshore?
        It‚Äôs horrible. You wouldn‚Äôt want to get offshored just to save a little money would you T?
            Nah I wouldn‚Äôt uh um
We need to tweet this to Rockstar, they got lazy
First big foot, then Aliens and now this shit? Maybe Alex Jones was on to something?
    Remember the LifeInvader shit about invading privacy and people‚Äôs data? Was Rockstar onto something?
        Faceboo-I-I mean Meta!
holy shit....... houser always knew what he was doing
Was it confirmed how much GSG got paid for their work? Didnt know they were underpaid.
Wow that cutscene aged like fine wine lol
Sam Houser was in Red Dead Redemption 1, forecasting GTA 5. Maybe this was his way of telling us what was to come.
I fucking swear Zelnick is a fusion between Haines and Weston.
Nail on the head??
thanks, I've been thinking about this scene ever since the news broke that they were outsourcing GTA DE to a small studio who used to focus on creating mobile ports of Rockstar titles.
holy shit this is scarily accurate
You either die a hero, or live long enough too see yourself become the villain.
Honestly still baffled as to how people say GTAV storyline isn‚Äôt better than GTAIV. Deluded bunch.
    They are both good problem solved.
    Cause GTA 5s storyline is a generic heist movie. Been done a million times before. 4 was much more unique and deep. Not many movies about a Eastern European immigrant moving to USA to escape his old life of crime only to be sucked back into it by his cousin, go through a lot of struggle then eventually make something of himself, meets a nice girl he could see himself settling down with, only for it to end tragically. 5 is more glamorous but that‚Äôs all it is
        They both are great in their own ways
        Niko actually went to the US to find the guy who betrayed his team and kill him, not to escape his old life.
            That‚Äôs part of it, also to escape cause Ray Bulgarin was after him
                Naw he pretty clearly explains his reason in the beginning of the game.
        Ok gta 4 fanboy.
    They can't really be compared because they have different story genres. While GTA IV is deep, realistic, and even sad and depressing at some points (Niko's past and his thirst for revenge, the end of the Holland Play mission if you take Playboy's side, and especially the Ending of the game), GTA V is comedic and action-packed. Even the scenes in V that could have a sensitive touch, like Trevor's relationship with Patricia or Michael's family situation, are being ridiculed (Trevor biting off Madrazo's ear or Michael tattooing a penis on Lazlow's chest).
    Imagine judging a story based on one line the character spoke. GTA 5 is still just a glamorous game with an above average story. That being said it's a technical masterpiece. So both 4 and 5 are great in their own ways.
    Exactly. Gta 5's story was so much more satirical and interesting.
    Yeppp they're just gta 4 fanboys. I encountered one earlier and holy shit was this guy being biased towards 4 and against 5.
*Insert Harvey Dent quote*
Foreshadowing lmao
Talk about irony!
Bet they're still making millions every month on shark cards because people are dumb.
rockstar predicted most big companies of any industry. it's the system we live in. exploit and steal
Rockstar will suffer like devin western
So accurate
They‚Äôve become the very thing they‚Äôve sworn to parody.  

How ironic.
    You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain
Facts...... maybe that dude was R* CEO.
Just remember that the company behind is take two...
The irony
I think the developers predicted the executives.
Damn thats deep af
Pretty sure the Housers knew things would go shit after this and slipped it into the story.
Essential
Ok but I m sure they have something big going on
You mean T2? Stop blaming Rockstar for remasters failure
    Rockstar published the game, they had the final word regarding its release.
        Thing is though, could still be both. I've heard behind the scenes Rockstar doesn't have full control because T2 is breathing down their necks do other shit. And T2 *owns* Rockstar, they *have* to comply.

Aside from the loss of original Rockstar staff, I heard that's why GTA slowly changed over the years. As it got bigger and bigger T2 started telling Rockstar how *they* wanted it.

Like GSG games is a subcontractor for a corporation owned by another corporation. Corporate everything is trash. For all we know T2 outright told Rockstar not to give a shit and focus on whatever the next main title is. Hard to say since they're secretive as fuck and try be all dramatic with surprise announcements after years of silence.
            [deleted]
                Well that's what people already thought then Rockstar blindsided everyone with RDR2.

Honestly wouldn't be surprised if the next main title is some weird shit like Bully 2 or Manhunt 3
                    Do you know how many people would get on their asses for Manhunt 3? That shit isn't happening anytime soon lol
    Yeah because it‚Äôs not like rockstar has any say right?
    Rockstar published the game and war drum studios shat out garbage, in reality its both of their fault since rockstar gave less of a shit about quality and war drum doesn‚Äôt give a shit about making something good
    Other comments are smugly shitting on you, but you might be correct here. I wasn't sure if GSG, R*, or T2 should be blamed - maybe all of them - but R* is actually "wholly owned" by T2, so the suits at T2 are probably at least the main issue here since they tell R* what to do. [This video](https://youtu.be/knXqO0hz600) explains it pretty well (no, it's not mine).
    If I wanted to pull my investment out of Take-Two and put it in Rockstar, what's Rockstar's stock symbol? Oh wait, I can't do that because THEY'RE THE SAME COMPANY.

Who would have guessed that Rockstar would eventually roast themselves.

There it is y‚Äôall.

Thanks for posting... had no memory of this
They literally lived long enough to see themselves become the villains
In this instance when he puts it like that, it makes sense !
DAMN
Oh shit here we go again !! üòã
\*Update to GTA V\*

\-Changed ending scene dialogue
Next up, this dialogue is deleted from the expanded and enhances and that too very poorly because it hurts rockstar's ego. Now you will hear nothing while michael moves his mouth
I genuinely don't understand how their PR are okay with this. They pretty much turned into some of the worst companies
Say less take everything and give nothing sounds about white.
OH MY FUCKING GOD üòÇ
I hate rockstar. Dont know why u still buy their games. Boycott them so they actually release good games. Used to love them. Now dont for 1 year
That would be Dan houser for you. He left rockstar just as frustrated as us that GTA6 isnt out yet.

Why is everyone blaming rockstar when Take 2 owns them and basically anything they do
*Dan Houser predicted Rockstar

He left the company for a reason methinks.

This is amazing
Damn.
This has nothing to do with this post but it's GTA related and it's been gnawing at my brain these past few weeks. I'm 33, I grew up playing the shit out of 3, VC and SA. I was extremely bitter about them changing the maps and characters of Liberty City and Los Santos for IV and V. I never understood why people loved IV (though I've only played it all the way through just once and only just now playing TLaD & have yet to play BoGT) and always saying how much better the story was, so in my ignorance, it didn't make sense to me because I had such a love for the originals. After playing the originals again after all these years (and possibly partially due to the RDR2 incredible story) I've found myself playing IV and TLaD and genuinely enjoying everything about it. It's made me realize how much the originals really lacked in decent story telling. If you actually read all this, thank you and you're a badass üòú

    Walking around a big city a big city after dark is what broke me. Homeless people everywhere. They can't even make eye contact they're so fucked up. Thousand yard stare straight through your face, while asking for money. I wish I had the cash, lady. I really did.
        Damn I wish I had your upbringing where any of this was new to me. I grew up in a big city and I remember walking through a really bad part of town to get something for my dad from the store. I had the money in my hand and this homeless guy stopped me and told me "never walk around with your money out. A guy like me could just take it from a little guy like you".  And he absolutely could have. But he didn't. In hindsight, I bet he really thought about it but I guess he couldn't do it to a kid. He seemed almost annoyed with me for having to tell me that.
Holy fuck hole
Oh my fuck!
Holy fuck face

Happy Cake Day!
    Thank you! Didn‚Äôt even realize lol.
I always get reminded of the ingame ifruit ad

"iFruit 9IX

3% thinner 3% faster 30 hour queue"

They were making fun of companies releasing new phones for full price while barely changing anything, yet now they are doing that themsekf with expanded and enhanced and to an extent even the trilogy remastered
    Or Righteous slaughter 7
    They also had a Digifarm Spinoffs ad 

"Digi-Gangsta .... buy an expensive digital sports car, and increase the length and girth of your sprite's penis with experience points"

They were literally making fun of GTA Online without even knowing it lol
    but they have fast character switching now

I honestly think it‚Äôs just Take2 making them milk it as much as possible
Projecting, projecting.
I never understood why you're all so upset, but don't shit on Howard for releasing Skyrim literally 7 or 8 times in 10 years.

R* gave us RDR2 in 2018. Before that, GTA 5 was 2013.  These MASSIVE open world games take TIME to make.

Yes, they keep GTA online going. Wouldn't you? if you were making boatloads of money off of one service, you'd keep that mule going for as long as possible, would you not?  and it pads their revenue so they can afford to work on their next project.

But no, you guys don't get a game from R* every year and you're frothing at the fucking mouth.

Give them some time.  Don't buy E&E if you don't fucking like it but stop pretending like R* owes you shit
    People criticise Skyrim re-releases all the time - just not on the GTA sub, because it's about GTA.
        [removed]
            so... my hate for r\* isnt justified just because people like me, who dont care about elder scrolls, arent angry skyrim gets re-released
                if thats what you took from my comment then god help you
    Dude... is this really the hill you wish to die upon?
        Absolutely.  Fuck all of you.  Y'all are just children wanting what you don't have and then blaming your parents when things don't go your way.  Keep your fucking mouth shut.
    You had me until the end. Rock* owes me a functional fucking game lmao. But yeah I don‚Äôt begrudge them for not yet releasing gta 6.
        What do they owe you exactly you decide to buy the game it was your option to also not buy and wait for reviews they don‚Äôt owe you shit because is there after they mad the game and can do whatever they want with it
            You know, for hundreds of years we used to have these things called refunds. Corporations didn't like refunds though because they had to give money back to people. Many internet came along, the internet was this new and crazy thing that needed new laws for it. We decided not to make new laws for it. As such corporations realize they could make their own laws for it, so now they can sell you items with absolutely no chance of getting a refund even if the object they sold you wasn't what was advertised in the slightest. I mean let's be real here, what if I don't have access to things like game reviews. How was I supposed to know the game was crap? It's not like the Rockstar launcher has any way to look at the reviews of the games.
                How can you have a console or a pc and don‚Äôt have access to reviews also you know there is something call steam that actually do refunds
    [deleted]
        It's entirely your fault for paying for this dog shit lmao

in an age where video reviews come out days before or literal hours after a game releases, live streams of the game from the moment it's available to play a plethora of media telling you what this was, it's 100% your own fault for paying for this.

If you pre-ordered it, you're even worse and I have nothing left to say to you. You should know better.
Wtf, that actually checks out! How did I not know this?
    \+ Leopold Strauss from Red Dead Redemption 2 is named after him.
Pretty sure Trevor would‚Äôve been the one to do that lol
    Pretty sure Trevor would first boot fuck, then turn around and skull fuck the CEO. After he‚Äôs done he will shit on him and go spoon Mr. Raspberry Jam.
This applies to every fucking game today‚Ä¶ why actually put work into a game when people will buy it regardless and you can just issue an apology and promise that you‚Äôll fix the game in future updates. All while hiding behind the millions you made from the shitty, unfinished video game.
    Seriously these days, companies are all just so disconnected from reality it's insane. From Blizzard's W3 reforged to GTA trilogy definitive edition or whatever it's called, they just expect to make a quick buck while spending nothing on the product. When I watched that video of the CEO of Chewy talking about how he came up with the idea of just pretty much PROVIDING A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE TO HIS CUSTOMERS to be successful, it was as if it was a novelty to everyone. We're just so used to shitty customer service, shitty products that are often overpriced, that Chewy was instantly successful. And it was supposed to be for jewelry too at first. The CEO pretty much said "it could have been about ANYTHING and it would have been successful". And he was 100% right. Provide good service and a good or even just decent product and you will be successful. Seriously, they could have just provided the new GTA edition at the older cost along with the older version and they would 100% have made more profit (or well will make I suppose) to begin with and people wouldn't have been upset. But nope it's going for a full AAA price instead.
        Especially because nobody needed this so soon‚Ä¶ you have an infinite amount of time to remaster a game, it‚Äôs clear that companies just want to make a quick buck when you release something in such a shitty condition. I understand releasing a game from a franchise that people are expecting. But people could‚Äôve waited a couple more years for these GTA games to be remastered and released, nobody needed these RIGHT NOW.
            Yeah! At the end of the day it's pretty much the good old saying "the customer is always right". When you take a look at a remake like Diablo 2 remastered, they literally did what everyone wanted; the exact same game with better graphics (and 1080p). This is what we got and I have enjoyed it since the release. Sure, there's no tci/ip support and sure I'd love to have some mods and whatnot, but even the graphics themselves are just EXACTLY like what it used to be but better. And it actually looks pretty damn good. When I look at someone streaming any of the definitive edition, it just looks like the same old game but with some mods on top. Definitely not what I would expect for a fully priced bundled.
    [removed]
        I agree but it‚Äôs sadly not a viable option‚Ä¶ the amount of people on the internet that actually care about quality pales in comparison to the people who will just buy the new COD because it‚Äôs COD (same goes for any triple A studio)

I think the workers need to strike or something‚Ä¶ refuse to make your shitty game and meet the shitty demands until quality control is taken more seriously. No more crunching.
Take 2 ceo*
This was 8 years ago though, was it relevant then?
    Well there was supposed to be add-ons and DLC to GTA5 story mode that never came, so possibly.

Also one year after GTA5 they did that PS4 port of San Andreas everyone hated.

It's been a long time but I'm pretty sure I've had some distaste for Rockstars ways since around the time this game came out.
        Actually that was the PS3/Xbox 360 port. The PS4 rerelease was much more positively received and true to the PS2 version.
            Yeah the PS4 version is great. I was lucky enough to buy it before the OG games were taken off the psstore for the new trilogy and I have to say, it feels like a direct port of the ps2 version.
                Same. That and the Vice City PS4 release. If they had all the songs intact they‚Äôd probably be the best versions of the games.
                    I wish I would've got all 3 when I had the chance. I'm grateful I atleast had the sense to buy San Andreas but not having 3 and VC really sucks now that they're gone... that's the worst part of the "definitive" trilogy imo, that they replaced the OG games altogether. Wtf was R* thinking?
                        R\* was thinking that people would buy it.

turns out they were right.
                            Well this is my first experience with something made by Grove Street Games. I missed the San Andreas port they screwed up and only heard about it recently. At first I didn't think the trilogy was actually that bad, but the more I played it, the worse it got. Then they "updated" the trilogy and now my Switch version is so much worse than it was before. It's comically bad now. 

I've always supported R* and as long as it's first party R* , I most likely always will. I'll never touch a damn thing GSG was a part of again though and my love for R* will change if they ever work with that garbage company again. GSG is a f'in joke.
                Us Xbox people don‚Äôt get the good PS4 port of SA. Only the 360 port and now the definitive editionüòÇüòÇ
                    Yeah but you can still buy a good version of SA for the 360 and play it on all Xbox consoles right now, Playstation players are kinda screwed when it comes to the GTA franchise, especially now that the original games have been pulled down. We can't play Gta4 at all,  there's no physical or digital version we can play on ps4 or ps5 lol
                        damn.. ill launch myself from the swingset for ya, homieüôè
            Was there a ps4 release of San Andreas? That I could play on my ps5. I was so excited for the trilogy until it released.
                Unfortunately no, not at the moment since they were taken down from the Playstation store. I heard the original games are being relisted on PC so hopefully console versions will be next. The version on PS4 was very good so if you don't want to try the trilogy, keep an eye out for the originals going back up and grab it as soon as they do
                There was. It was digital only and was pretty faithful other than a few songs removed for copyright.
                    That's because it was literally just the PS2 version emulated on a PS4
        I think you're talking about the Xbox version the PS4 version is literally the PS2 original game upscaled.
        They hate the ps4 port because they're xbox fanboys
        ive had some distaste for Rockstar since max payne 3 days :)
    Probably. That's when they started squeezing out money from Online, so the developers might have known ahead of time.
        Nope, only after 2015 they really 'squeezed money out of online'
Yeah I always felt like RDR2 was a self realising tragedy, its like just before rockstar lost all semblance of their soul, they released that banger. One last time
Who ever said there can only be one problem?
Outsourcing to a company with a poor track record is a problem. Lack of quality control is a problem. People pre-ordering games is a problem.

The big over-arching problem is the system where it's more profitable to release a game like this half-baked. They could do extra development and quality control, but that costs money and I'm guessing they struck a balance between cutting costs and losing sales.

Rockstar's priority is T2 share prices over all else unfortunately. Games are just a tool for them to drive share prices.
[removed]
    You wouldn't call it good cuz you're an xbox fanboy and would praise anything Phil releases even 69 bangers lol.
they created only third max payne game and it was not that good compared to first two ones (made by Remedy entertainmet )
r/thatsthejoke
    Not just me then
And the dirty work was sloppy
    Because they were underpaid, due to Rockstar thinking they were big enough and bad enough that they didn't need to play by the rules.
        lmao
No shit sherlock.
What other deductions have you made Sherlock?
Yes..  that's the joke
Thanks Peter
Whooooooosh
Welcome to "youtube comment section".
That‚Äôs why ppl should limit their expectations for gta6.. which is probably gonna be gta online part 2 with a single player slapped on to it as a checklist item
    This! This is exactly what I've been trying to tell people.
    From what I‚Äôve heard on YouTube  they‚Äôre gonna get rid of offensive jokes and be pc
        They won't as GTA's main paying audience are little children or teenagers who still think that being offensive for the sake of being offensive is funny.
            You sure about that?  


\*cough\* Hot coffee mod \*cough\*
                Precisely
                    What? I was disagreeing with you lol. I was using that "mod" as an example of rockstar not willing to go that far anymore. They already have a bad rep now, the media will eat them alive if they do anything considered too offensive, sadly.  


2013 was a different time.
                        Case in point
>I feel like since Dan Houser left Rockstar dipped hard

Nah, he started the outsourcing actually. The awful remaster of GTA San Andreas and the lackluster mobile ports by War Drum all happened under Dan Houser's watch.
    I wonder if the definitive trilogy would've been better if he actually helped with it instead of delegating it off.

A few high up producers from the originals did actually help Grove Street Games, but I don't think Dan was involved at all. Which is odd honestly. Almost that entire universe was designed by him and Lazlow, and neither of them were there to make sure GSG filled in the blanks properly.
At this point I don‚Äôt even want GTA 6 anymore. They‚Äôre going to have to make an unbelievable game to satisfy even a fraction of the hype and with how they‚Äôve been acting it‚Äôs not looking good.
    They're probably gonna make some goofy shit to please their 5-15 yo audience, the only ones who like what Rockstar did with GTA online. I just hope that it feels/look as revolutionary as RDR2, when it came out. But to be honest and realist, my expectations aren't very high with Rockstar. I saw Rockstar as a company with high standards, love for games and their fans. That thought is slowly fading away tbh.
        I don't want gta to be realistic just grounded
            literally the same thing
            If that shit means drive and kill missions like gta 3 and 4, I don't want it
                Yea same
    Talk about being entitled.
        I never understood why people who critisize a game/developer get called "entitled" by people like you. People literally pay R* for the game, so they have every right to call it shit. If they would hand the game out for free, You'd have a point.
            Entitled because unrealistic expectations.
                Wanting something to happen because it would be nice is not being entitled.

I would like for my team to win the championship this Sunday, it doesn't mean I feel entitled to the happiness I'd derive from that.
I'd either 6 or Bully 2. Why do i get the feeling Bully 2 would be a soulless sequel? I feel like respect for the series would become 0.
    Good thing theres never gonna be another bully. Rockstar only focuses on gta and red dead now smh
        We dont know that just yet. Gotta gave hope but again this is Rockstar soo, hope is nearly gone
It's not about skills anymore, it's all about greed and power to do things that other can't and other don't give a fuck about the game
*takes 2
Corporations
    Same shit
Offshore?
    It‚Äôs horrible. You wouldn‚Äôt want to get offshored just to save a little money would you T?
        Nah I wouldn‚Äôt uh um
Remember the LifeInvader shit about invading privacy and people‚Äôs data? Was Rockstar onto something?
    Faceboo-I-I mean Meta!
They are both good problem solved.
Cause GTA 5s storyline is a generic heist movie. Been done a million times before. 4 was much more unique and deep. Not many movies about a Eastern European immigrant moving to USA to escape his old life of crime only to be sucked back into it by his cousin, go through a lot of struggle then eventually make something of himself, meets a nice girl he could see himself settling down with, only for it to end tragically. 5 is more glamorous but that‚Äôs all it is
    They both are great in their own ways
    Niko actually went to the US to find the guy who betrayed his team and kill him, not to escape his old life.
        That‚Äôs part of it, also to escape cause Ray Bulgarin was after him
            Naw he pretty clearly explains his reason in the beginning of the game.
    Ok gta 4 fanboy.
They can't really be compared because they have different story genres. While GTA IV is deep, realistic, and even sad and depressing at some points (Niko's past and his thirst for revenge, the end of the Holland Play mission if you take Playboy's side, and especially the Ending of the game), GTA V is comedic and action-packed. Even the scenes in V that could have a sensitive touch, like Trevor's relationship with Patricia or Michael's family situation, are being ridiculed (Trevor biting off Madrazo's ear or Michael tattooing a penis on Lazlow's chest).
Imagine judging a story based on one line the character spoke. GTA 5 is still just a glamorous game with an above average story. That being said it's a technical masterpiece. So both 4 and 5 are great in their own ways.
Exactly. Gta 5's story was so much more satirical and interesting.
Yeppp they're just gta 4 fanboys. I encountered one earlier and holy shit was this guy being biased towards 4 and against 5.
You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain
Rockstar published the game, they had the final word regarding its release.
    Thing is though, could still be both. I've heard behind the scenes Rockstar doesn't have full control because T2 is breathing down their necks do other shit. And T2 *owns* Rockstar, they *have* to comply.

Aside from the loss of original Rockstar staff, I heard that's why GTA slowly changed over the years. As it got bigger and bigger T2 started telling Rockstar how *they* wanted it.

Like GSG games is a subcontractor for a corporation owned by another corporation. Corporate everything is trash. For all we know T2 outright told Rockstar not to give a shit and focus on whatever the next main title is. Hard to say since they're secretive as fuck and try be all dramatic with surprise announcements after years of silence.
        [deleted]
            Well that's what people already thought then Rockstar blindsided everyone with RDR2.

Honestly wouldn't be surprised if the next main title is some weird shit like Bully 2 or Manhunt 3
                Do you know how many people would get on their asses for Manhunt 3? That shit isn't happening anytime soon lol
Yeah because it‚Äôs not like rockstar has any say right?
Rockstar published the game and war drum studios shat out garbage, in reality its both of their fault since rockstar gave less of a shit about quality and war drum doesn‚Äôt give a shit about making something good
Other comments are smugly shitting on you, but you might be correct here. I wasn't sure if GSG, R*, or T2 should be blamed - maybe all of them - but R* is actually "wholly owned" by T2, so the suits at T2 are probably at least the main issue here since they tell R* what to do. [This video](https://youtu.be/knXqO0hz600) explains it pretty well (no, it's not mine).
If I wanted to pull my investment out of Take-Two and put it in Rockstar, what's Rockstar's stock symbol? Oh wait, I can't do that because THEY'RE THE SAME COMPANY.

Many internet came along, the internet was this new and crazy thing that needed new laws for it. We decided not to make new laws for it. As such corporations realize they could make their own laws for it, so now they can sell you items with absolutely no chance of getting a refund even if the object they sold you wasn't what was advertised in the slightest. I mean let's be real here, what if I don't have access to things like game reviews. How was I supposed to know the game was crap? It's not like the Rockstar launcher has any way to look at the reviews of the games.
            How can you have a console or a pc and don‚Äôt have access to reviews also you know there is something call steam that actually do refunds

    It's entirely your fault for paying for this dog shit lmao

in an age where video reviews come out days before or literal hours after a game releases, live streams of the game from the moment it's available to play a plethora of media telling you what this was, it's 100% your own fault for paying for this.

If you pre-ordered it, you're even worse and I have nothing left to say to you. You should know better.
\+ Leopold Strauss from Red Dead Redemption 2 is named after him.
Pretty sure Trevor would first boot fuck, then turn around and skull fuck the CEO. After he‚Äôs done he will shit on him and go spoon Mr. Raspberry Jam.
Seriously these days, companies are all just so disconnected from reality it's insane. From Blizzard's W3 reforged to GTA trilogy definitive edition or whatever it's called, they just expect to make a quick buck while spending nothing on the product. When I watched that video of the CEO of Chewy talking about how he came up with the idea of just pretty much PROVIDING A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE TO HIS CUSTOMERS to be successful, it was as if it was a novelty to everyone. We're just so used to shitty customer service, shitty products that are often overpriced, that Chewy was instantly successful. And it was supposed to be for jewelry too at first. The CEO pretty much said "it could have been about ANYTHING and it would have been successful". And he was 100% right. Provide good service and a good or even just decent product and you will be successful. Seriously, they could have just provided the new GTA edition at the older cost along with the older version and they would 100% have made more profit (or well will make I suppose) to begin with and people wouldn't have been upset. But nope it's going for a full AAA price instead.
    Especially because nobody needed this so soon‚Ä¶ you have an infinite amount of time to remaster a game, it‚Äôs clear that companies just want to make a quick buck when you release something in such a shitty condition. I understand releasing a game from a franchise that people are expecting. But people could‚Äôve waited a couple more years for these GTA games to be remastered and released, nobody needed these RIGHT NOW.
        Yeah! At the end of the day it's pretty much the good old saying "the customer is always right". When you take a look at a remake like Diablo 2 remastered, they literally did what everyone wanted; the exact same game with better graphics (and 1080p). This is what we got and I have enjoyed it since the release. Sure, there's no tci/ip support and sure I'd love to have some mods and whatnot, but even the graphics themselves are just EXACTLY like what it used to be but better. And it actually looks pretty damn good. When I look at someone streaming any of the definitive edition, it just looks like the same old game but with some mods on top. Definitely not what I would expect for a fully priced bundled.

    I agree but it‚Äôs sadly not a viable option‚Ä¶ the amount of people on the internet that actually care about quality pales in comparison to the people who will just buy the new COD because it‚Äôs COD (same goes for any triple A studio)

I think the workers need to strike or something‚Ä¶ refuse to make your shitty game and meet the shitty demands until quality control is taken more seriously. No more crunching.
Well there was supposed to be add-ons and DLC to GTA5 story mode that never came, so possibly.

Also one year after GTA5 they did that PS4 port of San Andreas everyone hated.

It's been a long time but I'm pretty sure I've had some distaste for Rockstars ways since around the time this game came out.
    Actually that was the PS3/Xbox 360 port. The PS4 rerelease was much more positively received and true to the PS2 version.
        Yeah the PS4 version is great. I was lucky enough to buy it before the OG games were taken off the psstore for the new trilogy and I have to say, it feels like a direct port of the ps2 version.
            Same. That and the Vice City PS4 release. If they had all the songs intact they‚Äôd probably be the best versions of the games.
                I wish I would've got all 3 when I had the chance. I'm grateful I atleast had the sense to buy San Andreas but not having 3 and VC really sucks now that they're gone... that's the worst part of the "definitive" trilogy imo, that they replaced the OG games altogether. Wtf was R* thinking?
                    R\* was thinking that people would buy it.

turns out they were right.
                        Well this is my first experience with something made by Grove Street Games. I missed the San Andreas port they screwed up and only heard about it recently. At first I didn't think the trilogy was actually that bad, but the more I played it, the worse it got. Then they "updated" the trilogy and now my Switch version is so much worse than it was before. It's comically bad now. 

I've always supported R* and as long as it's first party R* , I most likely always will. I'll never touch a damn thing GSG was a part of again though and my love for R* will change if they ever work with that garbage company again. GSG is a f'in joke.
            Us Xbox people don‚Äôt get the good PS4 port of SA. Only the 360 port and now the definitive editionüòÇüòÇ
                Yeah but you can still buy a good version of SA for the 360 and play it on all Xbox consoles right now, Playstation players are kinda screwed when it comes to the GTA franchise, especially now that the original games have been pulled down. We can't play Gta4 at all,  there's no physical or digital version we can play on ps4 or ps5 lol
                    damn.. ill launch myself from the swingset for ya, homieüôè
        Was there a ps4 release of San Andreas? That I could play on my ps5. I was so excited for the trilogy until it released.
            Unfortunately no, not at the moment since they were taken down from the Playstation store. I heard the original games are being relisted on PC so hopefully console versions will be next. The version on PS4 was very good so if you don't want to try the trilogy, keep an eye out for the originals going back up and grab it as soon as they do
            There was. It was digital only and was pretty faithful other than a few songs removed for copyright.
                That's because it was literally just the PS2 version emulated on a PS4
    I think you're talking about the Xbox version the PS4 version is literally the PS2 original game upscaled.
    They hate the ps4 port because they're xbox fanboys
    ive had some distaste for Rockstar since max payne 3 days :)
Probably. That's when they started squeezing out money from Online, so the developers might have known ahead of time.
    Nope, only after 2015 they really 'squeezed money out of online'
You wouldn't call it good cuz you're an xbox fanboy and would praise anything Phil releases even 69 bangers lol.
Not just me then
Because they were underpaid, due to Rockstar thinking they were big enough and bad enough that they didn't need to play by the rules.
    lmao
This! This is exactly what I've been trying to tell people.
From what I‚Äôve heard on YouTube  they‚Äôre gonna get rid of offensive jokes and be pc
    They won't as GTA's main paying audience are little children or teenagers who still think that being offensive for the sake of being offensive is funny.
        You sure about that?  


\*cough\* Hot coffee mod \*cough\*
            Precisely
                What? I was disagreeing with you lol. I was using that "mod" as an example of rockstar not willing to go that far anymore. They already have a bad rep now, the media will eat them alive if they do anything considered too offensive, sadly.  


2013 was a different time.
                    Case in point
I wonder if the definitive trilogy would've been better if he actually helped with it instead of delegating it off.

A few high up producers from the originals did actually help Grove Street Games, but I don't think Dan was involved at all. Which is odd honestly. Almost that entire universe was designed by him and Lazlow, and neither of them were there to make sure GSG filled in the blanks properly.
They're probably gonna make some goofy shit to please their 5-15 yo audience, the only ones who like what Rockstar did with GTA online. I just hope that it feels/look as revolutionary as RDR2, when it came out. But to be honest and realist, my expectations aren't very high with Rockstar. I saw Rockstar as a company with high standards, love for games and their fans. That thought is slowly fading away tbh.
    I don't want gta to be realistic just grounded
        literally the same thing
        If that shit means drive and kill missions like gta 3 and 4, I don't want it
            Yea same
Talk about being entitled.
    I never understood why people who critisize a game/developer get called "entitled" by people like you. People literally pay R* for the game, so they have every right to call it shit. If they would hand the game out for free, You'd have a point.
        Entitled because unrealistic expectations.
            Wanting something to happen because it would be nice is not being entitled.

I would like for my team to win the championship this Sunday, it doesn't mean I feel entitled to the happiness I'd derive from that.
Good thing theres never gonna be another bully. Rockstar only focuses on gta and red dead now smh
    We dont know that just yet. Gotta gave hope but again this is Rockstar soo, hope is nearly gone
Same shit
It‚Äôs horrible. You wouldn‚Äôt want to get offshored just to save a little money would you T?
    Nah I wouldn‚Äôt uh um
Faceboo-I-I mean Meta!
They both are great in their own ways
Niko actually went to the US to find the guy who betrayed his team and kill him, not to escape his old life.
    That‚Äôs part of it, also to escape cause Ray Bulgarin was after him
        Naw he pretty clearly explains his reason in the beginning of the game.
Ok gta 4 fanboy.
Thing is though, could still be both. I've heard behind the scenes Rockstar doesn't have full control because T2 is breathing down their necks do other shit. And T2 *owns* Rockstar, they *have* to comply.

Aside from the loss of original Rockstar staff, I heard that's why GTA slowly changed over the years. As it got bigger and bigger T2 started telling Rockstar how *they* wanted it.

Like GSG games is a subcontractor for a corporation owned by another corporation. Corporate everything is trash. For all we know T2 outright told Rockstar not to give a shit and focus on whatever the next main title is. Hard to say since they're secretive as fuck and try be all dramatic with surprise announcements after years of silence.
    [deleted]
        Well that's what people already thought then Rockstar blindsided everyone with RDR2.

Honestly wouldn't be surprised if the next main title is some weird shit like Bully 2 or Manhunt 3
            Do you know how many people would get on their asses for Manhunt 3? That shit isn't happening anytime soon lol
To avoid taxes lol
What a tragedy man, I saw it coming but I didn't think it would be this bad.
Ohhh shit...


GTA. My moneymaking machine. At least it was before I fucked everythin' up.
    All we had to do, was follow the damn train, C111tla!!
Holy fucking shit
Damn I wish I had your upbringing where any of this was new to me. I grew up in a big city and I remember walking through a really bad part of town to get something for my dad from the store. I had the money in my hand and this homeless guy stopped me and told me "never walk around with your money out. A guy like me could just take it from a little guy like you".  And he absolutely could have. But he didn't. In hindsight, I bet he really thought about it but I guess he couldn't do it to a kid. He seemed almost annoyed with me for having to tell me that.
No king rules forever, my son.

    so... my hate for r\* isnt justified just because people like me, who dont care about elder scrolls, arent angry skyrim gets re-released
        if thats what you took from my comment then god help you
Absolutely.  Fuck all of you.  Y'all are just children wanting what you don't have and then blaming your parents when things don't go your way.  Keep your fucking mouth shut.

At first I didn't think the trilogy was actually that bad, but the more I played it, the worse it got. Then they "updated" the trilogy and now my Switch version is so much worse than it was before. It's comically bad now. 

I've always supported R* and as long as it's first party R* , I most likely always will. I'll never touch a damn thing GSG was a part of again though and my love for R* will change if they ever work with that garbage company again. GSG is a f'in joke.
Yeah but you can still buy a good version of SA for the 360 and play it on all Xbox consoles right now, Playstation players are kinda screwed when it comes to the GTA franchise, especially now that the original games have been pulled down. We can't play Gta4 at all,  there's no physical or digital version we can play on ps4 or ps5 lol
    damn.. ill launch myself from the swingset for ya, homieüôè
That's because it was literally just the PS2 version emulated on a PS4
What? I was disagreeing with you lol. I was using that "mod" as an example of rockstar not willing to go that far anymore. They already have a bad rep now, the media will eat them alive if they do anything considered too offensive, sadly.  


2013 was a different time.
    Case in point
R\* was thinking that people would buy it.
