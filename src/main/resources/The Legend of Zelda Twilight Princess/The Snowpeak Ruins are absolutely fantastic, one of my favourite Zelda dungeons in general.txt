[[The Snowpeak Ruins are absolutely fantastic, one of my favourite Zelda dungeons in general]]





The look and atmosphere of this place is great: the decaying mansion that was once very fancy and rich now being destroyed by the elements, now inhabited by a couple of yetis that turned it into a home.

Love how the husband is making a soup for his sick wife and how she is so sweet but ends up corrupted by the mirror, the ending scene with them hugging and spewing hearts everywhere is so lovely.
    You know what? The mansion in the movie Some Girls reminds me of it.
Dude me too! Twilight Princess is the apex of the Zelda Series, in my opinion!
     Agree with you, it's the refinement of everthing that came before it. The combat is fun, the story is interesting, the dungeons are masterfully designed, the world is interesting, items are fun, love the lore, it has the best sidekick by far, nice artstyle.
        And one of my favorite touches is how Link is left-handed in it (GameCube version, of course) with the *only* other character in the game who shares this attribute is the Hero's Spirit/Hero's Shade. The Hero's Shade being Link from the Past teaching his descendant/reincarnation his sword techniques, passed down from the Heroes of Old. 

That's one of my favorite aspects! Despite the Wii Version mirroring the game, this Link was the last official left-handed variant, save for a few spin-offs. I miss that so much! I miss him being the Left-Handed Hero.
            I don't know why nintendo made him right handed in BotW and TotK. I get the motion conrtol excuse in SS, but I dislike that it seems like moving forward they make him right handed for no reason.

I tried talking about it in r/zelda, but it seems like most people there came from BotW and TotK and don't seem to care about it.
                I am definitely a TP fanboy but I'm gonna be honest: I don't care which hand Link holds his sword with. Left is cool, and right is cool. I care about the rest of the game, exclusively
                    Left is cool. Right is just normal. Normal isn't uncool, but only one is unique. You not caring doesn't change that Link should be lefty. Representation is important. Left-handers exist and Link used to be our one left-handed hero.
                I hear you there. Most people don't care, and they'll go out of their way to say so. They make it seem as if it doesn't matter because it 'doesn't affect gameplay'. But if it doesn't affect gameplay, then why not keep him lefty? Link was the only left-handed swordsman protagonist in gaming. It was a unique quality that made him stand out just a bit. Now in Smash he's that much more like all the Fire Emblem swordies and Metaknight and Shulk and Sora than he was before. 

It doesn't matter. But it does. Left-handers exist, and representation is important regardless of whether or not every individual cares what hand he holds his sword in. I'll forever be sad that he's righty now, for no reason.
                    Nice to see I'm not the only one who gets bothered by this. I also think his moer recent design is less unique. 

It's not a bad design, but it seems more generic to me than the classic look. I don't get it when people say that his green tunic and cap don't look cool for modern eyes (I've seen some people say that in the Zelda sub).
                        Can we be best friends, please?
                            Yes!
                                I sent you a message days ago. lol
                                    Omg, I'm so sorry i didn't see it! I'll answer you
I want a twilight princess port on switch so bad. This dungeon is one of many reasons.
    I like the WiiU HD version, but I feel like nintendo could have done more to remaster the game. 

I would love to see more polygons in this game and a newer lighting system. I love the art style of TP.
        Yes you took the words out of my mouth
        Same, really enjoyed playing it on wiiU. It just didnâ€™t feel like it had the love that windwakerHD had put into it
        I would pay $1,000 to play a new Nintendo produced, full length twilight princess style game. 

I was hoping with all my heart ToTK would bring back some of that old zelda charm and while it's an incredible improvement over botw, it just doesn't feel like the Zelda I grew up with. Feels like an S tier open world game.
            I feel you. I also don't feel like BotW and TotK feel like Zelda, and Nintendo said that future games will follow that structure going forward. I'm gonna miss that classic Zelda feel.
                Don't get me wrong, I had a blast playing botw/totk... but at a certain point it was just another open world game. The next one will be just another open world game. Wee, caving and scavenging. Nintendo team does it best but... I never loved that style of game to begin with. I actually *like* parameters. No issue with ToTK "solve it however you like" style, but when they make it this easy and free I almost feel like what's the point... Doing whatever I want is for sandbox games like GTA or Minecraft. 

I kind of understand the argument against the Zelda formula but I can't see anyone saying tp, oot, MM and SS are the same games...

Trying not to bitch too much but I swear there's a happy middle ground here and ToTK did not hit it for me. Dungeons felt like an afterthought to appease Zelda audience. Puzzles were top tier, but without themeing like the Snowpeak Ruins... they just felt like puzzles. Music was way too quiet. Could've helped atmosphere a lot.

I'll give BoTW a one-time break because it truly changed the open world genre, but I don't want every Zelda game to be BoTW 2.0, BoTW 3.0 etc...
                    I feel the same as you. I don't think BotW or TotK aare bad games, but they just feel like a different thing. I like the themed dungeons that take hours to complete, how they grow more complex as time goes on, the variety that other games had in them. 

I feel like even though BotW formula has quality, it focuses on quantity over quality of content. The world felt shallow, the story, the puzzles the themed areas... 

I also wish we could have a game that mixed the best of both worlds, but i'm getting old and I just don't like modern games as much.
    I still have my GameCube from like 2002 ðŸ˜Ž I just finished this temple.
        Iâ€™m so freakin jealous you still have one
Snowpeak Ruins, and Arbiters Grounds. I really am still mind blown every time I get to these areas. Sacred Grove also. This game is so next level. Atmospheric is an understatement.
S tier dungeon for sure. Top 3 Zelda dungeons all time.
I forgot how gorgeous the snow peak ruins area is
Easily one of the most unique dungeons in the series, and one of the few Ice levels in \*any\* game that I enjoy.
This was my favourite location in TP as a kid, the snowmen ppl were so sweet (when not possessed with very sharp teeth)
Top 3 castles: Snow Peak, Hyrule Castle, Sky Temple
I honestly love how itâ€™s not really a dungeon or some sort of temple. Itâ€™s just someoneâ€™s house XD
I would honestly love some kind of lore moment describing who used to live up there because it's so remote but they were clearly super rich, so what gives?? And what happened to them?
this is my favourite zelda dungeon
I thought this was Kino Der Toten
The most resident evil like dungeon of the Zelda games.
You know what? The mansion in the movie Some Girls reminds me of it.
