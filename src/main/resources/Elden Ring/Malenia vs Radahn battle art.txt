[[Malenia vs Radahn battle art]]


Hi y’all! I made a short comic of the battle between Radahn and Malenia, give it some love!


Wasn't she already blind when they fought? I don't think she ever really had eyes, that's why the blind swordsman trained her.
    Her being blind makes me wish the talisman that silences your steps would make her attack with a slight longer delay or to sometimes miss randomly
        Nah she's not listening to you, she's sensing the pure malice as you try for the 40th time.
            A spell to nullify your scent and talisman to reduce sound while walking and her good arm tied behind her back and I'd still need 2 summons and 13 furled finger callers to get the dub. Can she also sense my tears ?
                Believe in yourself friend, all you need is time and the willpower to walk that fog 500+ times and anything is possible.

~Signed someone dumb enough to make the leap from cheesing her with Mohg's spear to doing her hitless in melee
                    nobody asked
                        nobody asked you to be a bellend either but here you are, shaft on display
                            A year or so later, your comment taught me a wondrous insult. Thank you skeleton
                                no problem lol
                        I appreciated his response. May not have asked but it was welcome.
                I was surprised when I beat her on my 20th try during my bow only run
            she can taste the salt in the air
            40th?  Who do you think I am?  Some pro gamer?
            Heh, first time I did her with mimic tear and blasphemous blade, thought "what is everyone talking about? She's not so bad." In another playthrough, did her with no summons on a pure str build with greatsword, and thought, "OK, now I see what everyone is talking about."
        That would be cool and reminiscent of the [Old Hero ](https://demonssouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Old+Hero) from Demon's Souls.

        sounds like a fromsoftware thing to do! :D
        I beat her on my second try, seemed easy at the time. Mimic tear and rejuvia + frost misericorde. I found her attacks easy to evade, surprisingly enough. Almost got her on my first try but i went in blind not knowing her moves and abilities yet so she caught me out.

        Something like gough in ds1 dlc?
        That very thought pierced my mind today have you tried the talisman?
            I haven't, did you try it out? Did we discover something ?
                I wish ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
    I realized that , but it felt easier to give her an expression with eyes, She’s cooler like this for me, opinions?
        I mean I was also thinking she had no eyes by this point but honestly your eye expressions are amazing so I don't mind the lore break.
            Love the art, even if not consistent with lore :)  

yellow eyes are more a frenzied flame sign.  You get such also in your character if going that path.  But.. who knows who the 3 fingers gave free hugs too :). Maybe her too.  Fell god is associated with eyes and red hair.. prosthetic legs.. arms.. eyes? in helmet?  

Placing is also most likely near big rot tree outside castle, where the black knives have crossbows.  The invisibility of black knives would be useless against the blind, but the cross bows might even out the fight out a bit.  I Wonder if it was an ambush involved in the fight too?  But head canon guess.
                >yellow eyes are more a frenzied flame sign.

Iirc every non-tarnished human has yellow eyes. Millicent has yellow eyes for example, and I think Kenneth has them too, but I'm not sure.
                    iirc those directly tied with the Erdtree in some way have eyes of gold (Melina, Marika, Godfrey, etc)

Kenneth does have gold eyes, as does Millicent


looking at [more here,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu_Q9TwF5Xc) Sellen doesn't have gold eyes in either of her bodies, but she also isn't directly tied to Marika/Radagon at all
                    I thought it was tied to being able to see the guidance of grace
                        It's tied to the grace imbued in the non-Tarnished. Godfrey's eyes "dulled" when he lost the grace of the Erdtree and became the first Tarnished. The gold eyes never returned, even after the guidance of grace did.
        Idk I think her being blind is so integral to her character. I really love that she's a powerful disabled character.
            I was talking about this with someone the other day. It's a consistent theme for From games to have strong/important disabled characters. Maybe it's because I have a disability but it always stood out to me.
                I mean, in from soft games pretty much EVERYONE is disabled in some way, so yeah
                I do love characters like that, sad that it's overshadowed by WATERFOWL DANCE 

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
                    Waterfowl Dance? I think you meam Fowl Play *Badum tss*
                        Waterfoul dance? I think you mean AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
            her disability IS part of her power lol
        Fair enough, but I think making her eye color cloudy could work. (I'm no artist tho) 

But I feel like some cloudy Grey eyes with that expression could still work.

IGNORE ME
            >IGNORE ME


I don't think I will >:)
        It’s a masterpiece I would love to see more Elden ring stuff like this.
            Thank you! I was thinking about making another comic but I’m quite uncertain about the topic. I would love to do a Rennala/Radagon one!
Thoughts?
                I think that would be very interesting, they met during the war and fell in love they had children and radagon left her for Marika. 

Visually Renalla is probably the only demigod which doesn’t look weathered but how did Radagon look when he isn’t fused with Marika and crumbling so to speak. 

That’s all the context I can think off.

I just really like your artstyle and even if it isn’t lore accurate ( which shouldn’t matter in the souls franchise ) it’s your interpretation and I’d love to see more.
                    Thank you so much for the suggestion🥹✨
        It looks great, but her disability is a very important part of her character.
        The expressions make everything, this comic made my jaw drop, gj!
            I don't get why this got a few downvotes
    She was. A minor knitpick, but the comic is still dope.
    Not gonna lie. The blind guy being the strongest fighter is such a stupid cliché so I prefer this. It already is pushing it to not walk into every wall. How much of a monster would she be WITH her eyesight? Completely untouchable.
    i’m not sure, there’s a certain shot in the trailer where if you zoom in very close, you can at least see that the rot hasn’t gone over her eyes yet, made a post on tumblr on it 

https://www.tumblr.com/intelligent-fish/699055681402241024/so-it-would-seem-that-malenia-might-be-freshly
    she wasn't actually! her cutscene model has eyes
Radahn: Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.
    Unfortunately for everybody, Malenia had TWO plans.
        Yeah win or rage quit
            Malenia's the kind of girl to pull out a shotgun in a street fist fight when it goes wrong
                Yep worse she doesn't kill you just takes your shins
    Malenia: Its easy to be confident when you’ve never taken a Scarlet Aeonia to the face.
        Leonard: Can the siblings stop fighting so I can get some hay?
    "Everybody has a face till they get punched in the plan" tike myson
    Malenia: I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella. And I have never known defeat
        *proceeds to get KO'd for milennia while Radahn still stood*
            *Proceed to recover from the battle while Radahn became a mindless corpse*
                *Both proceed to get clapped by a random nameless tarnished*

General Grievous: "Ah,yes, the negotiator!"
                    Nowadays Fromsoft bosses should know that if a random naked dude with a club enters the arena, the boss is going to be fucked.
                        Radagon: "I seek to repair the Elden Ring, and you won't stop me!"
Tarnished: "You're talking mad shit for someone in unga bunga range :')"
                            I think the line would be more like "I seek to repair the-" "UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA"
                                Correct!
            to be a zombie for me is to be dead
                His body is alive, his mind is just fucked. Therefore not dead.
                He's not a zombie, he just lost reason. He still retains all his skills, he still held back the stars and he still loves his horse
    To quote the great poet Joyner Lucas: "he thought he had a plan, till the fists hit 'im"
I like to think that since the Scarlet Rot affects memories and without Miquella's unalloyed golden needle, it starts to eat at her once more to the point that our fight with Malenia in her perspective is her battle with Radahn. 

She only seems to remember waiting for Miquella and killing a bunch of people but it's all foggy to her. To her, it was the fact that she was undefeated that Miquella admired her, so she was willing to sacrifice anything for victory, to live up to her beloved brother's expectations. 

So when we defeat Malenia, Blade of Miquella, her memory lapses and she repeats what she did with Radahn and unleashes the Scarlet Aeonia, becoming Malenia, Goddess of Rot.

&#x200B;

This is my theory because Millicent's goal is to deliver the Unalloyed Golden Needle, to Malenia, stating that she's there to return Malenia's lost pride. I believe that the Unalloyed Golden Needle is Malenia's pride since it's like a symbol of her bond with Miquella. Breaking that needle to defeat Radahn was necessary to protect Miquella, but in doing so would mean abandoning her pride as a warrior and giving in to the outer god she and her brother despised. 

I pity Malenia, the best course of action she could take to protect her brother led to the worst possible outcome.
    This is a pretty dope theory, ngl
    Wow that explains why we fight her so well! I've always been a little annoyed that we fight Malenia even though the tarnished doesn't have any motivation to do so beyond the not-so-great rune.

Love this theory!
    Thats a really good theory. Because there is literally no reason to fight her.
    Yea her not having the needle for so long probably fucked her up because it has apparently been quite a while since her duel with Radahn. The needle was the only thing keeping the rot at bay and was lost and damaged during the fight. Frankly its kinda surprising she wasn't further deteriorated bodily but guess they just went with mental damage.
        Fun fact, it can be implied that the cinematic where she puts on her arm when facing Radahn occurs right after she took out and broke the needle.

She knew she could only defeat Radahn if she used everything and gave in to the rot.

*"The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot. The pride she abandoned, to meet Radahn's measure."*

This line shows that she willingly abandoned her pride, the Unalloyed Golden Needle. And since in the cinematic, Radahn is shown waiting for Malenia, most likely, during the early stages of the battle and during her march to Caelid, Malenia was conflicted with her choice and never removed the needle. Only when she faced Radahn did she come to the conclusion that she really couldn't win without breaking the needle. Radahn let her remove it as we see him waiting for Malenia to prepare herself, probably implying that he wanted to fight Malenia at her strongest in respect for a fellow warrior and to honor her resolve.

So they probably duked it out at first, Malenia was at a disadvantage and Radahn stopped, allowing her to do what she needed to truly face him. So she took off her arm, removed the needle, broke it to probably ensure that she couldn't use it again knowing what removing it would mean to Miquella and believing herself unworthy of picking it up again, and put back her arm ready to face Radahn with everything, and Radahn taking it all head on to truly see who was worthy of the title of "Strongest", the Conquerer of the Stars, or the Undefeated Blade of Miquella.

And the reason why I believe that she broke the needle because she felt unworthy, is that even when we give it to her after defeating her, even when she becomes a Scarlet Aeonia, she gives it right back to us in the unfinished but strengthened form of Miquella's Needle. While it is still incapable of completely warding off the Outer Gods, it's capable of subduing the Flame of Frenzy entirely. In a way, it can be seen that Miquella intended to create the needles to prevent all the Outer Gods from interfering with the Lands Between but wasn't powerful enough to complete them. He grew the Haligtree to break his curse of eternal youth and grow to become even stronger to truly complete his work. Miquella gave the first creations of Unalloyed Gold, the prosthetics, to Malenia, as her original was regular gold, the one we give to Millicent. But when he created the needle, it was meant to protect against the Outer Gods, he might have planned to rebel against them all, and entrusted the first needle, to Malenia, to serve both as a cure for her affliction as the two of them had long dreamed, and to protect against the future threats that are the Outer Gods. By abandoning that needle to protect Miquella, Malenia essentially betrayed Miquella. 

And when she had to betray the one she loved most and everything he sacrificed, she felt unworthy to face him again. Even more so when she came home to find Miquella gone, stolen by Mohg, a figure she doesn't even know. As far as she is concerned, Miquella simply disappeared, she doesn't know if his growth was complete, only that the Haligtree lies silent. But even after everything, she knows he is still alive, and despite her failure and betrayal, she wants nothing more than to see him, so she hopelessly waits.
You missed out the word 'Have'
    Reeeeeeeeeally needed the “have.” Sounds like fighting a hillbilly goddess now; Inbred Malenia of the Rotten Swamp Banjo.
        ‘I ain’t never known no dang defeat!’
            *casts Mississippi River of Blood
            Put them foolish ambitions to rest y’all.
        Playing red dead 2 also so it fit like a glove for me tbh
    Also the "I'm Malenia" instead of "I am" sounds way more informal.
    It's sad that such beautiful art has to be spoiled by grammar. It's like watching a super model say: wassup bro
        Its a real "with great power must come great possibility" moment

[How that line probably went](https://voca.ro/1m2qI2lrTHds)
            I honestly think "with great power comes great responsibility" works a lot better than "with great power must come great responsibility".  It implies that the power and the responsibility are a package deal, and you don't have a choice in the matter.  That when you accept that power, you automatically accept the burden that comes along with it.  Also rolls off the tongue better.
                The original already drove that message home, as the tone of the original line necessitates that they are both a package (kind of like saying with storms comes rain or lightning, that they come *together*). With great power, comes great responsibility, the implication being when you have great power, there is an inherent responsibility with owning it, including the must only serves to make the line more clunky.
                    Yeah I know, I'm agreeing.  I'm saying the "must" is unnecessary
                        Whoops my bad, not enough coffees here clearly
                            Happens to the best of us, my friend
Pretty sure it should read: "and I have never known" not "and I never known"
    Or at least "I've"
She’s blind though…
    That radahn punch was so strong that she got back her eyes

                Good bot
    Is she just blind or does she not have eyes?
        Her eyes are rotted so she no longer has them
    Isn't the sword also part of her prosthetic?
        No, but it does have a socket of sorts that clips onto the sword's bare tang.  Her prosthetic hand grips the base of the blade.

Would be a wildly uncomfortable sword to use with meat hands.
        It is. The blade literally says "Blade built into Malenia's prosthetic arm." It's attached to it.
        Nah it's separate
            Y'all stop downvoting this mf, it IS separate until she clips it into the arm socket
Nice! Radahn is such a beast. Just like his hero, his step-father Godfrey.
But as far as i know the battle was a stalemate, nobody won
    Caelid lost.
        o7 Caelid.
        You spelled Iowa wrong.
    Hard to have any victory when an entire city and its surrounding are now radioactive++
        Fallout is two blocks away this is elden ring lol
            Caelid Mojave what’s the difference practical the same thing
                Caelid is basically just Cali, hell it even sounds similar
    Battle was a stalemate but Radahn ended up far worse than Malenia, or any other shardbearer after the shattering. Mindless and a country in absolute ruin.
        Tbh i prefer him than malenia who fainted after the aeonia, left the battlefield still unconscious only thanks to the cleanrot knights and still has the courage to say she has never known defeat.. bitch has no shame, would've 100% died if not for Finley
            The point of her saying that is most likely to do with her rot and endless fight for sanity and control of her own body and destiny. Like if a cancer patient says they haven't lost yet. Only killing her allows her to let go of the pride keeping her alive. Honestly I see it as resolve beyond anyone else in the game
            Radahn likely would've eaten Malenia's unconscious body if it weren't for Finely removing her from the scene. He could've also dropped the stars on top of Malenia's head and end it there, but he probably didn't want to destroy Caleid in the process.
                He was holding the stars back. He was not aiming them like a bazooka.
            Well Radahn did actually die, completely lost his mind and turned into a zombie. I’d say that 100% trumps that.
                Radahn is not a fuckimg zombie. My Man's been out here surviving with a plague that kills people in minutes for an age. And you have the nerve to call h a zombie, when *there are literal zombies in the game that he looks nothing like.*
                    He basically it. The OP was talking about his sense of self, which is entirely gone from him. He just mindlessly munches on corpses and roams around. He has 0 sentience left in him.
                        He maintains enough control to:

A) Not kill and eat the fresh meat he's sitting on.

B)  Hold the stars locked in place. 

Neither of which improve his immediate chances of survival, and one of them is actively detrimental.
Nor has his will eroded enough to be malleable.

The man is clearly insane, but a zombie he is not.
                            You can still be basically a "zombie" and do things strongly associated with your life. Like muscle memory. Its likely he didn't need to exert much conscious power for the stars once he was done with his initial conquest and his horse is clearly something very deeply ingrained. He can't talk, he can't reason, he is running on instinct and basic functions that were strong enough in his life to be done automatically. He is a living zombie.
                    You’ve clearly never watched any zombie films. He acts exactly the same. He howls at the moon and eats the corpses of friends and foe alike. This is not the behaviour of a person, it’s the behaviour of a thing that acts on complete instinct. Ergo Radahn is dead. All that’s left is a mindless instinct husk. Hence the entire reason for the festival.

I know you can’t bare the thought that Radahn got reduced to such a pitiful state but those are the facts. And cause I know your going to mention his horse. He spends all his time on it, learned magic just to ride it and his been on it so much it’s basically an extension of his body, like his swords, he isn’t eating his swords is he? Then he ain’t eating his method of travel.
                Nope, you actually kill him.. the whole point of the festival was to finally kill him and give him a glorious death in battle.
                    So when a person turns into a a zombie they aren’t considered dead?

If you wanna get technical the body that is Radahn is alive but that actual person that was Radahn is objectively dead, and no amount of downvotes from salty Radahn dickriders can convince me otherwise.
                        Dude, you are the one making up things calling him zombie. Everything i claim is backed up by in-game lore, and for what I remember nowhere was mentioned that radahn is a zombie, nor that whoever affected by scarlet rot becomes one. It may be as you say, as it may not. From my point of view he is clinging to life, he's just that resilient that even scarlet rot cant fully kill him.. it took his sanity, but not his body.

Edit: just to be clear it is canon that a zombie is someone who comes back from the world of the dead
                            I find it ironic you mention in-game lore when you ignore it. The scarlet rot can’t fully kill him, or anyone, because there is no death in the lands between. Since the rune got stolen. Hence why you mostly you see those zombie-like wandering nobles, knights and every other mob. No one dying of old age. Just rotting and decomposing.

Pay attention man.
                                First, a zombie is someone who comes back to life meaning that one must die first, and as you just said radahn didn't die hence he can't be one. Second zombie-like is not the same as zombie. Third, by your logic (person dies, if comes back he automatically is a zombie) the tarnished do die and comes back to life, since is not affected by the golden order, so you must be saying we are actually zombies?
                                    Straight up false, lie after lie. Zombies aren’t always shown to die first then resurrect. They turn after being bitten too, they don’t need to die. Examples are the zombies in black summer or WWZ.

Point is after changing they are no longer considered alive and the person they once were gone. Thus dead. This is the concept you and others are not grasping.

Tarnished are dead and then brought back by the grace. they are not undead.
            The same can be said for Radahn though. Had he not evacuated the heart of aeonia, he would have been 100% killed by Commander O'Neil and cleanrot knights who still are present at heart of aeonia to this day.
                To my knowledge they actually tried to kill him but didn't manage to.. you can see they skewered him like a shish kebab but still didn't manage to kill him. Anyway he's not bitching about being undefeated
                    Well he can't talk lol.
        I mean, she ends up as an outergod's plague puppet. And I'm pretty sure she's pretty much mindless too at this point, the Rot is eating her mind constantly and anything she has left is probably instinct/muscle memory
    [deleted]
        Radahn dickriders are so annoying istg, it was a duel no shit she'd use every trick in her arsenal to win
            [deleted]
                So what if the AOE of scarlet aeonia was a *little* big for a 1v1?
            I think it stopped being a duel when she nuke the country and her boys started stabbing Radahn so she could be carried home.

If her knights weren't there she would have died.
    Radahn won, Malenia had to call upon an outer god to even stalemate him
        That's a straight up lie.

The Aeonian sword memorial reads:

>The Battle of Aeonia  
>  
>Radahn and Malenia locked in stalemate  
>  
>Then, the scarlet rot blooms

Malenia had already stalemated Radahn prior to unleashing her Rot. She bloomed in order to break the stalemate.
        Malenia, a demigod, had to call upon her demigod powers to break the stalemate with Radahn, a demigod. Saying she lost because she used her scarlet rot demigod powers is like saying a mages don’t really win fights because they call upon powerful magic, or like saying anyone who uses spirit ashes hasn’t really won a fight because they had to call upon other powers that were at their disposal.

I mean, don’t get me wrong, Malenia didn’t win, she was trying to kill Radahn to get the stars to move again and she failed, even with the scarlet flower blooming over Caelid. But Radahn sure as shit didn’t win either - I mean, you saw the state he and what little remains of his forces were in, right?
            But Scarlet Rot isn't her demigod power tho? That's a curse from Outer God, and she controls scarlet rot as much as you can control HIV. You can only spread it and make everyone miserable, including yourself.

I agree that neither won tho, both terribly lost. Malenia unleashing her curse had to be worsened her state and bring her close to became God of Rot avatar whatever. And as badass she is in that state – she is not herself anymore.
                Eh, we’re splitting hairs at this point. The comparison to HIV is pretty funny, but I think it would be more directly comparable to Morgott’s omen curse. During the fight with Morgott when he releases the power of the omen curse he blames it on you, implying that he didn’t want to release the curse. However, he still wields the power that the curse gives him all the same to fuck the player character’s shit up. At that point, putting the emphasis on the source of Morgott’s newfound strength and power is kinda silly when he’s using that strength and power greatly to his benefit in combat, especially since that power was always there, hiding just beneath the surface. We can say something similar about Melania.
                    No no, I didn't mean that scarlet rot can't be called her power, she can wield it alright and resemblance with Morgott is quite obvious. I just wanted to put emphasis on the factor that utilizing your curse as a weapon hits both sides of the conflict and brings harm beyond control of the cursed one, as opposed to natural powers like Radahn gravity magic.

Its more of an argument against statement that Radahn ultimately lost the battle because his mind was eaten by rot. But I believe that Malenia's bloom was more of the "screw both of us".
                        I don't know if I'd call learned alien magic natural powers
            Nah. Malenia was the avatar of an outer god as well as being a demigod. Radahn did extremely well considering he didn't have the powers of an ethereal being to back him up. Just him, his magic, and his belief in the golden order.
                Ok? Yes, Radahn did very well - he fought someone who is undefeated to a statemate and survived her onslaught. But that doesn’t mean he won. I’m confused how a demigod and avatar of a god using their demigod and avatar of god powers means the other guy won, especially when we can see the aftermath in the game and Radahn certainly didn’t win.

Was it unfair, dishonorable, and immoral on Malenia’s part? Absolutely. But that’s kind of irrelevant to whether or not Radahn won, now isn’t it?
                Lmao, Malenia was blind, rotted, limbs lost and was only using her blade until she bloomed.

Radahn was healthy, much larger, had gravity magic and home turf advantage and STILL couldn’t win.
                    Malenia is also an Empyrean, and Radahn isn't. Nuked an entire country, yet he was still standing while she went nappy time for a few millenia. Granted , he went cray cray, but remained standing and earned the undying respect of his men. Malenia? Alone in a chair lmao.
                        Being an Empyrean has nothing to do with a person strength and adds nothing. It’s just a title given to people chosen by the fingers as potential rulers.

His body was still there, his mind wasn’t. Radahn quite literally died after that nuke. Mindless and with a country in ruins. Whilst Malenia retains her sanity, her powers and actually becomes more powerful than he could ever dream of during our fight with her.
                            Malenia retaining her sanity is contradicted by Milicent's dialogue during her quest. Malenia no longer has, quote "will, dignity, or sense of self."

She can speak, and remembers her name. But she's not sane.
                                Well she is rotted to shit and we know exactly what the rot does at its worst from Radahn. So yeah probably. But she was in a hell of a better state than Radahn, that isn’t up for debate.
                                    Malenia had a needle that keep her from having stage 6 cancer while radahn didn’t had sht, and even in madness and agony he managed to keep protecting the lands between from galactic threats  like astel. So yeah I’m the match between malenia ain’t sht.
                Even if this is the argument you want to make Radahn couldn't really beat a half rotted, amputated, and blinded Demigod. The avatar of an outer God is what  simply ended their stalemate.
                    Okay? That half-rotted blind amputee was still the best swordswoman in the world. Holding her at bay while holding up the literal night sky is more of a nod to his skill.
                When people  downvote you for being right. Truly says a lot about reddit :')
                    Truly a redditor moment.
                        Sweaty downvoters go brrrr
Damn that first image is killer! Really shows the desperation in Malenias eyes. 

What a sick way to fight eh?
    *looks at cleanrot knights puking everywhere* Sick way to fight indeed
    Realising how much she was about to find out
        To be fair she got away with fucking around throughout pretty much the rest of the lands between. I’d be just as shocked going from Godrick to Radahn lol.
\*I ***have*** never known defeat.
    >I ain’t never
        Y'all heard of Malawnia, the shiv of Micky?
            This is an underrated comment right here
This is dope.
That punch was satisfying
Cool art, but not a huge fan of a simple punch to the face making her bloom.
Badass!
I want more, I want more, I want more.

Nice art, OP!
1. amazing comic
2. How fromsoft made a naked person even more terrifying then being clothed is mad crazy
    Its something I've learned to fear in pvp.
When a naked guy invades, I know I'm about to get fucked.
        "and unto them we will send only you. . " is what i imagine must play through peoples heads
So cool!!
It’s nice but there is a small mistake on page 4.

“And I never known” instead of “and I’ve never known” or “I have never known”

But you did great and the comic is amazing.
Wouldn’t General Radahan be white or whatever not gray? I always figured his skin colored changed after he went insane
[deleted]
    Only good take in this particular argument
Awesome work!
This is amazing, great work OP
Radahn without Leonard scares me
For all we know Caelid was green and florid in the first few panels
Nice comic, but shows a lack of lore and game knowledge as there are several mistakes including dialogue and character traits
Completely lore inaccurate, where is the part where they have sex violently?

>!/s!<
    G R R Martin: "Write that down, write that down!"
    😂😂😂
Awesome
Isn't the sword built into the prosthesis, I can't remember exactly.
I’m going to be thinking about this beautiful piece of art for the next few days, holy crap-
    Aww🥹✨
She may not know what defeat is but she at least knows what a draw is.
Most fan comics are pretty trash... The pacing & paneling on this one is PROFESSIONAL!
This is awesome. Well done!
Amazing sequence
Wow! Radahn got to that 2nd phase fast! Well done! but...

you know we're gonna need more pages now, right?!
This is so well done. I love this
Technically she wouldn’t be the Rot Goddess yet but it’s such a Cool Piece. Kudos
So phenomenal bro, very impressive artwork! Malenia for the Fucking win
This is fucking incredible. Imo Malenia wins this fight but who knows for sure.
Ooo! I really like this. It has a sort of American comic look to it, but it's unique and I really like the colors.
This is awesome! Malenia's so fucking cool
Awesome comic! Really good art ^^
This is an awesome comic!
I love Malenia ❤️🥰
Amazing! Can't imagine how long that took. I think that was the right place to put the battle.

--only thing to change. "I never" to "I've never"

Great work ❤️ 💙
that was great! would love to see a comic series based on elden ring. That final panel is beautiful, with the butterflies on the swords... it gives me chills
    Thank you so much!🥺✨
This is really cool but giving big “Action Bible” vibes
A lot of inaccuracies but good drawing style and fanart on general man
And yet, she did not truly win. The brilliance of Mallenia's quote is that reality is that she was defeated by Radahn as he did not die during their confrontation, yet she never knew she didn't win, as both warriors were left unconscious.  This ia why her phrase remains true: "I have never known defeat" She hasn't. She remains unaware that she did not win the Radahn battle or assumes she won since she is still alive
    I trust the only unbiased source in the lands between on “knowledge”. Sir Gideon Ofnir who claims that it was a “standstill” or a “stalemate”, and also refers to Malenia as “the undefeated swordswoman”.
        The sword monument in Caelid is probably the closest to an unbiased source you'll get that outright states how it went down. 

> *The Battle of Aeonia*

> *Radahn and Malenia locked in stalemate*

> ***Then,*** *the scarlet rot blooms*

They were locked in a stalemate until she went for the Scarlet Aeonia which ended the battle in a draw between the two. 

The malenia vs radahn discussion is the dumbest shit I read on this sub because it pretty much exists on the basis of people ignoring what characters and several item descriptions say.
            I can immediately smell a thread turning into a shit show whenever these 2 characters are brought up. It's been a year and people still want to argue with the lore.
        Well we've got more unbiased sources that are item descriptions of winged sword insignia, hand of Malenia and cleanrot armor. All are written in third person and call her undefeated.
            Oh for sure, I just like Gideon because he has no incentive in being biased. Dude is obsessed with being correct on all things in the Lands Between
                True that.
    So by that logic, since she wasn't killed by Radahn, he was also defeated. It was canonically a draw with neither of them winning or losing.
        I really think it's safe to say that everyone involved in that battle lost. Everyone.

The only person that benefitted from the conflict was... Mogh (yuck).
            Yeah. But honestly I have a feeling Miquella may not as be as kindly as we think. The bewitching branch description is, well.... sus. Would not be surprised if DLC reveals he orchestrated his own kidnapping or some crazy shit like that. Like he was play 5D chess while Mohg, Malenia, and everyone else were playing checkers. I could of course, definitely be wrong but that's my running theory.
    Malenia*
    Radahn certainly did not win the fight though. She wasn’t defeated and neither was Radahn. Neither won or lost, so it’s basically a tie.
        The one correct answer
            Also acceptable: Rage quit
        I respectfully disagree. While Millenia fell unconscious, Radahn still stood. She had to be saved and dragged out of the arena by her most loyal cleanrot knight. If that hadn't of happened she would have been eaten by newly crazy Radahn. Seems like a loss to me
            There are multiple points in the lore where it is said it was a stalemate with no winner. This cannot be respectfully disagreed upon. So it’s kinda irrelevant what “seems like a loss” to who. It is said many times that there was no winner and no loser. This point cannot be argued regardless of what people may think. Also, nowhere is it said that Radahn “still stood while Malenia fell unconscious”.
            >Radahn still stood

Thats pure speculation.
He could have just as easily crumpled on top of his horse and been carried away as well.
He also could have had to retreat from the constant scarlet rot emanating from the bloom to not die.

I severely doubt Finley could have gotten anywhere close if Radahn was  nearby and conscious, so he either ran away, or was unconscious himself.
            If he could’ve killed her, then he would’ve. I’d say being driven insane, and essentially an animal equates to a loss. Neither of them won, but they both lost.
        Yeah, but Radahn came to and lived on his own volition. Mallenia was only saved because Finley carried her on his back for miles and miles.
            Radahn was home, he didn't have to go anywhere. The Haligtree is an age away. We also don't know the immediate state of the battlefield post bloom. I find it hard to believe Radahn was in any shape to fight in the immediate aftermath.
    She knows, just considers it not as a defeat, but a stalemate. The winner is not you neither am I.
    Except she wasn’t defeated as is literally stated in game, in lore, in everywhere. Stalemate.

Radahn lost if we actually get really technical since 
Malenia rotted his mind and everything that makes him a person, away. Aswell as turning his country into a wasteland.

The Warrior Radahn fell that day, all that was left was a mindless hunk of flesh that acts purely on instinct.

The mental gymnastics people do to try to spin the fight in such a way that Radhan won is hilarious.
        It's getting ridiculous honestly. The Radhan boys have got to fuckin' relax.
        If we get really technical neither of them won. Yes she rotted his mind but in the ebd he was still standing. While she got bitch slapped so hard she went to sleep for milennia and completely forgot about it. Not to mention nuking an entire country and still failing to get a kill on her target. The mental gymnastics people do to try to spin the fight in such a way that Malenia won is hilarious.
But in the end, what does it matter? Both got smacked by a tarnished of no renown anyway lmao
            >Yes she rotted his mind but in the ebd he was still standing

What item, npc, or text says that? I can also make baseless speculation, like he was knocked unconscious as well, or he ran away from the flower emanating a death field.
Either way, "still standing" is not how you win in a fight to the death.

>The mental gymnastics people do to try to spin the fight in such a way that Malenia won is hilarious.

She didn't win you dingus, it was a draw.
It literally says it IN THE GAME by not only sword graves, item descriptions, and the story trailer, but by a gUY named Gideon Ofnir, THE ALL KNOWING.
            Except she never got bitch slapped at all, we know of literally no damage done to her from Radahn apart from her stabbing herself with her own blade to induce a bloom. So you are straight up lying there. 

Radahn got quite literally turned into a zombie and thus died. Aswell as his entire country being turned into a wasteland. She permanently took him out of the throne contention and put his foolish ambition to rest. Biggest, fattest L of the shattering.

Whereas Malenia wakes up later completely fine and ascends to an even higher power than he ever achieved.

Battle was stalemate but Radahn was objectively way worse off. Not even remotely up for debate.
                It IS stated that she had to be carried away from the battlefield. Keep coping lmao.
                    And it IS stated that Radahn completed lost his mind and turned into a beast that eats friend and foe alike. YOU keep coping hahahahaahha
                        Well yes. I never stated otherwise. All I said is that NOBODY won, while you insisted that she won, while taking a look at Finlay's Ashes proves you wrong. No need to act like a 12 yr old just because you didn't know as much of how it went down as you thought you did :,) Truly maidenless behaviour :') 
Edit: As a little note, the biggest single fat L in shattering history is dropping a nuke on a country and still fail to kill your target. That is the very definition of failure <3
                            Finley's ashes only say that she carried the slumbering demigod home and that it was a legendary feat. Not one word is said about Radahn in the immediate aftermath. Both lost because neither fulfilled their objectives (tho no one knows exactly what they were for either side). People can argue that one side or the other came out the better of the exchange though and that is probably the biggest bone of contention. I think most would agree that the battle itself was a stalemate but what happened after and the longer term affects are up in the air.
                            Dude you are the one replying to multiple comments of mine so it’s clear who is really immature and unable to let go lmao.

As I have explained but your brain is obviously too rotted to comprehend. She did kill him. His mind rotted and he turned into a zombie. Literally by that very definition he is dead. Keep. Coping.
                                Yet another dumb take easily disproven. He is still very much alive, very limited rationality, but still alive and kicking. If his mind was 100% gone (or dead dead, as you so obnoxiously keep insisting on) there would be 2 very important happenings. 
1-He wouldn't give a shit about his horse anymore, yet he still keeps it safe.
2-The stars would have resumed their movement, as , y'know, Blaidd and Selen straight up tell you.
Feeling that copium overdose yet?  :')
                                    And this is also very easily disproven. If locking the stars was a conscious effort that held him back, why didn’t he release it when fighting Malenia to ensure a win, or against the tarnished and the other warriors? Surely if he wanted to keep them locked so much he would do anything to ensure he doesn’t die? The fact that he didn’t pretty much obliterates your argument. He ain’t alive and kicking as he quite literally is undead. Quite literally if you’d pain any attention to the lore at all. AAAAAAAND he has no feet with which to kick, hahaha.

Also as to the horse point, guy literally learned magic so he could ride it, was on it all the time to the point where it would no longer be a conscious effort on his part. Horse was literally a part of his body and since we don’t see him eating his own body, that’s another part of your argument destroyed.

How’s that copium build up? Must be bursting at the seems right now lmao.
                and you're the one who says anything about mental gymnastics? no damage done to her? we literally see radahn letting her pick up her prosthesis from the ground to be honorable and then she proceeds to nuke a continent but still fails to kill radahn or get what she wanted. keep in mind radahn is doing all of this while still holding the stars in the sky and even after he gets turned into a "zombie" he still doesn't stop doing that, ever. also if you know lore you know that malenia didn't only take a nap and wake up completely fine few hours later lol. she was literally saved by a scarlet rot knight. it's stated, word by word, that she was literally SAVED by a knight who showed great bravery. yes literally it was a stalemate but if you really do wanna get technical, radahn fights her with honor while controlling stars in the sky, she nukes a continent, gives radahn alzhimers and nearly dies herself if she didn't get saved, goes into a coma while radahn still stands, damaged, but still stands. it's clear radahn is the stronger demigod idk how this is even a debate.
                    Prosthetic is a prosthetic. It’s not her actual body. 

There is nothing in lore that states that holding the stars back limits his power, find proof of that, I’ll wait. If it actually limited him he would have deactivated it to beat Malenia, or us when we fight him.

If we wanna get REALLY technical Radahn immediately falls to the ground after the bloom. You seen this literally in the cutscene before you fight him, so no he wasn’t still standing.

Malenia was rotted to fuck, blind, lost limbs and only used her blade till she bloomed. Whereas Radahn was healthy, much larger, had magic to supplement his swords and had home advantage and STILL couldn’t kill her AND had his entire country ruined. One Aeonia put him out the game forever, literally only a small part of her power finished him. It’s clear who the stronger demigod is because she literally becomes a Goddess when we fight her. You clearly pay no attention whatsoever hahahahah
                        Not wanting to enter into the debate but there are a few facts you are ignoring. 

1- Radanh never falls to the bloom. Since all Elden Ring media is canon, if you watch the 2019 annoucememt trailer you can see post bloom Radahn, rotting but still standing, roaring alone in the battlefield to the sky. Even more, you can also see in the trailer a lone Cleanrot knight attacking an alone Radahn, most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

2- Radahn is the defender, Malenia the aggressor. Whatever were Malenia goals with Caelid invasions it was a complete strategical and tactical failure. Her army got decimated to the point of no survivors. On the other part, the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured  and whats more important, they kept Radanh great rune safe. So calling her adventure in Caelid a stalemate or a victory is plain preposterous. It was an decisive defeat that erased any kind of military influese of the Halitree. The Redmanes stood standing against the rot, hurted, but with enough power to keep all their land under control, with a sizable and well organiced army. 

The 1v1 is debatable. Its state clearly that it was a draw, so no winners in the direrct confrontation. 

But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision. Only Finlay prevent  her gruesome death. I wouldnt call that a stalemate neither a victory for obvous reasons. 

Sumarizing: Malenia goals unachieved, her army completely anhinilated, 1v1 duel ends in draw, her target rotten but alive so Miquellas fate still frozen, Radanh great rune was not retrieved, Miquella was not founded, Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid, and even celebrate festivals in the name of their leader.

Veredic: total defeat, with no goals achieved.
                            >On the other part, the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

They don't at all? Did you miss how they're all backed up at Redmane Castle barely holding off the wildlife? The Rot has also spread past the flaming walls, and the entire land is uninhabitable. Fort Faroth is completely abandoned, Sellia is a ghost town (literally) and there's ruins everywhere. What are you even talking about?

>The Redmanes stood standing against the rot, hurted, but with enough power to keep all their land under control, with a sizable and well organiced army.

Again what the fuck are you talking about? Have you seen Caelid? Does that look under control to you? And there's still Cleanrot Knights in the Aeonia Swamp.

>But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision.

There is zero evidence for that, Radahn isn't even found at where the bloom took place, it happened in the Aeonian Swamp while the story trailer shows the dunes. At some point he must've left to his castle.

>most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

Finlay survived all the way to the Haligtree

>Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision

Headcanon, post an item description proving he was still conscious. 

>Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid, and even celebrate festivals in the name of their leader.

I'm seriously convinced you haven't actually played the game and just watch Gigachad Radahn tiktok edits, NOTHING about Caelid is secure, and the festival is just a pretense to quite literally Old Yeller Radahn and put him out of his misery.
                                The annoucement trailer of 2019 shows you Post-bloom Radanh standing alone, kneeling and roaring at the sky, covered in rott, in the same battlefield were he tank the scarlet aeonia. Then they show a lone cleanrot knight charging a kneeling Radanh. Seeing the whole context of the scenario, and all writen lore, that was Finlay charging to save Malenia, and i take that as a fact. It makes sense, since is a fact that Malenia was out of cold after the Bloom, and all the puzzle pieces match. Even if Radanh also got invoncious, he woke uo before Malenia no matter what, so without Finlay, her fate was sealed. 

Also, Redmane army end the war with enough man power to build numerous barriers, walls and other fortifications to try to stop the rot. That requieres a level of organization that a destroyed army couldnt achieve. We have to remember that the war happens god knows when. The fact that, a super invasive apocalypthic disasters hasnt consume the whole Caelid by the time our Tarnished appears, shows the power, discipline and organization of the Redmanes. Now compare the few soldiers the Halitree has and the decrepit state of Miquella realm, litteraly falling appart. That looks like a victorious party to you? Finlay ashes clearly state that there were basically no survivors, but them we see the Redmanes contain the Rott for hundreds or thousands of years until our arrival. At the end there were more Redmanes than Halitree troops, so as i said before, the military campaing was a failure.

As i said before, i wont enter in an heated debate since is pointless. The 1v1 was a stalemate, as the All-Knowing said. But from a military point of view, Radahn as the defending party win the exchange, a phyrric victory, but a victory noneless, since he only need to survive and fend of the invading forces.

Malenia didnt achieve any of the possible goals pursued. So thats defeat, no matter how one try to argue.

The day i decide to use tiktok, use cringe expresions like chad, gigachad or the like, will be the day i remove my eyes and tongue. I dont have anything against any character or any personal grief or blind hatred or love to any character of the game. And for the record, Ng+7 player here, with a semi-legic farmed 713 level character on ps4 with God knows how many hours of playtime.
                                    > The fact that, a super invasive apocalypthic disasters hasnt consume the whole Caelid by the time our Tarnished appears, shows the power, discipline and organization of the Redmanes.

It does, again what the fuck are you talking about? There isn't a single place in Caelid free from the Rot besides a single tiny cave found underground.

>Finlay ashes clearly state that there were basically no survivors, but them we see the Redmanes contain the Rott for hundreds or thousands of years until our arrival.

It says that there were few survivors, not none. 

>Now compare the few soldiers the Halitree has and the decrepit state of Miquella realm, litteraly falling appart. That looks like a victorious party to you?

I didn't say they won, I said it was a stalemate that ended in no victor. The story trailer even states, what exactly do you think that means?

>Then they show a lone cleanrot knight charging a kneeling Radanh. Seeing the whole context of the scenario, and all writen lore, that was Finlay charging to save Malenia, and i take that as a fact

All written lore states that the battle ended immediately with the Aeonia and pretty much annhilated everything. Radahn straight up retreats from the battle, as the it happens in the heart of Aeonia. This is objective fact, whether it happend later or sooner is unknown but at some point he had to leave.

>he woke uo before Malenia no matter what, so without Finlay, her fate was sealed.

Prove it

>Malenia didnt achieve any of the possible goals pursued. So thats defeat, no matter how one try to argue.

The Redmanes themselves consider themselves to have lost Caelid lol

>When they were driven to defeat by Malenia's scarlet rot, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve.
>"Alas, dear home, I shan't see you again! For our duty is to remain here, a bulwark against the blight."

You're literally arguing against the game
                            > you can see post bloom Radahn, rotting but still standing, roaring alone in the battlefield to the sky.

This could be right after the bloom, or days after the bloom. We don't know.
It also could be the battlefield in the trailer, or the desert we fight him at later.

He absolutely could have fallen unconscious atop his horse, and Leonard ran off from the rot.
Or Radahn himself could have fled the bloom while Malenia was still awake. We don't know because we lack info. I would defer to the game, which states multiple times that it was a draw.

>Even more, you can also see in the trailer a lone Cleanrot knight attacking an alone Radahn, most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

Go watch the trailer of thier fight.
He has multiple clean rot spears in his back, implying he had already fought several before the clash.
It could have easily been one of them.
Additional, can you actually imagine Finley carrying Malenia away from Radahn? A flying, horse riding general with a godamn artillery level bow?

>Whatever were Malenia goals with Caelid invasions it was a complete strategical and tactical failure.

It was to reach Radahn and take his rune, which she did in fact do.

> Her army got decimated to the point of no survivors.

Patently not true, as several survivors are found spread throughout Caelid.
Also:
"Finlay was one of the few survivors of the Battle of Aeonia"
That's both sides baby. Both armies were decimated. 

>the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

I'll let Jerren handle this one:


"I am Jerren. Foolish old warrior, and witness. Incidentally, do you like a good festival,  from time to time? Well, it's true, this fortress houses only the vanquished. But when the stars align, we celebrate."

Here is the redmane armor set.

"When they were driven to defeat by Malenia's scarlet rot, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve."

They lost, and given that thier were "few survivors" and the fight wasn't at the castle, we can assume the redmanes we see weren't at the battle of Aeonia.

>were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

Its a little suspicious that there were no forts in the path of an invading army headed to the capital.
Sure are a lot of ruins in thier path though....hmmm

>and whats more important, they kept Radanh great rune safe.

Its because he had it on him and fucked off to the desert. His army had nothing to do with it.

>So calling her adventure in Caelid a stalemate or a victory is plain preposterous.

The game and story trailer disagree.

>It was an decisive defeat that erased any kind of military influese of the Halitree.

The haligtree definitely still has soldiers in higher comfort, number, and Calibur then Caelid.

>But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision.

Pure speculation, as we don't know when Malenia fell unconscious, nor when Radahn left.
He could have fled the pain of her Aonea in his madness, and she could have been to week to chase him, but we literally do not know.

> Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid,

Very very wierd understanding of what "secure" means.
Cealid is a hell hole that belongs to the children of rot, the redmanes are cornered, broken, and leaderles. 

Let's just agree the game and its creators are right, it was a draw for both powers.
                        Okay if you wanna suggest holding stars in the sly don’t take at least some level of power and doesn’t limit his strength AT ALL then there’s also nothing in the lore that states that her blindness and prosthetics limit her power either. You say she was rotten and near death or something as if she was weakened, she was born like that, even if she was weakened so what? What’s your point? We’re talking about malenia vs radahn and that’s simply how malenia is. If you wanna talk about an imporved version of her then sure maybe she would’ve won but i don’t get the point. It’s whoever fought who on the battlefield.

No you’re not getting technical, you’re getting silly. Radahn was bat shit insane but still very much standing and would’ve killed knocked out malenia of a random knight didn’t save her and took her home where she would continue to be in the coma.


“Radahn was much larger” idk since when size and mass mattered in soulsborne games or lore but omay. Also magic supplements? That’s his powers, you wanted him to not use them while fighting malenia? “And still couldn’t kill her” like i said already he would’ve because he was the conscious one, malenia got saved by third party.

Malenia can’t beat radahn, explodes so she can st least do something, gets her srmy destroyed, fails to accomplish anything other than give radahn brain damage i guess, falls into coma and gets saved by her knight. And even after that, radahn is still holding stars in the sky like the absolute chad he is. Also your argument about “he would’ve deactivated while fighting” is invalid, because he was clearly doing that for an important reason. He obviously didn’t learn gravity magic to not crush his horse, he had a very important goal. Some theories include protecting lands in between from outer creatures etc. so no he wouldn’t and he didn’t, even after having his brain rotten. A true Legend if I’ve ever seen one.
    The gymnastics Radahn simps will go through to make themselves believe he won lol. It's been a year, the man lost, get over it.
    Yup. Nuked an entire country, couldn't even win smh. 
She's still a badass tho.
    Alternatively, the brilliance of the quote is that she has never known defeat because she has never been defeated. Neither won, neither lost. They were both too powerful to lose, so when they fought they basically divided by zero.

Though personally even though I don't think Radahn 'lost' (in terms of hand to hand combat, he sort of won), he was absolutely 'defeated'. It was a classic "win the battle, lose the nuke war" situation.
When you fight with honor but your opponent bitches out and nukes you with cancer.
    People who fight with honor tend to end up dead pretty quick. Or zombified in Radahn's case lol. Reminds me of Bronn from GoT. There is no honor in a fight to the death.
        Unless your HORAH LOUX, WARRIOR!
    yep, pretty much Malenia in a nutshell.
Really cool just a shame about the grammar for such a well drawn comic
    I’m so sorry for the mistake, I’m italian and sometimes I forget the right forms of speaking! (Even if it’s her sentence, but still, I’m not a perfect human being) thanks for the appreciation tho!
Radahn is incredibly powerful but he doesn’t have the strength of an outer god laying dormant within his body, I’m still team Malenia all day for this fight. Pretty sick art!
But she does know

Da feet

-Michael Zaki
That’s…not at all how that went.
So radahn punching women is canon?

I respect him even more for the gender equality now.
    Women's rights. And when they unleash cataclysmic biohazard powers, give them some lefts too!
    yes, why does fan art become canom now
        I canon everything i like
This comic is truly a epic masterpiece - Malenia eyes are true gems :3
*spams L2*
Their battle, the lead-up to it, and the scarlet rot aftermath would make for a dope animated short film.
It is great, but she become the godess of rot after using her power 3 times. Fisrt time was agaimst radahn, second time was close to her arena and finally the third time against the tarnished. 

But i still think the style you use is stunning
    It seems inconsistent, because I feel like it's implied she may have taken that winged form before.

>Blade built into Malenia's prosthetic arm.
>Through consecration it is resistant to rot.

>Malenia's war prosthesis symbolized her victories.
Some claim to have seen wings when the weapon was raised aloft;
wings of fierce determination that have never known defeat.
        Actually, before becoming the godess of rot, she is mostly being devoured by it. And putting alloyed gold prosthesis made it to slow down the rot
This is awesome bro
She has never known the feet?
You should write an ER manga you definitely have the talent dude!
FUCKING COOL!!!!! YES!!!
This is really nice! well made
Kuzu Ryu Sen!
This is one of the most gorgeous Elden Ring comics I've seen since the game came out
Parry. L1 L1 L2
This is just epic.
Absurdly awesome fucking art. Like damn
Garbage art because Radahn is without Leonard. Jk
Awesome. Question, is that blood or rot pouring from her eyes in the last panel on the second page?
    I like to think about malenia getting more “rotten” trough and trough the fight, so i would go with rotten, or both if you prefer!
Nicely done!
 love this. Great art style. Nice job.
This is so badass
Would like to see where she makes the choice to drop the unalloyed gold needle. Aeonia makes Malenia choosing to let the rot in to keep her line about defeat true. She didn't just fight hard, but actively chose her path.
"I have never known defeat because i cheat : Surprise biohazard attack! Get fucked Radhan!"
    The Malenia simps downvoting you for stating facts lmao
Practically Malenia acted like a kamikaze after realizing she couldn't defeat Radahn the chad in a sword duel, what a rotten pussy.
    True.
And then she proceed to lose the battle
imagine cheating in a duel with poison. fucking pathetic piece of shit
    Lol you okay, dude?
        Rob builds got to him, understandably
    Imagine cheating in a duel with magic...
    Oberyn Martel proves how stupid your comment is. Guy was a badass. Got his head popped but still, cockiness is what got him.
Makes me think of pvp, when I don’t use spells or AOW. I’d be radahn my opponent is malenia. I start to smack malenia in COQ. She realizes I don’t let off and I am in constant COQ. Malenia backs off realizing she can’t quite match the skill. Then transforms builds so she can royally fuck me with an AOE spell.  Ahhhhhhh combat at its finest
And then they fucked
    I guess they are step bro and sis, dont they have the same dad tough?
        Hasn't stopped people in the past
I don't know how, but I beat Malenia on my 7th attempt. I have heard horror stories but she fell fairly easily. Its Maliketh I am struggling with. Damn mutt is too fast and I've NO ranged attacks at all haha.
Technically Redahn won that fight because she got knocked out and almost died. One of her soldiers saved her. Redahn went insane and started to eat the dead bodies around him
Radhan beats up Malenia and is about to kill her. Than arrives our to be elden lord.  With Malenia in one arm and sword in other.  He fucks Radhan up for good.  Than goes to bed with Malena and proceed with the f@@king.....
If Radahn had not been holding back the "stars" he would have yeeted her into realm of the Onyx lords. He would have stasis-locked her as soon as she attempted to bloom, and then launched her skyward.

Clearly I am team Radahn.
    Pretty much
wow, ok Karen, chill out
Wasn’t Radhan who cut off her arm and leg??
    As far as I know, they rotted off because she was born with the curse of the Scarlet Rot.
    No, she was missing them prior to their fight. Rot is taking her body from her.
A perfect display of how she lost, very well done!
You beat her alone. It takes a whole squad to take out Radahn. He is stronger
    You…. You can not use the summons and still pretty easily destroy him though? You can fight him just as alone as you do Malenia
Malenia definitely lost this fight. 

Don't get me wrong, radahn wasn't exactly a Victor here. Buy Melania lost. She got her ass handed to her and ended up nuking a peninsula and passing out. If her clean rot knight didn't grab her body and run her back to haligtree, she would've died.
    It is stated over and over again in lore that it was a stalemate. Nobody won and nobody lost. You might see it as a loss, but the fact is Radahn lost just as much as Malenia did, this point cannot be argued.
Reminder Malenia is the bad guy in this fight
Im pretty sure the fact that she needed to commit war crime to "win" is a definition of L
    Given Malenia herself has lost sight and limbs to it, Scarlet rot is more curse than consciously wielded bioweapon.
    Not really. I'm not sure why people are so desperate for Radahn to have won this fight. He didn't. He lost everything. I don't think she won either since she didn't get his shard of the he Elden Ring but she didn't lose. That battle ended up in a stalemate.
        Because hE LoVEd HiS hOrSE sO MUch
    The Fire Giants and the Merchants will be delighted to find out that they actually *defeated* the Golden Order. Y'know, because of the war crimes.
    Chill. It’s all fiction
Now that I think about it, i don't think the tarnished would ever have a chance against radahn in his prime.
    We did malenia.
        I think if that fight continued somebody would've lost for the very first time. We only see him fight her without using all he's got. She used her rot transformation and still he wasn't using anything crazy. The rot got to him and thats when the tarnished comes in. He fights the tarnished at his best with rot. So definitely not 100%
            He dosen't have anything crazy. Astels meteor storm is astels and malenia could easily dodge his comet dive. There's really nothing crazy. He's just brute strength and willpower.
            You don't know that he wasn't using anything crazy. The trailer, if we even accept it as a source of content, only shows the beginning and the end of their fight; and from what little we do see, Radahn *was* using his sorcery from the start. All we can say without doubt is that he didn't let go of the stars, but we don't know if that would even have helped him, since when he dies none of them fall anywhere near Aeonia, nor does maintaining this control seem to limit his other spellcasting even when he's rotten. Certainly Radahn is badly weakened when *we* fight him, but if we can beat Malenia we can beat him in his prime.
                Is there source of malenia in her prime when fighting tarnished?
                    No, but there's little reason to think she wasn't. Her missing limbs and her blindness appear to predate the Shattering (or at least her war against Radahn, since Miquella made her prosthetics), she has no other obvious wounds or conditions weakening her, and she even blooms and ascends to godhood during the fight. By contrast, Radahn was obviously a shadow of his former self as of the game.
Epic
This is so cool!
Excellent work!!!
I would love an anime just of this fight
And i HAVE* never known defeat
Very cool. You missed a word in that 2nd to last composition though.
Mf went in was losing gave giga cancer to the whole place and left XDD
I would love to see Radahn try to panic roll after that last panel.
 I don't think she ever really had eyes,
Wow this is amazing
It's a bit curious that Radahn knows gravity magic, yet doesn't use it to shove attackers away that are coming right at him. (Makes sense in the trailer, because he was in the middle of attacking her... here, not so much.)
This is amazing ! If the last panel was her blooming and saying defeat that would have been nice but still
Malenia if she was southern
WATCH OIT THE RADAHN STANS ARE COMING
This artwork gave me chills
It's weird to think that everybody dedicated to gravity magic is black
the art is nice but it has wrong points in it.
fucking beautiful art but one small nitpick on my part his how radahn is a bit small compared to the game
very nice!
"I've"
I thought she bloomed after her death. Which causes reanimation.
Proceeds to nuke an entire nation
Didn't they fight to a draw?
Get her ass, king
Didn’t she get the prosthetics after her fight with radahn?
I thought the sword was part of her prosthetic arm? 

Looks amazing regardless.
Blade of fucking...
Suddenly it makes sense that gravity spells work so damn well on her.
 Big Kill 6 Billion Demons vibe
It looked like they were kissing in the second pic
I kinda feel sad that I won against her on my first try. I just finished my first playthrough and will go ng+. I was scared going into her since everyone said she was really hard so I grinded to lvl 180 and fought her with a max lvl mimic and bleed build. I kinda feel like I cheated myself out of an epic boss fight because I just stunlocked her and bled her to death :/
Do you think Radahn would have won if Malenia didn't go Scarlet Rot nuke?
I thought radahn was way bigger?
The first pic is the first mistake. Malenia has no fear.

Good work though..
Still fucked up how during a near L she decided to just drop a nuke and fuck up the lands inbetween
She’s blind bro, had been for a while
Amazing
The comic looks amazing, but why did you draw a hilt on her blade? One of the best parts if her design is the hiltless sword and how she directly holds the blade with her prosthetic hand.
so glad I found this game.  good community of players too.
Man i want Malenia so bad...
Is she sniffing her finger in the second to last panel? 😅😅
    No? But perhaps?😂
Her being blind makes me wish the talisman that silences your steps would make her attack with a slight longer delay or to sometimes miss randomly
    Nah she's not listening to you, she's sensing the pure malice as you try for the 40th time.
        A spell to nullify your scent and talisman to reduce sound while walking and her good arm tied behind her back and I'd still need 2 summons and 13 furled finger callers to get the dub. Can she also sense my tears ?
            Believe in yourself friend, all you need is time and the willpower to walk that fog 500+ times and anything is possible.

~Signed someone dumb enough to make the leap from cheesing her with Mohg's spear to doing her hitless in melee

                            no problem lol
                    I appreciated his response. May not have asked but it was welcome.
            I was surprised when I beat her on my 20th try during my bow only run
        she can taste the salt in the air
        40th?  Who do you think I am?  Some pro gamer?
        Heh, first time I did her with mimic tear and blasphemous blade, thought "what is everyone talking about? She's not so bad." In another playthrough, did her with no summons on a pure str build with greatsword, and thought, "OK, now I see what everyone is talking about."
    That would be cool and reminiscent of the [Old Hero ](https://demonssouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Old+Hero) from Demon's Souls.

    sounds like a fromsoftware thing to do! :D
    I beat her on my second try, seemed easy at the time. Mimic tear and rejuvia + frost misericorde. I found her attacks easy to evade, surprisingly enough. Almost got her on my first try but i went in blind not knowing her moves and abilities yet so she caught me out.

    Something like gough in ds1 dlc?
    That very thought pierced my mind today have you tried the talisman?
        I haven't, did you try it out? Did we discover something ?
            I wish ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
I realized that , but it felt easier to give her an expression with eyes, She’s cooler like this for me, opinions?
    I mean I was also thinking she had no eyes by this point but honestly your eye expressions are amazing so I don't mind the lore break.
        Love the art, even if not consistent with lore :)  

yellow eyes are more a frenzied flame sign.  You get such also in your character if going that path.  But.. who knows who the 3 fingers gave free hugs too :). Maybe her too.  Fell god is associated with eyes and red hair.. prosthetic legs.. arms.. eyes? in helmet?  

Placing is also most likely near big rot tree outside castle, where the black knives have crossbows.  The invisibility of black knives would be useless against the blind, but the cross bows might even out the fight out a bit.  I Wonder if it was an ambush involved in the fight too?  But head canon guess.
            >yellow eyes are more a frenzied flame sign.

Iirc every non-tarnished human has yellow eyes. Millicent has yellow eyes for example, and I think Kenneth has them too, but I'm not sure.
                iirc those directly tied with the Erdtree in some way have eyes of gold (Melina, Marika, Godfrey, etc)

Kenneth does have gold eyes, as does Millicent


looking at [more here,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu_Q9TwF5Xc) Sellen doesn't have gold eyes in either of her bodies, but she also isn't directly tied to Marika/Radagon at all
                I thought it was tied to being able to see the guidance of grace
                    It's tied to the grace imbued in the non-Tarnished. Godfrey's eyes "dulled" when he lost the grace of the Erdtree and became the first Tarnished. The gold eyes never returned, even after the guidance of grace did.
    Idk I think her being blind is so integral to her character. I really love that she's a powerful disabled character.
        I was talking about this with someone the other day. It's a consistent theme for From games to have strong/important disabled characters. Maybe it's because I have a disability but it always stood out to me.
            I mean, in from soft games pretty much EVERYONE is disabled in some way, so yeah
            I do love characters like that, sad that it's overshadowed by WATERFOWL DANCE 

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
                Waterfowl Dance? I think you meam Fowl Play *Badum tss*
                    Waterfoul dance? I think you mean AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
        her disability IS part of her power lol
    Fair enough, but I think making her eye color cloudy could work. (I'm no artist tho) 

But I feel like some cloudy Grey eyes with that expression could still work.

IGNORE ME
        >IGNORE ME


I don't think I will >:)
    It’s a masterpiece I would love to see more Elden ring stuff like this.
        Thank you! I was thinking about making another comic but I’m quite uncertain about the topic. I would love to do a Rennala/Radagon one!
Thoughts?
            I think that would be very interesting, they met during the war and fell in love they had children and radagon left her for Marika. 

Visually Renalla is probably the only demigod which doesn’t look weathered but how did Radagon look when he isn’t fused with Marika and crumbling so to speak. 

That’s all the context I can think off.

I just really like your artstyle and even if it isn’t lore accurate ( which shouldn’t matter in the souls franchise ) it’s your interpretation and I’d love to see more.
                Thank you so much for the suggestion🥹✨
    It looks great, but her disability is a very important part of her character.
    The expressions make everything, this comic made my jaw drop, gj!
        I don't get why this got a few downvotes
She was. A minor knitpick, but the comic is still dope.
Not gonna lie. The blind guy being the strongest fighter is such a stupid cliché so I prefer this. It already is pushing it to not walk into every wall. How much of a monster would she be WITH her eyesight? Completely untouchable.
i’m not sure, there’s a certain shot in the trailer where if you zoom in very close, you can at least see that the rot hasn’t gone over her eyes yet, made a post on tumblr on it 

https://www.tumblr.com/intelligent-fish/699055681402241024/so-it-would-seem-that-malenia-might-be-freshly

        to be a zombie for me is to be dead

To quote the great poet Joyner Lucas: "he thought he had a plan, till the fists hit 'im"
This is a pretty dope theory, ngl
Wow that explains why we fight her so well! I've always been a little annoyed that we fight Malenia even though the tarnished doesn't have any motivation to do so beyond the not-so-great rune.

Love this theory!
Thats a really good theory. Because there is literally no reason to fight her.
Yea her not having the needle for so long probably fucked her up because it has apparently been quite a while since her duel with Radahn. The needle was the only thing keeping the rot at bay and was lost and damaged during the fight. Frankly its kinda surprising she wasn't further deteriorated bodily but guess they just went with mental damage.
    Fun fact, it can be implied that the cinematic where she puts on her arm when facing Radahn occurs right after she took out and broke the needle.

She knew she could only defeat Radahn if she used everything and gave in to the rot.

*"The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot. The pride she abandoned, to meet Radahn's measure."*

This line shows that she willingly abandoned her pride, the Unalloyed Golden Needle. And since in the cinematic, Radahn is shown waiting for Malenia, most likely, during the early stages of the battle and during her march to Caelid, Malenia was conflicted with her choice and never removed the needle. Only when she faced Radahn did she come to the conclusion that she really couldn't win without breaking the needle. Radahn let her remove it as we see him waiting for Malenia to prepare herself, probably implying that he wanted to fight Malenia at her strongest in respect for a fellow warrior and to honor her resolve.

So they probably duked it out at first, Malenia was at a disadvantage and Radahn stopped, allowing her to do what she needed to truly face him. So she took off her arm, removed the needle, broke it to probably ensure that she couldn't use it again knowing what removing it would mean to Miquella and believing herself unworthy of picking it up again, and put back her arm ready to face Radahn with everything, and Radahn taking it all head on to truly see who was worthy of the title of "Strongest", the Conquerer of the Stars, or the Undefeated Blade of Miquella.

And the reason why I believe that she broke the needle because she felt unworthy, is that even when we give it to her after defeating her, even when she becomes a Scarlet Aeonia, she gives it right back to us in the unfinished but strengthened form of Miquella's Needle. While it is still incapable of completely warding off the Outer Gods, it's capable of subduing the Flame of Frenzy entirely. In a way, it can be seen that Miquella intended to create the needles to prevent all the Outer Gods from interfering with the Lands Between but wasn't powerful enough to complete them. He grew the Haligtree to break his curse of eternal youth and grow to become even stronger to truly complete his work. Miquella gave the first creations of Unalloyed Gold, the prosthetics, to Malenia, as her original was regular gold, the one we give to Millicent. But when he created the needle, it was meant to protect against the Outer Gods, he might have planned to rebel against them all, and entrusted the first needle, to Malenia, to serve both as a cure for her affliction as the two of them had long dreamed, and to protect against the future threats that are the Outer Gods. By abandoning that needle to protect Miquella, Malenia essentially betrayed Miquella. 

And when she had to betray the one she loved most and everything he sacrificed, she felt unworthy to face him again. Even more so when she came home to find Miquella gone, stolen by Mohg, a figure she doesn't even know. As far as she is concerned, Miquella simply disappeared, she doesn't know if his growth was complete, only that the Haligtree lies silent. But even after everything, she knows he is still alive, and despite her failure and betrayal, she wants nothing more than to see him, so she hopelessly waits.
Reeeeeeeeeally needed the “have.” Sounds like fighting a hillbilly goddess now; Inbred Malenia of the Rotten Swamp Banjo.

Also the "I'm Malenia" instead of "I am" sounds way more informal.
It's sad that such beautiful art has to be spoiled by grammar. It's like watching a super model say: wassup bro
    Its a real "with great power must come great possibility" moment

[How that line probably went](https://voca.ro/1m2qI2lrTHds)
        I honestly think "with great power comes great responsibility" works a lot better than "with great power must come great responsibility".  It implies that the power and the responsibility are a package deal, and you don't have a choice in the matter.  That when you accept that power, you automatically accept the burden that comes along with it.  Also rolls off the tongue better.
            The original already drove that message home, as the tone of the original line necessitates that they are both a package (kind of like saying with storms comes rain or lightning, that they come *together*). With great power, comes great responsibility, the implication being when you have great power, there is an inherent responsibility with owning it, including the must only serves to make the line more clunky.
                Yeah I know, I'm agreeing.  I'm saying the "must" is unnecessary
                    Whoops my bad, not enough coffees here clearly

            Good bot
Is she just blind or does she not have eyes?
    Her eyes are rotted so she no longer has them
Isn't the sword also part of her prosthetic?
    No, but it does have a socket of sorts that clips onto the sword's bare tang.  Her prosthetic hand grips the base of the blade.

Would be a wildly uncomfortable sword to use with meat hands.
    It is. The blade literally says "Blade built into Malenia's prosthetic arm." It's attached to it.
    Nah it's separate
        Y'all stop downvoting this mf, it IS separate until she clips it into the arm socket
Caelid lost.
    o7 Caelid.
    You spelled Iowa wrong.
Hard to have any victory when an entire city and its surrounding are now radioactive++
    Fallout is two blocks away this is elden ring lol
        Caelid Mojave what’s the difference practical the same thing
            Caelid is basically just Cali, hell it even sounds similar
Battle was a stalemate but Radahn ended up far worse than Malenia, or any other shardbearer after the shattering. Mindless and a country in absolute ruin.
    Tbh i prefer him than malenia who fainted after the aeonia, left the battlefield still unconscious only thanks to the cleanrot knights and still has the courage to say she has never known defeat.. bitch has no shame, would've 100% died if not for Finley
        The point of her saying that is most likely to do with her rot and endless fight for sanity and control of her own body and destiny. Like if a cancer patient says they haven't lost yet. Only killing her allows her to let go of the pride keeping her alive. Honestly I see it as resolve beyond anyone else in the game
        Radahn likely would've eaten Malenia's unconscious body if it weren't for Finely removing her from the scene. He could've also dropped the stars on top of Malenia's head and end it there, but he probably didn't want to destroy Caleid in the process.
            He was holding the stars back. He was not aiming them like a bazooka.
        Well Radahn did actually die, completely lost his mind and turned into a zombie. I’d say that 100% trumps that.
            Radahn is not a fuckimg zombie. My Man's been out here surviving with a plague that kills people in minutes for an age. And you have the nerve to call h a zombie, when *there are literal zombies in the game that he looks nothing like.*
                He basically it. The OP was talking about his sense of self, which is entirely gone from him. He just mindlessly munches on corpses and roams around. He has 0 sentience left in him.
                    He maintains enough control to:

A) Not kill and eat the fresh meat he's sitting on.

B)  Hold the stars locked in place. 

Neither of which improve his immediate chances of survival, and one of them is actively detrimental.
Nor has his will eroded enough to be malleable.

The man is clearly insane, but a zombie he is not.
                        You can still be basically a "zombie" and do things strongly associated with your life. Like muscle memory. Its likely he didn't need to exert much conscious power for the stars once he was done with his initial conquest and his horse is clearly something very deeply ingrained. He can't talk, he can't reason, he is running on instinct and basic functions that were strong enough in his life to be done automatically. He is a living zombie.
                You’ve clearly never watched any zombie films. He acts exactly the same. He howls at the moon and eats the corpses of friends and foe alike. This is not the behaviour of a person, it’s the behaviour of a thing that acts on complete instinct. Ergo Radahn is dead. All that’s left is a mindless instinct husk. Hence the entire reason for the festival.

I know you can’t bare the thought that Radahn got reduced to such a pitiful state but those are the facts. And cause I know your going to mention his horse. He spends all his time on it, learned magic just to ride it and his been on it so much it’s basically an extension of his body, like his swords, he isn’t eating his swords is he? Then he ain’t eating his method of travel.
            Nope, you actually kill him.. the whole point of the festival was to finally kill him and give him a glorious death in battle.
                So when a person turns into a a zombie they aren’t considered dead?

If you wanna get technical the body that is Radahn is alive but that actual person that was Radahn is objectively dead, and no amount of downvotes from salty Radahn dickriders can convince me otherwise.
                    Dude, you are the one making up things calling him zombie. Everything i claim is backed up by in-game lore, and for what I remember nowhere was mentioned that radahn is a zombie, nor that whoever affected by scarlet rot becomes one. It may be as you say, as it may not. From my point of view he is clinging to life, he's just that resilient that even scarlet rot cant fully kill him.. it took his sanity, but not his body.

Edit: just to be clear it is canon that a zombie is someone who comes back from the world of the dead
                        I find it ironic you mention in-game lore when you ignore it. The scarlet rot can’t fully kill him, or anyone, because there is no death in the lands between. Since the rune got stolen. Hence why you mostly you see those zombie-like wandering nobles, knights and every other mob. No one dying of old age. Just rotting and decomposing.

Pay attention man.
                            First, a zombie is someone who comes back to life meaning that one must die first, and as you just said radahn didn't die hence he can't be one. Second zombie-like is not the same as zombie. Third, by your logic (person dies, if comes back he automatically is a zombie) the tarnished do die and comes back to life, since is not affected by the golden order, so you must be saying we are actually zombies?
                                Straight up false, lie after lie. Zombies aren’t always shown to die first then resurrect. They turn after being bitten too, they don’t need to die. Examples are the zombies in black summer or WWZ.

Point is after changing they are no longer considered alive and the person they once were gone. Thus dead. This is the concept you and others are not grasping.

Tarnished are dead and then brought back by the grace. they are not undead.
        The same can be said for Radahn though. Had he not evacuated the heart of aeonia, he would have been 100% killed by Commander O'Neil and cleanrot knights who still are present at heart of aeonia to this day.
            To my knowledge they actually tried to kill him but didn't manage to.. you can see they skewered him like a shish kebab but still didn't manage to kill him. Anyway he's not bitching about being undefeated
                Well he can't talk lol.
    I mean, she ends up as an outergod's plague puppet. And I'm pretty sure she's pretty much mindless too at this point, the Rot is eating her mind constantly and anything she has left is probably instinct/muscle memory
[deleted]
    Radahn dickriders are so annoying istg, it was a duel no shit she'd use every trick in her arsenal to win
        [deleted]
            So what if the AOE of scarlet aeonia was a *little* big for a 1v1?
        I think it stopped being a duel when she nuke the country and her boys started stabbing Radahn so she could be carried home.

If her knights weren't there she would have died.
Radahn won, Malenia had to call upon an outer god to even stalemate him
    That's a straight up lie.

The Aeonian sword memorial reads:

>The Battle of Aeonia  
>  
>Radahn and Malenia locked in stalemate  
>  
>Then, the scarlet rot blooms

Malenia had already stalemated Radahn prior to unleashing her Rot. She bloomed in order to break the stalemate.
    Malenia, a demigod, had to call upon her demigod powers to break the stalemate with Radahn, a demigod. Saying she lost because she used her scarlet rot demigod powers is like saying a mages don’t really win fights because they call upon powerful magic, or like saying anyone who uses spirit ashes hasn’t really won a fight because they had to call upon other powers that were at their disposal.

I mean, don’t get me wrong, Malenia didn’t win, she was trying to kill Radahn to get the stars to move again and she failed, even with the scarlet flower blooming over Caelid. But Radahn sure as shit didn’t win either - I mean, you saw the state he and what little remains of his forces were in, right?
        But Scarlet Rot isn't her demigod power tho? That's a curse from Outer God, and she controls scarlet rot as much as you can control HIV. You can only spread it and make everyone miserable, including yourself.

I agree that neither won tho, both terribly lost. Malenia unleashing her curse had to be worsened her state and bring her close to became God of Rot avatar whatever. And as badass she is in that state – she is not herself anymore.
            Eh, we’re splitting hairs at this point. The comparison to HIV is pretty funny, but I think it would be more directly comparable to Morgott’s omen curse. During the fight with Morgott when he releases the power of the omen curse he blames it on you, implying that he didn’t want to release the curse. However, he still wields the power that the curse gives him all the same to fuck the player character’s shit up. At that point, putting the emphasis on the source of Morgott’s newfound strength and power is kinda silly when he’s using that strength and power greatly to his benefit in combat, especially since that power was always there, hiding just beneath the surface. We can say something similar about Melania.
                No no, I didn't mean that scarlet rot can't be called her power, she can wield it alright and resemblance with Morgott is quite obvious. I just wanted to put emphasis on the factor that utilizing your curse as a weapon hits both sides of the conflict and brings harm beyond control of the cursed one, as opposed to natural powers like Radahn gravity magic.

Its more of an argument against statement that Radahn ultimately lost the battle because his mind was eaten by rot. But I believe that Malenia's bloom was more of the "screw both of us".
                    I don't know if I'd call learned alien magic natural powers
        Nah. Malenia was the avatar of an outer god as well as being a demigod. Radahn did extremely well considering he didn't have the powers of an ethereal being to back him up. Just him, his magic, and his belief in the golden order.
            Ok? Yes, Radahn did very well - he fought someone who is undefeated to a statemate and survived her onslaught. But that doesn’t mean he won. I’m confused how a demigod and avatar of a god using their demigod and avatar of god powers means the other guy won, especially when we can see the aftermath in the game and Radahn certainly didn’t win.

Was it unfair, dishonorable, and immoral on Malenia’s part? Absolutely. But that’s kind of irrelevant to whether or not Radahn won, now isn’t it?
            Lmao, Malenia was blind, rotted, limbs lost and was only using her blade until she bloomed.

Radahn was healthy, much larger, had gravity magic and home turf advantage and STILL couldn’t win.
                Malenia is also an Empyrean, and Radahn isn't. Nuked an entire country, yet he was still standing while she went nappy time for a few millenia. Granted , he went cray cray, but remained standing and earned the undying respect of his men. Malenia? Alone in a chair lmao.
                    Being an Empyrean has nothing to do with a person strength and adds nothing. It’s just a title given to people chosen by the fingers as potential rulers.

His body was still there, his mind wasn’t. Radahn quite literally died after that nuke. Mindless and with a country in ruins. Whilst Malenia retains her sanity, her powers and actually becomes more powerful than he could ever dream of during our fight with her.
                        Malenia retaining her sanity is contradicted by Milicent's dialogue during her quest. Malenia no longer has, quote "will, dignity, or sense of self."

She can speak, and remembers her name. But she's not sane.
                            Well she is rotted to shit and we know exactly what the rot does at its worst from Radahn. So yeah probably. But she was in a hell of a better state than Radahn, that isn’t up for debate.
                                Malenia had a needle that keep her from having stage 6 cancer while radahn didn’t had sht, and even in madness and agony he managed to keep protecting the lands between from galactic threats  like astel. So yeah I’m the match between malenia ain’t sht.
            Even if this is the argument you want to make Radahn couldn't really beat a half rotted, amputated, and blinded Demigod. The avatar of an outer God is what  simply ended their stalemate.
                Okay? That half-rotted blind amputee was still the best swordswoman in the world. Holding her at bay while holding up the literal night sky is more of a nod to his skill.
            When people  downvote you for being right. Truly says a lot about reddit :')
                Truly a redditor moment.
                    Sweaty downvoters go brrrr
*looks at cleanrot knights puking everywhere* Sick way to fight indeed
Realising how much she was about to find out
    To be fair she got away with fucking around throughout pretty much the rest of the lands between. I’d be just as shocked going from Godrick to Radahn lol.
>I ain’t never
    Y'all heard of Malawnia, the shiv of Micky?
        This is an underrated comment right here
Its something I've learned to fear in pvp.
When a naked guy invades, I know I'm about to get fucked.
    "and unto them we will send only you. . " is what i imagine must play through peoples heads
Only good take in this particular argument
G R R Martin: "Write that down, write that down!"
😂😂😂
Aww🥹✨
Thank you so much!🥺✨
I trust the only unbiased source in the lands between on “knowledge”. Sir Gideon Ofnir who claims that it was a “standstill” or a “stalemate”, and also refers to Malenia as “the undefeated swordswoman”.
    The sword monument in Caelid is probably the closest to an unbiased source you'll get that outright states how it went down. 

> *The Battle of Aeonia*

> *Radahn and Malenia locked in stalemate*

> ***Then,*** *the scarlet rot blooms*

They were locked in a stalemate until she went for the Scarlet Aeonia which ended the battle in a draw between the two. 

The malenia vs radahn discussion is the dumbest shit I read on this sub because it pretty much exists on the basis of people ignoring what characters and several item descriptions say.
        I can immediately smell a thread turning into a shit show whenever these 2 characters are brought up. It's been a year and people still want to argue with the lore.
    Well we've got more unbiased sources that are item descriptions of winged sword insignia, hand of Malenia and cleanrot armor. All are written in third person and call her undefeated.
        Oh for sure, I just like Gideon because he has no incentive in being biased. Dude is obsessed with being correct on all things in the Lands Between
            True that.
So by that logic, since she wasn't killed by Radahn, he was also defeated. It was canonically a draw with neither of them winning or losing.
    I really think it's safe to say that everyone involved in that battle lost. Everyone.

The only person that benefitted from the conflict was... Mogh (yuck).
        Yeah. But honestly I have a feeling Miquella may not as be as kindly as we think. The bewitching branch description is, well.... sus. Would not be surprised if DLC reveals he orchestrated his own kidnapping or some crazy shit like that. Like he was play 5D chess while Mohg, Malenia, and everyone else were playing checkers. I could of course, definitely be wrong but that's my running theory.
Malenia*
Radahn certainly did not win the fight though. She wasn’t defeated and neither was Radahn. Neither won or lost, so it’s basically a tie.
    The one correct answer
        Also acceptable: Rage quit
    I respectfully disagree. While Millenia fell unconscious, Radahn still stood. She had to be saved and dragged out of the arena by her most loyal cleanrot knight. If that hadn't of happened she would have been eaten by newly crazy Radahn. Seems like a loss to me
        There are multiple points in the lore where it is said it was a stalemate with no winner. This cannot be respectfully disagreed upon. So it’s kinda irrelevant what “seems like a loss” to who. It is said many times that there was no winner and no loser. This point cannot be argued regardless of what people may think. Also, nowhere is it said that Radahn “still stood while Malenia fell unconscious”.
        >Radahn still stood

Thats pure speculation.
He could have just as easily crumpled on top of his horse and been carried away as well.
He also could have had to retreat from the constant scarlet rot emanating from the bloom to not die.

I severely doubt Finley could have gotten anywhere close if Radahn was  nearby and conscious, so he either ran away, or was unconscious himself.
        If he could’ve killed her, then he would’ve. I’d say being driven insane, and essentially an animal equates to a loss. Neither of them won, but they both lost.
    Yeah, but Radahn came to and lived on his own volition. Mallenia was only saved because Finley carried her on his back for miles and miles.
        Radahn was home, he didn't have to go anywhere. The Haligtree is an age away. We also don't know the immediate state of the battlefield post bloom. I find it hard to believe Radahn was in any shape to fight in the immediate aftermath.
She knows, just considers it not as a defeat, but a stalemate. The winner is not you neither am I.
Except she wasn’t defeated as is literally stated in game, in lore, in everywhere. Stalemate.

Radahn lost if we actually get really technical since 
Malenia rotted his mind and everything that makes him a person, away. Aswell as turning his country into a wasteland.

The Warrior Radahn fell that day, all that was left was a mindless hunk of flesh that acts purely on instinct.

The mental gymnastics people do to try to spin the fight in such a way that Radhan won is hilarious.
    It's getting ridiculous honestly. The Radhan boys have got to fuckin' relax.
    If we get really technical neither of them won. Yes she rotted his mind but in the ebd he was still standing. While she got bitch slapped so hard she went to sleep for milennia and completely forgot about it. Not to mention nuking an entire country and still failing to get a kill on her target. The mental gymnastics people do to try to spin the fight in such a way that Malenia won is hilarious.
But in the end, what does it matter? Both got smacked by a tarnished of no renown anyway lmao
        >Yes she rotted his mind but in the ebd he was still standing

What item, npc, or text says that? I can also make baseless speculation, like he was knocked unconscious as well, or he ran away from the flower emanating a death field.
Either way, "still standing" is not how you win in a fight to the death.

>The mental gymnastics people do to try to spin the fight in such a way that Malenia won is hilarious.

She didn't win you dingus, it was a draw.
It literally says it IN THE GAME by not only sword graves, item descriptions, and the story trailer, but by a gUY named Gideon Ofnir, THE ALL KNOWING.
        Except she never got bitch slapped at all, we know of literally no damage done to her from Radahn apart from her stabbing herself with her own blade to induce a bloom. So you are straight up lying there. 

Radahn got quite literally turned into a zombie and thus died. Aswell as his entire country being turned into a wasteland. She permanently took him out of the throne contention and put his foolish ambition to rest. Biggest, fattest L of the shattering.

Whereas Malenia wakes up later completely fine and ascends to an even higher power than he ever achieved.

Battle was stalemate but Radahn was objectively way worse off. Not even remotely up for debate.
            It IS stated that she had to be carried away from the battlefield. Keep coping lmao.
                And it IS stated that Radahn completed lost his mind and turned into a beast that eats friend and foe alike. YOU keep coping hahahahaahha
                    Well yes. I never stated otherwise. All I said is that NOBODY won, while you insisted that she won, while taking a look at Finlay's Ashes proves you wrong. No need to act like a 12 yr old just because you didn't know as much of how it went down as you thought you did :,) Truly maidenless behaviour :') 
Edit: As a little note, the biggest single fat L in shattering history is dropping a nuke on a country and still fail to kill your target. That is the very definition of failure <3
                        Finley's ashes only say that she carried the slumbering demigod home and that it was a legendary feat. Not one word is said about Radahn in the immediate aftermath. Both lost because neither fulfilled their objectives (tho no one knows exactly what they were for either side). People can argue that one side or the other came out the better of the exchange though and that is probably the biggest bone of contention. I think most would agree that the battle itself was a stalemate but what happened after and the longer term affects are up in the air.
                        Dude you are the one replying to multiple comments of mine so it’s clear who is really immature and unable to let go lmao.

As I have explained but your brain is obviously too rotted to comprehend. She did kill him. His mind rotted and he turned into a zombie. Literally by that very definition he is dead. Keep. Coping.
                            Yet another dumb take easily disproven. He is still very much alive, very limited rationality, but still alive and kicking. If his mind was 100% gone (or dead dead, as you so obnoxiously keep insisting on) there would be 2 very important happenings. 
1-He wouldn't give a shit about his horse anymore, yet he still keeps it safe.
2-The stars would have resumed their movement, as , y'know, Blaidd and Selen straight up tell you.
Feeling that copium overdose yet?  :')
                                And this is also very easily disproven. If locking the stars was a conscious effort that held him back, why didn’t he release it when fighting Malenia to ensure a win, or against the tarnished and the other warriors? Surely if he wanted to keep them locked so much he would do anything to ensure he doesn’t die? The fact that he didn’t pretty much obliterates your argument. He ain’t alive and kicking as he quite literally is undead. Quite literally if you’d pain any attention to the lore at all. AAAAAAAND he has no feet with which to kick, hahaha.

Also as to the horse point, guy literally learned magic so he could ride it, was on it all the time to the point where it would no longer be a conscious effort on his part. Horse was literally a part of his body and since we don’t see him eating his own body, that’s another part of your argument destroyed.

How’s that copium build up? Must be bursting at the seems right now lmao.
            and you're the one who says anything about mental gymnastics? no damage done to her? we literally see radahn letting her pick up her prosthesis from the ground to be honorable and then she proceeds to nuke a continent but still fails to kill radahn or get what she wanted. keep in mind radahn is doing all of this while still holding the stars in the sky and even after he gets turned into a "zombie" he still doesn't stop doing that, ever. also if you know lore you know that malenia didn't only take a nap and wake up completely fine few hours later lol. she was literally saved by a scarlet rot knight. it's stated, word by word, that she was literally SAVED by a knight who showed great bravery. yes literally it was a stalemate but if you really do wanna get technical, radahn fights her with honor while controlling stars in the sky, she nukes a continent, gives radahn alzhimers and nearly dies herself if she didn't get saved, goes into a coma while radahn still stands, damaged, but still stands. it's clear radahn is the stronger demigod idk how this is even a debate.
                Prosthetic is a prosthetic. It’s not her actual body. 

There is nothing in lore that states that holding the stars back limits his power, find proof of that, I’ll wait. If it actually limited him he would have deactivated it to beat Malenia, or us when we fight him.

If we wanna get REALLY technical Radahn immediately falls to the ground after the bloom. You seen this literally in the cutscene before you fight him, so no he wasn’t still standing.

Malenia was rotted to fuck, blind, lost limbs and only used her blade till she bloomed. Whereas Radahn was healthy, much larger, had magic to supplement his swords and had home advantage and STILL couldn’t kill her AND had his entire country ruined. One Aeonia put him out the game forever, literally only a small part of her power finished him. It’s clear who the stronger demigod is because she literally becomes a Goddess when we fight her. You clearly pay no attention whatsoever hahahahah
                    Not wanting to enter into the debate but there are a few facts you are ignoring. 

1- Radanh never falls to the bloom. Since all Elden Ring media is canon, if you watch the 2019 annoucememt trailer you can see post bloom Radahn, rotting but still standing, roaring alone in the battlefield to the sky. Even more, you can also see in the trailer a lone Cleanrot knight attacking an alone Radahn, most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

2- Radahn is the defender, Malenia the aggressor. Whatever were Malenia goals with Caelid invasions it was a complete strategical and tactical failure. Her army got decimated to the point of no survivors. On the other part, the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured  and whats more important, they kept Radanh great rune safe. So calling her adventure in Caelid a stalemate or a victory is plain preposterous. It was an decisive defeat that erased any kind of military influese of the Halitree. The Redmanes stood standing against the rot, hurted, but with enough power to keep all their land under control, with a sizable and well organiced army. 

The 1v1 is debatable. Its state clearly that it was a draw, so no winners in the direrct confrontation. 

But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision. Only Finlay prevent  her gruesome death. I wouldnt call that a stalemate neither a victory for obvous reasons. 

Sumarizing: Malenia goals unachieved, her army completely anhinilated, 1v1 duel ends in draw, her target rotten but alive so Miquellas fate still frozen, Radanh great rune was not retrieved, Miquella was not founded, Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid, and even celebrate festivals in the name of their leader.

Veredic: total defeat, with no goals achieved.
                        >On the other part, the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

They don't at all? Did you miss how they're all backed up at Redmane Castle barely holding off the wildlife? The Rot has also spread past the flaming walls, and the entire land is uninhabitable. Fort Faroth is completely abandoned, Sellia is a ghost town (literally) and there's ruins everywhere. What are you even talking about?

>The Redmanes stood standing against the rot, hurted, but with enough power to keep all their land under control, with a sizable and well organiced army.

Again what the fuck are you talking about? Have you seen Caelid? Does that look under control to you? And there's still Cleanrot Knights in the Aeonia Swamp.

>But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision.

There is zero evidence for that, Radahn isn't even found at where the bloom took place, it happened in the Aeonian Swamp while the story trailer shows the dunes. At some point he must've left to his castle.

>most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

Finlay survived all the way to the Haligtree

>Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision

Headcanon, post an item description proving he was still conscious. 

>Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid, and even celebrate festivals in the name of their leader.

I'm seriously convinced you haven't actually played the game and just watch Gigachad Radahn tiktok edits, NOTHING about Caelid is secure, and the festival is just a pretense to quite literally Old Yeller Radahn and put him out of his misery.
                            The annoucement trailer of 2019 shows you Post-bloom Radanh standing alone, kneeling and roaring at the sky, covered in rott, in the same battlefield were he tank the scarlet aeonia. Then they show a lone cleanrot knight charging a kneeling Radanh. Seeing the whole context of the scenario, and all writen lore, that was Finlay charging to save Malenia, and i take that as a fact. It makes sense, since is a fact that Malenia was out of cold after the Bloom, and all the puzzle pieces match. Even if Radanh also got invoncious, he woke uo before Malenia no matter what, so without Finlay, her fate was sealed. 

Also, Redmane army end the war with enough man power to build numerous barriers, walls and other fortifications to try to stop the rot. That requieres a level of organization that a destroyed army couldnt achieve. We have to remember that the war happens god knows when. The fact that, a super invasive apocalypthic disasters hasnt consume the whole Caelid by the time our Tarnished appears, shows the power, discipline and organization of the Redmanes. Now compare the few soldiers the Halitree has and the decrepit state of Miquella realm, litteraly falling appart. That looks like a victorious party to you? Finlay ashes clearly state that there were basically no survivors, but them we see the Redmanes contain the Rott for hundreds or thousands of years until our arrival. At the end there were more Redmanes than Halitree troops, so as i said before, the military campaing was a failure.

As i said before, i wont enter in an heated debate since is pointless. The 1v1 was a stalemate, as the All-Knowing said. But from a military point of view, Radahn as the defending party win the exchange, a phyrric victory, but a victory noneless, since he only need to survive and fend of the invading forces.

Malenia didnt achieve any of the possible goals pursued. So thats defeat, no matter how one try to argue.

The day i decide to use tiktok, use cringe expresions like chad, gigachad or the like, will be the day i remove my eyes and tongue. I dont have anything against any character or any personal grief or blind hatred or love to any character of the game. And for the record, Ng+7 player here, with a semi-legic farmed 713 level character on ps4 with God knows how many hours of playtime.
                                > The fact that, a super invasive apocalypthic disasters hasnt consume the whole Caelid by the time our Tarnished appears, shows the power, discipline and organization of the Redmanes.

It does, again what the fuck are you talking about? There isn't a single place in Caelid free from the Rot besides a single tiny cave found underground.

>Finlay ashes clearly state that there were basically no survivors, but them we see the Redmanes contain the Rott for hundreds or thousands of years until our arrival.

It says that there were few survivors, not none. 

>Now compare the few soldiers the Halitree has and the decrepit state of Miquella realm, litteraly falling appart. That looks like a victorious party to you?

I didn't say they won, I said it was a stalemate that ended in no victor. The story trailer even states, what exactly do you think that means?

>Then they show a lone cleanrot knight charging a kneeling Radanh. Seeing the whole context of the scenario, and all writen lore, that was Finlay charging to save Malenia, and i take that as a fact

All written lore states that the battle ended immediately with the Aeonia and pretty much annhilated everything. Radahn straight up retreats from the battle, as the it happens in the heart of Aeonia. This is objective fact, whether it happend later or sooner is unknown but at some point he had to leave.

>he woke uo before Malenia no matter what, so without Finlay, her fate was sealed.

Prove it

>Malenia didnt achieve any of the possible goals pursued. So thats defeat, no matter how one try to argue.

The Redmanes themselves consider themselves to have lost Caelid lol

>When they were driven to defeat by Malenia's scarlet rot, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve.
>"Alas, dear home, I shan't see you again! For our duty is to remain here, a bulwark against the blight."

You're literally arguing against the game
                        > you can see post bloom Radahn, rotting but still standing, roaring alone in the battlefield to the sky.

This could be right after the bloom, or days after the bloom. We don't know.
It also could be the battlefield in the trailer, or the desert we fight him at later.

He absolutely could have fallen unconscious atop his horse, and Leonard ran off from the rot.
Or Radahn himself could have fled the bloom while Malenia was still awake. We don't know because we lack info. I would defer to the game, which states multiple times that it was a draw.

>Even more, you can also see in the trailer a lone Cleanrot knight attacking an alone Radahn, most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

Go watch the trailer of thier fight.
He has multiple clean rot spears in his back, implying he had already fought several before the clash.
It could have easily been one of them.
Additional, can you actually imagine Finley carrying Malenia away from Radahn? A flying, horse riding general with a godamn artillery level bow?

>Whatever were Malenia goals with Caelid invasions it was a complete strategical and tactical failure.

It was to reach Radahn and take his rune, which she did in fact do.

> Her army got decimated to the point of no survivors.

Patently not true, as several survivors are found spread throughout Caelid.
Also:
"Finlay was one of the few survivors of the Battle of Aeonia"
That's both sides baby. Both armies were decimated. 

>the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

I'll let Jerren handle this one:


"I am Jerren. Foolish old warrior, and witness. Incidentally, do you like a good festival,  from time to time? Well, it's true, this fortress houses only the vanquished. But when the stars align, we celebrate."

Here is the redmane armor set.

"When they were driven to defeat by Malenia's scarlet rot, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve."

They lost, and given that thier were "few survivors" and the fight wasn't at the castle, we can assume the redmanes we see weren't at the battle of Aeonia.

>were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

Its a little suspicious that there were no forts in the path of an invading army headed to the capital.
Sure are a lot of ruins in thier path though....hmmm

>and whats more important, they kept Radanh great rune safe.

Its because he had it on him and fucked off to the desert. His army had nothing to do with it.

>So calling her adventure in Caelid a stalemate or a victory is plain preposterous.

The game and story trailer disagree.

>It was an decisive defeat that erased any kind of military influese of the Halitree.

The haligtree definitely still has soldiers in higher comfort, number, and Calibur then Caelid.

>But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision.

Pure speculation, as we don't know when Malenia fell unconscious, nor when Radahn left.
He could have fled the pain of her Aonea in his madness, and she could have been to week to chase him, but we literally do not know.

> Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid,

Very very wierd understanding of what "secure" means.
Cealid is a hell hole that belongs to the children of rot, the redmanes are cornered, broken, and leaderles. 

Let's just agree the game and its creators are right, it was a draw for both powers.
                    Okay if you wanna suggest holding stars in the sly don’t take at least some level of power and doesn’t limit his strength AT ALL then there’s also nothing in the lore that states that her blindness and prosthetics limit her power either. You say she was rotten and near death or something as if she was weakened, she was born like that, even if she was weakened so what? What’s your point? We’re talking about malenia vs radahn and that’s simply how malenia is. If you wanna talk about an imporved version of her then sure maybe she would’ve won but i don’t get the point. It’s whoever fought who on the battlefield.

No you’re not getting technical, you’re getting silly. Radahn was bat shit insane but still very much standing and would’ve killed knocked out malenia of a random knight didn’t save her and took her home where she would continue to be in the coma.


“Radahn was much larger” idk since when size and mass mattered in soulsborne games or lore but omay. Also magic supplements? That’s his powers, you wanted him to not use them while fighting malenia? “And still couldn’t kill her” like i said already he would’ve because he was the conscious one, malenia got saved by third party.

Malenia can’t beat radahn, explodes so she can st least do something, gets her srmy destroyed, fails to accomplish anything other than give radahn brain damage i guess, falls into coma and gets saved by her knight. And even after that, radahn is still holding stars in the sky like the absolute chad he is. Also your argument about “he would’ve deactivated while fighting” is invalid, because he was clearly doing that for an important reason. He obviously didn’t learn gravity magic to not crush his horse, he had a very important goal. Some theories include protecting lands in between from outer creatures etc. so no he wouldn’t and he didn’t, even after having his brain rotten. A true Legend if I’ve ever seen one.
The gymnastics Radahn simps will go through to make themselves believe he won lol. It's been a year, the man lost, get over it.
Yup. Nuked an entire country, couldn't even win smh. 
She's still a badass tho.
Alternatively, the brilliance of the quote is that she has never known defeat because she has never been defeated. Neither won, neither lost. They were both too powerful to lose, so when they fought they basically divided by zero.

Though personally even though I don't think Radahn 'lost' (in terms of hand to hand combat, he sort of won), he was absolutely 'defeated'. It was a classic "win the battle, lose the nuke war" situation.
People who fight with honor tend to end up dead pretty quick. Or zombified in Radahn's case lol. Reminds me of Bronn from GoT. There is no honor in a fight to the death.
    Unless your HORAH LOUX, WARRIOR!
yep, pretty much Malenia in a nutshell.
I’m so sorry for the mistake, I’m italian and sometimes I forget the right forms of speaking! (Even if it’s her sentence, but still, I’m not a perfect human being) thanks for the appreciation tho!
Women's rights. And when they unleash cataclysmic biohazard powers, give them some lefts too!
yes, why does fan art become canom now
    I canon everything i like
It seems inconsistent, because I feel like it's implied she may have taken that winged form before.

>Blade built into Malenia's prosthetic arm.
>Through consecration it is resistant to rot.

>Malenia's war prosthesis symbolized her victories.
Some claim to have seen wings when the weapon was raised aloft;
wings of fierce determination that have never known defeat.
    Actually, before becoming the godess of rot, she is mostly being devoured by it. And putting alloyed gold prosthesis made it to slow down the rot
I like to think about malenia getting more “rotten” trough and trough the fight, so i would go with rotten, or both if you prefer!
The Malenia simps downvoting you for stating facts lmao
True.
Lol you okay, dude?
    Rob builds got to him, understandably

Oberyn Martel proves how stupid your comment is. Guy was a badass. Got his head popped but still, cockiness is what got him.

    Hasn't stopped people in the past
Pretty much
As far as I know, they rotted off because she was born with the curse of the Scarlet Rot.
No, she was missing them prior to their fight. Rot is taking her body from her.
You…. You can not use the summons and still pretty easily destroy him though? You can fight him just as alone as you do Malenia
It is stated over and over again in lore that it was a stalemate. Nobody won and nobody lost. You might see it as a loss, but the fact is Radahn lost just as much as Malenia did, this point cannot be argued.
Given Malenia herself has lost sight and limbs to it, Scarlet rot is more curse than consciously wielded bioweapon.
Not really. I'm not sure why people are so desperate for Radahn to have won this fight. He didn't. He lost everything. I don't think she won either since she didn't get his shard of the he Elden Ring but she didn't lose. That battle ended up in a stalemate.
    Because hE LoVEd HiS hOrSE sO MUch
The Fire Giants and the Merchants will be delighted to find out that they actually *defeated* the Golden Order. Y'know, because of the war crimes.
Chill. It’s all fiction
We did malenia.
    I think if that fight continued somebody would've lost for the very first time. We only see him fight her without using all he's got. She used her rot transformation and still he wasn't using anything crazy. The rot got to him and thats when the tarnished comes in. He fights the tarnished at his best with rot. So definitely not 100%
        He dosen't have anything crazy. Astels meteor storm is astels and malenia could easily dodge his comet dive. There's really nothing crazy. He's just brute strength and willpower.
        You don't know that he wasn't using anything crazy. The trailer, if we even accept it as a source of content, only shows the beginning and the end of their fight; and from what little we do see, Radahn *was* using his sorcery from the start. All we can say without doubt is that he didn't let go of the stars, but we don't know if that would even have helped him, since when he dies none of them fall anywhere near Aeonia, nor does maintaining this control seem to limit his other spellcasting even when he's rotten. Certainly Radahn is badly weakened when *we* fight him, but if we can beat Malenia we can beat him in his prime.
            Is there source of malenia in her prime when fighting tarnished?
                No, but there's little reason to think she wasn't. Her missing limbs and her blindness appear to predate the Shattering (or at least her war against Radahn, since Miquella made her prosthetics), she has no other obvious wounds or conditions weakening her, and she even blooms and ascends to godhood during the fight. By contrast, Radahn was obviously a shadow of his former self as of the game.
No? But perhaps?😂
Nah she's not listening to you, she's sensing the pure malice as you try for the 40th time.
    A spell to nullify your scent and talisman to reduce sound while walking and her good arm tied behind her back and I'd still need 2 summons and 13 furled finger callers to get the dub. Can she also sense my tears ?
        Believe in yourself friend, all you need is time and the willpower to walk that fog 500+ times and anything is possible.

                I appreciated his response. May not have asked but it was welcome.
        I was surprised when I beat her on my 20th try during my bow only run
    she can taste the salt in the air
    40th?  Who do you think I am?  Some pro gamer?
    Heh, first time I did her with mimic tear and blasphemous blade, thought "what is everyone talking about? She's not so bad." In another playthrough, did her with no summons on a pure str build with greatsword, and thought, "OK, now I see what everyone is talking about."
That would be cool and reminiscent of the [Old Hero ](https://demonssouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Old+Hero) from Demon's Souls.

sounds like a fromsoftware thing to do! :D
I beat her on my second try, seemed easy at the time. Mimic tear and rejuvia + frost misericorde. I found her attacks easy to evade, surprisingly enough. Almost got her on my first try but i went in blind not knowing her moves and abilities yet so she caught me out.

I mean I was also thinking she had no eyes by this point but honestly your eye expressions are amazing so I don't mind the lore break.
    Love the art, even if not consistent with lore :)  

yellow eyes are more a frenzied flame sign.  You get such also in your character if going that path.  But.. who knows who the 3 fingers gave free hugs too :). Maybe her too.  Fell god is associated with eyes and red hair.. prosthetic legs.. arms.. eyes? in helmet?  

Placing is also most likely near big rot tree outside castle, where the black knives have crossbows.  The invisibility of black knives would be useless against the blind, but the cross bows might even out the fight out a bit.  I Wonder if it was an ambush involved in the fight too?  But head canon guess.
        >yellow eyes are more a frenzied flame sign.

Iirc every non-tarnished human has yellow eyes. Millicent has yellow eyes for example, and I think Kenneth has them too, but I'm not sure.
            iirc those directly tied with the Erdtree in some way have eyes of gold (Melina, Marika, Godfrey, etc)

Kenneth does have gold eyes, as does Millicent


looking at [more here,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu_Q9TwF5Xc) Sellen doesn't have gold eyes in either of her bodies, but she also isn't directly tied to Marika/Radagon at all
            I thought it was tied to being able to see the guidance of grace
                It's tied to the grace imbued in the non-Tarnished. Godfrey's eyes "dulled" when he lost the grace of the Erdtree and became the first Tarnished. The gold eyes never returned, even after the guidance of grace did.
Idk I think her being blind is so integral to her character. I really love that she's a powerful disabled character.
    I was talking about this with someone the other day. It's a consistent theme for From games to have strong/important disabled characters. Maybe it's because I have a disability but it always stood out to me.
        I mean, in from soft games pretty much EVERYONE is disabled in some way, so yeah
        I do love characters like that, sad that it's overshadowed by WATERFOWL DANCE 

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
            Waterfowl Dance? I think you meam Fowl Play *Badum tss*
                Waterfoul dance? I think you mean AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    her disability IS part of her power lol
Fair enough, but I think making her eye color cloudy could work. (I'm no artist tho) 

But I feel like some cloudy Grey eyes with that expression could still work.

IGNORE ME
    >IGNORE ME


I don't think I will >:)
It’s a masterpiece I would love to see more Elden ring stuff like this.
    Thank you! I was thinking about making another comic but I’m quite uncertain about the topic. I would love to do a Rennala/Radagon one!
Thoughts?
        I think that would be very interesting, they met during the war and fell in love they had children and radagon left her for Marika. 

Visually Renalla is probably the only demigod which doesn’t look weathered but how did Radagon look when he isn’t fused with Marika and crumbling so to speak. 

That’s all the context I can think off.

I just really like your artstyle and even if it isn’t lore accurate ( which shouldn’t matter in the souls franchise ) it’s your interpretation and I’d love to see more.
            Thank you so much for the suggestion🥹✨
It looks great, but her disability is a very important part of her character.

Fun fact, it can be implied that the cinematic where she puts on her arm when facing Radahn occurs right after she took out and broke the needle.

She knew she could only defeat Radahn if she used everything and gave in to the rot.

*"The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot. The pride she abandoned, to meet Radahn's measure."*

This line shows that she willingly abandoned her pride, the Unalloyed Golden Needle. And since in the cinematic, Radahn is shown waiting for Malenia, most likely, during the early stages of the battle and during her march to Caelid, Malenia was conflicted with her choice and never removed the needle. Only when she faced Radahn did she come to the conclusion that she really couldn't win without breaking the needle. Radahn let her remove it as we see him waiting for Malenia to prepare herself, probably implying that he wanted to fight Malenia at her strongest in respect for a fellow warrior and to honor her resolve.

So they probably duked it out at first, Malenia was at a disadvantage and Radahn stopped, allowing her to do what she needed to truly face him. So she took off her arm, removed the needle, broke it to probably ensure that she couldn't use it again knowing what removing it would mean to Miquella and believing herself unworthy of picking it up again, and put back her arm ready to face Radahn with everything, and Radahn taking it all head on to truly see who was worthy of the title of "Strongest", the Conquerer of the Stars, or the Undefeated Blade of Miquella.

And the reason why I believe that she broke the needle because she felt unworthy, is that even when we give it to her after defeating her, even when she becomes a Scarlet Aeonia, she gives it right back to us in the unfinished but strengthened form of Miquella's Needle. While it is still incapable of completely warding off the Outer Gods, it's capable of subduing the Flame of Frenzy entirely. In a way, it can be seen that Miquella intended to create the needles to prevent all the Outer Gods from interfering with the Lands Between but wasn't powerful enough to complete them. He grew the Haligtree to break his curse of eternal youth and grow to become even stronger to truly complete his work. Miquella gave the first creations of Unalloyed Gold, the prosthetics, to Malenia, as her original was regular gold, the one we give to Millicent. But when he created the needle, it was meant to protect against the Outer Gods, he might have planned to rebel against them all, and entrusted the first needle, to Malenia, to serve both as a cure for her affliction as the two of them had long dreamed, and to protect against the future threats that are the Outer Gods. By abandoning that needle to protect Miquella, Malenia essentially betrayed Miquella. 

And when she had to betray the one she loved most and everything he sacrificed, she felt unworthy to face him again. Even more so when she came home to find Miquella gone, stolen by Mohg, a figure she doesn't even know. As far as she is concerned, Miquella simply disappeared, she doesn't know if his growth was complete, only that the Haligtree lies silent. But even after everything, she knows he is still alive, and despite her failure and betrayal, she wants nothing more than to see him, so she hopelessly waits.

Its a real "with great power must come great possibility" moment

[How that line probably went](https://voca.ro/1m2qI2lrTHds)
    I honestly think "with great power comes great responsibility" works a lot better than "with great power must come great responsibility".  It implies that the power and the responsibility are a package deal, and you don't have a choice in the matter.  That when you accept that power, you automatically accept the burden that comes along with it.  Also rolls off the tongue better.
        The original already drove that message home, as the tone of the original line necessitates that they are both a package (kind of like saying with storms comes rain or lightning, that they come *together*). With great power, comes great responsibility, the implication being when you have great power, there is an inherent responsibility with owning it, including the must only serves to make the line more clunky.
            Yeah I know, I'm agreeing.  I'm saying the "must" is unnecessary

Her eyes are rotted so she no longer has them
No, but it does have a socket of sorts that clips onto the sword's bare tang.  Her prosthetic hand grips the base of the blade.

Would be a wildly uncomfortable sword to use with meat hands.
It is. The blade literally says "Blade built into Malenia's prosthetic arm." It's attached to it.
Nah it's separate
    Y'all stop downvoting this mf, it IS separate until she clips it into the arm socket
o7 Caelid.
You spelled Iowa wrong.
Fallout is two blocks away this is elden ring lol
    Caelid Mojave what’s the difference practical the same thing
        Caelid is basically just Cali, hell it even sounds similar
Tbh i prefer him than malenia who fainted after the aeonia, left the battlefield still unconscious only thanks to the cleanrot knights and still has the courage to say she has never known defeat.. bitch has no shame, would've 100% died if not for Finley
    The point of her saying that is most likely to do with her rot and endless fight for sanity and control of her own body and destiny. Like if a cancer patient says they haven't lost yet. Only killing her allows her to let go of the pride keeping her alive. Honestly I see it as resolve beyond anyone else in the game
    Radahn likely would've eaten Malenia's unconscious body if it weren't for Finely removing her from the scene. He could've also dropped the stars on top of Malenia's head and end it there, but he probably didn't want to destroy Caleid in the process.
        He was holding the stars back. He was not aiming them like a bazooka.
    Well Radahn did actually die, completely lost his mind and turned into a zombie. I’d say that 100% trumps that.
        Radahn is not a fuckimg zombie. My Man's been out here surviving with a plague that kills people in minutes for an age. And you have the nerve to call h a zombie, when *there are literal zombies in the game that he looks nothing like.*
            He basically it. The OP was talking about his sense of self, which is entirely gone from him. He just mindlessly munches on corpses and roams around. He has 0 sentience left in him.
                He maintains enough control to:

A) Not kill and eat the fresh meat he's sitting on.

B)  Hold the stars locked in place. 

Neither of which improve his immediate chances of survival, and one of them is actively detrimental.
Nor has his will eroded enough to be malleable.

The man is clearly insane, but a zombie he is not.
                    You can still be basically a "zombie" and do things strongly associated with your life. Like muscle memory. Its likely he didn't need to exert much conscious power for the stars once he was done with his initial conquest and his horse is clearly something very deeply ingrained. He can't talk, he can't reason, he is running on instinct and basic functions that were strong enough in his life to be done automatically. He is a living zombie.
            You’ve clearly never watched any zombie films. He acts exactly the same. He howls at the moon and eats the corpses of friends and foe alike. This is not the behaviour of a person, it’s the behaviour of a thing that acts on complete instinct. Ergo Radahn is dead. All that’s left is a mindless instinct husk. Hence the entire reason for the festival.

I know you can’t bare the thought that Radahn got reduced to such a pitiful state but those are the facts. And cause I know your going to mention his horse. He spends all his time on it, learned magic just to ride it and his been on it so much it’s basically an extension of his body, like his swords, he isn’t eating his swords is he? Then he ain’t eating his method of travel.
        Nope, you actually kill him.. the whole point of the festival was to finally kill him and give him a glorious death in battle.
            So when a person turns into a a zombie they aren’t considered dead?

If you wanna get technical the body that is Radahn is alive but that actual person that was Radahn is objectively dead, and no amount of downvotes from salty Radahn dickriders can convince me otherwise.
                Dude, you are the one making up things calling him zombie. Everything i claim is backed up by in-game lore, and for what I remember nowhere was mentioned that radahn is a zombie, nor that whoever affected by scarlet rot becomes one. It may be as you say, as it may not. From my point of view he is clinging to life, he's just that resilient that even scarlet rot cant fully kill him.. it took his sanity, but not his body.

Edit: just to be clear it is canon that a zombie is someone who comes back from the world of the dead
                    I find it ironic you mention in-game lore when you ignore it. The scarlet rot can’t fully kill him, or anyone, because there is no death in the lands between. Since the rune got stolen. Hence why you mostly you see those zombie-like wandering nobles, knights and every other mob. No one dying of old age. Just rotting and decomposing.

Pay attention man.
                        First, a zombie is someone who comes back to life meaning that one must die first, and as you just said radahn didn't die hence he can't be one. Second zombie-like is not the same as zombie. Third, by your logic (person dies, if comes back he automatically is a zombie) the tarnished do die and comes back to life, since is not affected by the golden order, so you must be saying we are actually zombies?
                            Straight up false, lie after lie. Zombies aren’t always shown to die first then resurrect. They turn after being bitten too, they don’t need to die. Examples are the zombies in black summer or WWZ.

Point is after changing they are no longer considered alive and the person they once were gone. Thus dead. This is the concept you and others are not grasping.

Tarnished are dead and then brought back by the grace. they are not undead.
    The same can be said for Radahn though. Had he not evacuated the heart of aeonia, he would have been 100% killed by Commander O'Neil and cleanrot knights who still are present at heart of aeonia to this day.
        To my knowledge they actually tried to kill him but didn't manage to.. you can see they skewered him like a shish kebab but still didn't manage to kill him. Anyway he's not bitching about being undefeated
            Well he can't talk lol.
I mean, she ends up as an outergod's plague puppet. And I'm pretty sure she's pretty much mindless too at this point, the Rot is eating her mind constantly and anything she has left is probably instinct/muscle memory
Radahn dickriders are so annoying istg, it was a duel no shit she'd use every trick in her arsenal to win
    [deleted]
        So what if the AOE of scarlet aeonia was a *little* big for a 1v1?
    I think it stopped being a duel when she nuke the country and her boys started stabbing Radahn so she could be carried home.

If her knights weren't there she would have died.
That's a straight up lie.

The Aeonian sword memorial reads:

>The Battle of Aeonia  
>  
>Radahn and Malenia locked in stalemate  
>  
>Then, the scarlet rot blooms

Malenia had already stalemated Radahn prior to unleashing her Rot. She bloomed in order to break the stalemate.
Malenia, a demigod, had to call upon her demigod powers to break the stalemate with Radahn, a demigod. Saying she lost because she used her scarlet rot demigod powers is like saying a mages don’t really win fights because they call upon powerful magic, or like saying anyone who uses spirit ashes hasn’t really won a fight because they had to call upon other powers that were at their disposal.

I mean, don’t get me wrong, Malenia didn’t win, she was trying to kill Radahn to get the stars to move again and she failed, even with the scarlet flower blooming over Caelid. But Radahn sure as shit didn’t win either - I mean, you saw the state he and what little remains of his forces were in, right?
    But Scarlet Rot isn't her demigod power tho? That's a curse from Outer God, and she controls scarlet rot as much as you can control HIV. You can only spread it and make everyone miserable, including yourself.

I agree that neither won tho, both terribly lost. Malenia unleashing her curse had to be worsened her state and bring her close to became God of Rot avatar whatever. And as badass she is in that state – she is not herself anymore.
        Eh, we’re splitting hairs at this point. The comparison to HIV is pretty funny, but I think it would be more directly comparable to Morgott’s omen curse. During the fight with Morgott when he releases the power of the omen curse he blames it on you, implying that he didn’t want to release the curse. However, he still wields the power that the curse gives him all the same to fuck the player character’s shit up. At that point, putting the emphasis on the source of Morgott’s newfound strength and power is kinda silly when he’s using that strength and power greatly to his benefit in combat, especially since that power was always there, hiding just beneath the surface. We can say something similar about Melania.
            No no, I didn't mean that scarlet rot can't be called her power, she can wield it alright and resemblance with Morgott is quite obvious. I just wanted to put emphasis on the factor that utilizing your curse as a weapon hits both sides of the conflict and brings harm beyond control of the cursed one, as opposed to natural powers like Radahn gravity magic.

Its more of an argument against statement that Radahn ultimately lost the battle because his mind was eaten by rot. But I believe that Malenia's bloom was more of the "screw both of us".
                I don't know if I'd call learned alien magic natural powers
    Nah. Malenia was the avatar of an outer god as well as being a demigod. Radahn did extremely well considering he didn't have the powers of an ethereal being to back him up. Just him, his magic, and his belief in the golden order.
        Ok? Yes, Radahn did very well - he fought someone who is undefeated to a statemate and survived her onslaught. But that doesn’t mean he won. I’m confused how a demigod and avatar of a god using their demigod and avatar of god powers means the other guy won, especially when we can see the aftermath in the game and Radahn certainly didn’t win.

Was it unfair, dishonorable, and immoral on Malenia’s part? Absolutely. But that’s kind of irrelevant to whether or not Radahn won, now isn’t it?
        Lmao, Malenia was blind, rotted, limbs lost and was only using her blade until she bloomed.

Radahn was healthy, much larger, had gravity magic and home turf advantage and STILL couldn’t win.
            Malenia is also an Empyrean, and Radahn isn't. Nuked an entire country, yet he was still standing while she went nappy time for a few millenia. Granted , he went cray cray, but remained standing and earned the undying respect of his men. Malenia? Alone in a chair lmao.
                Being an Empyrean has nothing to do with a person strength and adds nothing. It’s just a title given to people chosen by the fingers as potential rulers.

His body was still there, his mind wasn’t. Radahn quite literally died after that nuke. Mindless and with a country in ruins. Whilst Malenia retains her sanity, her powers and actually becomes more powerful than he could ever dream of during our fight with her.
                    Malenia retaining her sanity is contradicted by Milicent's dialogue during her quest. Malenia no longer has, quote "will, dignity, or sense of self."

She can speak, and remembers her name. But she's not sane.
                        Well she is rotted to shit and we know exactly what the rot does at its worst from Radahn. So yeah probably. But she was in a hell of a better state than Radahn, that isn’t up for debate.
                            Malenia had a needle that keep her from having stage 6 cancer while radahn didn’t had sht, and even in madness and agony he managed to keep protecting the lands between from galactic threats  like astel. So yeah I’m the match between malenia ain’t sht.
        Even if this is the argument you want to make Radahn couldn't really beat a half rotted, amputated, and blinded Demigod. The avatar of an outer God is what  simply ended their stalemate.
            Okay? That half-rotted blind amputee was still the best swordswoman in the world. Holding her at bay while holding up the literal night sky is more of a nod to his skill.
        When people  downvote you for being right. Truly says a lot about reddit :')
            Truly a redditor moment.
                Sweaty downvoters go brrrr
To be fair she got away with fucking around throughout pretty much the rest of the lands between. I’d be just as shocked going from Godrick to Radahn lol.
Y'all heard of Malawnia, the shiv of Micky?
    This is an underrated comment right here
"and unto them we will send only you. . " is what i imagine must play through peoples heads
The sword monument in Caelid is probably the closest to an unbiased source you'll get that outright states how it went down. 

> *The Battle of Aeonia*

> *Radahn and Malenia locked in stalemate*

> ***Then,*** *the scarlet rot blooms*

They were locked in a stalemate until she went for the Scarlet Aeonia which ended the battle in a draw between the two. 

The malenia vs radahn discussion is the dumbest shit I read on this sub because it pretty much exists on the basis of people ignoring what characters and several item descriptions say.
    I can immediately smell a thread turning into a shit show whenever these 2 characters are brought up. It's been a year and people still want to argue with the lore.
Well we've got more unbiased sources that are item descriptions of winged sword insignia, hand of Malenia and cleanrot armor. All are written in third person and call her undefeated.
    Oh for sure, I just like Gideon because he has no incentive in being biased. Dude is obsessed with being correct on all things in the Lands Between
        True that.
I really think it's safe to say that everyone involved in that battle lost. Everyone.

The only person that benefitted from the conflict was... Mogh (yuck).
    Yeah. But honestly I have a feeling Miquella may not as be as kindly as we think. The bewitching branch description is, well.... sus. Would not be surprised if DLC reveals he orchestrated his own kidnapping or some crazy shit like that. Like he was play 5D chess while Mohg, Malenia, and everyone else were playing checkers. I could of course, definitely be wrong but that's my running theory.
The one correct answer
    Also acceptable: Rage quit
I respectfully disagree. While Millenia fell unconscious, Radahn still stood. She had to be saved and dragged out of the arena by her most loyal cleanrot knight. If that hadn't of happened she would have been eaten by newly crazy Radahn. Seems like a loss to me
    There are multiple points in the lore where it is said it was a stalemate with no winner. This cannot be respectfully disagreed upon. So it’s kinda irrelevant what “seems like a loss” to who. It is said many times that there was no winner and no loser. This point cannot be argued regardless of what people may think. Also, nowhere is it said that Radahn “still stood while Malenia fell unconscious”.
    >Radahn still stood

Thats pure speculation.
He could have just as easily crumpled on top of his horse and been carried away as well.
He also could have had to retreat from the constant scarlet rot emanating from the bloom to not die.

I severely doubt Finley could have gotten anywhere close if Radahn was  nearby and conscious, so he either ran away, or was unconscious himself.
    If he could’ve killed her, then he would’ve. I’d say being driven insane, and essentially an animal equates to a loss. Neither of them won, but they both lost.
Yeah, but Radahn came to and lived on his own volition. Mallenia was only saved because Finley carried her on his back for miles and miles.
    Radahn was home, he didn't have to go anywhere. The Haligtree is an age away. We also don't know the immediate state of the battlefield post bloom. I find it hard to believe Radahn was in any shape to fight in the immediate aftermath.
It's getting ridiculous honestly. The Radhan boys have got to fuckin' relax.
If we get really technical neither of them won. Yes she rotted his mind but in the ebd he was still standing. While she got bitch slapped so hard she went to sleep for milennia and completely forgot about it. Not to mention nuking an entire country and still failing to get a kill on her target. The mental gymnastics people do to try to spin the fight in such a way that Malenia won is hilarious.
But in the end, what does it matter? Both got smacked by a tarnished of no renown anyway lmao
    >Yes she rotted his mind but in the ebd he was still standing

What item, npc, or text says that? I can also make baseless speculation, like he was knocked unconscious as well, or he ran away from the flower emanating a death field.
Either way, "still standing" is not how you win in a fight to the death.

>The mental gymnastics people do to try to spin the fight in such a way that Malenia won is hilarious.

She didn't win you dingus, it was a draw.
It literally says it IN THE GAME by not only sword graves, item descriptions, and the story trailer, but by a gUY named Gideon Ofnir, THE ALL KNOWING.
    Except she never got bitch slapped at all, we know of literally no damage done to her from Radahn apart from her stabbing herself with her own blade to induce a bloom. So you are straight up lying there. 

Radahn got quite literally turned into a zombie and thus died. Aswell as his entire country being turned into a wasteland. She permanently took him out of the throne contention and put his foolish ambition to rest. Biggest, fattest L of the shattering.

Whereas Malenia wakes up later completely fine and ascends to an even higher power than he ever achieved.

Battle was stalemate but Radahn was objectively way worse off. Not even remotely up for debate.
        It IS stated that she had to be carried away from the battlefield. Keep coping lmao.
            And it IS stated that Radahn completed lost his mind and turned into a beast that eats friend and foe alike. YOU keep coping hahahahaahha
                Well yes. I never stated otherwise. All I said is that NOBODY won, while you insisted that she won, while taking a look at Finlay's Ashes proves you wrong. No need to act like a 12 yr old just because you didn't know as much of how it went down as you thought you did :,) Truly maidenless behaviour :') 
Edit: As a little note, the biggest single fat L in shattering history is dropping a nuke on a country and still fail to kill your target. That is the very definition of failure <3
                    Finley's ashes only say that she carried the slumbering demigod home and that it was a legendary feat. Not one word is said about Radahn in the immediate aftermath. Both lost because neither fulfilled their objectives (tho no one knows exactly what they were for either side). People can argue that one side or the other came out the better of the exchange though and that is probably the biggest bone of contention. I think most would agree that the battle itself was a stalemate but what happened after and the longer term affects are up in the air.
                    Dude you are the one replying to multiple comments of mine so it’s clear who is really immature and unable to let go lmao.

As I have explained but your brain is obviously too rotted to comprehend. She did kill him. His mind rotted and he turned into a zombie. Literally by that very definition he is dead. Keep. Coping.
                        Yet another dumb take easily disproven. He is still very much alive, very limited rationality, but still alive and kicking. If his mind was 100% gone (or dead dead, as you so obnoxiously keep insisting on) there would be 2 very important happenings. 
1-He wouldn't give a shit about his horse anymore, yet he still keeps it safe.
2-The stars would have resumed their movement, as , y'know, Blaidd and Selen straight up tell you.
Feeling that copium overdose yet?  :')
                            And this is also very easily disproven. If locking the stars was a conscious effort that held him back, why didn’t he release it when fighting Malenia to ensure a win, or against the tarnished and the other warriors? Surely if he wanted to keep them locked so much he would do anything to ensure he doesn’t die? The fact that he didn’t pretty much obliterates your argument. He ain’t alive and kicking as he quite literally is undead. Quite literally if you’d pain any attention to the lore at all. AAAAAAAND he has no feet with which to kick, hahaha.

Also as to the horse point, guy literally learned magic so he could ride it, was on it all the time to the point where it would no longer be a conscious effort on his part. Horse was literally a part of his body and since we don’t see him eating his own body, that’s another part of your argument destroyed.

How’s that copium build up? Must be bursting at the seems right now lmao.
        and you're the one who says anything about mental gymnastics? no damage done to her? we literally see radahn letting her pick up her prosthesis from the ground to be honorable and then she proceeds to nuke a continent but still fails to kill radahn or get what she wanted. keep in mind radahn is doing all of this while still holding the stars in the sky and even after he gets turned into a "zombie" he still doesn't stop doing that, ever. also if you know lore you know that malenia didn't only take a nap and wake up completely fine few hours later lol. she was literally saved by a scarlet rot knight. it's stated, word by word, that she was literally SAVED by a knight who showed great bravery. yes literally it was a stalemate but if you really do wanna get technical, radahn fights her with honor while controlling stars in the sky, she nukes a continent, gives radahn alzhimers and nearly dies herself if she didn't get saved, goes into a coma while radahn still stands, damaged, but still stands. it's clear radahn is the stronger demigod idk how this is even a debate.
            Prosthetic is a prosthetic. It’s not her actual body. 

There is nothing in lore that states that holding the stars back limits his power, find proof of that, I’ll wait. If it actually limited him he would have deactivated it to beat Malenia, or us when we fight him.

If we wanna get REALLY technical Radahn immediately falls to the ground after the bloom. You seen this literally in the cutscene before you fight him, so no he wasn’t still standing.

Malenia was rotted to fuck, blind, lost limbs and only used her blade till she bloomed. Whereas Radahn was healthy, much larger, had magic to supplement his swords and had home advantage and STILL couldn’t kill her AND had his entire country ruined. One Aeonia put him out the game forever, literally only a small part of her power finished him. It’s clear who the stronger demigod is because she literally becomes a Goddess when we fight her. You clearly pay no attention whatsoever hahahahah
                Not wanting to enter into the debate but there are a few facts you are ignoring. 

1- Radanh never falls to the bloom. Since all Elden Ring media is canon, if you watch the 2019 annoucememt trailer you can see post bloom Radahn, rotting but still standing, roaring alone in the battlefield to the sky. Even more, you can also see in the trailer a lone Cleanrot knight attacking an alone Radahn, most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

2- Radahn is the defender, Malenia the aggressor. Whatever were Malenia goals with Caelid invasions it was a complete strategical and tactical failure. Her army got decimated to the point of no survivors. On the other part, the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured  and whats more important, they kept Radanh great rune safe. So calling her adventure in Caelid a stalemate or a victory is plain preposterous. It was an decisive defeat that erased any kind of military influese of the Halitree. The Redmanes stood standing against the rot, hurted, but with enough power to keep all their land under control, with a sizable and well organiced army. 

The 1v1 is debatable. Its state clearly that it was a draw, so no winners in the direrct confrontation. 

But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision. Only Finlay prevent  her gruesome death. I wouldnt call that a stalemate neither a victory for obvous reasons. 

Sumarizing: Malenia goals unachieved, her army completely anhinilated, 1v1 duel ends in draw, her target rotten but alive so Miquellas fate still frozen, Radanh great rune was not retrieved, Miquella was not founded, Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid, and even celebrate festivals in the name of their leader.

Veredic: total defeat, with no goals achieved.
                    >On the other part, the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

They don't at all? Did you miss how they're all backed up at Redmane Castle barely holding off the wildlife? The Rot has also spread past the flaming walls, and the entire land is uninhabitable. Fort Faroth is completely abandoned, Sellia is a ghost town (literally) and there's ruins everywhere. What are you even talking about?

>The Redmanes stood standing against the rot, hurted, but with enough power to keep all their land under control, with a sizable and well organiced army.

Again what the fuck are you talking about? Have you seen Caelid? Does that look under control to you? And there's still Cleanrot Knights in the Aeonia Swamp.

>But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision.

There is zero evidence for that, Radahn isn't even found at where the bloom took place, it happened in the Aeonian Swamp while the story trailer shows the dunes. At some point he must've left to his castle.

>most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

Finlay survived all the way to the Haligtree

>Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision

Headcanon, post an item description proving he was still conscious. 

>Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid, and even celebrate festivals in the name of their leader.

I'm seriously convinced you haven't actually played the game and just watch Gigachad Radahn tiktok edits, NOTHING about Caelid is secure, and the festival is just a pretense to quite literally Old Yeller Radahn and put him out of his misery.
                        The annoucement trailer of 2019 shows you Post-bloom Radanh standing alone, kneeling and roaring at the sky, covered in rott, in the same battlefield were he tank the scarlet aeonia. Then they show a lone cleanrot knight charging a kneeling Radanh. Seeing the whole context of the scenario, and all writen lore, that was Finlay charging to save Malenia, and i take that as a fact. It makes sense, since is a fact that Malenia was out of cold after the Bloom, and all the puzzle pieces match. Even if Radanh also got invoncious, he woke uo before Malenia no matter what, so without Finlay, her fate was sealed. 

Also, Redmane army end the war with enough man power to build numerous barriers, walls and other fortifications to try to stop the rot. That requieres a level of organization that a destroyed army couldnt achieve. We have to remember that the war happens god knows when. The fact that, a super invasive apocalypthic disasters hasnt consume the whole Caelid by the time our Tarnished appears, shows the power, discipline and organization of the Redmanes. Now compare the few soldiers the Halitree has and the decrepit state of Miquella realm, litteraly falling appart. That looks like a victorious party to you? Finlay ashes clearly state that there were basically no survivors, but them we see the Redmanes contain the Rott for hundreds or thousands of years until our arrival. At the end there were more Redmanes than Halitree troops, so as i said before, the military campaing was a failure.

As i said before, i wont enter in an heated debate since is pointless. The 1v1 was a stalemate, as the All-Knowing said. But from a military point of view, Radahn as the defending party win the exchange, a phyrric victory, but a victory noneless, since he only need to survive and fend of the invading forces.

Malenia didnt achieve any of the possible goals pursued. So thats defeat, no matter how one try to argue.

The day i decide to use tiktok, use cringe expresions like chad, gigachad or the like, will be the day i remove my eyes and tongue. I dont have anything against any character or any personal grief or blind hatred or love to any character of the game. And for the record, Ng+7 player here, with a semi-legic farmed 713 level character on ps4 with God knows how many hours of playtime.
                            > The fact that, a super invasive apocalypthic disasters hasnt consume the whole Caelid by the time our Tarnished appears, shows the power, discipline and organization of the Redmanes.

It does, again what the fuck are you talking about? There isn't a single place in Caelid free from the Rot besides a single tiny cave found underground.

>Finlay ashes clearly state that there were basically no survivors, but them we see the Redmanes contain the Rott for hundreds or thousands of years until our arrival.

It says that there were few survivors, not none. 

>Now compare the few soldiers the Halitree has and the decrepit state of Miquella realm, litteraly falling appart. That looks like a victorious party to you?

I didn't say they won, I said it was a stalemate that ended in no victor. The story trailer even states, what exactly do you think that means?

>Then they show a lone cleanrot knight charging a kneeling Radanh. Seeing the whole context of the scenario, and all writen lore, that was Finlay charging to save Malenia, and i take that as a fact

All written lore states that the battle ended immediately with the Aeonia and pretty much annhilated everything. Radahn straight up retreats from the battle, as the it happens in the heart of Aeonia. This is objective fact, whether it happend later or sooner is unknown but at some point he had to leave.

>he woke uo before Malenia no matter what, so without Finlay, her fate was sealed.

Prove it

>Malenia didnt achieve any of the possible goals pursued. So thats defeat, no matter how one try to argue.

The Redmanes themselves consider themselves to have lost Caelid lol

>When they were driven to defeat by Malenia's scarlet rot, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve.
>"Alas, dear home, I shan't see you again! For our duty is to remain here, a bulwark against the blight."

You're literally arguing against the game
                    > you can see post bloom Radahn, rotting but still standing, roaring alone in the battlefield to the sky.

This could be right after the bloom, or days after the bloom. We don't know.
It also could be the battlefield in the trailer, or the desert we fight him at later.

He absolutely could have fallen unconscious atop his horse, and Leonard ran off from the rot.
Or Radahn himself could have fled the bloom while Malenia was still awake. We don't know because we lack info. I would defer to the game, which states multiple times that it was a draw.

>Even more, you can also see in the trailer a lone Cleanrot knight attacking an alone Radahn, most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

Go watch the trailer of thier fight.
He has multiple clean rot spears in his back, implying he had already fought several before the clash.
It could have easily been one of them.
Additional, can you actually imagine Finley carrying Malenia away from Radahn? A flying, horse riding general with a godamn artillery level bow?

>Whatever were Malenia goals with Caelid invasions it was a complete strategical and tactical failure.

It was to reach Radahn and take his rune, which she did in fact do.

> Her army got decimated to the point of no survivors.

Patently not true, as several survivors are found spread throughout Caelid.
Also:
"Finlay was one of the few survivors of the Battle of Aeonia"
That's both sides baby. Both armies were decimated. 

>the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

I'll let Jerren handle this one:


"I am Jerren. Foolish old warrior, and witness. Incidentally, do you like a good festival,  from time to time? Well, it's true, this fortress houses only the vanquished. But when the stars align, we celebrate."

Here is the redmane armor set.

"When they were driven to defeat by Malenia's scarlet rot, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve."

They lost, and given that thier were "few survivors" and the fight wasn't at the castle, we can assume the redmanes we see weren't at the battle of Aeonia.

>were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

Its a little suspicious that there were no forts in the path of an invading army headed to the capital.
Sure are a lot of ruins in thier path though....hmmm

>and whats more important, they kept Radanh great rune safe.

Its because he had it on him and fucked off to the desert. His army had nothing to do with it.

>So calling her adventure in Caelid a stalemate or a victory is plain preposterous.

The game and story trailer disagree.

>It was an decisive defeat that erased any kind of military influese of the Halitree.

The haligtree definitely still has soldiers in higher comfort, number, and Calibur then Caelid.

>But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision.

Pure speculation, as we don't know when Malenia fell unconscious, nor when Radahn left.
He could have fled the pain of her Aonea in his madness, and she could have been to week to chase him, but we literally do not know.

> Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid,

Very very wierd understanding of what "secure" means.
Cealid is a hell hole that belongs to the children of rot, the redmanes are cornered, broken, and leaderles. 

Let's just agree the game and its creators are right, it was a draw for both powers.
                Okay if you wanna suggest holding stars in the sly don’t take at least some level of power and doesn’t limit his strength AT ALL then there’s also nothing in the lore that states that her blindness and prosthetics limit her power either. You say she was rotten and near death or something as if she was weakened, she was born like that, even if she was weakened so what? What’s your point? We’re talking about malenia vs radahn and that’s simply how malenia is. If you wanna talk about an imporved version of her then sure maybe she would’ve won but i don’t get the point. It’s whoever fought who on the battlefield.

No you’re not getting technical, you’re getting silly. Radahn was bat shit insane but still very much standing and would’ve killed knocked out malenia of a random knight didn’t save her and took her home where she would continue to be in the coma.


“Radahn was much larger” idk since when size and mass mattered in soulsborne games or lore but omay. Also magic supplements? That’s his powers, you wanted him to not use them while fighting malenia? “And still couldn’t kill her” like i said already he would’ve because he was the conscious one, malenia got saved by third party.

Malenia can’t beat radahn, explodes so she can st least do something, gets her srmy destroyed, fails to accomplish anything other than give radahn brain damage i guess, falls into coma and gets saved by her knight. And even after that, radahn is still holding stars in the sky like the absolute chad he is. Also your argument about “he would’ve deactivated while fighting” is invalid, because he was clearly doing that for an important reason. He obviously didn’t learn gravity magic to not crush his horse, he had a very important goal. Some theories include protecting lands in between from outer creatures etc. so no he wouldn’t and he didn’t, even after having his brain rotten. A true Legend if I’ve ever seen one.
Unless your HORAH LOUX, WARRIOR!
I canon everything i like
Actually, before becoming the godess of rot, she is mostly being devoured by it. And putting alloyed gold prosthesis made it to slow down the rot
Rob builds got to him, understandably
Hasn't stopped people in the past
Because hE LoVEd HiS hOrSE sO MUch
I think if that fight continued somebody would've lost for the very first time. We only see him fight her without using all he's got. She used her rot transformation and still he wasn't using anything crazy. The rot got to him and thats when the tarnished comes in. He fights the tarnished at his best with rot. So definitely not 100%
    He dosen't have anything crazy. Astels meteor storm is astels and malenia could easily dodge his comet dive. There's really nothing crazy. He's just brute strength and willpower.
    You don't know that he wasn't using anything crazy. The trailer, if we even accept it as a source of content, only shows the beginning and the end of their fight; and from what little we do see, Radahn *was* using his sorcery from the start. All we can say without doubt is that he didn't let go of the stars, but we don't know if that would even have helped him, since when he dies none of them fall anywhere near Aeonia, nor does maintaining this control seem to limit his other spellcasting even when he's rotten. Certainly Radahn is badly weakened when *we* fight him, but if we can beat Malenia we can beat him in his prime.
        Is there source of malenia in her prime when fighting tarnished?
            No, but there's little reason to think she wasn't. Her missing limbs and her blindness appear to predate the Shattering (or at least her war against Radahn, since Miquella made her prosthetics), she has no other obvious wounds or conditions weakening her, and she even blooms and ascends to godhood during the fight. By contrast, Radahn was obviously a shadow of his former self as of the game.
A spell to nullify your scent and talisman to reduce sound while walking and her good arm tied behind her back and I'd still need 2 summons and 13 furled finger callers to get the dub. Can she also sense my tears ?
    Believe in yourself friend, all you need is time and the willpower to walk that fog 500+ times and anything is possible.

~Signed someone dumb enough to make the leap from cheesing her with Mohg's spear to doing her hitless in melee

                A year or so later, your comment taught me a wondrous insult. Thank you skeleton
                    no problem lol
            I appreciated his response. May not have asked but it was welcome.
    I was surprised when I beat her on my 20th try during my bow only run
she can taste the salt in the air
40th?  Who do you think I am?  Some pro gamer?
Heh, first time I did her with mimic tear and blasphemous blade, thought "what is everyone talking about? She's not so bad." In another playthrough, did her with no summons on a pure str build with greatsword, and thought, "OK, now I see what everyone is talking about."

I haven't, did you try it out? Did we discover something ?
    I wish ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
Love the art, even if not consistent with lore :)  

yellow eyes are more a frenzied flame sign.  You get such also in your character if going that path.  But.. who knows who the 3 fingers gave free hugs too :). Maybe her too.  Fell god is associated with eyes and red hair.. prosthetic legs.. arms.. eyes? in helmet?  

Placing is also most likely near big rot tree outside castle, where the black knives have crossbows.  The invisibility of black knives would be useless against the blind, but the cross bows might even out the fight out a bit.  I Wonder if it was an ambush involved in the fight too?  But head canon guess.
    >yellow eyes are more a frenzied flame sign.

Iirc every non-tarnished human has yellow eyes. Millicent has yellow eyes for example, and I think Kenneth has them too, but I'm not sure.
        iirc those directly tied with the Erdtree in some way have eyes of gold (Melina, Marika, Godfrey, etc)

Kenneth does have gold eyes, as does Millicent


looking at [more here,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu_Q9TwF5Xc) Sellen doesn't have gold eyes in either of her bodies, but she also isn't directly tied to Marika/Radagon at all
        I thought it was tied to being able to see the guidance of grace
            It's tied to the grace imbued in the non-Tarnished. Godfrey's eyes "dulled" when he lost the grace of the Erdtree and became the first Tarnished. The gold eyes never returned, even after the guidance of grace did.
I was talking about this with someone the other day. It's a consistent theme for From games to have strong/important disabled characters. Maybe it's because I have a disability but it always stood out to me.
    I mean, in from soft games pretty much EVERYONE is disabled in some way, so yeah
    I do love characters like that, sad that it's overshadowed by WATERFOWL DANCE 

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
        Waterfowl Dance? I think you meam Fowl Play *Badum tss*
            Waterfoul dance? I think you mean AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
her disability IS part of her power lol
>IGNORE ME


I don't think I will >:)
Thank you! I was thinking about making another comic but I’m quite uncertain about the topic. I would love to do a Rennala/Radagon one!
Thoughts?
    I think that would be very interesting, they met during the war and fell in love they had children and radagon left her for Marika. 

Visually Renalla is probably the only demigod which doesn’t look weathered but how did Radagon look when he isn’t fused with Marika and crumbling so to speak. 

That’s all the context I can think off.

I just really like your artstyle and even if it isn’t lore accurate ( which shouldn’t matter in the souls franchise ) it’s your interpretation and I’d love to see more.
        Thank you so much for the suggestion🥹✨
I don't get why this got a few downvotes
Malenia's the kind of girl to pull out a shotgun in a street fist fight when it goes wrong
    Yep worse she doesn't kill you just takes your shins
*Proceed to recover from the battle while Radahn became a mindless corpse*
    *Both proceed to get clapped by a random nameless tarnished*

General Grievous: "Ah,yes, the negotiator!"
        Nowadays Fromsoft bosses should know that if a random naked dude with a club enters the arena, the boss is going to be fucked.
            Radagon: "I seek to repair the Elden Ring, and you won't stop me!"
Tarnished: "You're talking mad shit for someone in unga bunga range :')"
                I think the line would be more like "I seek to repair the-" "UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA"
                    Correct!
to be a zombie for me is to be dead
    His body is alive, his mind is just fucked. Therefore not dead.
    He's not a zombie, he just lost reason. He still retains all his skills, he still held back the stars and he still loves his horse
*casts Mississippi River of Blood
Put them foolish ambitions to rest y’all.
I honestly think "with great power comes great responsibility" works a lot better than "with great power must come great responsibility".  It implies that the power and the responsibility are a package deal, and you don't have a choice in the matter.  That when you accept that power, you automatically accept the burden that comes along with it.  Also rolls off the tongue better.
    The original already drove that message home, as the tone of the original line necessitates that they are both a package (kind of like saying with storms comes rain or lightning, that they come *together*). With great power, comes great responsibility, the implication being when you have great power, there is an inherent responsibility with owning it, including the must only serves to make the line more clunky.
        Yeah I know, I'm agreeing.  I'm saying the "must" is unnecessary

Y'all stop downvoting this mf, it IS separate until she clips it into the arm socket
Caelid Mojave what’s the difference practical the same thing
    Caelid is basically just Cali, hell it even sounds similar
The point of her saying that is most likely to do with her rot and endless fight for sanity and control of her own body and destiny. Like if a cancer patient says they haven't lost yet. Only killing her allows her to let go of the pride keeping her alive. Honestly I see it as resolve beyond anyone else in the game
Radahn likely would've eaten Malenia's unconscious body if it weren't for Finely removing her from the scene. He could've also dropped the stars on top of Malenia's head and end it there, but he probably didn't want to destroy Caleid in the process.
    He was holding the stars back. He was not aiming them like a bazooka.
Well Radahn did actually die, completely lost his mind and turned into a zombie. I’d say that 100% trumps that.
    Radahn is not a fuckimg zombie. My Man's been out here surviving with a plague that kills people in minutes for an age. And you have the nerve to call h a zombie, when *there are literal zombies in the game that he looks nothing like.*
        He basically it. The OP was talking about his sense of self, which is entirely gone from him. He just mindlessly munches on corpses and roams around. He has 0 sentience left in him.
            He maintains enough control to:

A) Not kill and eat the fresh meat he's sitting on.

B)  Hold the stars locked in place. 

Neither of which improve his immediate chances of survival, and one of them is actively detrimental.
Nor has his will eroded enough to be malleable.

The man is clearly insane, but a zombie he is not.
                You can still be basically a "zombie" and do things strongly associated with your life. Like muscle memory. Its likely he didn't need to exert much conscious power for the stars once he was done with his initial conquest and his horse is clearly something very deeply ingrained. He can't talk, he can't reason, he is running on instinct and basic functions that were strong enough in his life to be done automatically. He is a living zombie.
        You’ve clearly never watched any zombie films. He acts exactly the same. He howls at the moon and eats the corpses of friends and foe alike. This is not the behaviour of a person, it’s the behaviour of a thing that acts on complete instinct. Ergo Radahn is dead. All that’s left is a mindless instinct husk. Hence the entire reason for the festival.

I know you can’t bare the thought that Radahn got reduced to such a pitiful state but those are the facts. And cause I know your going to mention his horse. He spends all his time on it, learned magic just to ride it and his been on it so much it’s basically an extension of his body, like his swords, he isn’t eating his swords is he? Then he ain’t eating his method of travel.
    Nope, you actually kill him.. the whole point of the festival was to finally kill him and give him a glorious death in battle.
        So when a person turns into a a zombie they aren’t considered dead?

If you wanna get technical the body that is Radahn is alive but that actual person that was Radahn is objectively dead, and no amount of downvotes from salty Radahn dickriders can convince me otherwise.
            Dude, you are the one making up things calling him zombie. Everything i claim is backed up by in-game lore, and for what I remember nowhere was mentioned that radahn is a zombie, nor that whoever affected by scarlet rot becomes one. It may be as you say, as it may not. From my point of view he is clinging to life, he's just that resilient that even scarlet rot cant fully kill him.. it took his sanity, but not his body.

Edit: just to be clear it is canon that a zombie is someone who comes back from the world of the dead
                I find it ironic you mention in-game lore when you ignore it. The scarlet rot can’t fully kill him, or anyone, because there is no death in the lands between. Since the rune got stolen. Hence why you mostly you see those zombie-like wandering nobles, knights and every other mob. No one dying of old age. Just rotting and decomposing.

Pay attention man.
                    First, a zombie is someone who comes back to life meaning that one must die first, and as you just said radahn didn't die hence he can't be one. Second zombie-like is not the same as zombie. Third, by your logic (person dies, if comes back he automatically is a zombie) the tarnished do die and comes back to life, since is not affected by the golden order, so you must be saying we are actually zombies?
                        Straight up false, lie after lie. Zombies aren’t always shown to die first then resurrect. They turn after being bitten too, they don’t need to die. Examples are the zombies in black summer or WWZ.

Point is after changing they are no longer considered alive and the person they once were gone. Thus dead. This is the concept you and others are not grasping.

Tarnished are dead and then brought back by the grace. they are not undead.
The same can be said for Radahn though. Had he not evacuated the heart of aeonia, he would have been 100% killed by Commander O'Neil and cleanrot knights who still are present at heart of aeonia to this day.
    To my knowledge they actually tried to kill him but didn't manage to.. you can see they skewered him like a shish kebab but still didn't manage to kill him. Anyway he's not bitching about being undefeated
        Well he can't talk lol.
[deleted]
    So what if the AOE of scarlet aeonia was a *little* big for a 1v1?
I think it stopped being a duel when she nuke the country and her boys started stabbing Radahn so she could be carried home.

If her knights weren't there she would have died.
But Scarlet Rot isn't her demigod power tho? That's a curse from Outer God, and she controls scarlet rot as much as you can control HIV. You can only spread it and make everyone miserable, including yourself.

I agree that neither won tho, both terribly lost. Malenia unleashing her curse had to be worsened her state and bring her close to became God of Rot avatar whatever. And as badass she is in that state – she is not herself anymore.
    Eh, we’re splitting hairs at this point. The comparison to HIV is pretty funny, but I think it would be more directly comparable to Morgott’s omen curse. During the fight with Morgott when he releases the power of the omen curse he blames it on you, implying that he didn’t want to release the curse. However, he still wields the power that the curse gives him all the same to fuck the player character’s shit up. At that point, putting the emphasis on the source of Morgott’s newfound strength and power is kinda silly when he’s using that strength and power greatly to his benefit in combat, especially since that power was always there, hiding just beneath the surface. We can say something similar about Melania.
        No no, I didn't mean that scarlet rot can't be called her power, she can wield it alright and resemblance with Morgott is quite obvious. I just wanted to put emphasis on the factor that utilizing your curse as a weapon hits both sides of the conflict and brings harm beyond control of the cursed one, as opposed to natural powers like Radahn gravity magic.

Its more of an argument against statement that Radahn ultimately lost the battle because his mind was eaten by rot. But I believe that Malenia's bloom was more of the "screw both of us".
            I don't know if I'd call learned alien magic natural powers
Nah. Malenia was the avatar of an outer god as well as being a demigod. Radahn did extremely well considering he didn't have the powers of an ethereal being to back him up. Just him, his magic, and his belief in the golden order.
    Ok? Yes, Radahn did very well - he fought someone who is undefeated to a statemate and survived her onslaught. But that doesn’t mean he won. I’m confused how a demigod and avatar of a god using their demigod and avatar of god powers means the other guy won, especially when we can see the aftermath in the game and Radahn certainly didn’t win.

Was it unfair, dishonorable, and immoral on Malenia’s part? Absolutely. But that’s kind of irrelevant to whether or not Radahn won, now isn’t it?
    Lmao, Malenia was blind, rotted, limbs lost and was only using her blade until she bloomed.

Radahn was healthy, much larger, had gravity magic and home turf advantage and STILL couldn’t win.
        Malenia is also an Empyrean, and Radahn isn't. Nuked an entire country, yet he was still standing while she went nappy time for a few millenia. Granted , he went cray cray, but remained standing and earned the undying respect of his men. Malenia? Alone in a chair lmao.
            Being an Empyrean has nothing to do with a person strength and adds nothing. It’s just a title given to people chosen by the fingers as potential rulers.

His body was still there, his mind wasn’t. Radahn quite literally died after that nuke. Mindless and with a country in ruins. Whilst Malenia retains her sanity, her powers and actually becomes more powerful than he could ever dream of during our fight with her.
                Malenia retaining her sanity is contradicted by Milicent's dialogue during her quest. Malenia no longer has, quote "will, dignity, or sense of self."

She can speak, and remembers her name. But she's not sane.
                    Well she is rotted to shit and we know exactly what the rot does at its worst from Radahn. So yeah probably. But she was in a hell of a better state than Radahn, that isn’t up for debate.
                        Malenia had a needle that keep her from having stage 6 cancer while radahn didn’t had sht, and even in madness and agony he managed to keep protecting the lands between from galactic threats  like astel. So yeah I’m the match between malenia ain’t sht.
    Even if this is the argument you want to make Radahn couldn't really beat a half rotted, amputated, and blinded Demigod. The avatar of an outer God is what  simply ended their stalemate.
        Okay? That half-rotted blind amputee was still the best swordswoman in the world. Holding her at bay while holding up the literal night sky is more of a nod to his skill.
    When people  downvote you for being right. Truly says a lot about reddit :')
        Truly a redditor moment.
            Sweaty downvoters go brrrr
This is an underrated comment right here
I can immediately smell a thread turning into a shit show whenever these 2 characters are brought up. It's been a year and people still want to argue with the lore.
Oh for sure, I just like Gideon because he has no incentive in being biased. Dude is obsessed with being correct on all things in the Lands Between
    True that.
Yeah. But honestly I have a feeling Miquella may not as be as kindly as we think. The bewitching branch description is, well.... sus. Would not be surprised if DLC reveals he orchestrated his own kidnapping or some crazy shit like that. Like he was play 5D chess while Mohg, Malenia, and everyone else were playing checkers. I could of course, definitely be wrong but that's my running theory.
Also acceptable: Rage quit
There are multiple points in the lore where it is said it was a stalemate with no winner. This cannot be respectfully disagreed upon. So it’s kinda irrelevant what “seems like a loss” to who. It is said many times that there was no winner and no loser. This point cannot be argued regardless of what people may think. Also, nowhere is it said that Radahn “still stood while Malenia fell unconscious”.
>Radahn still stood

Thats pure speculation.
He could have just as easily crumpled on top of his horse and been carried away as well.
He also could have had to retreat from the constant scarlet rot emanating from the bloom to not die.

I severely doubt Finley could have gotten anywhere close if Radahn was  nearby and conscious, so he either ran away, or was unconscious himself.
If he could’ve killed her, then he would’ve. I’d say being driven insane, and essentially an animal equates to a loss. Neither of them won, but they both lost.
Radahn was home, he didn't have to go anywhere. The Haligtree is an age away. We also don't know the immediate state of the battlefield post bloom. I find it hard to believe Radahn was in any shape to fight in the immediate aftermath.
>Yes she rotted his mind but in the ebd he was still standing

What item, npc, or text says that? I can also make baseless speculation, like he was knocked unconscious as well, or he ran away from the flower emanating a death field.
Either way, "still standing" is not how you win in a fight to the death.

>The mental gymnastics people do to try to spin the fight in such a way that Malenia won is hilarious.

She didn't win you dingus, it was a draw.
It literally says it IN THE GAME by not only sword graves, item descriptions, and the story trailer, but by a gUY named Gideon Ofnir, THE ALL KNOWING.
Except she never got bitch slapped at all, we know of literally no damage done to her from Radahn apart from her stabbing herself with her own blade to induce a bloom. So you are straight up lying there. 

Radahn got quite literally turned into a zombie and thus died. Aswell as his entire country being turned into a wasteland. She permanently took him out of the throne contention and put his foolish ambition to rest. Biggest, fattest L of the shattering.

Whereas Malenia wakes up later completely fine and ascends to an even higher power than he ever achieved.

Battle was stalemate but Radahn was objectively way worse off. Not even remotely up for debate.
    It IS stated that she had to be carried away from the battlefield. Keep coping lmao.
        And it IS stated that Radahn completed lost his mind and turned into a beast that eats friend and foe alike. YOU keep coping hahahahaahha
            Well yes. I never stated otherwise. All I said is that NOBODY won, while you insisted that she won, while taking a look at Finlay's Ashes proves you wrong. No need to act like a 12 yr old just because you didn't know as much of how it went down as you thought you did :,) Truly maidenless behaviour :') 
Edit: As a little note, the biggest single fat L in shattering history is dropping a nuke on a country and still fail to kill your target. That is the very definition of failure <3
                Finley's ashes only say that she carried the slumbering demigod home and that it was a legendary feat. Not one word is said about Radahn in the immediate aftermath. Both lost because neither fulfilled their objectives (tho no one knows exactly what they were for either side). People can argue that one side or the other came out the better of the exchange though and that is probably the biggest bone of contention. I think most would agree that the battle itself was a stalemate but what happened after and the longer term affects are up in the air.
                Dude you are the one replying to multiple comments of mine so it’s clear who is really immature and unable to let go lmao.

As I have explained but your brain is obviously too rotted to comprehend. She did kill him. His mind rotted and he turned into a zombie. Literally by that very definition he is dead. Keep. Coping.
                    Yet another dumb take easily disproven. He is still very much alive, very limited rationality, but still alive and kicking. If his mind was 100% gone (or dead dead, as you so obnoxiously keep insisting on) there would be 2 very important happenings. 
1-He wouldn't give a shit about his horse anymore, yet he still keeps it safe.
2-The stars would have resumed their movement, as , y'know, Blaidd and Selen straight up tell you.
Feeling that copium overdose yet?  :')
                        And this is also very easily disproven. If locking the stars was a conscious effort that held him back, why didn’t he release it when fighting Malenia to ensure a win, or against the tarnished and the other warriors? Surely if he wanted to keep them locked so much he would do anything to ensure he doesn’t die? The fact that he didn’t pretty much obliterates your argument. He ain’t alive and kicking as he quite literally is undead. Quite literally if you’d pain any attention to the lore at all. AAAAAAAND he has no feet with which to kick, hahaha.

Also as to the horse point, guy literally learned magic so he could ride it, was on it all the time to the point where it would no longer be a conscious effort on his part. Horse was literally a part of his body and since we don’t see him eating his own body, that’s another part of your argument destroyed.

How’s that copium build up? Must be bursting at the seems right now lmao.
    and you're the one who says anything about mental gymnastics? no damage done to her? we literally see radahn letting her pick up her prosthesis from the ground to be honorable and then she proceeds to nuke a continent but still fails to kill radahn or get what she wanted. keep in mind radahn is doing all of this while still holding the stars in the sky and even after he gets turned into a "zombie" he still doesn't stop doing that, ever. also if you know lore you know that malenia didn't only take a nap and wake up completely fine few hours later lol. she was literally saved by a scarlet rot knight. it's stated, word by word, that she was literally SAVED by a knight who showed great bravery. yes literally it was a stalemate but if you really do wanna get technical, radahn fights her with honor while controlling stars in the sky, she nukes a continent, gives radahn alzhimers and nearly dies herself if she didn't get saved, goes into a coma while radahn still stands, damaged, but still stands. it's clear radahn is the stronger demigod idk how this is even a debate.
        Prosthetic is a prosthetic. It’s not her actual body. 

There is nothing in lore that states that holding the stars back limits his power, find proof of that, I’ll wait. If it actually limited him he would have deactivated it to beat Malenia, or us when we fight him.

If we wanna get REALLY technical Radahn immediately falls to the ground after the bloom. You seen this literally in the cutscene before you fight him, so no he wasn’t still standing.

Malenia was rotted to fuck, blind, lost limbs and only used her blade till she bloomed. Whereas Radahn was healthy, much larger, had magic to supplement his swords and had home advantage and STILL couldn’t kill her AND had his entire country ruined. One Aeonia put him out the game forever, literally only a small part of her power finished him. It’s clear who the stronger demigod is because she literally becomes a Goddess when we fight her. You clearly pay no attention whatsoever hahahahah
            Not wanting to enter into the debate but there are a few facts you are ignoring. 

1- Radanh never falls to the bloom. Since all Elden Ring media is canon, if you watch the 2019 annoucememt trailer you can see post bloom Radahn, rotting but still standing, roaring alone in the battlefield to the sky. Even more, you can also see in the trailer a lone Cleanrot knight attacking an alone Radahn, most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

2- Radahn is the defender, Malenia the aggressor. Whatever were Malenia goals with Caelid invasions it was a complete strategical and tactical failure. Her army got decimated to the point of no survivors. On the other part, the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured  and whats more important, they kept Radanh great rune safe. So calling her adventure in Caelid a stalemate or a victory is plain preposterous. It was an decisive defeat that erased any kind of military influese of the Halitree. The Redmanes stood standing against the rot, hurted, but with enough power to keep all their land under control, with a sizable and well organiced army. 

The 1v1 is debatable. Its state clearly that it was a draw, so no winners in the direrct confrontation. 

But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision. Only Finlay prevent  her gruesome death. I wouldnt call that a stalemate neither a victory for obvous reasons. 

Sumarizing: Malenia goals unachieved, her army completely anhinilated, 1v1 duel ends in draw, her target rotten but alive so Miquellas fate still frozen, Radanh great rune was not retrieved, Miquella was not founded, Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid, and even celebrate festivals in the name of their leader.

Veredic: total defeat, with no goals achieved.
                >On the other part, the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

They don't at all? Did you miss how they're all backed up at Redmane Castle barely holding off the wildlife? The Rot has also spread past the flaming walls, and the entire land is uninhabitable. Fort Faroth is completely abandoned, Sellia is a ghost town (literally) and there's ruins everywhere. What are you even talking about?

>The Redmanes stood standing against the rot, hurted, but with enough power to keep all their land under control, with a sizable and well organiced army.

Again what the fuck are you talking about? Have you seen Caelid? Does that look under control to you? And there's still Cleanrot Knights in the Aeonia Swamp.

>But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision.

There is zero evidence for that, Radahn isn't even found at where the bloom took place, it happened in the Aeonian Swamp while the story trailer shows the dunes. At some point he must've left to his castle.

>most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

Finlay survived all the way to the Haligtree

>Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision

Headcanon, post an item description proving he was still conscious. 

>Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid, and even celebrate festivals in the name of their leader.

I'm seriously convinced you haven't actually played the game and just watch Gigachad Radahn tiktok edits, NOTHING about Caelid is secure, and the festival is just a pretense to quite literally Old Yeller Radahn and put him out of his misery.
                    The annoucement trailer of 2019 shows you Post-bloom Radanh standing alone, kneeling and roaring at the sky, covered in rott, in the same battlefield were he tank the scarlet aeonia. Then they show a lone cleanrot knight charging a kneeling Radanh. Seeing the whole context of the scenario, and all writen lore, that was Finlay charging to save Malenia, and i take that as a fact. It makes sense, since is a fact that Malenia was out of cold after the Bloom, and all the puzzle pieces match. Even if Radanh also got invoncious, he woke uo before Malenia no matter what, so without Finlay, her fate was sealed. 

Also, Redmane army end the war with enough man power to build numerous barriers, walls and other fortifications to try to stop the rot. That requieres a level of organization that a destroyed army couldnt achieve. We have to remember that the war happens god knows when. The fact that, a super invasive apocalypthic disasters hasnt consume the whole Caelid by the time our Tarnished appears, shows the power, discipline and organization of the Redmanes. Now compare the few soldiers the Halitree has and the decrepit state of Miquella realm, litteraly falling appart. That looks like a victorious party to you? Finlay ashes clearly state that there were basically no survivors, but them we see the Redmanes contain the Rott for hundreds or thousands of years until our arrival. At the end there were more Redmanes than Halitree troops, so as i said before, the military campaing was a failure.

As i said before, i wont enter in an heated debate since is pointless. The 1v1 was a stalemate, as the All-Knowing said. But from a military point of view, Radahn as the defending party win the exchange, a phyrric victory, but a victory noneless, since he only need to survive and fend of the invading forces.

Malenia didnt achieve any of the possible goals pursued. So thats defeat, no matter how one try to argue.

The day i decide to use tiktok, use cringe expresions like chad, gigachad or the like, will be the day i remove my eyes and tongue. I dont have anything against any character or any personal grief or blind hatred or love to any character of the game. And for the record, Ng+7 player here, with a semi-legic farmed 713 level character on ps4 with God knows how many hours of playtime.
                        > The fact that, a super invasive apocalypthic disasters hasnt consume the whole Caelid by the time our Tarnished appears, shows the power, discipline and organization of the Redmanes.

It does, again what the fuck are you talking about? There isn't a single place in Caelid free from the Rot besides a single tiny cave found underground.

>Finlay ashes clearly state that there were basically no survivors, but them we see the Redmanes contain the Rott for hundreds or thousands of years until our arrival.

It says that there were few survivors, not none. 

>Now compare the few soldiers the Halitree has and the decrepit state of Miquella realm, litteraly falling appart. That looks like a victorious party to you?

I didn't say they won, I said it was a stalemate that ended in no victor. The story trailer even states, what exactly do you think that means?

>Then they show a lone cleanrot knight charging a kneeling Radanh. Seeing the whole context of the scenario, and all writen lore, that was Finlay charging to save Malenia, and i take that as a fact

All written lore states that the battle ended immediately with the Aeonia and pretty much annhilated everything. Radahn straight up retreats from the battle, as the it happens in the heart of Aeonia. This is objective fact, whether it happend later or sooner is unknown but at some point he had to leave.

>he woke uo before Malenia no matter what, so without Finlay, her fate was sealed.

Prove it

>Malenia didnt achieve any of the possible goals pursued. So thats defeat, no matter how one try to argue.

The Redmanes themselves consider themselves to have lost Caelid lol

>When they were driven to defeat by Malenia's scarlet rot, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve.
>"Alas, dear home, I shan't see you again! For our duty is to remain here, a bulwark against the blight."

You're literally arguing against the game
                > you can see post bloom Radahn, rotting but still standing, roaring alone in the battlefield to the sky.

This could be right after the bloom, or days after the bloom. We don't know.
It also could be the battlefield in the trailer, or the desert we fight him at later.

He absolutely could have fallen unconscious atop his horse, and Leonard ran off from the rot.
Or Radahn himself could have fled the bloom while Malenia was still awake. We don't know because we lack info. I would defer to the game, which states multiple times that it was a draw.

>Even more, you can also see in the trailer a lone Cleanrot knight attacking an alone Radahn, most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

Go watch the trailer of thier fight.
He has multiple clean rot spears in his back, implying he had already fought several before the clash.
It could have easily been one of them.
Additional, can you actually imagine Finley carrying Malenia away from Radahn? A flying, horse riding general with a godamn artillery level bow?

>Whatever were Malenia goals with Caelid invasions it was a complete strategical and tactical failure.

It was to reach Radahn and take his rune, which she did in fact do.

> Her army got decimated to the point of no survivors.

Patently not true, as several survivors are found spread throughout Caelid.
Also:
"Finlay was one of the few survivors of the Battle of Aeonia"
That's both sides baby. Both armies were decimated. 

>the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

I'll let Jerren handle this one:


"I am Jerren. Foolish old warrior, and witness. Incidentally, do you like a good festival,  from time to time? Well, it's true, this fortress houses only the vanquished. But when the stars align, we celebrate."

Here is the redmane armor set.

"When they were driven to defeat by Malenia's scarlet rot, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve."

They lost, and given that thier were "few survivors" and the fight wasn't at the castle, we can assume the redmanes we see weren't at the battle of Aeonia.

>were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

Its a little suspicious that there were no forts in the path of an invading army headed to the capital.
Sure are a lot of ruins in thier path though....hmmm

>and whats more important, they kept Radanh great rune safe.

Its because he had it on him and fucked off to the desert. His army had nothing to do with it.

>So calling her adventure in Caelid a stalemate or a victory is plain preposterous.

The game and story trailer disagree.

>It was an decisive defeat that erased any kind of military influese of the Halitree.

The haligtree definitely still has soldiers in higher comfort, number, and Calibur then Caelid.

>But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision.

Pure speculation, as we don't know when Malenia fell unconscious, nor when Radahn left.
He could have fled the pain of her Aonea in his madness, and she could have been to week to chase him, but we literally do not know.

> Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid,

Very very wierd understanding of what "secure" means.
Cealid is a hell hole that belongs to the children of rot, the redmanes are cornered, broken, and leaderles. 

Let's just agree the game and its creators are right, it was a draw for both powers.
            Okay if you wanna suggest holding stars in the sly don’t take at least some level of power and doesn’t limit his strength AT ALL then there’s also nothing in the lore that states that her blindness and prosthetics limit her power either. You say she was rotten and near death or something as if she was weakened, she was born like that, even if she was weakened so what? What’s your point? We’re talking about malenia vs radahn and that’s simply how malenia is. If you wanna talk about an imporved version of her then sure maybe she would’ve won but i don’t get the point. It’s whoever fought who on the battlefield.

No you’re not getting technical, you’re getting silly. Radahn was bat shit insane but still very much standing and would’ve killed knocked out malenia of a random knight didn’t save her and took her home where she would continue to be in the coma.


“Radahn was much larger” idk since when size and mass mattered in soulsborne games or lore but omay. Also magic supplements? That’s his powers, you wanted him to not use them while fighting malenia? “And still couldn’t kill her” like i said already he would’ve because he was the conscious one, malenia got saved by third party.

Malenia can’t beat radahn, explodes so she can st least do something, gets her srmy destroyed, fails to accomplish anything other than give radahn brain damage i guess, falls into coma and gets saved by her knight. And even after that, radahn is still holding stars in the sky like the absolute chad he is. Also your argument about “he would’ve deactivated while fighting” is invalid, because he was clearly doing that for an important reason. He obviously didn’t learn gravity magic to not crush his horse, he had a very important goal. Some theories include protecting lands in between from outer creatures etc. so no he wouldn’t and he didn’t, even after having his brain rotten. A true Legend if I’ve ever seen one.
He dosen't have anything crazy. Astels meteor storm is astels and malenia could easily dodge his comet dive. There's really nothing crazy. He's just brute strength and willpower.
You don't know that he wasn't using anything crazy. The trailer, if we even accept it as a source of content, only shows the beginning and the end of their fight; and from what little we do see, Radahn *was* using his sorcery from the start. All we can say without doubt is that he didn't let go of the stars, but we don't know if that would even have helped him, since when he dies none of them fall anywhere near Aeonia, nor does maintaining this control seem to limit his other spellcasting even when he's rotten. Certainly Radahn is badly weakened when *we* fight him, but if we can beat Malenia we can beat him in his prime.
    Is there source of malenia in her prime when fighting tarnished?
        No, but there's little reason to think she wasn't. Her missing limbs and her blindness appear to predate the Shattering (or at least her war against Radahn, since Miquella made her prosthetics), she has no other obvious wounds or conditions weakening her, and she even blooms and ascends to godhood during the fight. By contrast, Radahn was obviously a shadow of his former self as of the game.
Believe in yourself friend, all you need is time and the willpower to walk that fog 500+ times and anything is possible.

>yellow eyes are more a frenzied flame sign.

Iirc every non-tarnished human has yellow eyes. Millicent has yellow eyes for example, and I think Kenneth has them too, but I'm not sure.
    iirc those directly tied with the Erdtree in some way have eyes of gold (Melina, Marika, Godfrey, etc)

Kenneth does have gold eyes, as does Millicent


looking at [more here,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu_Q9TwF5Xc) Sellen doesn't have gold eyes in either of her bodies, but she also isn't directly tied to Marika/Radagon at all
    I thought it was tied to being able to see the guidance of grace
        It's tied to the grace imbued in the non-Tarnished. Godfrey's eyes "dulled" when he lost the grace of the Erdtree and became the first Tarnished. The gold eyes never returned, even after the guidance of grace did.
I mean, in from soft games pretty much EVERYONE is disabled in some way, so yeah
I do love characters like that, sad that it's overshadowed by WATERFOWL DANCE 

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    Waterfowl Dance? I think you meam Fowl Play *Badum tss*
        Waterfoul dance? I think you mean AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I think that would be very interesting, they met during the war and fell in love they had children and radagon left her for Marika. 

Visually Renalla is probably the only demigod which doesn’t look weathered but how did Radagon look when he isn’t fused with Marika and crumbling so to speak. 

That’s all the context I can think off.

I just really like your artstyle and even if it isn’t lore accurate ( which shouldn’t matter in the souls franchise ) it’s your interpretation and I’d love to see more.
    Thank you so much for the suggestion🥹✨
Yep worse she doesn't kill you just takes your shins
*Both proceed to get clapped by a random nameless tarnished*

General Grievous: "Ah,yes, the negotiator!"
    Nowadays Fromsoft bosses should know that if a random naked dude with a club enters the arena, the boss is going to be fucked.
        Radagon: "I seek to repair the Elden Ring, and you won't stop me!"
Tarnished: "You're talking mad shit for someone in unga bunga range :')"
            I think the line would be more like "I seek to repair the-" "UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA"
                Correct!
His body is alive, his mind is just fucked. Therefore not dead.
He's not a zombie, he just lost reason. He still retains all his skills, he still held back the stars and he still loves his horse
The original already drove that message home, as the tone of the original line necessitates that they are both a package (kind of like saying with storms comes rain or lightning, that they come *together*). With great power, comes great responsibility, the implication being when you have great power, there is an inherent responsibility with owning it, including the must only serves to make the line more clunky.
    Yeah I know, I'm agreeing.  I'm saying the "must" is unnecessary
        Whoops my bad, not enough coffees here clearly

Good bot
Caelid is basically just Cali, hell it even sounds similar
He was holding the stars back. He was not aiming them like a bazooka.
Radahn is not a fuckimg zombie. My Man's been out here surviving with a plague that kills people in minutes for an age. And you have the nerve to call h a zombie, when *there are literal zombies in the game that he looks nothing like.*
    He basically it. The OP was talking about his sense of self, which is entirely gone from him. He just mindlessly munches on corpses and roams around. He has 0 sentience left in him.
        He maintains enough control to:

A) Not kill and eat the fresh meat he's sitting on.

B)  Hold the stars locked in place. 

Neither of which improve his immediate chances of survival, and one of them is actively detrimental.
Nor has his will eroded enough to be malleable.

The man is clearly insane, but a zombie he is not.
            You can still be basically a "zombie" and do things strongly associated with your life. Like muscle memory. Its likely he didn't need to exert much conscious power for the stars once he was done with his initial conquest and his horse is clearly something very deeply ingrained. He can't talk, he can't reason, he is running on instinct and basic functions that were strong enough in his life to be done automatically. He is a living zombie.
    You’ve clearly never watched any zombie films. He acts exactly the same. He howls at the moon and eats the corpses of friends and foe alike. This is not the behaviour of a person, it’s the behaviour of a thing that acts on complete instinct. Ergo Radahn is dead. All that’s left is a mindless instinct husk. Hence the entire reason for the festival.

I know you can’t bare the thought that Radahn got reduced to such a pitiful state but those are the facts. And cause I know your going to mention his horse. He spends all his time on it, learned magic just to ride it and his been on it so much it’s basically an extension of his body, like his swords, he isn’t eating his swords is he? Then he ain’t eating his method of travel.
Nope, you actually kill him.. the whole point of the festival was to finally kill him and give him a glorious death in battle.
    So when a person turns into a a zombie they aren’t considered dead?

If you wanna get technical the body that is Radahn is alive but that actual person that was Radahn is objectively dead, and no amount of downvotes from salty Radahn dickriders can convince me otherwise.
        Dude, you are the one making up things calling him zombie. Everything i claim is backed up by in-game lore, and for what I remember nowhere was mentioned that radahn is a zombie, nor that whoever affected by scarlet rot becomes one. It may be as you say, as it may not. From my point of view he is clinging to life, he's just that resilient that even scarlet rot cant fully kill him.. it took his sanity, but not his body.

Edit: just to be clear it is canon that a zombie is someone who comes back from the world of the dead
            I find it ironic you mention in-game lore when you ignore it. The scarlet rot can’t fully kill him, or anyone, because there is no death in the lands between. Since the rune got stolen. Hence why you mostly you see those zombie-like wandering nobles, knights and every other mob. No one dying of old age. Just rotting and decomposing.

Pay attention man.
                First, a zombie is someone who comes back to life meaning that one must die first, and as you just said radahn didn't die hence he can't be one. Second zombie-like is not the same as zombie. Third, by your logic (person dies, if comes back he automatically is a zombie) the tarnished do die and comes back to life, since is not affected by the golden order, so you must be saying we are actually zombies?
                    Straight up false, lie after lie. Zombies aren’t always shown to die first then resurrect. They turn after being bitten too, they don’t need to die. Examples are the zombies in black summer or WWZ.

Point is after changing they are no longer considered alive and the person they once were gone. Thus dead. This is the concept you and others are not grasping.

Tarnished are dead and then brought back by the grace. they are not undead.
To my knowledge they actually tried to kill him but didn't manage to.. you can see they skewered him like a shish kebab but still didn't manage to kill him. Anyway he's not bitching about being undefeated
    Well he can't talk lol.
So what if the AOE of scarlet aeonia was a *little* big for a 1v1?
Eh, we’re splitting hairs at this point. The comparison to HIV is pretty funny, but I think it would be more directly comparable to Morgott’s omen curse. During the fight with Morgott when he releases the power of the omen curse he blames it on you, implying that he didn’t want to release the curse. However, he still wields the power that the curse gives him all the same to fuck the player character’s shit up. At that point, putting the emphasis on the source of Morgott’s newfound strength and power is kinda silly when he’s using that strength and power greatly to his benefit in combat, especially since that power was always there, hiding just beneath the surface. We can say something similar about Melania.
    No no, I didn't mean that scarlet rot can't be called her power, she can wield it alright and resemblance with Morgott is quite obvious. I just wanted to put emphasis on the factor that utilizing your curse as a weapon hits both sides of the conflict and brings harm beyond control of the cursed one, as opposed to natural powers like Radahn gravity magic.

Its more of an argument against statement that Radahn ultimately lost the battle because his mind was eaten by rot. But I believe that Malenia's bloom was more of the "screw both of us".
        I don't know if I'd call learned alien magic natural powers
Ok? Yes, Radahn did very well - he fought someone who is undefeated to a statemate and survived her onslaught. But that doesn’t mean he won. I’m confused how a demigod and avatar of a god using their demigod and avatar of god powers means the other guy won, especially when we can see the aftermath in the game and Radahn certainly didn’t win.

Was it unfair, dishonorable, and immoral on Malenia’s part? Absolutely. But that’s kind of irrelevant to whether or not Radahn won, now isn’t it?
Lmao, Malenia was blind, rotted, limbs lost and was only using her blade until she bloomed.

Radahn was healthy, much larger, had gravity magic and home turf advantage and STILL couldn’t win.
    Malenia is also an Empyrean, and Radahn isn't. Nuked an entire country, yet he was still standing while she went nappy time for a few millenia. Granted , he went cray cray, but remained standing and earned the undying respect of his men. Malenia? Alone in a chair lmao.
        Being an Empyrean has nothing to do with a person strength and adds nothing. It’s just a title given to people chosen by the fingers as potential rulers.

His body was still there, his mind wasn’t. Radahn quite literally died after that nuke. Mindless and with a country in ruins. Whilst Malenia retains her sanity, her powers and actually becomes more powerful than he could ever dream of during our fight with her.
            Malenia retaining her sanity is contradicted by Milicent's dialogue during her quest. Malenia no longer has, quote "will, dignity, or sense of self."

She can speak, and remembers her name. But she's not sane.
                Well she is rotted to shit and we know exactly what the rot does at its worst from Radahn. So yeah probably. But she was in a hell of a better state than Radahn, that isn’t up for debate.
                    Malenia had a needle that keep her from having stage 6 cancer while radahn didn’t had sht, and even in madness and agony he managed to keep protecting the lands between from galactic threats  like astel. So yeah I’m the match between malenia ain’t sht.
Even if this is the argument you want to make Radahn couldn't really beat a half rotted, amputated, and blinded Demigod. The avatar of an outer God is what  simply ended their stalemate.
    Okay? That half-rotted blind amputee was still the best swordswoman in the world. Holding her at bay while holding up the literal night sky is more of a nod to his skill.
When people  downvote you for being right. Truly says a lot about reddit :')
    Truly a redditor moment.
        Sweaty downvoters go brrrr
True that.
It IS stated that she had to be carried away from the battlefield. Keep coping lmao.
    And it IS stated that Radahn completed lost his mind and turned into a beast that eats friend and foe alike. YOU keep coping hahahahaahha
        Well yes. I never stated otherwise. All I said is that NOBODY won, while you insisted that she won, while taking a look at Finlay's Ashes proves you wrong. No need to act like a 12 yr old just because you didn't know as much of how it went down as you thought you did :,) Truly maidenless behaviour :') 
Edit: As a little note, the biggest single fat L in shattering history is dropping a nuke on a country and still fail to kill your target. That is the very definition of failure <3
            Finley's ashes only say that she carried the slumbering demigod home and that it was a legendary feat. Not one word is said about Radahn in the immediate aftermath. Both lost because neither fulfilled their objectives (tho no one knows exactly what they were for either side). People can argue that one side or the other came out the better of the exchange though and that is probably the biggest bone of contention. I think most would agree that the battle itself was a stalemate but what happened after and the longer term affects are up in the air.
            Dude you are the one replying to multiple comments of mine so it’s clear who is really immature and unable to let go lmao.

As I have explained but your brain is obviously too rotted to comprehend. She did kill him. His mind rotted and he turned into a zombie. Literally by that very definition he is dead. Keep. Coping.
                Yet another dumb take easily disproven. He is still very much alive, very limited rationality, but still alive and kicking. If his mind was 100% gone (or dead dead, as you so obnoxiously keep insisting on) there would be 2 very important happenings. 
1-He wouldn't give a shit about his horse anymore, yet he still keeps it safe.
2-The stars would have resumed their movement, as , y'know, Blaidd and Selen straight up tell you.
Feeling that copium overdose yet?  :')
                    And this is also very easily disproven. If locking the stars was a conscious effort that held him back, why didn’t he release it when fighting Malenia to ensure a win, or against the tarnished and the other warriors? Surely if he wanted to keep them locked so much he would do anything to ensure he doesn’t die? The fact that he didn’t pretty much obliterates your argument. He ain’t alive and kicking as he quite literally is undead. Quite literally if you’d pain any attention to the lore at all. AAAAAAAND he has no feet with which to kick, hahaha.

Also as to the horse point, guy literally learned magic so he could ride it, was on it all the time to the point where it would no longer be a conscious effort on his part. Horse was literally a part of his body and since we don’t see him eating his own body, that’s another part of your argument destroyed.

How’s that copium build up? Must be bursting at the seems right now lmao.
and you're the one who says anything about mental gymnastics? no damage done to her? we literally see radahn letting her pick up her prosthesis from the ground to be honorable and then she proceeds to nuke a continent but still fails to kill radahn or get what she wanted. keep in mind radahn is doing all of this while still holding the stars in the sky and even after he gets turned into a "zombie" he still doesn't stop doing that, ever. also if you know lore you know that malenia didn't only take a nap and wake up completely fine few hours later lol. she was literally saved by a scarlet rot knight. it's stated, word by word, that she was literally SAVED by a knight who showed great bravery. yes literally it was a stalemate but if you really do wanna get technical, radahn fights her with honor while controlling stars in the sky, she nukes a continent, gives radahn alzhimers and nearly dies herself if she didn't get saved, goes into a coma while radahn still stands, damaged, but still stands. it's clear radahn is the stronger demigod idk how this is even a debate.
    Prosthetic is a prosthetic. It’s not her actual body. 

There is nothing in lore that states that holding the stars back limits his power, find proof of that, I’ll wait. If it actually limited him he would have deactivated it to beat Malenia, or us when we fight him.

If we wanna get REALLY technical Radahn immediately falls to the ground after the bloom. You seen this literally in the cutscene before you fight him, so no he wasn’t still standing.

Malenia was rotted to fuck, blind, lost limbs and only used her blade till she bloomed. Whereas Radahn was healthy, much larger, had magic to supplement his swords and had home advantage and STILL couldn’t kill her AND had his entire country ruined. One Aeonia put him out the game forever, literally only a small part of her power finished him. It’s clear who the stronger demigod is because she literally becomes a Goddess when we fight her. You clearly pay no attention whatsoever hahahahah
        Not wanting to enter into the debate but there are a few facts you are ignoring. 

1- Radanh never falls to the bloom. Since all Elden Ring media is canon, if you watch the 2019 annoucememt trailer you can see post bloom Radahn, rotting but still standing, roaring alone in the battlefield to the sky. Even more, you can also see in the trailer a lone Cleanrot knight attacking an alone Radahn, most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

2- Radahn is the defender, Malenia the aggressor. Whatever were Malenia goals with Caelid invasions it was a complete strategical and tactical failure. Her army got decimated to the point of no survivors. On the other part, the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured  and whats more important, they kept Radanh great rune safe. So calling her adventure in Caelid a stalemate or a victory is plain preposterous. It was an decisive defeat that erased any kind of military influese of the Halitree. The Redmanes stood standing against the rot, hurted, but with enough power to keep all their land under control, with a sizable and well organiced army. 

The 1v1 is debatable. Its state clearly that it was a draw, so no winners in the direrct confrontation. 

But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision. Only Finlay prevent  her gruesome death. I wouldnt call that a stalemate neither a victory for obvous reasons. 

Sumarizing: Malenia goals unachieved, her army completely anhinilated, 1v1 duel ends in draw, her target rotten but alive so Miquellas fate still frozen, Radanh great rune was not retrieved, Miquella was not founded, Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid, and even celebrate festivals in the name of their leader.

Veredic: total defeat, with no goals achieved.
            >On the other part, the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

They don't at all? Did you miss how they're all backed up at Redmane Castle barely holding off the wildlife? The Rot has also spread past the flaming walls, and the entire land is uninhabitable. Fort Faroth is completely abandoned, Sellia is a ghost town (literally) and there's ruins everywhere. What are you even talking about?

>The Redmanes stood standing against the rot, hurted, but with enough power to keep all their land under control, with a sizable and well organiced army.

Again what the fuck are you talking about? Have you seen Caelid? Does that look under control to you? And there's still Cleanrot Knights in the Aeonia Swamp.

>But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision.

There is zero evidence for that, Radahn isn't even found at where the bloom took place, it happened in the Aeonian Swamp while the story trailer shows the dunes. At some point he must've left to his castle.

>most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

Finlay survived all the way to the Haligtree

>Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision

Headcanon, post an item description proving he was still conscious. 

>Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid, and even celebrate festivals in the name of their leader.

I'm seriously convinced you haven't actually played the game and just watch Gigachad Radahn tiktok edits, NOTHING about Caelid is secure, and the festival is just a pretense to quite literally Old Yeller Radahn and put him out of his misery.
                The annoucement trailer of 2019 shows you Post-bloom Radanh standing alone, kneeling and roaring at the sky, covered in rott, in the same battlefield were he tank the scarlet aeonia. Then they show a lone cleanrot knight charging a kneeling Radanh. Seeing the whole context of the scenario, and all writen lore, that was Finlay charging to save Malenia, and i take that as a fact. It makes sense, since is a fact that Malenia was out of cold after the Bloom, and all the puzzle pieces match. Even if Radanh also got invoncious, he woke uo before Malenia no matter what, so without Finlay, her fate was sealed. 

Also, Redmane army end the war with enough man power to build numerous barriers, walls and other fortifications to try to stop the rot. That requieres a level of organization that a destroyed army couldnt achieve. We have to remember that the war happens god knows when. The fact that, a super invasive apocalypthic disasters hasnt consume the whole Caelid by the time our Tarnished appears, shows the power, discipline and organization of the Redmanes. Now compare the few soldiers the Halitree has and the decrepit state of Miquella realm, litteraly falling appart. That looks like a victorious party to you? Finlay ashes clearly state that there were basically no survivors, but them we see the Redmanes contain the Rott for hundreds or thousands of years until our arrival. At the end there were more Redmanes than Halitree troops, so as i said before, the military campaing was a failure.

As i said before, i wont enter in an heated debate since is pointless. The 1v1 was a stalemate, as the All-Knowing said. But from a military point of view, Radahn as the defending party win the exchange, a phyrric victory, but a victory noneless, since he only need to survive and fend of the invading forces.

Malenia didnt achieve any of the possible goals pursued. So thats defeat, no matter how one try to argue.

The day i decide to use tiktok, use cringe expresions like chad, gigachad or the like, will be the day i remove my eyes and tongue. I dont have anything against any character or any personal grief or blind hatred or love to any character of the game. And for the record, Ng+7 player here, with a semi-legic farmed 713 level character on ps4 with God knows how many hours of playtime.
                    > The fact that, a super invasive apocalypthic disasters hasnt consume the whole Caelid by the time our Tarnished appears, shows the power, discipline and organization of the Redmanes.

It does, again what the fuck are you talking about? There isn't a single place in Caelid free from the Rot besides a single tiny cave found underground.

>Finlay ashes clearly state that there were basically no survivors, but them we see the Redmanes contain the Rott for hundreds or thousands of years until our arrival.

It says that there were few survivors, not none. 

>Now compare the few soldiers the Halitree has and the decrepit state of Miquella realm, litteraly falling appart. That looks like a victorious party to you?

I didn't say they won, I said it was a stalemate that ended in no victor. The story trailer even states, what exactly do you think that means?

>Then they show a lone cleanrot knight charging a kneeling Radanh. Seeing the whole context of the scenario, and all writen lore, that was Finlay charging to save Malenia, and i take that as a fact

All written lore states that the battle ended immediately with the Aeonia and pretty much annhilated everything. Radahn straight up retreats from the battle, as the it happens in the heart of Aeonia. This is objective fact, whether it happend later or sooner is unknown but at some point he had to leave.

>he woke uo before Malenia no matter what, so without Finlay, her fate was sealed.

Prove it

>Malenia didnt achieve any of the possible goals pursued. So thats defeat, no matter how one try to argue.

The Redmanes themselves consider themselves to have lost Caelid lol

>When they were driven to defeat by Malenia's scarlet rot, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve.
>"Alas, dear home, I shan't see you again! For our duty is to remain here, a bulwark against the blight."

You're literally arguing against the game
            > you can see post bloom Radahn, rotting but still standing, roaring alone in the battlefield to the sky.

This could be right after the bloom, or days after the bloom. We don't know.
It also could be the battlefield in the trailer, or the desert we fight him at later.

He absolutely could have fallen unconscious atop his horse, and Leonard ran off from the rot.
Or Radahn himself could have fled the bloom while Malenia was still awake. We don't know because we lack info. I would defer to the game, which states multiple times that it was a draw.

>Even more, you can also see in the trailer a lone Cleanrot knight attacking an alone Radahn, most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

Go watch the trailer of thier fight.
He has multiple clean rot spears in his back, implying he had already fought several before the clash.
It could have easily been one of them.
Additional, can you actually imagine Finley carrying Malenia away from Radahn? A flying, horse riding general with a godamn artillery level bow?

>Whatever were Malenia goals with Caelid invasions it was a complete strategical and tactical failure.

It was to reach Radahn and take his rune, which she did in fact do.

> Her army got decimated to the point of no survivors.

Patently not true, as several survivors are found spread throughout Caelid.
Also:
"Finlay was one of the few survivors of the Battle of Aeonia"
That's both sides baby. Both armies were decimated. 

>the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

I'll let Jerren handle this one:


"I am Jerren. Foolish old warrior, and witness. Incidentally, do you like a good festival,  from time to time? Well, it's true, this fortress houses only the vanquished. But when the stars align, we celebrate."

Here is the redmane armor set.

"When they were driven to defeat by Malenia's scarlet rot, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve."

They lost, and given that thier were "few survivors" and the fight wasn't at the castle, we can assume the redmanes we see weren't at the battle of Aeonia.

>were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

Its a little suspicious that there were no forts in the path of an invading army headed to the capital.
Sure are a lot of ruins in thier path though....hmmm

>and whats more important, they kept Radanh great rune safe.

Its because he had it on him and fucked off to the desert. His army had nothing to do with it.

>So calling her adventure in Caelid a stalemate or a victory is plain preposterous.

The game and story trailer disagree.

>It was an decisive defeat that erased any kind of military influese of the Halitree.

The haligtree definitely still has soldiers in higher comfort, number, and Calibur then Caelid.

>But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision.

Pure speculation, as we don't know when Malenia fell unconscious, nor when Radahn left.
He could have fled the pain of her Aonea in his madness, and she could have been to week to chase him, but we literally do not know.

> Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid,

Very very wierd understanding of what "secure" means.
Cealid is a hell hole that belongs to the children of rot, the redmanes are cornered, broken, and leaderles. 

Let's just agree the game and its creators are right, it was a draw for both powers.
        Okay if you wanna suggest holding stars in the sly don’t take at least some level of power and doesn’t limit his strength AT ALL then there’s also nothing in the lore that states that her blindness and prosthetics limit her power either. You say she was rotten and near death or something as if she was weakened, she was born like that, even if she was weakened so what? What’s your point? We’re talking about malenia vs radahn and that’s simply how malenia is. If you wanna talk about an imporved version of her then sure maybe she would’ve won but i don’t get the point. It’s whoever fought who on the battlefield.

No you’re not getting technical, you’re getting silly. Radahn was bat shit insane but still very much standing and would’ve killed knocked out malenia of a random knight didn’t save her and took her home where she would continue to be in the coma.


“Radahn was much larger” idk since when size and mass mattered in soulsborne games or lore but omay. Also magic supplements? That’s his powers, you wanted him to not use them while fighting malenia? “And still couldn’t kill her” like i said already he would’ve because he was the conscious one, malenia got saved by third party.

Malenia can’t beat radahn, explodes so she can st least do something, gets her srmy destroyed, fails to accomplish anything other than give radahn brain damage i guess, falls into coma and gets saved by her knight. And even after that, radahn is still holding stars in the sky like the absolute chad he is. Also your argument about “he would’ve deactivated while fighting” is invalid, because he was clearly doing that for an important reason. He obviously didn’t learn gravity magic to not crush his horse, he had a very important goal. Some theories include protecting lands in between from outer creatures etc. so no he wouldn’t and he didn’t, even after having his brain rotten. A true Legend if I’ve ever seen one.
Is there source of malenia in her prime when fighting tarnished?
    No, but there's little reason to think she wasn't. Her missing limbs and her blindness appear to predate the Shattering (or at least her war against Radahn, since Miquella made her prosthetics), she has no other obvious wounds or conditions weakening her, and she even blooms and ascends to godhood during the fight. By contrast, Radahn was obviously a shadow of his former self as of the game.
nobody asked
    nobody asked you to be a bellend either but here you are, shaft on display
        A year or so later, your comment taught me a wondrous insult. Thank you skeleton
            no problem lol
    I appreciated his response. May not have asked but it was welcome.
Good bot
iirc those directly tied with the Erdtree in some way have eyes of gold (Melina, Marika, Godfrey, etc)

Kenneth does have gold eyes, as does Millicent


looking at [more here,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu_Q9TwF5Xc) Sellen doesn't have gold eyes in either of her bodies, but she also isn't directly tied to Marika/Radagon at all
I thought it was tied to being able to see the guidance of grace
    It's tied to the grace imbued in the non-Tarnished. Godfrey's eyes "dulled" when he lost the grace of the Erdtree and became the first Tarnished. The gold eyes never returned, even after the guidance of grace did.
Waterfowl Dance? I think you meam Fowl Play *Badum tss*
    Waterfoul dance? I think you mean AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Thank you so much for the suggestion🥹✨
Nowadays Fromsoft bosses should know that if a random naked dude with a club enters the arena, the boss is going to be fucked.
    Radagon: "I seek to repair the Elden Ring, and you won't stop me!"
Tarnished: "You're talking mad shit for someone in unga bunga range :')"
        I think the line would be more like "I seek to repair the-" "UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA"
            Correct!
Yeah I know, I'm agreeing.  I'm saying the "must" is unnecessary
    Whoops my bad, not enough coffees here clearly
        Happens to the best of us, my friend
He basically it. The OP was talking about his sense of self, which is entirely gone from him. He just mindlessly munches on corpses and roams around. He has 0 sentience left in him.
    He maintains enough control to:

A) Not kill and eat the fresh meat he's sitting on.

B)  Hold the stars locked in place. 

Neither of which improve his immediate chances of survival, and one of them is actively detrimental.
Nor has his will eroded enough to be malleable.

The man is clearly insane, but a zombie he is not.
        You can still be basically a "zombie" and do things strongly associated with your life. Like muscle memory. Its likely he didn't need to exert much conscious power for the stars once he was done with his initial conquest and his horse is clearly something very deeply ingrained. He can't talk, he can't reason, he is running on instinct and basic functions that were strong enough in his life to be done automatically. He is a living zombie.
You’ve clearly never watched any zombie films. He acts exactly the same. He howls at the moon and eats the corpses of friends and foe alike. This is not the behaviour of a person, it’s the behaviour of a thing that acts on complete instinct. Ergo Radahn is dead. All that’s left is a mindless instinct husk. Hence the entire reason for the festival.

I know you can’t bare the thought that Radahn got reduced to such a pitiful state but those are the facts. And cause I know your going to mention his horse. He spends all his time on it, learned magic just to ride it and his been on it so much it’s basically an extension of his body, like his swords, he isn’t eating his swords is he? Then he ain’t eating his method of travel.
So when a person turns into a a zombie they aren’t considered dead?

If you wanna get technical the body that is Radahn is alive but that actual person that was Radahn is objectively dead, and no amount of downvotes from salty Radahn dickriders can convince me otherwise.
    Dude, you are the one making up things calling him zombie. Everything i claim is backed up by in-game lore, and for what I remember nowhere was mentioned that radahn is a zombie, nor that whoever affected by scarlet rot becomes one. It may be as you say, as it may not. From my point of view he is clinging to life, he's just that resilient that even scarlet rot cant fully kill him.. it took his sanity, but not his body.

Edit: just to be clear it is canon that a zombie is someone who comes back from the world of the dead
        I find it ironic you mention in-game lore when you ignore it. The scarlet rot can’t fully kill him, or anyone, because there is no death in the lands between. Since the rune got stolen. Hence why you mostly you see those zombie-like wandering nobles, knights and every other mob. No one dying of old age. Just rotting and decomposing.

Pay attention man.
            First, a zombie is someone who comes back to life meaning that one must die first, and as you just said radahn didn't die hence he can't be one. Second zombie-like is not the same as zombie. Third, by your logic (person dies, if comes back he automatically is a zombie) the tarnished do die and comes back to life, since is not affected by the golden order, so you must be saying we are actually zombies?
                Straight up false, lie after lie. Zombies aren’t always shown to die first then resurrect. They turn after being bitten too, they don’t need to die. Examples are the zombies in black summer or WWZ.

Point is after changing they are no longer considered alive and the person they once were gone. Thus dead. This is the concept you and others are not grasping.

Tarnished are dead and then brought back by the grace. they are not undead.
Well he can't talk lol.
No no, I didn't mean that scarlet rot can't be called her power, she can wield it alright and resemblance with Morgott is quite obvious. I just wanted to put emphasis on the factor that utilizing your curse as a weapon hits both sides of the conflict and brings harm beyond control of the cursed one, as opposed to natural powers like Radahn gravity magic.

Its more of an argument against statement that Radahn ultimately lost the battle because his mind was eaten by rot. But I believe that Malenia's bloom was more of the "screw both of us".
    I don't know if I'd call learned alien magic natural powers
Malenia is also an Empyrean, and Radahn isn't. Nuked an entire country, yet he was still standing while she went nappy time for a few millenia. Granted , he went cray cray, but remained standing and earned the undying respect of his men. Malenia? Alone in a chair lmao.
    Being an Empyrean has nothing to do with a person strength and adds nothing. It’s just a title given to people chosen by the fingers as potential rulers.

His body was still there, his mind wasn’t. Radahn quite literally died after that nuke. Mindless and with a country in ruins. Whilst Malenia retains her sanity, her powers and actually becomes more powerful than he could ever dream of during our fight with her.
        Malenia retaining her sanity is contradicted by Milicent's dialogue during her quest. Malenia no longer has, quote "will, dignity, or sense of self."

She can speak, and remembers her name. But she's not sane.
            Well she is rotted to shit and we know exactly what the rot does at its worst from Radahn. So yeah probably. But she was in a hell of a better state than Radahn, that isn’t up for debate.
                Malenia had a needle that keep her from having stage 6 cancer while radahn didn’t had sht, and even in madness and agony he managed to keep protecting the lands between from galactic threats  like astel. So yeah I’m the match between malenia ain’t sht.
Okay? That half-rotted blind amputee was still the best swordswoman in the world. Holding her at bay while holding up the literal night sky is more of a nod to his skill.
Truly a redditor moment.
    Sweaty downvoters go brrrr
And it IS stated that Radahn completed lost his mind and turned into a beast that eats friend and foe alike. YOU keep coping hahahahaahha
    Well yes. I never stated otherwise. All I said is that NOBODY won, while you insisted that she won, while taking a look at Finlay's Ashes proves you wrong. No need to act like a 12 yr old just because you didn't know as much of how it went down as you thought you did :,) Truly maidenless behaviour :') 
Edit: As a little note, the biggest single fat L in shattering history is dropping a nuke on a country and still fail to kill your target. That is the very definition of failure <3
        Finley's ashes only say that she carried the slumbering demigod home and that it was a legendary feat. Not one word is said about Radahn in the immediate aftermath. Both lost because neither fulfilled their objectives (tho no one knows exactly what they were for either side). People can argue that one side or the other came out the better of the exchange though and that is probably the biggest bone of contention. I think most would agree that the battle itself was a stalemate but what happened after and the longer term affects are up in the air.
        Dude you are the one replying to multiple comments of mine so it’s clear who is really immature and unable to let go lmao.

As I have explained but your brain is obviously too rotted to comprehend. She did kill him. His mind rotted and he turned into a zombie. Literally by that very definition he is dead. Keep. Coping.
            Yet another dumb take easily disproven. He is still very much alive, very limited rationality, but still alive and kicking. If his mind was 100% gone (or dead dead, as you so obnoxiously keep insisting on) there would be 2 very important happenings. 
1-He wouldn't give a shit about his horse anymore, yet he still keeps it safe.
2-The stars would have resumed their movement, as , y'know, Blaidd and Selen straight up tell you.
Feeling that copium overdose yet?  :')
                And this is also very easily disproven. If locking the stars was a conscious effort that held him back, why didn’t he release it when fighting Malenia to ensure a win, or against the tarnished and the other warriors? Surely if he wanted to keep them locked so much he would do anything to ensure he doesn’t die? The fact that he didn’t pretty much obliterates your argument. He ain’t alive and kicking as he quite literally is undead. Quite literally if you’d pain any attention to the lore at all. AAAAAAAND he has no feet with which to kick, hahaha.

Also as to the horse point, guy literally learned magic so he could ride it, was on it all the time to the point where it would no longer be a conscious effort on his part. Horse was literally a part of his body and since we don’t see him eating his own body, that’s another part of your argument destroyed.

How’s that copium build up? Must be bursting at the seems right now lmao.
Prosthetic is a prosthetic. It’s not her actual body. 

There is nothing in lore that states that holding the stars back limits his power, find proof of that, I’ll wait. If it actually limited him he would have deactivated it to beat Malenia, or us when we fight him.

If we wanna get REALLY technical Radahn immediately falls to the ground after the bloom. You seen this literally in the cutscene before you fight him, so no he wasn’t still standing.

Malenia was rotted to fuck, blind, lost limbs and only used her blade till she bloomed. Whereas Radahn was healthy, much larger, had magic to supplement his swords and had home advantage and STILL couldn’t kill her AND had his entire country ruined. One Aeonia put him out the game forever, literally only a small part of her power finished him. It’s clear who the stronger demigod is because she literally becomes a Goddess when we fight her. You clearly pay no attention whatsoever hahahahah
    Not wanting to enter into the debate but there are a few facts you are ignoring. 

1- Radanh never falls to the bloom. Since all Elden Ring media is canon, if you watch the 2019 annoucememt trailer you can see post bloom Radahn, rotting but still standing, roaring alone in the battlefield to the sky. Even more, you can also see in the trailer a lone Cleanrot knight attacking an alone Radahn, most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

2- Radahn is the defender, Malenia the aggressor. Whatever were Malenia goals with Caelid invasions it was a complete strategical and tactical failure. Her army got decimated to the point of no survivors. On the other part, the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured  and whats more important, they kept Radanh great rune safe. So calling her adventure in Caelid a stalemate or a victory is plain preposterous. It was an decisive defeat that erased any kind of military influese of the Halitree. The Redmanes stood standing against the rot, hurted, but with enough power to keep all their land under control, with a sizable and well organiced army. 

The 1v1 is debatable. Its state clearly that it was a draw, so no winners in the direrct confrontation. 

But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision. Only Finlay prevent  her gruesome death. I wouldnt call that a stalemate neither a victory for obvous reasons. 

Sumarizing: Malenia goals unachieved, her army completely anhinilated, 1v1 duel ends in draw, her target rotten but alive so Miquellas fate still frozen, Radanh great rune was not retrieved, Miquella was not founded, Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid, and even celebrate festivals in the name of their leader.

Veredic: total defeat, with no goals achieved.
        >On the other part, the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

They don't at all? Did you miss how they're all backed up at Redmane Castle barely holding off the wildlife? The Rot has also spread past the flaming walls, and the entire land is uninhabitable. Fort Faroth is completely abandoned, Sellia is a ghost town (literally) and there's ruins everywhere. What are you even talking about?

>The Redmanes stood standing against the rot, hurted, but with enough power to keep all their land under control, with a sizable and well organiced army.

Again what the fuck are you talking about? Have you seen Caelid? Does that look under control to you? And there's still Cleanrot Knights in the Aeonia Swamp.

>But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision.

There is zero evidence for that, Radahn isn't even found at where the bloom took place, it happened in the Aeonian Swamp while the story trailer shows the dunes. At some point he must've left to his castle.

>most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

Finlay survived all the way to the Haligtree

>Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision

Headcanon, post an item description proving he was still conscious. 

>Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid, and even celebrate festivals in the name of their leader.

I'm seriously convinced you haven't actually played the game and just watch Gigachad Radahn tiktok edits, NOTHING about Caelid is secure, and the festival is just a pretense to quite literally Old Yeller Radahn and put him out of his misery.
            The annoucement trailer of 2019 shows you Post-bloom Radanh standing alone, kneeling and roaring at the sky, covered in rott, in the same battlefield were he tank the scarlet aeonia. Then they show a lone cleanrot knight charging a kneeling Radanh. Seeing the whole context of the scenario, and all writen lore, that was Finlay charging to save Malenia, and i take that as a fact. It makes sense, since is a fact that Malenia was out of cold after the Bloom, and all the puzzle pieces match. Even if Radanh also got invoncious, he woke uo before Malenia no matter what, so without Finlay, her fate was sealed. 

Also, Redmane army end the war with enough man power to build numerous barriers, walls and other fortifications to try to stop the rot. That requieres a level of organization that a destroyed army couldnt achieve. We have to remember that the war happens god knows when. The fact that, a super invasive apocalypthic disasters hasnt consume the whole Caelid by the time our Tarnished appears, shows the power, discipline and organization of the Redmanes. Now compare the few soldiers the Halitree has and the decrepit state of Miquella realm, litteraly falling appart. That looks like a victorious party to you? Finlay ashes clearly state that there were basically no survivors, but them we see the Redmanes contain the Rott for hundreds or thousands of years until our arrival. At the end there were more Redmanes than Halitree troops, so as i said before, the military campaing was a failure.

But from a military point of view, Radahn as the defending party win the exchange, a phyrric victory, but a victory noneless, since he only need to survive and fend of the invading forces.

Malenia didnt achieve any of the possible goals pursued. So thats defeat, no matter how one try to argue.

The day i decide to use tiktok, use cringe expresions like chad, gigachad or the like, will be the day i remove my eyes and tongue. I dont have anything against any character or any personal grief or blind hatred or love to any character of the game. And for the record, Ng+7 player here, with a semi-legic farmed 713 level character on ps4 with God knows how many hours of playtime.
                > The fact that, a super invasive apocalypthic disasters hasnt consume the whole Caelid by the time our Tarnished appears, shows the power, discipline and organization of the Redmanes.

It does, again what the fuck are you talking about? There isn't a single place in Caelid free from the Rot besides a single tiny cave found underground.

>Finlay ashes clearly state that there were basically no survivors, but them we see the Redmanes contain the Rott for hundreds or thousands of years until our arrival.

It says that there were few survivors, not none. 

>Now compare the few soldiers the Halitree has and the decrepit state of Miquella realm, litteraly falling appart. That looks like a victorious party to you?

I didn't say they won, I said it was a stalemate that ended in no victor. The story trailer even states, what exactly do you think that means?

>Then they show a lone cleanrot knight charging a kneeling Radanh. Seeing the whole context of the scenario, and all writen lore, that was Finlay charging to save Malenia, and i take that as a fact

All written lore states that the battle ended immediately with the Aeonia and pretty much annhilated everything. Radahn straight up retreats from the battle, as the it happens in the heart of Aeonia. This is objective fact, whether it happend later or sooner is unknown but at some point he had to leave.

>he woke uo before Malenia no matter what, so without Finlay, her fate was sealed.

Prove it

>Malenia didnt achieve any of the possible goals pursued. So thats defeat, no matter how one try to argue.

The Redmanes themselves consider themselves to have lost Caelid lol

>When they were driven to defeat by Malenia's scarlet rot, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve.
>"Alas, dear home, I shan't see you again! For our duty is to remain here, a bulwark against the blight."

You're literally arguing against the game
        > you can see post bloom Radahn, rotting but still standing, roaring alone in the battlefield to the sky.

This could be right after the bloom, or days after the bloom. We don't know.
It also could be the battlefield in the trailer, or the desert we fight him at later.

He absolutely could have fallen unconscious atop his horse, and Leonard ran off from the rot.
Or Radahn himself could have fled the bloom while Malenia was still awake. We don't know because we lack info. I would defer to the game, which states multiple times that it was a draw.

>Even more, you can also see in the trailer a lone Cleanrot knight attacking an alone Radahn, most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

Go watch the trailer of thier fight.
He has multiple clean rot spears in his back, implying he had already fought several before the clash.
It could have easily been one of them.
Additional, can you actually imagine Finley carrying Malenia away from Radahn? A flying, horse riding general with a godamn artillery level bow?

>Whatever were Malenia goals with Caelid invasions it was a complete strategical and tactical failure.

It was to reach Radahn and take his rune, which she did in fact do.

> Her army got decimated to the point of no survivors.

Patently not true, as several survivors are found spread throughout Caelid.
Also:
"Finlay was one of the few survivors of the Battle of Aeonia"
That's both sides baby. Both armies were decimated. 

>the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

I'll let Jerren handle this one:


"I am Jerren. Foolish old warrior, and witness. Incidentally, do you like a good festival,  from time to time? Well, it's true, this fortress houses only the vanquished. But when the stars align, we celebrate."

Here is the redmane armor set.

"When they were driven to defeat by Malenia's scarlet rot, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve."

They lost, and given that thier were "few survivors" and the fight wasn't at the castle, we can assume the redmanes we see weren't at the battle of Aeonia.

>were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

Its a little suspicious that there were no forts in the path of an invading army headed to the capital.
Sure are a lot of ruins in thier path though....hmmm

>and whats more important, they kept Radanh great rune safe.

Its because he had it on him and fucked off to the desert. His army had nothing to do with it.

>So calling her adventure in Caelid a stalemate or a victory is plain preposterous.

The game and story trailer disagree.

>It was an decisive defeat that erased any kind of military influese of the Halitree.

The haligtree definitely still has soldiers in higher comfort, number, and Calibur then Caelid.

>But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision.

Pure speculation, as we don't know when Malenia fell unconscious, nor when Radahn left.
He could have fled the pain of her Aonea in his madness, and she could have been to week to chase him, but we literally do not know.

> Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid,

Very very wierd understanding of what "secure" means.
Cealid is a hell hole that belongs to the children of rot, the redmanes are cornered, broken, and leaderles. 

Let's just agree the game and its creators are right, it was a draw for both powers.
    Okay if you wanna suggest holding stars in the sly don’t take at least some level of power and doesn’t limit his strength AT ALL then there’s also nothing in the lore that states that her blindness and prosthetics limit her power either. You say she was rotten and near death or something as if she was weakened, she was born like that, even if she was weakened so what? What’s your point? We’re talking about malenia vs radahn and that’s simply how malenia is. If you wanna talk about an imporved version of her then sure maybe she would’ve won but i don’t get the point. It’s whoever fought who on the battlefield.

No you’re not getting technical, you’re getting silly. Radahn was bat shit insane but still very much standing and would’ve killed knocked out malenia of a random knight didn’t save her and took her home where she would continue to be in the coma.


“Radahn was much larger” idk since when size and mass mattered in soulsborne games or lore but omay. Also magic supplements? That’s his powers, you wanted him to not use them while fighting malenia? “And still couldn’t kill her” like i said already he would’ve because he was the conscious one, malenia got saved by third party.

Malenia can’t beat radahn, explodes so she can st least do something, gets her srmy destroyed, fails to accomplish anything other than give radahn brain damage i guess, falls into coma and gets saved by her knight. And even after that, radahn is still holding stars in the sky like the absolute chad he is. Also your argument about “he would’ve deactivated while fighting” is invalid, because he was clearly doing that for an important reason. He obviously didn’t learn gravity magic to not crush his horse, he had a very important goal. Some theories include protecting lands in between from outer creatures etc. so no he wouldn’t and he didn’t, even after having his brain rotten. A true Legend if I’ve ever seen one.
No, but there's little reason to think she wasn't. Her missing limbs and her blindness appear to predate the Shattering (or at least her war against Radahn, since Miquella made her prosthetics), she has no other obvious wounds or conditions weakening her, and she even blooms and ascends to godhood during the fight. By contrast, Radahn was obviously a shadow of his former self as of the game.
nobody asked you to be a bellend either but here you are, shaft on display
    A year or so later, your comment taught me a wondrous insult. Thank you skeleton
        no problem lol
I appreciated his response. May not have asked but it was welcome.
It's tied to the grace imbued in the non-Tarnished. Godfrey's eyes "dulled" when he lost the grace of the Erdtree and became the first Tarnished. The gold eyes never returned, even after the guidance of grace did.
Waterfoul dance? I think you mean AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Radagon: "I seek to repair the Elden Ring, and you won't stop me!"
Tarnished: "You're talking mad shit for someone in unga bunga range :')"
    I think the line would be more like "I seek to repair the-" "UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA UNGA BUNGA"
        Correct!
Whoops my bad, not enough coffees here clearly
    Happens to the best of us, my friend
He maintains enough control to:

A) Not kill and eat the fresh meat he's sitting on.

B)  Hold the stars locked in place. 

Neither of which improve his immediate chances of survival, and one of them is actively detrimental.
Nor has his will eroded enough to be malleable.

The man is clearly insane, but a zombie he is not.
    You can still be basically a "zombie" and do things strongly associated with your life. Like muscle memory. Its likely he didn't need to exert much conscious power for the stars once he was done with his initial conquest and his horse is clearly something very deeply ingrained. He can't talk, he can't reason, he is running on instinct and basic functions that were strong enough in his life to be done automatically. He is a living zombie.
Dude, you are the one making up things calling him zombie. Everything i claim is backed up by in-game lore, and for what I remember nowhere was mentioned that radahn is a zombie, nor that whoever affected by scarlet rot becomes one. It may be as you say, as it may not. From my point of view he is clinging to life, he's just that resilient that even scarlet rot cant fully kill him.. it took his sanity, but not his body.

Edit: just to be clear it is canon that a zombie is someone who comes back from the world of the dead
    I find it ironic you mention in-game lore when you ignore it. The scarlet rot can’t fully kill him, or anyone, because there is no death in the lands between. Since the rune got stolen. Hence why you mostly you see those zombie-like wandering nobles, knights and every other mob. No one dying of old age. Just rotting and decomposing.

Pay attention man.
        First, a zombie is someone who comes back to life meaning that one must die first, and as you just said radahn didn't die hence he can't be one. Second zombie-like is not the same as zombie. Third, by your logic (person dies, if comes back he automatically is a zombie) the tarnished do die and comes back to life, since is not affected by the golden order, so you must be saying we are actually zombies?
            Straight up false, lie after lie. Zombies aren’t always shown to die first then resurrect. They turn after being bitten too, they don’t need to die. Examples are the zombies in black summer or WWZ.

Point is after changing they are no longer considered alive and the person they once were gone. Thus dead. This is the concept you and others are not grasping.

Tarnished are dead and then brought back by the grace. they are not undead.
I don't know if I'd call learned alien magic natural powers
Being an Empyrean has nothing to do with a person strength and adds nothing. It’s just a title given to people chosen by the fingers as potential rulers.

His body was still there, his mind wasn’t. Radahn quite literally died after that nuke. Mindless and with a country in ruins. Whilst Malenia retains her sanity, her powers and actually becomes more powerful than he could ever dream of during our fight with her.
    Malenia retaining her sanity is contradicted by Milicent's dialogue during her quest. Malenia no longer has, quote "will, dignity, or sense of self."

She can speak, and remembers her name. But she's not sane.
        Well she is rotted to shit and we know exactly what the rot does at its worst from Radahn. So yeah probably. But she was in a hell of a better state than Radahn, that isn’t up for debate.
            Malenia had a needle that keep her from having stage 6 cancer while radahn didn’t had sht, and even in madness and agony he managed to keep protecting the lands between from galactic threats  like astel. So yeah I’m the match between malenia ain’t sht.
Sweaty downvoters go brrrr
Well yes. I never stated otherwise. All I said is that NOBODY won, while you insisted that she won, while taking a look at Finlay's Ashes proves you wrong. No need to act like a 12 yr old just because you didn't know as much of how it went down as you thought you did :,) Truly maidenless behaviour :') 
Edit: As a little note, the biggest single fat L in shattering history is dropping a nuke on a country and still fail to kill your target. That is the very definition of failure <3
    Finley's ashes only say that she carried the slumbering demigod home and that it was a legendary feat. Not one word is said about Radahn in the immediate aftermath. Both lost because neither fulfilled their objectives (tho no one knows exactly what they were for either side). People can argue that one side or the other came out the better of the exchange though and that is probably the biggest bone of contention. I think most would agree that the battle itself was a stalemate but what happened after and the longer term affects are up in the air.
    Dude you are the one replying to multiple comments of mine so it’s clear who is really immature and unable to let go lmao.

As I have explained but your brain is obviously too rotted to comprehend. She did kill him. His mind rotted and he turned into a zombie. Literally by that very definition he is dead. Keep. Coping.
        Yet another dumb take easily disproven. He is still very much alive, very limited rationality, but still alive and kicking. If his mind was 100% gone (or dead dead, as you so obnoxiously keep insisting on) there would be 2 very important happenings. 
1-He wouldn't give a shit about his horse anymore, yet he still keeps it safe.
2-The stars would have resumed their movement, as , y'know, Blaidd and Selen straight up tell you.
Feeling that copium overdose yet?  :')
            And this is also very easily disproven. If locking the stars was a conscious effort that held him back, why didn’t he release it when fighting Malenia to ensure a win, or against the tarnished and the other warriors? Surely if he wanted to keep them locked so much he would do anything to ensure he doesn’t die? The fact that he didn’t pretty much obliterates your argument. He ain’t alive and kicking as he quite literally is undead. Quite literally if you’d pain any attention to the lore at all. AAAAAAAND he has no feet with which to kick, hahaha.

Also as to the horse point, guy literally learned magic so he could ride it, was on it all the time to the point where it would no longer be a conscious effort on his part. Horse was literally a part of his body and since we don’t see him eating his own body, that’s another part of your argument destroyed.

How’s that copium build up? Must be bursting at the seems right now lmao.
Not wanting to enter into the debate but there are a few facts you are ignoring. 

1- Radanh never falls to the bloom. Since all Elden Ring media is canon, if you watch the 2019 annoucememt trailer you can see post bloom Radahn, rotting but still standing, roaring alone in the battlefield to the sky. Even more, you can also see in the trailer a lone Cleanrot knight attacking an alone Radahn, most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

2- Radahn is the defender, Malenia the aggressor. Whatever were Malenia goals with Caelid invasions it was a complete strategical and tactical failure. Her army got decimated to the point of no survivors. On the other part, the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured  and whats more important, they kept Radanh great rune safe. So calling her adventure in Caelid a stalemate or a victory is plain preposterous. It was an decisive defeat that erased any kind of military influese of the Halitree. The Redmanes stood standing against the rot, hurted, but with enough power to keep all their land under control, with a sizable and well organiced army. 

The 1v1 is debatable. Its state clearly that it was a draw, so no winners in the direrct confrontation. 

But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision. Only Finlay prevent  her gruesome death. I wouldnt call that a stalemate neither a victory for obvous reasons. 

Sumarizing: Malenia goals unachieved, her army completely anhinilated, 1v1 duel ends in draw, her target rotten but alive so Miquellas fate still frozen, Radanh great rune was not retrieved, Miquella was not founded, Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid, and even celebrate festivals in the name of their leader.

Veredic: total defeat, with no goals achieved.
    >On the other part, the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

They don't at all? Did you miss how they're all backed up at Redmane Castle barely holding off the wildlife? The Rot has also spread past the flaming walls, and the entire land is uninhabitable. Fort Faroth is completely abandoned, Sellia is a ghost town (literally) and there's ruins everywhere. What are you even talking about?

>The Redmanes stood standing against the rot, hurted, but with enough power to keep all their land under control, with a sizable and well organiced army.

Again what the fuck are you talking about? Have you seen Caelid? Does that look under control to you? And there's still Cleanrot Knights in the Aeonia Swamp.

>But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision.

There is zero evidence for that, Radahn isn't even found at where the bloom took place, it happened in the Aeonian Swamp while the story trailer shows the dunes. At some point he must've left to his castle.

>most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

Finlay survived all the way to the Haligtree

>Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision

Headcanon, post an item description proving he was still conscious. 

>Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid, and even celebrate festivals in the name of their leader.

I'm seriously convinced you haven't actually played the game and just watch Gigachad Radahn tiktok edits, NOTHING about Caelid is secure, and the festival is just a pretense to quite literally Old Yeller Radahn and put him out of his misery.
        The annoucement trailer of 2019 shows you Post-bloom Radanh standing alone, kneeling and roaring at the sky, covered in rott, in the same battlefield were he tank the scarlet aeonia. Then they show a lone cleanrot knight charging a kneeling Radanh. Seeing the whole context of the scenario, and all writen lore, that was Finlay charging to save Malenia, and i take that as a fact. It makes sense, since is a fact that Malenia was out of cold after the Bloom, and all the puzzle pieces match. Even if Radanh also got invoncious, he woke uo before Malenia no matter what, so without Finlay, her fate was sealed. 

Also, Redmane army end the war with enough man power to build numerous barriers, walls and other fortifications to try to stop the rot. That requieres a level of organization that a destroyed army couldnt achieve. We have to remember that the war happens god knows when. The fact that, a super invasive apocalypthic disasters hasnt consume the whole Caelid by the time our Tarnished appears, shows the power, discipline and organization of the Redmanes. Now compare the few soldiers the Halitree has and the decrepit state of Miquella realm, litteraly falling appart. That looks like a victorious party to you? Finlay ashes clearly state that there were basically no survivors, but them we see the Redmanes contain the Rott for hundreds or thousands of years until our arrival. At the end there were more Redmanes than Halitree troops, so as i said before, the military campaing was a failure.

As i said before, i wont enter in an heated debate since is pointless. The 1v1 was a stalemate, as the All-Knowing said. But from a military point of view, Radahn as the defending party win the exchange, a phyrric victory, but a victory noneless, since he only need to survive and fend of the invading forces.

Malenia didnt achieve any of the possible goals pursued. So thats defeat, no matter how one try to argue.

The day i decide to use tiktok, use cringe expresions like chad, gigachad or the like, will be the day i remove my eyes and tongue. I dont have anything against any character or any personal grief or blind hatred or love to any character of the game. And for the record, Ng+7 player here, with a semi-legic farmed 713 level character on ps4 with God knows how many hours of playtime.

It does, again what the fuck are you talking about? There isn't a single place in Caelid free from the Rot besides a single tiny cave found underground.

>Finlay ashes clearly state that there were basically no survivors, but them we see the Redmanes contain the Rott for hundreds or thousands of years until our arrival.

Dude you are the one replying to multiple comments of mine so it’s clear who is really immature and unable to let go lmao.

As I have explained but your brain is obviously too rotted to comprehend. She did kill him. His mind rotted and he turned into a zombie. Literally by that very definition he is dead. Keep. Coping.
    Yet another dumb take easily disproven. He is still very much alive, very limited rationality, but still alive and kicking. If his mind was 100% gone (or dead dead, as you so obnoxiously keep insisting on) there would be 2 very important happenings. 
1-He wouldn't give a shit about his horse anymore, yet he still keeps it safe.
2-The stars would have resumed their movement, as , y'know, Blaidd and Selen straight up tell you.
Feeling that copium overdose yet?  :')
        And this is also very easily disproven. If locking the stars was a conscious effort that held him back, why didn’t he release it when fighting Malenia to ensure a win, or against the tarnished and the other warriors? Surely if he wanted to keep them locked so much he would do anything to ensure he doesn’t die? The fact that he didn’t pretty much obliterates your argument. He ain’t alive and kicking as he quite literally is undead. Quite literally if you’d pain any attention to the lore at all. AAAAAAAND he has no feet with which to kick, hahaha.

Also as to the horse point, guy literally learned magic so he could ride it, was on it all the time to the point where it would no longer be a conscious effort on his part. Horse was literally a part of his body and since we don’t see him eating his own body, that’s another part of your argument destroyed.

How’s that copium build up? Must be bursting at the seems right now lmao.
>On the other part, the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

They don't at all? Did you miss how they're all backed up at Redmane Castle barely holding off the wildlife? The Rot has also spread past the flaming walls, and the entire land is uninhabitable. Fort Faroth is completely abandoned, Sellia is a ghost town (literally) and there's ruins everywhere. What are you even talking about?

>The Redmanes stood standing against the rot, hurted, but with enough power to keep all their land under control, with a sizable and well organiced army.

Again what the fuck are you talking about? Have you seen Caelid? Does that look under control to you? And there's still Cleanrot Knights in the Aeonia Swamp.

>But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision.

There is zero evidence for that, Radahn isn't even found at where the bloom took place, it happened in the Aeonian Swamp while the story trailer shows the dunes. At some point he must've left to his castle.

>most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

Finlay survived all the way to the Haligtree

>Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision

Headcanon, post an item description proving he was still conscious. 

>Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid, and even celebrate festivals in the name of their leader.

I'm seriously convinced you haven't actually played the game and just watch Gigachad Radahn tiktok edits, NOTHING about Caelid is secure, and the festival is just a pretense to quite literally Old Yeller Radahn and put him out of his misery.
    The annoucement trailer of 2019 shows you Post-bloom Radanh standing alone, kneeling and roaring at the sky, covered in rott, in the same battlefield were he tank the scarlet aeonia. Then they show a lone cleanrot knight charging a kneeling Radanh. Seeing the whole context of the scenario, and all writen lore, that was Finlay charging to save Malenia, and i take that as a fact. It makes sense, since is a fact that Malenia was out of cold after the Bloom, and all the puzzle pieces match. Even if Radanh also got invoncious, he woke uo before Malenia no matter what, so without Finlay, her fate was sealed. 

Also, Redmane army end the war with enough man power to build numerous barriers, walls and other fortifications to try to stop the rot. That requieres a level of organization that a destroyed army couldnt achieve. We have to remember that the war happens god knows when. The fact that, a super invasive apocalypthic disasters hasnt consume the whole Caelid by the time our Tarnished appears, shows the power, discipline and organization of the Redmanes. Now compare the few soldiers the Halitree has and the decrepit state of Miquella realm, litteraly falling appart. That looks like a victorious party to you? Finlay ashes clearly state that there were basically no survivors, but them we see the Redmanes contain the Rott for hundreds or thousands of years until our arrival. At the end there were more Redmanes than Halitree troops, so as i said before, the military campaing was a failure.

As i said before, i wont enter in an heated debate since is pointless. The 1v1 was a stalemate, as the All-Knowing said. But from a military point of view, Radahn as the defending party win the exchange, a phyrric victory, but a victory noneless, since he only need to survive and fend of the invading forces.

Malenia didnt achieve any of the possible goals pursued. So thats defeat, no matter how one try to argue.

The day i decide to use tiktok, use cringe expresions like chad, gigachad or the like, will be the day i remove my eyes and tongue. I dont have anything against any character or any personal grief or blind hatred or love to any character of the game. And for the record, Ng+7 player here, with a semi-legic farmed 713 level character on ps4 with God knows how many hours of playtime.
        > The fact that, a super invasive apocalypthic disasters hasnt consume the whole Caelid by the time our Tarnished appears, shows the power, discipline and organization of the Redmanes.

It does, again what the fuck are you talking about? There isn't a single place in Caelid free from the Rot besides a single tiny cave found underground.

>Finlay ashes clearly state that there were basically no survivors, but them we see the Redmanes contain the Rott for hundreds or thousands of years until our arrival.

It says that there were few survivors, not none. 

>Now compare the few soldiers the Halitree has and the decrepit state of Miquella realm, litteraly falling appart. That looks like a victorious party to you?

I didn't say they won, I said it was a stalemate that ended in no victor. The story trailer even states, what exactly do you think that means?

>Then they show a lone cleanrot knight charging a kneeling Radanh. Seeing the whole context of the scenario, and all writen lore, that was Finlay charging to save Malenia, and i take that as a fact

All written lore states that the battle ended immediately with the Aeonia and pretty much annhilated everything. Radahn straight up retreats from the battle, as the it happens in the heart of Aeonia. This is objective fact, whether it happend later or sooner is unknown but at some point he had to leave.

>he woke uo before Malenia no matter what, so without Finlay, her fate was sealed.

Prove it

>Malenia didnt achieve any of the possible goals pursued. So thats defeat, no matter how one try to argue.

The Redmanes themselves consider themselves to have lost Caelid lol

>When they were driven to defeat by Malenia's scarlet rot, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve.
>"Alas, dear home, I shan't see you again! For our duty is to remain here, a bulwark against the blight."

You're literally arguing against the game
> you can see post bloom Radahn, rotting but still standing, roaring alone in the battlefield to the sky.

This could be right after the bloom, or days after the bloom. We don't know.
It also could be the battlefield in the trailer, or the desert we fight him at later.

He absolutely could have fallen unconscious atop his horse, and Leonard ran off from the rot.
Or Radahn himself could have fled the bloom while Malenia was still awake. We don't know because we lack info. I would defer to the game, which states multiple times that it was a draw.

>Even more, you can also see in the trailer a lone Cleanrot knight attacking an alone Radahn, most likely Finlay rescuing Malenia before she got eaten/smashed by rotten Radahn.

Go watch the trailer of thier fight.
He has multiple clean rot spears in his back, implying he had already fought several before the clash.
It could have easily been one of them.
Additional, can you actually imagine Finley carrying Malenia away from Radahn? A flying, horse riding general with a godamn artillery level bow?

>Whatever were Malenia goals with Caelid invasions it was a complete strategical and tactical failure.

It was to reach Radahn and take his rune, which she did in fact do.

> Her army got decimated to the point of no survivors.

Patently not true, as several survivors are found spread throughout Caelid.
Also:
"Finlay was one of the few survivors of the Battle of Aeonia"
That's both sides baby. Both armies were decimated. 

>the defending army, the Redmanes, allthrought not without damage, were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

I'll let Jerren handle this one:


"I am Jerren. Foolish old warrior, and witness. Incidentally, do you like a good festival,  from time to time? Well, it's true, this fortress houses only the vanquished. But when the stars align, we celebrate."

Here is the redmane armor set.

"When they were driven to defeat by Malenia's scarlet rot, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve."

They lost, and given that thier were "few survivors" and the fight wasn't at the castle, we can assume the redmanes we see weren't at the battle of Aeonia.

>were able to quickly regroup and kept the rot at bay and hold all their forts and castles secured

Its a little suspicious that there were no forts in the path of an invading army headed to the capital.
Sure are a lot of ruins in thier path though....hmmm

>and whats more important, they kept Radanh great rune safe.

Its because he had it on him and fucked off to the desert. His army had nothing to do with it.

>So calling her adventure in Caelid a stalemate or a victory is plain preposterous.

The game and story trailer disagree.

>It was an decisive defeat that erased any kind of military influese of the Halitree.

The haligtree definitely still has soldiers in higher comfort, number, and Calibur then Caelid.

>But the after-duel is an other story. Rotten Radanh would had eaten Malenia 100%, since he was still concious and went berserker and she was out if commision.

Pure speculation, as we don't know when Malenia fell unconscious, nor when Radahn left.
He could have fled the pain of her Aonea in his madness, and she could have been to week to chase him, but we literally do not know.

> Redmane army still standing with enough power to secure Caelid,

Very very wierd understanding of what "secure" means.
Cealid is a hell hole that belongs to the children of rot, the redmanes are cornered, broken, and leaderles. 

Let's just agree the game and its creators are right, it was a draw for both powers.
no problem lol
Correct!
First, a zombie is someone who comes back to life meaning that one must die first, and as you just said radahn didn't die hence he can't be one. Second zombie-like is not the same as zombie. Third, by your logic (person dies, if comes back he automatically is a zombie) the tarnished do die and comes back to life, since is not affected by the golden order, so you must be saying we are actually zombies?
    Straight up false, lie after lie. Zombies aren’t always shown to die first then resurrect. They turn after being bitten too, they don’t need to die. Examples are the zombies in black summer or WWZ.

Point is after changing they are no longer considered alive and the person they once were gone. Thus dead. This is the concept you and others are not grasping.

Tarnished are dead and then brought back by the grace. they are not undead.
Well she is rotted to shit and we know exactly what the rot does at its worst from Radahn. So yeah probably. But she was in a hell of a better state than Radahn, that isn’t up for debate.
    Malenia had a needle that keep her from having stage 6 cancer while radahn didn’t had sht, and even in madness and agony he managed to keep protecting the lands between from galactic threats  like astel. So yeah I’m the match between malenia ain’t sht.
Yet another dumb take easily disproven. He is still very much alive, very limited rationality, but still alive and kicking. If his mind was 100% gone (or dead dead, as you so obnoxiously keep insisting on) there would be 2 very important happenings.
