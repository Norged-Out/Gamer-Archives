[[If you could give Torrent one more ability, what would it be]]





ram those avionette soldiers
    Agreed he should have a skill called ram. Felt like this should have been obvious.
        only works if smaller than torrent though.
            You would deprive the challenge runners of killing the biggest enemies with only the torrent ram?
                "So how'd you kill the fire giant?"

"Headbutted it's toes till it died"
                    Lmao like the meme of the turtle attacking peoples' shoes ü§£ü§£
                        Only the black shoesüíÄ
                    The Lego tactic!
                    We already do that. Attack its toes till it dies I mean XD
            "Can he double jump off of thin air by creating a magical platform?"

"Yes."

"Can he headbutt things?"

"This might be a fantasy game Peter but let's respect some small notion of realism at least."
                Heheh funny.
            Works on enemies larger, but if they're smaller they get launched away.
            No, it should work on big guys.  It just won't trample them.
            If it's larger you get to play motorcycle crash simulator
        Doesn't even need a separate skill, just add it to the initial dash, give him a few frames of bludgeoning damage when you first hit the button.
            Horses trample people on the battlefield without the need to head butt them.  Just give him the ability to trample too.
                Yes, but why give horns if no stabby with horns
                Imagine farming for runes outside bestial sanctum if torrent could trample. You‚Äôd be picking vulgar parts out of your hooves for days.
                    Extra treats for Torrent‚Äôs good work
        I was saying this yesterday. You stop on a dime if someone walks in front of you. There‚Äôs already animations for stumbling on all human sized and below creatures
        They had this in the Ghost of Tsushima DLC, imagine if they put it in ER‚Äôs DLC üòáüôè
            I legit had a moment where I said "I thought that was added" and then realized I was thinking of GoT. Iki Island was such an amazing dlc.
                Right??? It really surprised me in terms of the story and content. I might have gotten just as emotionally invested, if not more so than I did with the core game, tbh. 

The core game was mostly us vs them. Good guys versus bad guys with us eventually caught in the middle. But the DLC was about looking at BOTH sides with equal amount of empathy. You both hated and somewhat forgave them for their sins. At least I did anyway
            I still have to play that fucking game I know I'm missing out big time.
                You really are. It's totally worth it. It was on sale, I want to say a few weeks ago, (PS store) for about $20, I think, and that was with everything, including the DLC. It was a steal.

        I can‚Äôt believe no one is making a Rick and Morty Ghost Train Guy Comparison!?! ALLL ABBOOAAARRDDDDD
        he does have collision physics so you can run through objects, similar to how jumping into stuff does like 1dam
        Maybe a bit too obvious. Also Ghost of Tsushima did something similar but that might have been exclusive to DLC
    Came here to say this! A short charge where he rams into an enemy. Doesn't even need to do too much damage, just inflict a stun or stumble that you can follow up with a jump attack from the saddle.

Also, not exactly an ability, but some customisation would be so cool. Let me make my best boi some fashion!
        I always said that would love to have the horses from around the world, some of them have an incredible design... when I first saw the horse from redmanes became in love with the armor for the horse, cucko knights also have a really beautiful design
            Agreed. I LARPed as a Cuckoo Knight towards the end of my first playthrough, and I felt so naked without the regal silver, red, and blue armor adorning my steed.
    Goat simulator 4
    Ahem... excuse me, sir, your idea is genius. Might I raise you one lightning ram instead?
    üêé trample not üêè
     An item that could grant Torrent a triple jump would be sweet
    My thoughts exactly. Make it to where he can ram certain enemies and just flatten or push them. If they‚Äôre blocking then break their guard and stagger or throw them.
    Only came here to say this
I swear he looks and feels like a normal horse when playing

Then I see pictures and realize how stumpy this mf is
    Torrent isn‚Äôt a horse, and no one ever refers to it as a horse. That mf a STEED
        my dad is adamant torrent is a yak.
            It‚Äôs not a real animal, but it does look like a cross between a yak and a horse. Look up Watusi cow. Could also be a variation of that.
                Watussy
                    no
                        :(
                            shame upon you
                                :(
                    Damn, 40 minutes too late...
            Your dad is right
        All right, I hope you heard that? She called me a "noble steed." She thinks I'm a steed.
            Donkeh!
        I know that but he SEEMS like a horse when riding him

That's all I'm sayin
        My man a STALLION
    I have always thought of him as a young ancestral spirit. Check out the noise when they both jump in mid air too.
        You know, I've never thought about them having a connection. Makes more sense than Torrent being the only one of its kind.
            I saw the theory in a video but I can‚Äôt remember who made it! If anyone knows please drop the link.
        That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve thought since launch. They‚Äôre absolutely related, Torrent is even a spirit himself.
    He's Yakul from Princess Mononoke.
        I had this same thought when I first played, especially with how he jumps.
    Fianc√©e took one look and said Torrent is a Bicorn. She's not wrong, he does have two horns. But it doesn't feel right. Torrent's last owner DLC when?
        Bicorn? Which can only be ridden by the sinful/non-virgins right?

Cheer up everyone, we may be maidenless in the Lands Between but this means that our character must have fucked at least once before the game.
        Came across your comment randomly... you called it
            XD I completely forgot about this. That's honestly hilarious.
The ability to be summoned for elden beast and maybe a few other bosses like the (possibly related to torrent) ancestor spirits.
    I like the theory that Torrent is just a young ancestral spirit. Makes sense and is cute
        I mean they do look somewhat similar and ancestor spirit definitely has the same air jump.  I really wish they had done a bit more with him, he‚Äôs a really unique mount.
        I genuinely thought in my first fight with Ancestor Spirit, that the fight was going to be a way to upgrade Torrent in one way or another. Son, I am dissapoint.
            Huh- like he would abilities the more of them you fight?

My instincts are telling me that might have been the idea‚Ä¶. Maybe in an earlier concept he didn‚Äôt get double jump until after beating one, or something.  Generally speaking ‚Äúdouble jump‚Äù is a special unlock in games these days.
                Yeah, it would have been awesome to unlock another jump with those fights. Or the ability for him to absorb healing from dead spirit creatures. The triple jump was what I suspected though when I first did the fight.
                    Reasonable thought.
            DOOD! That would have made these fights so much better. Faster sprinting, more health or stagger resistance, maybe a triple jump?

Or torrent auto-reviving beast type enemies that died in the vicinity to fight for you? Maybe the ability to make ancestral guardians non-hostile? They‚Äôre a pretty irrelevant enemy anyway, would‚Äôve been great to see the pack near the erdtree guardian go hostile on the guardian. I didn‚Äôt even think the ancestor worshippers were cool with the golden order.

Even just an actual trample charge like other mounted fighters can do would‚Äôve been awesome.

Edit: just saw your suggestion to make him heal too, another good one.
            I honestly thought you were going to be able to unlock triple and maybe even quadruple jumps because of the gravestones coming out of the side of the the cliffs and the regular double jump when it let me jump to a lot of them. But then my friend told me that those were just for dropping down safely.
    That‚Äôd actually be so cool if you could summon him for Elden beast, like you‚Äôre finishing the journey with your companion while offering the better mechanic of cutting down the chase time
        Yes. I‚Äôve seen others mention it before I‚Äôm not taking credit for the idea, but the arena is so huge it really feels like something they were considering and decided against for some reason- maybe because of you slip up and get caught by a single stray star, torrents ridiculously huge stagger animations would probably lock you into auto-death. Lol.
Respawn without me having to click yes to use a flask in the middle of a fight,
    Should be a setting at the very least.
        I mean I imagine it's intentional to be harrowing to do mid combat.
            [deleted]
                Ngl I'd find being locked into an animation mid combat way more frustrating than the current option
                    That's a good point, and if you aren't keeping track of Torrent's HP you may not realize when you need to use a flask. 

Tbh rather than this I'd have the 'Somewhere a heavy door has opened' dialogue disappear automatically. I cannot imagine why this isn't already the case. I've died several times to the fucking imps because I can't attack or roll while that text is there.
                        Same with "stonesword key was lost with use"
                        This

And it‚Äôs extra dumb because you can still move around so you don‚Äôt realize things are amiss until it‚Äôs too late
                    It could grant invincibility while the animation is happening though, like when you perform a finishing move or whatever you‚Äôd call it
                        then it wouldn't be harrowing, you could even use it to i-frame certain attacks too
                You can speed up pressing yes, you cant speed up an animation, so... skill issue.

            Bad UI design should not be used to punish the player.
            [deleted]
                People suck Miyazaki‚Äôs dick when it comes to any flaw in ER‚Äôs design. Yes yes we all know the game is a 10/10, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt have its issues. Any mention of this logic is a request to have ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs intentional‚Äù, and ‚Äúplay a different game‚Äù comments thrown at you.
            If the default option was YES instead of NO it'd be better tbh.
            It's never good design to intentionally make the UI cumbersome.
    WHY DOES IT DEFAULT TO ‚ÄúNO‚Äù!??????
        Exactly. I‚Äôd settle for just yes as the default
        My inputs: Drink. No. Drink. No. Drink. No.

My thoughts: Why is this taking so long?

My reality: I was smashing the button so fast that I didn‚Äôt even notice the prompt until I was already about to die.
        Because its a FromSoft game.
    Seriously, improvements to Torrent aside, this is the number one thing I would want added to this game.
        The lantern automaticlly being equiped when going into dark areas.
            I can see why it‚Äôs optional, though. The lantern definitely has a greater ranger for aggro and if it were automatic, that would ruin stealth runs.
                Yeah, it's also trivial to add it to your action bar or whatever and throw it on as necessary.
                    I keep it in a pouch for that reason
                        Yeah, pouch, that's what I was thinking of. Haven't played in a few months. I have mine set to O+down on all my characters (also have O and triangle switched because I had just come off Bloodborne).
            I want it to maintain its state when fast traveling. If I turn it on, keep it on until I turn it off.
    Either this or third jump
    FOR REAL. Give me a cool down if you have to but that flask shit is garbage.
        I think it's to force you to take better care of torrent and use the item that heals him that I'm sure 99% of players (including myself)never used.
            I give it to him as treat from time to time
                Same! He‚Äôs such a good boy after all
            Exactly. By using rowa seeds that people have millions in their inventory, Torrent heals up a quarter of his health. People need to realise that.
                The disposable items are fairly useful but they take up an inventory slot
                    I use my pouch for that
            I keep a stack of raisins and if Torrent is so much as nicked, I feed him. Or if we're both injured, I use a healing Incant on us. Sometimes I feed Torrent when his HP is full, just because he's a good boy.
                I went out of my way to find him the new raisins every time I found a new bush because the sweet boi deserves the best
            This is the first I'm hearing of an item that heals torrent other than the flask. 

I'd be willing to bet that most players don't use it because they don't know its there
                It's not even one item. 

There's 3 tiers of Rowa fruit/raisins.
                It‚Äôs one of the most common items you find in limgrave though (Rowafruit) ‚Äî probably it will be the first ingredient you find in game
                There‚Äôs heaps of great items in the game. I too used to be an inventory hoarder until I realised I was beating all the souls games with a full inventory at the end of the game that just gets‚Ä¶ wasted. Now I just pop whatever. Except for precious upgrade materials I‚Äôm still hoarding them.
                Cause it says it refills stamina. Not heath in the item description.
                Do you just go through the game without looking at half the things you pick up??
        The annoying ass thing is that sometimes there is, like it seems kinda random as to when it asks
            It‚Äôs not random. It will only ask to use a crimson flask to summon Torrent if they took so much damage that their HP hit 0 (which would also cause you to dismounted). This is where the rowa fruit can be used to replenish HP if they took a few hits. I believe resting at graces refills their HP/revives them.
            Torrent dying and you getting knocked off Torrent look visually similar, but they're two different things. You only need to use a flask if Torrent actually dies, which in my experience is much less common than you getting knocked off.
                I think the only difference is there‚Äôs like a whinnying(is that the word for a horse cry?) sound when he dies. I could be wrong but I know there‚Äôs some subtle difference when he dies.
    Flying like a pegasus.
    Or default to yes at least lol
    Yeah I don‚Äòt even mind having to spend the flask most of the time, it‚Äòs just the time waste of having to click (after moving the option to yes) whilst you‚Äòre freaking out trying to scramble away from danger. Just let me say in the menu ‚Äûyes I always want to spend the flask to do this‚Äú so that it can be instant in-play.
    I've adapted, and considered the pop up a "punishment" for "cheating" out of a Drink Flask animation (which itself is punishment for letting Torrent die. "Dark Souls: It's Punishments All The Way Down!‚Ñ¢"). 

If Torrent dies, I just make sure to down a flask the traditional way before I call him back - no popup, and I know Michael Zaki would be proud.

^/uj >!but yeah I'd be cool with an actual diagetic animation delay instead, or something - popping up ui is so jarring and fucks immersion, I hate all the popups.!<
    They‚Äôve had so many chances to fix this and chosen not to that I have to believe this is a deliberate choice coming straight from Miyazaki

        Exactly my first thought, specifically what you said with mini-comet azur
    Sea Bass are just as effective as Sharks when it comes to laser eyes

        How do you think he knows about it.
            magic, probably
            Miyazaki himself runs the channel
    That may be just because of code reuse from other mounts since npc horses can do that. Rather than rewriting torrents code just for him
        That's a good point.

But on the other hand, give Torrent that BS shoulder charge that the Nightrider horses do!
    modders: rubs hands....
I want an ability to pet Torrent.
    You can sort of do this by giving him berries
        I‚Äôm sorry, *what?*
            Rowa raisins (crafted from rowa fruit) are the way to heal Torrent so that he doesn't despawn.
            Rowa berries are meant to heal Torrent.

Hardly ever necessary, but the option's there.
                I did it so much on my first playthru just cuz I love Torrent. (And I also fought a number of bosses on Torrent my first playthru.) THE BEST BOI
                    [removed]
                        He's the best. I loved feeding him and it was legit necessary cuz I was so scurred my whole first playthru. Thank god for strength and that shield counter R2 tech.
                I've never used them to heal, I just keep feeding him cause it's the only way to interact. GIVE US A PET BUTTON MICHAELZAKI I'M BEGGING YOU
                They are always necessary. Torrent carries us through hell and back without complaint even when dying because of our stupidity. The least we could do is toss a raisin to our Torrent whether he needs healing or not.

Yes, I do have the maximum number of raisins and fruit to make more, who do you ask?
            There is an item, you can use to recover Torrent's health, while riding him. It's a snowberries or something like that. Animation is pretty cute
        There's 3 types of berries or rasins the darker they are the more they heal Torrent.
    I give him berries for fun because he's a good boy and my friend.
        Yeah my torrent would probably be closer to lazy river if in game reflected all the berries he's been fed
    YES!!!!!!!
    He's a good boy, to be sure
    should at least be there at graces

gets lonely there when you've got no melina dialogue
    RDR2 stuff like petting, brushing, feeding would nice. Also bonding that comes with fancy moves like powerslides, and it's level deteriorating each time Torrents dies, because the player should've be more careful. Gradual leveling, improving it's own stats. Determine which build compliments Torrent best. That and bumrushing the everliving bejesus out of everything, letting them soldiers know who runs this shitshow is glorious.
        Yo, any sort of torrent leveling/ upgrade system would be sick, even if it just slightly improved mounted stamina, health, jump height, and sprint speed
Mimic tear should be able to summon mimic torrent
    Omg that would be so cool
    I just was thinking this the other day when I summoned the Mimic Tear while horseback for a field boss.
    That's hilarious. Imagine him jumping around the enemy thinking he's doing something
    That‚Äôs so obvious, why wasn‚Äôt it done?
Double jump resetting fall distance calculation.
    I died so many times before I realized that wasn‚Äôt how it works.
        I'm now realizing... 200+ hours later... This isn't what I was doing.
            That's embarrassing
                Oh nooooooooo
            Same.
        [deleted]
            I agree it is intuitive, but at the moment this change would break a ton of their hard-to-reach areas because you could effectively jump from any height and land safely down below.   
And they'd also have to rework their fall instakill zones and stop the death cam from triggering if there's any ground underneath.
                If you attack while falling it resets the timer for when you instantly die in mid air as you fall. This was important for the rune farm where you fall out of bound in Mogh's area as you needed to fall far enough off the map while still alive for the terrain to despawn and kill all the enemies on the area. I'm sad that they added terrain that blocks the path to the out of bounds zone.
                    There is still a way to do the mohg palace jump, you can go up a wall near a laser skeleton, or down a wall near the grace near mohg.
                    That kill timer is a different thing than the kill box, the kill timer is a backup failsafe mechanic for if you oob into an infinite fall and have no other way out, the kill boxes are put into map geometry by hand to insta kill you if you touch them to make deaths quicker if you fall from a very great height or an intended bottomless pit
                They could just do what breath of the wild did. Yes you could technically survive any fall with the paraglider but there were still areas that weren't part of the map and would insta-kill you. All the areas that you couldn't use torrent (every legacy dungeon and side dungeon) would not be affected by this change. It would only apply to the OPEN world. Honestly think it would be really cool.
                    If we're being honest with ourselves, it's not like the perilous drops down cliffsides from one stone slab to the next for 4 full minutes making sure you dont fuck up really adds anything to the game. If I have the option to drop down to certain areas, I shouldn't have to play a mini-platformer every time
                        Almost all platforms like this in the game are designed so that running off the edge without jumping will get you one step lower. Sometimes you do have to jump but the distance is always like ‚Äúone normal jump‚Äù and it shouldn‚Äôt take that much focus. Just something I noticed.
                Perhaps they could change the double jump's animation and effect so it factors in your current fall speed. Double jump at a low speed and it functions as it currently does. Double jump after you've been descending for a bit and most of the push will be forwards, without affecting your fall speed much at all.
    That would invalid a lot of platforming in open areas, so definitely not gonna happen.
        Yeah, the map is very clearly designed around the fact that there is a maximum distance you can fall and survive, allowing double jump to reset that throws all that into the trash. I would be okay if double jumping cancelled any damage you would take if you would have already survived the fall but I think that would just be way more confusing.
            In that case, just use cat talisman or cotton item :D
    at that point, there might as well not be fall damage at all
    The amount of times I would double jump and still get hurt; I always thought I was messing it up somehow. Most recently, that cliff overlooking the Golden Lineage Evergaol. I was wondering how I died even though I timed the jump perfectly. Thanks for absolving me of that particular skill issue.
Dash i frames
    Holy fuck how is this not #1
        because being on a horse is already enough of an advantage in the majority of combat situations where you're able to mount it
            Its a disadvantage for me. I literally cant play on horseback because without a dodge I just get hit by them. Like people fight against dragons on horseback. Like how?? I just cant they always have some weird attacks that oneshot me or torrent that I cant dodge
                If you fight on horseback, you should dash in for some hits and then get far away from the boss while they attack. I'd argue that dragons in the open world are actually designed to be fought with Torrent.
                    I fell like they dont. I just cant dodge adulas blade for example. But its so easy to dodge on foot.
                    Yeah I thought that was obvious, I don't know why people don't understand how to fight on horse. You just go in, hit once or twice, then dip and repeat. It's almost foolproof. The only real issues are the dragon breaths or stuff like that.
            It would be an advantage if torrent didn't have so little health and negative poise so he gets stunned forever and you get stunlocked to death
            Combat on torrent sucks. The hit stun animation is really long and there‚Äôs a couple bosses where I think you‚Äôre incentivized to use him (fire giant) but avoiding attacks on him is just not really feasible
            My friend I usually co-op with feels that way tok and I do NOT get it.

Being on Torrent during major fights is a death sentence for me 99% of the time.
                All you have to do while on torrent is go in, hit once or twice and dip. You go so fast that it's almost foolproof.
    We have dismount I-frames instead.
The ability to not be asked to use a flask to revive. I tried to call Torrent, please just use the flask!
    But thats there for the extra challenge. The game would be too easy otherwise
That shoulder shove move the night cavalry horses can do, where they sortof lunge at you with their shoulder
    Those attacks always seem to have zero wind up.
        10/10
Poise. Or stagger resistance of some type.
    This idea is all the way down at the bottom because people would rather pet their horse than have it be functional. 

Those weirdos can have their horse petting and saddles, but I'll take not being stunlocked off my horse by a feeble man holding a torch out every time.

        Yeah he looks the happiest when that ancient dragon engulfs him in flames.
Flying
    No no, this is already in the game.
Lance/spear attacks should be different while on Torrent, special moves and damage.
    100% there needs to be a charge mechanic for lances so u can joust ur opponents. Imagine the fun in pvp for this. It would be its own entire community
        Yeah but no Torrent in multi-player :(  I was **sooo** disappointed.
The ability to be dismounted without disappearing, that way I can give him the head pats and ear scratches he deserves for being such a good boy.
I really hope the DLC adds something new to torrent, whether that be a new ability or some customization options
    Steed talismans ( can only be used on torrent )
        Either weapons with a special "slot" for mounted Ashes of War, or possibly a great rune style slot for it, so it stays across all weapons (if compatible)

            Yeah but you got what I meant, wait does torrent only have 3 legs then EDIT: googled it he does have 4 legs
                [deleted]
                    Mate this world's full of grafted Kings and snake man hybrids, not the most far fetched idea of 3 leg double jump
                        Eh, I dunno. 4 I can believe the double jump. 3‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a bit of a stretch, right? ;)
Being able to knock enemies down or kick them
Poise. I'd give the poor bastard actual poise, insetad of the -100 he has now. A bloody whiff of air knocks that thing down -\_-

&#x200B;

you'd think with a boss that big, in an arena that big, with a very mobile moveset, would have your mount for it right?

&#x200B;

and ive always been of the opinion that the final boss of a game should be like the game exam:

this is where you prove to the game that you've mastered the skills needed to beat it, and one of those skills is definitely mounted combat.  the boss fight being two drastically different parts even makes me  think you were supposed to be able to do mounted combat for the elden beast, but it was either too difficult or overlooked by mistake.

Hey, how about the ability to equip a GOSHDANG SHIELD in my offhand while riding him?! I'd sacrifice the ability to attack on my left side if I could defend on it. Or left light is block, left heavy is a lil shield swing. That's something I could get behind. Y'know... Like a shield?
It'd be cool if we could change his form. Let me ride a direwolf in a G.R.R.M. game

Have gravity damage be calculated  more "properly"
Agreed he should have a skill called ram. Felt like this should have been obvious.
    only works if smaller than torrent though.
        You would deprive the challenge runners of killing the biggest enemies with only the torrent ram?
            "So how'd you kill the fire giant?"

        "Can he double jump off of thin air by creating a magical platform?"

"Yes."

"Can he headbutt things?"

"This might be a fantasy game Peter but let's respect some small notion of realism at least."
            Heheh funny.
        Works on enemies larger, but if they're smaller they get launched away.
        No, it should work on big guys.  It just won't trample them.
        If it's larger you get to play motorcycle crash simulator
    Doesn't even need a separate skill, just add it to the initial dash, give him a few frames of bludgeoning damage when you first hit the button.
        Horses trample people on the battlefield without the need to head butt them.  Just give him the ability to trample too.
            Yes, but why give horns if no stabby with horns
            Imagine farming for runes outside bestial sanctum if torrent could trample. You‚Äôd be picking vulgar parts out of your hooves for days.
                Extra treats for Torrent‚Äôs good work
    I was saying this yesterday. You stop on a dime if someone walks in front of you. There‚Äôs already animations for stumbling on all human sized and below creatures
    They had this in the Ghost of Tsushima DLC, imagine if they put it in ER‚Äôs DLC üòáüôè
        I legit had a moment where I said "I thought that was added" and then realized I was thinking of GoT. Iki Island was such an amazing dlc.
            Right??? It really surprised me in terms of the story and content. I might have gotten just as emotionally invested, if not more so than I did with the core game, tbh. 

The core game was mostly us vs them. Good guys versus bad guys with us eventually caught in the middle. But the DLC was about looking at BOTH sides with equal amount of empathy. You both hated and somewhat forgave them for their sins. At least I did anyway
        I still have to play that fucking game I know I'm missing out big time.
            You really are. It's totally worth it. It was on sale, I want to say a few weeks ago, (PS store) for about $20, I think, and that was with everything, including the DLC. It was a steal.
    [removed]
    I can‚Äôt believe no one is making a Rick and Morty Ghost Train Guy Comparison!?! ALLL ABBOOAAARRDDDDD
    he does have collision physics so you can run through objects, similar to how jumping into stuff does like 1dam
    Maybe a bit too obvious. Also Ghost of Tsushima did something similar but that might have been exclusive to DLC
Came here to say this! A short charge where he rams into an enemy. Doesn't even need to do too much damage, just inflict a stun or stumble that you can follow up with a jump attack from the saddle.

Also, not exactly an ability, but some customisation would be so cool. Let me make my best boi some fashion!
    I always said that would love to have the horses from around the world, some of them have an incredible design... when I first saw the horse from redmanes became in love with the armor for the horse, cucko knights also have a really beautiful design
        Agreed. I LARPed as a Cuckoo Knight towards the end of my first playthrough, and I felt so naked without the regal silver, red, and blue armor adorning my steed.
Goat simulator 4
Ahem... excuse me, sir, your idea is genius. Might I raise you one lightning ram instead?
üêé trample not üêè
 An item that could grant Torrent a triple jump would be sweet
My thoughts exactly. Make it to where he can ram certain enemies and just flatten or push them. If they‚Äôre blocking then break their guard and stagger or throw them.
Only came here to say this
Torrent isn‚Äôt a horse, and no one ever refers to it as a horse. That mf a STEED
    my dad is adamant torrent is a yak.
        It‚Äôs not a real animal, but it does look like a cross between a yak and a horse. Look up Watusi cow. Could also be a variation of that.
            Watussy
                no
                    :(
                        shame upon you
                            :(
                Damn, 40 minutes too late...
        Your dad is right
    All right, I hope you heard that? She called me a "noble steed." She thinks I'm a steed.
        Donkeh!
    I know that but he SEEMS like a horse when riding him

That's all I'm sayin
    My man a STALLION
I have always thought of him as a young ancestral spirit. Check out the noise when they both jump in mid air too.
    You know, I've never thought about them having a connection. Makes more sense than Torrent being the only one of its kind.
        I saw the theory in a video but I can‚Äôt remember who made it! If anyone knows please drop the link.
    That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve thought since launch. They‚Äôre absolutely related, Torrent is even a spirit himself.
He's Yakul from Princess Mononoke.
    I had this same thought when I first played, especially with how he jumps.
Fianc√©e took one look and said Torrent is a Bicorn. She's not wrong, he does have two horns. But it doesn't feel right. Torrent's last owner DLC when?
    Bicorn? Which can only be ridden by the sinful/non-virgins right?

Cheer up everyone, we may be maidenless in the Lands Between but this means that our character must have fucked at least once before the game.
    Came across your comment randomly... you called it
        XD I completely forgot about this. That's honestly hilarious.
I like the theory that Torrent is just a young ancestral spirit. Makes sense and is cute
    I mean they do look somewhat similar and ancestor spirit definitely has the same air jump.  I really wish they had done a bit more with him, he‚Äôs a really unique mount.
    I genuinely thought in my first fight with Ancestor Spirit, that the fight was going to be a way to upgrade Torrent in one way or another. Son, I am dissapoint.
        Huh- like he would abilities the more of them you fight?

My instincts are telling me that might have been the idea‚Ä¶. Maybe in an earlier concept he didn‚Äôt get double jump until after beating one, or something.  Generally speaking ‚Äúdouble jump‚Äù is a special unlock in games these days.
            Yeah, it would have been awesome to unlock another jump with those fights. Or the ability for him to absorb healing from dead spirit creatures. The triple jump was what I suspected though when I first did the fight.
                Reasonable thought.
        DOOD! That would have made these fights so much better. Faster sprinting, more health or stagger resistance, maybe a triple jump?

Or torrent auto-reviving beast type enemies that died in the vicinity to fight for you? Maybe the ability to make ancestral guardians non-hostile? They‚Äôre a pretty irrelevant enemy anyway, would‚Äôve been great to see the pack near the erdtree guardian go hostile on the guardian. I didn‚Äôt even think the ancestor worshippers were cool with the golden order.

Even just an actual trample charge like other mounted fighters can do would‚Äôve been awesome.

Edit: just saw your suggestion to make him heal too, another good one.
        I honestly thought you were going to be able to unlock triple and maybe even quadruple jumps because of the gravestones coming out of the side of the the cliffs and the regular double jump when it let me jump to a lot of them. But then my friend told me that those were just for dropping down safely.
That‚Äôd actually be so cool if you could summon him for Elden beast, like you‚Äôre finishing the journey with your companion while offering the better mechanic of cutting down the chase time
    Yes. I‚Äôve seen others mention it before I‚Äôm not taking credit for the idea, but the arena is so huge it really feels like something they were considering and decided against for some reason- maybe because of you slip up and get caught by a single stray star, torrents ridiculously huge stagger animations would probably lock you into auto-death. Lol.
Should be a setting at the very least.
    I mean I imagine it's intentional to be harrowing to do mid combat.
        [deleted]
            Ngl I'd find being locked into an animation mid combat way more frustrating than the current option
                That's a good point, and if you aren't keeping track of Torrent's HP you may not realize when you need to use a flask. 

Tbh rather than this I'd have the 'Somewhere a heavy door has opened' dialogue disappear automatically. I cannot imagine why this isn't already the case. I've died several times to the fucking imps because I can't attack or roll while that text is there.
                    Same with "stonesword key was lost with use"
                    This

And it‚Äôs extra dumb because you can still move around so you don‚Äôt realize things are amiss until it‚Äôs too late
                It could grant invincibility while the animation is happening though, like when you perform a finishing move or whatever you‚Äôd call it
                    then it wouldn't be harrowing, you could even use it to i-frame certain attacks too
            You can speed up pressing yes, you cant speed up an animation, so... skill issue.
                [deleted]
        Bad UI design should not be used to punish the player.
        [deleted]
            People suck Miyazaki‚Äôs dick when it comes to any flaw in ER‚Äôs design. Yes yes we all know the game is a 10/10, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt have its issues. Any mention of this logic is a request to have ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs intentional‚Äù, and ‚Äúplay a different game‚Äù comments thrown at you.
        If the default option was YES instead of NO it'd be better tbh.
        It's never good design to intentionally make the UI cumbersome.
WHY DOES IT DEFAULT TO ‚ÄúNO‚Äù!??????
    Exactly. I‚Äôd settle for just yes as the default
    My inputs: Drink. No. Drink. No. Drink. No.

My thoughts: Why is this taking so long?

My reality: I was smashing the button so fast that I didn‚Äôt even notice the prompt until I was already about to die.
    Because its a FromSoft game.
Seriously, improvements to Torrent aside, this is the number one thing I would want added to this game.
    The lantern automaticlly being equiped when going into dark areas.
        I can see why it‚Äôs optional, though. The lantern definitely has a greater ranger for aggro and if it were automatic, that would ruin stealth runs.
            Yeah, it's also trivial to add it to your action bar or whatever and throw it on as necessary.
                I keep it in a pouch for that reason
                    Yeah, pouch, that's what I was thinking of. Haven't played in a few months. I have mine set to O+down on all my characters (also have O and triangle switched because I had just come off Bloodborne).
        I want it to maintain its state when fast traveling. If I turn it on, keep it on until I turn it off.
Either this or third jump
FOR REAL. Give me a cool down if you have to but that flask shit is garbage.
    I think it's to force you to take better care of torrent and use the item that heals him that I'm sure 99% of players (including myself)never used.
        I give it to him as treat from time to time
            Same! He‚Äôs such a good boy after all
        Exactly. By using rowa seeds that people have millions in their inventory, Torrent heals up a quarter of his health. People need to realise that.
            The disposable items are fairly useful but they take up an inventory slot
                I use my pouch for that
        I keep a stack of raisins and if Torrent is so much as nicked, I feed him. Or if we're both injured, I use a healing Incant on us. Sometimes I feed Torrent when his HP is full, just because he's a good boy.
            I went out of my way to find him the new raisins every time I found a new bush because the sweet boi deserves the best
        This is the first I'm hearing of an item that heals torrent other than the flask. 

I'd be willing to bet that most players don't use it because they don't know its there
            It's not even one item. 

There's 3 tiers of Rowa fruit/raisins.
            It‚Äôs one of the most common items you find in limgrave though (Rowafruit) ‚Äî probably it will be the first ingredient you find in game
            There‚Äôs heaps of great items in the game. I too used to be an inventory hoarder until I realised I was beating all the souls games with a full inventory at the end of the game that just gets‚Ä¶ wasted. Now I just pop whatever. Except for precious upgrade materials I‚Äôm still hoarding them.
            Cause it says it refills stamina. Not heath in the item description.
            Do you just go through the game without looking at half the things you pick up??
    The annoying ass thing is that sometimes there is, like it seems kinda random as to when it asks
        It‚Äôs not random. It will only ask to use a crimson flask to summon Torrent if they took so much damage that their HP hit 0 (which would also cause you to dismounted). This is where the rowa fruit can be used to replenish HP if they took a few hits. I believe resting at graces refills their HP/revives them.
        Torrent dying and you getting knocked off Torrent look visually similar, but they're two different things. You only need to use a flask if Torrent actually dies, which in my experience is much less common than you getting knocked off.
            I think the only difference is there‚Äôs like a whinnying(is that the word for a horse cry?) sound when he dies. I could be wrong but I know there‚Äôs some subtle difference when he dies.
Flying like a pegasus.
Or default to yes at least lol
Yeah I don‚Äòt even mind having to spend the flask most of the time, it‚Äòs just the time waste of having to click (after moving the option to yes) whilst you‚Äòre freaking out trying to scramble away from danger. Just let me say in the menu ‚Äûyes I always want to spend the flask to do this‚Äú so that it can be instant in-play.
I've adapted, and considered the pop up a "punishment" for "cheating" out of a Drink Flask animation (which itself is punishment for letting Torrent die. "Dark Souls: It's Punishments All The Way Down!‚Ñ¢"). 

If Torrent dies, I just make sure to down a flask the traditional way before I call him back - no popup, and I know Michael Zaki would be proud.

^/uj >!but yeah I'd be cool with an actual diagetic animation delay instead, or something - popping up ui is so jarring and fucks immersion, I hate all the popups.!<
They‚Äôve had so many chances to fix this and chosen not to that I have to believe this is a deliberate choice coming straight from Miyazaki

    How do you think he knows about it.
        magic, probably
        Miyazaki himself runs the channel
That may be just because of code reuse from other mounts since npc horses can do that. Rather than rewriting torrents code just for him
    That's a good point.

But on the other hand, give Torrent that BS shoulder charge that the Nightrider horses do!
modders: rubs hands....
You can sort of do this by giving him berries
    I‚Äôm sorry, *what?*
        Rowa raisins (crafted from rowa fruit) are the way to heal Torrent so that he doesn't despawn.
        Rowa berries are meant to heal Torrent.

Hardly ever necessary, but the option's there.
            I did it so much on my first playthru just cuz I love Torrent. (And I also fought a number of bosses on Torrent my first playthru.) THE BEST BOI
                [removed]
                    He's the best. I loved feeding him and it was legit necessary cuz I was so scurred my whole first playthru. Thank god for strength and that shield counter R2 tech.
            I've never used them to heal, I just keep feeding him cause it's the only way to interact. GIVE US A PET BUTTON MICHAELZAKI I'M BEGGING YOU
            They are always necessary. Torrent carries us through hell and back without complaint even when dying because of our stupidity. The least we could do is toss a raisin to our Torrent whether he needs healing or not.

Yes, I do have the maximum number of raisins and fruit to make more, who do you ask?
        There is an item, you can use to recover Torrent's health, while riding him. It's a snowberries or something like that. Animation is pretty cute
    There's 3 types of berries or rasins the darker they are the more they heal Torrent.
I give him berries for fun because he's a good boy and my friend.
    Yeah my torrent would probably be closer to lazy river if in game reflected all the berries he's been fed
YES!!!!!!!
He's a good boy, to be sure
should at least be there at graces

gets lonely there when you've got no melina dialogue
RDR2 stuff like petting, brushing, feeding would nice. Also bonding that comes with fancy moves like powerslides, and it's level deteriorating each time Torrents dies, because the player should've be more careful. Gradual leveling, improving it's own stats. Determine which build compliments Torrent best. That and bumrushing the everliving bejesus out of everything, letting them soldiers know who runs this shitshow is glorious.
    Yo, any sort of torrent leveling/ upgrade system would be sick, even if it just slightly improved mounted stamina, health, jump height, and sprint speed
Omg that would be so cool
I just was thinking this the other day when I summoned the Mimic Tear while horseback for a field boss.
That's hilarious. Imagine him jumping around the enemy thinking he's doing something
That‚Äôs so obvious, why wasn‚Äôt it done?
I died so many times before I realized that wasn‚Äôt how it works.
    I'm now realizing... 200+ hours later... This isn't what I was doing.
        That's embarrassing
            Oh nooooooooo
        Same.
    [deleted]
        I agree it is intuitive, but at the moment this change would break a ton of their hard-to-reach areas because you could effectively jump from any height and land safely down below.   
And they'd also have to rework their fall instakill zones and stop the death cam from triggering if there's any ground underneath.
            If you attack while falling it resets the timer for when you instantly die in mid air as you fall. This was important for the rune farm where you fall out of bound in Mogh's area as you needed to fall far enough off the map while still alive for the terrain to despawn and kill all the enemies on the area. I'm sad that they added terrain that blocks the path to the out of bounds zone.
                There is still a way to do the mohg palace jump, you can go up a wall near a laser skeleton, or down a wall near the grace near mohg.
                That kill timer is a different thing than the kill box, the kill timer is a backup failsafe mechanic for if you oob into an infinite fall and have no other way out, the kill boxes are put into map geometry by hand to insta kill you if you touch them to make deaths quicker if you fall from a very great height or an intended bottomless pit
            They could just do what breath of the wild did. Yes you could technically survive any fall with the paraglider but there were still areas that weren't part of the map and would insta-kill you. All the areas that you couldn't use torrent (every legacy dungeon and side dungeon) would not be affected by this change. It would only apply to the OPEN world. Honestly think it would be really cool.
                If we're being honest with ourselves, it's not like the perilous drops down cliffsides from one stone slab to the next for 4 full minutes making sure you dont fuck up really adds anything to the game. If I have the option to drop down to certain areas, I shouldn't have to play a mini-platformer every time
                    Almost all platforms like this in the game are designed so that running off the edge without jumping will get you one step lower. Sometimes you do have to jump but the distance is always like ‚Äúone normal jump‚Äù and it shouldn‚Äôt take that much focus. Just something I noticed.
            Perhaps they could change the double jump's animation and effect so it factors in your current fall speed. Double jump at a low speed and it functions as it currently does. Double jump after you've been descending for a bit and most of the push will be forwards, without affecting your fall speed much at all.
That would invalid a lot of platforming in open areas, so definitely not gonna happen.
    Yeah, the map is very clearly designed around the fact that there is a maximum distance you can fall and survive, allowing double jump to reset that throws all that into the trash. I would be okay if double jumping cancelled any damage you would take if you would have already survived the fall but I think that would just be way more confusing.
        In that case, just use cat talisman or cotton item :D
at that point, there might as well not be fall damage at all
The amount of times I would double jump and still get hurt; I always thought I was messing it up somehow. Most recently, that cliff overlooking the Golden Lineage Evergaol. I was wondering how I died even though I timed the jump perfectly. Thanks for absolving me of that particular skill issue.
Holy fuck how is this not #1
    because being on a horse is already enough of an advantage in the majority of combat situations where you're able to mount it
        Its a disadvantage for me. I literally cant play on horseback because without a dodge I just get hit by them. Like people fight against dragons on horseback. Like how?? I just cant they always have some weird attacks that oneshot me or torrent that I cant dodge
            If you fight on horseback, you should dash in for some hits and then get far away from the boss while they attack. I'd argue that dragons in the open world are actually designed to be fought with Torrent.
                I fell like they dont. I just cant dodge adulas blade for example. But its so easy to dodge on foot.
                Yeah I thought that was obvious, I don't know why people don't understand how to fight on horse. You just go in, hit once or twice, then dip and repeat. It's almost foolproof. The only real issues are the dragon breaths or stuff like that.
        It would be an advantage if torrent didn't have so little health and negative poise so he gets stunned forever and you get stunlocked to death
        Combat on torrent sucks. The hit stun animation is really long and there‚Äôs a couple bosses where I think you‚Äôre incentivized to use him (fire giant) but avoiding attacks on him is just not really feasible
        My friend I usually co-op with feels that way tok and I do NOT get it.

Being on Torrent during major fights is a death sentence for me 99% of the time.
            All you have to do while on torrent is go in, hit once or twice and dip. You go so fast that it's almost foolproof.
We have dismount I-frames instead.
But thats there for the extra challenge. The game would be too easy otherwise
Those attacks always seem to have zero wind up.
    10/10
This idea is all the way down at the bottom because people would rather pet their horse than have it be functional. 

Those weirdos can have their horse petting and saddles, but I'll take not being stunlocked off my horse by a feeble man holding a torch out every time.
This!

Agreed, but do not make them tedious to find. Maybe have a vendor in an early area that sells them for runes.

"Yes."

"Can he headbutt things?"

"This might be a fantasy game Peter but let's respect some small notion of realism at least."
        Heheh funny.
    Works on enemies larger, but if they're smaller they get launched away.
    No, it should work on big guys.  It just won't trample them.
    If it's larger you get to play motorcycle crash simulator
Doesn't even need a separate skill, just add it to the initial dash, give him a few frames of bludgeoning damage when you first hit the button.
    Horses trample people on the battlefield without the need to head butt them.  Just give him the ability to trample too.
        Yes, but why give horns if no stabby with horns
        Imagine farming for runes outside bestial sanctum if torrent could trample. You‚Äôd be picking vulgar parts out of your hooves for days.
            Extra treats for Torrent‚Äôs good work
I was saying this yesterday. You stop on a dime if someone walks in front of you. There‚Äôs already animations for stumbling on all human sized and below creatures
They had this in the Ghost of Tsushima DLC, imagine if they put it in ER‚Äôs DLC üòáüôè
    I legit had a moment where I said "I thought that was added" and then realized I was thinking of GoT. Iki Island was such an amazing dlc.
        Right??? It really surprised me in terms of the story and content. I might have gotten just as emotionally invested, if not more so than I did with the core game, tbh. 

The core game was mostly us vs them. Good guys versus bad guys with us eventually caught in the middle. But the DLC was about looking at BOTH sides with equal amount of empathy. You both hated and somewhat forgave them for their sins. At least I did anyway
    I still have to play that fucking game I know I'm missing out big time.
        You really are. It's totally worth it. It was on sale, I want to say a few weeks ago, (PS store) for about $20, I think, and that was with everything, including the DLC. It was a steal.

I can‚Äôt believe no one is making a Rick and Morty Ghost Train Guy Comparison!?! ALLL ABBOOAAARRDDDDD
he does have collision physics so you can run through objects, similar to how jumping into stuff does like 1dam

I always said that would love to have the horses from around the world, some of them have an incredible design... when I first saw the horse from redmanes became in love with the armor for the horse, cucko knights also have a really beautiful design
    Agreed. I LARPed as a Cuckoo Knight towards the end of my first playthrough, and I felt so naked without the regal silver, red, and blue armor adorning my steed.
my dad is adamant torrent is a yak.
    It‚Äôs not a real animal, but it does look like a cross between a yak and a horse. Look up Watusi cow. Could also be a variation of that.

I know that but he SEEMS like a horse when riding him

That's all I'm sayin
My man a STALLION
You know, I've never thought about them having a connection. Makes more sense than Torrent being the only one of its kind.
    I saw the theory in a video but I can‚Äôt remember who made it! If anyone knows please drop the link.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve thought since launch. They‚Äôre absolutely related, Torrent is even a spirit himself.
I had this same thought when I first played, especially with how he jumps.
Bicorn? Which can only be ridden by the sinful/non-virgins right?

Cheer up everyone, we may be maidenless in the Lands Between but this means that our character must have fucked at least once before the game.
Came across your comment randomly... you called it
    XD I completely forgot about this. That's honestly hilarious.
I mean they do look somewhat similar and ancestor spirit definitely has the same air jump.  I really wish they had done a bit more with him, he‚Äôs a really unique mount.
I genuinely thought in my first fight with Ancestor Spirit, that the fight was going to be a way to upgrade Torrent in one way or another. Son, I am dissapoint.
    Huh- like he would abilities the more of them you fight?

My instincts are telling me that might have been the idea‚Ä¶. Maybe in an earlier concept he didn‚Äôt get double jump until after beating one, or something.  Generally speaking ‚Äúdouble jump‚Äù is a special unlock in games these days.
        Yeah, it would have been awesome to unlock another jump with those fights. Or the ability for him to absorb healing from dead spirit creatures. The triple jump was what I suspected though when I first did the fight.
            Reasonable thought.
    DOOD! That would have made these fights so much better. Faster sprinting, more health or stagger resistance, maybe a triple jump?

Or torrent auto-reviving beast type enemies that died in the vicinity to fight for you? Maybe the ability to make ancestral guardians non-hostile? They‚Äôre a pretty irrelevant enemy anyway, would‚Äôve been great to see the pack near the erdtree guardian go hostile on the guardian. I didn‚Äôt even think the ancestor worshippers were cool with the golden order.

Even just an actual trample charge like other mounted fighters can do would‚Äôve been awesome.

Edit: just saw your suggestion to make him heal too, another good one.
    I honestly thought you were going to be able to unlock triple and maybe even quadruple jumps because of the gravestones coming out of the side of the the cliffs and the regular double jump when it let me jump to a lot of them. But then my friend told me that those were just for dropping down safely.
Yes. I‚Äôve seen others mention it before I‚Äôm not taking credit for the idea, but the arena is so huge it really feels like something they were considering and decided against for some reason- maybe because of you slip up and get caught by a single stray star, torrents ridiculously huge stagger animations would probably lock you into auto-death. Lol.
I mean I imagine it's intentional to be harrowing to do mid combat.
    [deleted]
        Ngl I'd find being locked into an animation mid combat way more frustrating than the current option
            That's a good point, and if you aren't keeping track of Torrent's HP you may not realize when you need to use a flask. 

Tbh rather than this I'd have the 'Somewhere a heavy door has opened' dialogue disappear automatically. I cannot imagine why this isn't already the case. I've died several times to the fucking imps because I can't attack or roll while that text is there.
                Same with "stonesword key was lost with use"
                This

And it‚Äôs extra dumb because you can still move around so you don‚Äôt realize things are amiss until it‚Äôs too late
            It could grant invincibility while the animation is happening though, like when you perform a finishing move or whatever you‚Äôd call it
                then it wouldn't be harrowing, you could even use it to i-frame certain attacks too
        You can speed up pressing yes, you cant speed up an animation, so... skill issue.

    Bad UI design should not be used to punish the player.
    [deleted]
        People suck Miyazaki‚Äôs dick when it comes to any flaw in ER‚Äôs design. Yes yes we all know the game is a 10/10, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt have its issues. Any mention of this logic is a request to have ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs intentional‚Äù, and ‚Äúplay a different game‚Äù comments thrown at you.
    If the default option was YES instead of NO it'd be better tbh.
    It's never good design to intentionally make the UI cumbersome.
Exactly. I‚Äôd settle for just yes as the default
My inputs: Drink. No. Drink. No. Drink. No.

My thoughts: Why is this taking so long?

My reality: I was smashing the button so fast that I didn‚Äôt even notice the prompt until I was already about to die.
Because its a FromSoft game.
The lantern automaticlly being equiped when going into dark areas.
    I can see why it‚Äôs optional, though. The lantern definitely has a greater ranger for aggro and if it were automatic, that would ruin stealth runs.
        Yeah, it's also trivial to add it to your action bar or whatever and throw it on as necessary.
            I keep it in a pouch for that reason
                Yeah, pouch, that's what I was thinking of. Haven't played in a few months. I have mine set to O+down on all my characters (also have O and triangle switched because I had just come off Bloodborne).
    I want it to maintain its state when fast traveling. If I turn it on, keep it on until I turn it off.
I think it's to force you to take better care of torrent and use the item that heals him that I'm sure 99% of players (including myself)never used.
    I give it to him as treat from time to time
        Same! He‚Äôs such a good boy after all
    Exactly. By using rowa seeds that people have millions in their inventory, Torrent heals up a quarter of his health. People need to realise that.
        The disposable items are fairly useful but they take up an inventory slot
            I use my pouch for that
    I keep a stack of raisins and if Torrent is so much as nicked, I feed him. Or if we're both injured, I use a healing Incant on us. Sometimes I feed Torrent when his HP is full, just because he's a good boy.
        I went out of my way to find him the new raisins every time I found a new bush because the sweet boi deserves the best
    This is the first I'm hearing of an item that heals torrent other than the flask. 

I'd be willing to bet that most players don't use it because they don't know its there
        It's not even one item. 

There's 3 tiers of Rowa fruit/raisins.
        It‚Äôs one of the most common items you find in limgrave though (Rowafruit) ‚Äî probably it will be the first ingredient you find in game
        There‚Äôs heaps of great items in the game. I too used to be an inventory hoarder until I realised I was beating all the souls games with a full inventory at the end of the game that just gets‚Ä¶ wasted. Now I just pop whatever. Except for precious upgrade materials I‚Äôm still hoarding them.
        Cause it says it refills stamina. Not heath in the item description.
        Do you just go through the game without looking at half the things you pick up??
The annoying ass thing is that sometimes there is, like it seems kinda random as to when it asks
    It‚Äôs not random. It will only ask to use a crimson flask to summon Torrent if they took so much damage that their HP hit 0 (which would also cause you to dismounted). This is where the rowa fruit can be used to replenish HP if they took a few hits. I believe resting at graces refills their HP/revives them.
    Torrent dying and you getting knocked off Torrent look visually similar, but they're two different things. You only need to use a flask if Torrent actually dies, which in my experience is much less common than you getting knocked off.
        I think the only difference is there‚Äôs like a whinnying(is that the word for a horse cry?) sound when he dies. I could be wrong but I know there‚Äôs some subtle difference when he dies.

    Nice
How do you think he knows about it.
    magic, probably
    Miyazaki himself runs the channel
That's a good point.

But on the other hand, give Torrent that BS shoulder charge that the Nightrider horses do!
I‚Äôm sorry, *what?*
    Rowa raisins (crafted from rowa fruit) are the way to heal Torrent so that he doesn't despawn.
    Rowa berries are meant to heal Torrent.

Hardly ever necessary, but the option's there.
        I did it so much on my first playthru just cuz I love Torrent. (And I also fought a number of bosses on Torrent my first playthru.) THE BEST BOI
            [removed]
                He's the best. I loved feeding him and it was legit necessary cuz I was so scurred my whole first playthru. Thank god for strength and that shield counter R2 tech.
        I've never used them to heal, I just keep feeding him cause it's the only way to interact. GIVE US A PET BUTTON MICHAELZAKI I'M BEGGING YOU
        They are always necessary. Torrent carries us through hell and back without complaint even when dying because of our stupidity. The least we could do is toss a raisin to our Torrent whether he needs healing or not.

Yes, I do have the maximum number of raisins and fruit to make more, who do you ask?
    There is an item, you can use to recover Torrent's health, while riding him. It's a snowberries or something like that. Animation is pretty cute
There's 3 types of berries or rasins the darker they are the more they heal Torrent.
Yeah my torrent would probably be closer to lazy river if in game reflected all the berries he's been fed
Yo, any sort of torrent leveling/ upgrade system would be sick, even if it just slightly improved mounted stamina, health, jump height, and sprint speed
I'm now realizing... 200+ hours later... This isn't what I was doing.
    That's embarrassing
        Oh nooooooooo
    Same.
[deleted]
    I agree it is intuitive, but at the moment this change would break a ton of their hard-to-reach areas because you could effectively jump from any height and land safely down below.   
And they'd also have to rework their fall instakill zones and stop the death cam from triggering if there's any ground underneath.
        If you attack while falling it resets the timer for when you instantly die in mid air as you fall. This was important for the rune farm where you fall out of bound in Mogh's area as you needed to fall far enough off the map while still alive for the terrain to despawn and kill all the enemies on the area. I'm sad that they added terrain that blocks the path to the out of bounds zone.
            There is still a way to do the mohg palace jump, you can go up a wall near a laser skeleton, or down a wall near the grace near mohg.
            That kill timer is a different thing than the kill box, the kill timer is a backup failsafe mechanic for if you oob into an infinite fall and have no other way out, the kill boxes are put into map geometry by hand to insta kill you if you touch them to make deaths quicker if you fall from a very great height or an intended bottomless pit
        They could just do what breath of the wild did. Yes you could technically survive any fall with the paraglider but there were still areas that weren't part of the map and would insta-kill you. All the areas that you couldn't use torrent (every legacy dungeon and side dungeon) would not be affected by this change. It would only apply to the OPEN world. Honestly think it would be really cool.
            If we're being honest with ourselves, it's not like the perilous drops down cliffsides from one stone slab to the next for 4 full minutes making sure you dont fuck up really adds anything to the game. If I have the option to drop down to certain areas, I shouldn't have to play a mini-platformer every time
                Almost all platforms like this in the game are designed so that running off the edge without jumping will get you one step lower. Sometimes you do have to jump but the distance is always like ‚Äúone normal jump‚Äù and it shouldn‚Äôt take that much focus. Just something I noticed.
        Perhaps they could change the double jump's animation and effect so it factors in your current fall speed. Double jump at a low speed and it functions as it currently does. Double jump after you've been descending for a bit and most of the push will be forwards, without affecting your fall speed much at all.
Yeah, the map is very clearly designed around the fact that there is a maximum distance you can fall and survive, allowing double jump to reset that throws all that into the trash. I would be okay if double jumping cancelled any damage you would take if you would have already survived the fall but I think that would just be way more confusing.
    In that case, just use cat talisman or cotton item :D
because being on a horse is already enough of an advantage in the majority of combat situations where you're able to mount it
    Its a disadvantage for me. I literally cant play on horseback because without a dodge I just get hit by them. Like people fight against dragons on horseback. Like how?? I just cant they always have some weird attacks that oneshot me or torrent that I cant dodge
        If you fight on horseback, you should dash in for some hits and then get far away from the boss while they attack. I'd argue that dragons in the open world are actually designed to be fought with Torrent.
            I fell like they dont. I just cant dodge adulas blade for example. But its so easy to dodge on foot.
            Yeah I thought that was obvious, I don't know why people don't understand how to fight on horse. You just go in, hit once or twice, then dip and repeat. It's almost foolproof. The only real issues are the dragon breaths or stuff like that.
    It would be an advantage if torrent didn't have so little health and negative poise so he gets stunned forever and you get stunlocked to death
    Combat on torrent sucks. The hit stun animation is really long and there‚Äôs a couple bosses where I think you‚Äôre incentivized to use him (fire giant) but avoiding attacks on him is just not really feasible
    My friend I usually co-op with feels that way tok and I do NOT get it.

Being on Torrent during major fights is a death sentence for me 99% of the time.
        All you have to do while on torrent is go in, hit once or twice and dip. You go so fast that it's almost foolproof.
10/10
You wouldn't steal a bell bearing
And also dont have them effect anything like jump height/running speed. Purely cosmetic

        blood wings
Yes
Yeah he looks the happiest when that ancient dragon engulfs him in flames.
Yeah but no Torrent in multi-player :(  I was **sooo** disappointed.
Either weapons with a special "slot" for mounted Ashes of War, or possibly a great rune style slot for it, so it stays across all weapons (if compatible)
Todd howard played the long game.


HE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS!
You mean 5th
    Yeah but you got what I meant, wait does torrent only have 3 legs then EDIT: googled it he does have 4 legs
        [deleted]
            Mate this world's full of grafted Kings and snake man hybrids, not the most far fetched idea of 3 leg double jump
                Eh, I dunno. 4 I can believe the double jump. 3‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a bit of a stretch, right? ;)
You would deprive the challenge runners of killing the biggest enemies with only the torrent ram?

        We already do that. Attack its toes till it dies I mean XD
"Can he double jump off of thin air by creating a magical platform?"

"Yes."

"Can he headbutt things?"

"This might be a fantasy game Peter but let's respect some small notion of realism at least."
    Heheh funny.
Works on enemies larger, but if they're smaller they get launched away.
No, it should work on big guys.  It just won't trample them.
If it's larger you get to play motorcycle crash simulator
Horses trample people on the battlefield without the need to head butt them.  Just give him the ability to trample too.
    Yes, but why give horns if no stabby with horns
    Imagine farming for runes outside bestial sanctum if torrent could trample. You‚Äôd be picking vulgar parts out of your hooves for days.
        Extra treats for Torrent‚Äôs good work
I legit had a moment where I said "I thought that was added" and then realized I was thinking of GoT. Iki Island was such an amazing dlc.
    Right??? It really surprised me in terms of the story and content. I might have gotten just as emotionally invested, if not more so than I did with the core game, tbh. 

The core game was mostly us vs them. Good guys versus bad guys with us eventually caught in the middle. But the DLC was about looking at BOTH sides with equal amount of empathy. You both hated and somewhat forgave them for their sins. At least I did anyway
I still have to play that fucking game I know I'm missing out big time.
    You really are. It's totally worth it. It was on sale, I want to say a few weeks ago, (PS store) for about $20, I think, and that was with everything, including the DLC. It was a steal.
Agreed. I LARPed as a Cuckoo Knight towards the end of my first playthrough, and I felt so naked without the regal silver, red, and blue armor adorning my steed.
It‚Äôs not a real animal, but it does look like a cross between a yak and a horse. Look up Watusi cow. Could also be a variation of that.

        Damn, 40 minutes too late...
Your dad is right
Donkeh!
I saw the theory in a video but I can‚Äôt remember who made it! If anyone knows please drop the link.
XD I completely forgot about this. That's honestly hilarious.
Huh- like he would abilities the more of them you fight?

My instincts are telling me that might have been the idea‚Ä¶. Maybe in an earlier concept he didn‚Äôt get double jump until after beating one, or something.  Generally speaking ‚Äúdouble jump‚Äù is a special unlock in games these days.
    Yeah, it would have been awesome to unlock another jump with those fights. Or the ability for him to absorb healing from dead spirit creatures. The triple jump was what I suspected though when I first did the fight.
        Reasonable thought.
DOOD! That would have made these fights so much better. Faster sprinting, more health or stagger resistance, maybe a triple jump?

Or torrent auto-reviving beast type enemies that died in the vicinity to fight for you? Maybe the ability to make ancestral guardians non-hostile? They‚Äôre a pretty irrelevant enemy anyway, would‚Äôve been great to see the pack near the erdtree guardian go hostile on the guardian. I didn‚Äôt even think the ancestor worshippers were cool with the golden order.

Even just an actual trample charge like other mounted fighters can do would‚Äôve been awesome.

Edit: just saw your suggestion to make him heal too, another good one.
I honestly thought you were going to be able to unlock triple and maybe even quadruple jumps because of the gravestones coming out of the side of the the cliffs and the regular double jump when it let me jump to a lot of them. But then my friend told me that those were just for dropping down safely.

    Ngl I'd find being locked into an animation mid combat way more frustrating than the current option
        That's a good point, and if you aren't keeping track of Torrent's HP you may not realize when you need to use a flask. 

Tbh rather than this I'd have the 'Somewhere a heavy door has opened' dialogue disappear automatically. I cannot imagine why this isn't already the case. I've died several times to the fucking imps because I can't attack or roll while that text is there.
            Same with "stonesword key was lost with use"
            This

And it‚Äôs extra dumb because you can still move around so you don‚Äôt realize things are amiss until it‚Äôs too late
        It could grant invincibility while the animation is happening though, like when you perform a finishing move or whatever you‚Äôd call it
            then it wouldn't be harrowing, you could even use it to i-frame certain attacks too
    You can speed up pressing yes, you cant speed up an animation, so... skill issue.

Bad UI design should not be used to punish the player.
[deleted]
    People suck Miyazaki‚Äôs dick when it comes to any flaw in ER‚Äôs design. Yes yes we all know the game is a 10/10, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt have its issues. Any mention of this logic is a request to have ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs intentional‚Äù, and ‚Äúplay a different game‚Äù comments thrown at you.
If the default option was YES instead of NO it'd be better tbh.
It's never good design to intentionally make the UI cumbersome.
I can see why it‚Äôs optional, though. The lantern definitely has a greater ranger for aggro and if it were automatic, that would ruin stealth runs.
    Yeah, it's also trivial to add it to your action bar or whatever and throw it on as necessary.
        I keep it in a pouch for that reason
            Yeah, pouch, that's what I was thinking of. Haven't played in a few months. I have mine set to O+down on all my characters (also have O and triangle switched because I had just come off Bloodborne).

And it‚Äôs extra dumb because you can still move around so you don‚Äôt realize things are amiss until it‚Äôs too late
    It could grant invincibility while the animation is happening though, like when you perform a finishing move or whatever you‚Äôd call it
        then it wouldn't be harrowing, you could even use it to i-frame certain attacks too
You can speed up pressing yes, you cant speed up an animation, so... skill issue.

People suck Miyazaki‚Äôs dick when it comes to any flaw in ER‚Äôs design. Yes yes we all know the game is a 10/10, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt have its issues. Any mention of this logic is a request to have ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs intentional‚Äù, and ‚Äúplay a different game‚Äù comments thrown at you.
Yeah, it's also trivial to add it to your action bar or whatever and throw it on as necessary.
    I keep it in a pouch for that reason
        Yeah, pouch, that's what I was thinking of. Haven't played in a few months. I have mine set to O+down on all my characters (also have O and triangle switched because I had just come off Bloodborne).
Same! He‚Äôs such a good boy after all
The disposable items are fairly useful but they take up an inventory slot
    I use my pouch for that
I went out of my way to find him the new raisins every time I found a new bush because the sweet boi deserves the best
It's not even one item. 

There's 3 tiers of Rowa fruit/raisins.
It‚Äôs one of the most common items you find in limgrave though (Rowafruit) ‚Äî probably it will be the first ingredient you find in game
There‚Äôs heaps of great items in the game. I too used to be an inventory hoarder until I realised I was beating all the souls games with a full inventory at the end of the game that just gets‚Ä¶ wasted. Now I just pop whatever. Except for precious upgrade materials I‚Äôm still hoarding them.
Cause it says it refills stamina. Not heath in the item description.
Do you just go through the game without looking at half the things you pick up??
I think the only difference is there‚Äôs like a whinnying(is that the word for a horse cry?) sound when he dies. I could be wrong but I know there‚Äôs some subtle difference when he dies.

WHERE IS IT??!
    In the Altus plateau just outside the capital. Look it up it‚Äôs called like ‚Äòlightning ram‚Äô or something
Is it possible to learn this power?
Also the default claymore skill looks pretty close
U mean JET POWERED TORRENT?
The ass of Frenzied Flame
I did it so much on my first playthru just cuz I love Torrent. (And I also fought a number of bosses on Torrent my first playthru.) THE BEST BOI

        He's the best. I loved feeding him and it was legit necessary cuz I was so scurred my whole first playthru. Thank god for strength and that shield counter R2 tech.
I've never used them to heal, I just keep feeding him cause it's the only way to interact. GIVE US A PET BUTTON MICHAELZAKI I'M BEGGING YOU
They are always necessary. Torrent carries us through hell and back without complaint even when dying because of our stupidity. The least we could do is toss a raisin to our Torrent whether he needs healing or not.

Yes, I do have the maximum number of raisins and fruit to make more, who do you ask?
Oh nooooooooo
If you attack while falling it resets the timer for when you instantly die in mid air as you fall. This was important for the rune farm where you fall out of bound in Mogh's area as you needed to fall far enough off the map while still alive for the terrain to despawn and kill all the enemies on the area. I'm sad that they added terrain that blocks the path to the out of bounds zone.
    There is still a way to do the mohg palace jump, you can go up a wall near a laser skeleton, or down a wall near the grace near mohg.
    That kill timer is a different thing than the kill box, the kill timer is a backup failsafe mechanic for if you oob into an infinite fall and have no other way out, the kill boxes are put into map geometry by hand to insta kill you if you touch them to make deaths quicker if you fall from a very great height or an intended bottomless pit
They could just do what breath of the wild did. Yes you could technically survive any fall with the paraglider but there were still areas that weren't part of the map and would insta-kill you. All the areas that you couldn't use torrent (every legacy dungeon and side dungeon) would not be affected by this change. It would only apply to the OPEN world. Honestly think it would be really cool.
    If we're being honest with ourselves, it's not like the perilous drops down cliffsides from one stone slab to the next for 4 full minutes making sure you dont fuck up really adds anything to the game. If I have the option to drop down to certain areas, I shouldn't have to play a mini-platformer every time
        Almost all platforms like this in the game are designed so that running off the edge without jumping will get you one step lower. Sometimes you do have to jump but the distance is always like ‚Äúone normal jump‚Äù and it shouldn‚Äôt take that much focus. Just something I noticed.
Perhaps they could change the double jump's animation and effect so it factors in your current fall speed. Double jump at a low speed and it functions as it currently does. Double jump after you've been descending for a bit and most of the push will be forwards, without affecting your fall speed much at all.
If you fight on horseback, you should dash in for some hits and then get far away from the boss while they attack. I'd argue that dragons in the open world are actually designed to be fought with Torrent.
    I fell like they dont. I just cant dodge adulas blade for example. But its so easy to dodge on foot.
    Yeah I thought that was obvious, I don't know why people don't understand how to fight on horse. You just go in, hit once or twice, then dip and repeat. It's almost foolproof. The only real issues are the dragon breaths or stuff like that.
All you have to do while on torrent is go in, hit once or twice and dip. You go so fast that it's almost foolproof.

    Mate this world's full of grafted Kings and snake man hybrids, not the most far fetched idea of 3 leg double jump
        Eh, I dunno. 4 I can believe the double jump. 3‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a bit of a stretch, right? ;)
Lmao like the meme of the turtle attacking peoples' shoes ü§£ü§£
    Only the black shoesüíÄ
The Lego tactic!
We already do that. Attack its toes till it dies I mean XD
Extra treats for Torrent‚Äôs good work
no
    :(
        shame upon you
            :(
Damn, 40 minutes too late...
Reasonable thought.
That's a good point, and if you aren't keeping track of Torrent's HP you may not realize when you need to use a flask. 

Tbh rather than this I'd have the 'Somewhere a heavy door has opened' dialogue disappear automatically. I cannot imagine why this isn't already the case. I've died several times to the fucking imps because I can't attack or roll while that text is there.
