[[Did George R. R. Martin do this on purpose]]


The name of every main character in this game starts with G, R or M which is the first letters of
  George R. R. Martins


Also the letters are more similar the more related they are:

Radagon + Renalla = Ranni, Radahn, Rykard

Marika's children are Malenia, Miquella, Melina, Morgott, Mohg,

and Godwyn, who is son of Godfrey
    And Godrick and Gostoc are descendants of Godfrey
        Ain't no way I just learned that Gostoc is also a descendent of Godfrey??
            The quest that would confirm it directly was cut, but Godrick and Gostoc do look quite similar, and there's a reason Gostoc can just *order* the gates to be open.
                Good point on the gates, but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.  
  
Plus, their relationship didn't seem that great.  I took it more like he was saying they had an easy prisoner if the gates were opened.
                    What about Godrick makes you think he'd be a good dad? But despite their relationship, Gostoc would still be the heir and therefore of some value to Godrick - if only as a source of high-quality grafting materials (at least breeding-wise). Like, a paranoid coward like Godrick wouldn't put some random peasant who hates his guts in charge of the gates.
                        >What about Godrick makes you think he'd be a good dad?  
  
Nothing about being good really, more the fact that he's the weakest of his family, and thus would be the most interested in having some other semi formidable fighters around.  
  
More it's interesting to me that Gostoc has no grafted parts, and may or may not have lost a hand to grafting.  While the regular soldiers in the castle have been augmented, such as the blades on the birds and the grafted enemy and such.

                                Given the second ass kicking he took in his castle getting assaulted by something from the ocean (looks like a sea creature hit it), maybe he should be rethinking that.

                            Godrick is actually the opposite. He’s not only the weakest, but he’s the most cowardly in his family. He’s terrified that anyone with a modicum of strength will try to take the little bit of power he’s managed to take for himself, so he surrounds himself with peons. He ensures that everyone around him is either far weaker than him, or under his direct control. Rather than having powerful fighters assist him, he takes their limbs and grafts them onto himself for the small fraction of their strength that gives him
                        Don't forget he has the ability to steal your runes
                    >but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.

It's only a hand, and there's no proof it was taken for grafting. Gostoc steals your runes when you die and his merchant inventory hints that he stole those items as well. Having a hand cut off was a punishment for thieves in older days.
                    Just because they’re related doesn’t mean they get along. Don’t you have relatives you loathe?
                    You can actually find Gostoc following you through stormveil leading up to Godrick fight. As you're walking up to him in these three spots, his idle dialogue would suggest that he's examining body parts for his own desire to graft. If you also attack him at the start and he kills you, he will say that he'll take good care of your parts. Credit to VaatiVidya for that knowledge.
                    >but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.  

Why? If Godrick is so obsessed with his royal heritage, his own son would also have that golden lineage blood.
                If it was cut then he isn't. It's literally not in the game.
                    It's literally in the game, just not in a way that's accessible without outside tools. And if we only considered the text when researching lore, there wouldn't *be* any lore. So many youtubers would lose their jobs. 13+ hour long part one video woud be ten minutes long. We would never see Strider ported into the Lands Between. Etc.
                        This is absolutely delusional. It was left in the code but it's clearly not in the game since you need to bloody hack it to see it in its raw form. You can't acces it through gameplay, how can you even argue it's part of the game?
                            Cut content in these games often comes back as dlc. Big L for you no more lore 4 you
                                Then it's not cut anymore...
                                    See?  Now you're getting it! Ya fucking onion
                            The phrasing was "literally in the game", not "accessible normally through gameplay". And *literally*? It's in the game.
                                If it's called cut content, then explain what was it cut *from*? It's in the code, not in the game. Devs clearly didn't want this to be part of it.
                                    It was cut from the game, of course!


However, that doesn't mean it's been removed, it was just hidden. Still in the game files, with partial dialogue and voices, and mechanical stuff - scripts and shit, unlike anything the devs actually didn't want to use. And there are many reasons something they really wanted to use would be cut - maybe not enough time, maybe it was interfering with other events, maybe they didn't want to overcrowd Limgrave with quests.


My point is - it's still in the game, it wasn't just some first draft stuff discarded at the planning stage, effort was clearly put into it, it can be modded in if you know the game dev sorcery (like that guy fromsoftserve who re-remasters DS1 on youtube), or it could even be added later by FS themselves, now that they had time to work on it! (Wishful thinking). That's the reason why cut content like that is generally accepted as canon.
                How does he look similar? He has same model and outfit like all the other commoners 😅
            Yeah Godstoc was the family pet
                I thought that was godrick
                    Nah, that was Rick, Soldier of God.
            Go back into Godrick's arena after sitting at a grace (might need to pass time/sit outside the arena), but before completing Nepheli's questline.

Gostoc can be found talking mad shit over Godrick's nubby corpse.

So, double TiL, gostoc has daddy issues.

Triple, TiL (maybe not for you but for those unaware, at least): nepheli loux, descendant of Hoarah loux, Warrior, would be a sibling of godrick.

This is why she gets the crown and stormveil in her questline. That detail is not very nuanced and I'm skipping over a few things, but ye.
                Isn't that mentioned directly in her questline that they need someone from that family line?  It's right after you clear the guys castle I thought.
                    It says that godrick usurped the throne. Iirc, it never says who from but only that nepheli is heir, later revealed. 

We don't even learn of Hoarah loux until right at the end of the storyline. Not to mention From notoriously does not hold up flashing signs that point to these details; there's a ton of gaps but just enough solid info to cause great debates lol
                        >We don't even learn of Hoarah loux until right at the end of the storyline

He's in the opening cutscene when you start the game...
                            I'm gonna level with you. It's been like two years since I watched that. Was he called Hoarah loux or Godfrey in that video?
                                They refer to him as Hoarah Loux. It's the image of him and Serosh being crucified
                                He's referred to as "Hoarah Loux, Chieftain of the Badlands"
                    Kenneth mentions that, but I think Nepheli just says it’s because she command the hawk that only obeys said bloodline. She just wonders why the hawk listens to her I think.
                >Triple, TiL (maybe not for you but for those unaware, at least): nepheli loux, descendant of Hoarah loux, Warrior, would be a sibling of godrick.

Nice catch!

What makes Sir Gideon Ofnir though? Isn't he her daddy?
                    Adopted
                    Adoptive daddy.

He says he "took her in" at a young age.
                    Others have answered, but the various dialogue with gideon and nepheli reveals a few things.

Nepheli was part of a village that was massacred, much like the albinauric village under moonlight altar, which left her not just orphaned, but completely alone.

Gideon took her in and raised her, making her loyal to the roundtable hold until she found what Gideon did to the albinauric village in the name of his own pursuits. This is why she feels betrayed and can be found in the lower parts of the hold feeling dejected and lost. And Gideon does not care. So fourth fun fact, nepheli also has daddy issues lol.

I'm still missing some information myself on the link between the spirit ashes you give her that leads her to stormveil, but at face value she becomes the lord of the castle and swears fealty to you because you cheered her up with N O S T A L G I A!

Shame that didn't mean you could summon her more often as a cooperator... you know, versus the alternative ending where you can summon her pretty freely.
                        Nepheli and Gideon have known each other Nepheli's whole life as Nepheli says but Gideon specifies he didn't adopt her until she lost her grace. After they had both lived out their first lives, died and then after the Shattering were resurrected to come back to the Lands Between and eventually Nepheli like most Tarnished in the game beside Gideon and Godfrey, lost her grace again. He didn't raise her per se.
                Hey, so that's foreshadowing Hoarah Loux identity as well! I never connected the dots.
                >Triple, TiL (maybe not for you but for those unaware, at least): nepheli loux, descendant of Hoarah loux, Warrior, would be a sibling of godrick.

Not a sibling at all. More like a distant cousin of some sort. Nepheli Loux probably is a child of Godfrey's Hoarah Loux persona, and has nothing to do with Marika.
                    TiL if my dad has a child with someone, who is not my mom, that doesn't make the child a half-sibling but


>More like a distant cousin of some sort.

Get out of here, my guy! If you said daughter of Godfrey's sibling, Gregory Loux, then yeah that would make her a cousin of godrick.

No such sibling is named, the only person carrying that name is hoarah. The implication, as you state yourself is that nepheli is Hoarah's daughter. This means when Hoarah/Godfrey sired Godrick with Marika, that makes Godfrey's daughter Godricks half-sibling
                        >TiL if my dad has a child with someone, who is not my mom, that doesn't make the child a half-sibling but

Godrick isn't Godfrey's child.

>This means when Hoarah/Godfrey sired Godrick with Marika,

He didn't though... godrick is a distant descendant of Godfrey. This is made explicit in game dialogue.

>The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika. Godrick the Grafted was but a distant relation... The runt of the litter, his divine blood sorely diluted".
            Even more important: is godrick and godefroy related?
            It’s confirmed by cut content. There’s a cut line of dialogue where Gostoc straight up says “I am the son of Godrick” or something along those lines. I chose to believe it’s canon though.
        Where is the lore for Gostoc being a descendant? Not saying he isn’t but is there an item or dialogue that confirms that?
            They're referencing cut content. People tend to canonize cut quest lines, but FROM intentionally cut it out of the game so if they didn't want it in the game, then it's not canon.  [V-Limit made a video discussing all the cut content surrounding Gostoc](https://youtu.be/LadiFWjWhMI?si=w6pV4gjAum_yHKMa)
                Gostoc does look like Godrick though, and he's clearly got a personal grudge against Godrick too. Also that creepy line about doing anything he wants - why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?
                    >Also that creepy line about doing anything he wants - why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?


I can see why some people tend to canonize cut content, sometimes it makes more sense than what they ended up leaving in.
                        It would be easier to dismiss if it was completely cut
                        The creepy line wasn't cut.
                            I know, that's not what I meant. 


Gastocs current version, where he says that line, makes more sense when paired with the original cut content. Without it, what he says doesn't really make any sense if the final version is supposed to be just some random little dude running around. If he's a part of Godrick's lineage, then naturally the line makes sense.
                                It makes sense on its own. The Lord of the castle he resides in has been killed, and he had no heir. There's no one left with authority over Gostoc, so he's free to do as he likes. The 'cut content' changes the context.
                        I completely agree with you, but just because something makes more sense doesn't make it canon. Especially in this context when it wasn't disclosed that their familial relation was found in a cut quest. I like Gostoc's cut quests they're very interesting, and I hope a lot of the discovered cut quest lines end up being restored in SotE.
                            I'm completely in favour of disregarding cut content if was replaced or the context for it was changed, but in this case they just pruned the quest a bit, with seemingly no changes to the remaining ending or any of the npcs related to it. It's basically cannon.
                                >It's basically cannon


You're free to head-canonize whatever you'd like, but like I said earlier if you need a PC + external software to support your claim of what's canon or not, it's not canon. If you can't boot up Elden Ring right now and support the claim being made, it cannot be considered 'canon.' Canon should only include things that can be verified within the confines of the game we can all boot up and play right now.(ex - Ranni is an Empyrean. Placidusaxx was an Elden Lord. Radagon is preventing our entry to the Erdtree.) Everything else is conjecture, speculation, or theory. (Ex -Melina is the GEQ. Miquella is St Trina. Marika helped orchestrate the NotBK)

I'm not trying to be a hard ass about this, exploring the conjecture, theory, and speculation spaces this game provides the player is why I love these games so much! However, there does need distinctions between these concepts or you end up with people proudly proclaiming shit about the game that isn't technically true.
                                    100%. i was going to say, 'idk why you're being downvoted' but i do know. stop disrupting the head canon!

not that this is datamining related, but this all harkens back to when people were taking the ancientDragon=aldia to be canon, during dks2 vanilla days. there was no text to support it, just a bunch of wildly formed connections.
                        Same with the cut content about the nomadic merchants being blamed for worshipping the frenzy flame. It’s all in a cut quest for Kale. There’s still stuff in game for it tho like the dead merchants in the shunning grounds and the nomadic merchant in Altus who uses frenzy flame incantations
                    >why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?

You're asking a question about cut content relating back to other cut content. You're welcome to canonize Gostoc and Godrick being related, the only point I was trying to make is that the theory originates from cut content and anything that derives from that should be taken with a dump truck amount of salt. It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line. Sure, it might be restored in some fashion in the DLC, but until then it's just fanfic.
                        I was talking about this line:


>Now, I supposed I'm free. I can do whatever takes my fancy...Can't I, mate?


Which is not cut content. I remembered it being a bit more in favour of that hypothesis - something more like "I can do whatever I want *with this place*". Still, the rest - the name, the face, the personal connection etc - is enough for me.
                            He can do what he wants because you murdered the Lord of the castle. That doesn't insinuate anything about them being related. 

>Still, the rest - the name, the face, the personal connection etc - is enough for me.

And that's totally fine by me! I have my own crazy theories about the game that rely on speculation, it's why these games are as fun to delve into as they are. I replied with the 'its not canon' comment because the initial reply stating that Gostoc and Godrick are related stated it as fact instead of simply saying "We actually don't know, but, there's cut content in the game suggesting ____" 

That comment has like +200 upvotes. People are gonna see that little fun fact and start spewing it around, and now, something that was intentionally removed from the game for one reason or another, is being spread as fact. It's not a fact, the 'fact' is supported by content you cannot access without a PC and third party software because the developers did not want you to see it.
                        >It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line

Just because some connections got cut, doesn't mean all of it's gone. The lilies and fevor's cookbook still clearly show a very strong connection. 

"A record of crafting techniques left by a man who was utterly captivated by St. Trina. He continued the search for her in his slumber.

Acquire the knowledge to craft the following:

- Bewitching Branch"
                            >Just because some connections got cut, doesn't mean all of it's gone. The lilies and fevor's cookbook still clearly show a very strong connection. 

I would love for you to read my comment in its entirety, because no where did I say they cut the whole thing out. I'm fully aware of the subtle inferences the game makes towards things we speculate on in the game, but we're not talking about that, we're talking about things the game explicitly explains to us. Neither Gostoc being related to Godrick nor St Trina being Miquella is directly stated in the current version of the game, and until otherwise both theories have to rely on using speculation, conjecture, or data mining. For as much as this game relies on ambiguity the community sure seems to struggle with differentiating between the things the game tells us outright(canon) and the popular theories the community has come up with to help with the cohesion of the overarching story. Both are great, but they aren't the same thing. St Trina in the current version of the game is basically an irrelevant character. The only reason that theory got the community's attention IS the cut quest line relating to her.
                                >It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line

It is not *all* from a cut questline though. Sure, the things that directly, explicitely state Miquella is Trina are cut. But not all the strong connections are cut.

>I would love for you to read my comment in its entirety

I did. 



>For as much as this game relies on ambiguity the community sure seems to struggle with differentiating between the things the game tells us outright(canon) and the popular theories the community has come up with

Well I don't? So? I'm literally just saying that there are strong points in favour of Miquella being Trina that didn't get cut. Which is true.

Even without the cut quest, the lilies are an extremely obvious connection, as is the fact that a fevor's cookbook is given to us when we find Miquella, and it lets us craft a Miquella item. I genuinely don't even know much of anything about the cut questline.
                                    I hope I'm not coming off that I'm arguing that the current subtle references between Miquella and St Trina don't exist, because they do and I see them.  Within the confines of the game, there's enough there to make the player ask the question, 'hey what's the deal with these two?' My point is that the references aren't concrete enough to say with absolute certainty that they are the exact same person. You keep saying otherwise so at this point we're debating how to define a fact and I'm not interested in that sort of conversation.
                I mean, cut content can certainly be contradicted later without repercussion, but generally cut content at that point is going to have lore written into whatever is officially referenced for the game.  And the content is cut for other reasons such as time, game pacing, technical issues, quality, or other reasons.
                    Regardless of the reason, it was cut. Cut content can provide context of the development cycle and plans for certain aspects of the game, but at the end of the day it didn't make the final product of the game, and referencing assets that aren't accessible in the main game to answer questions we have is incredibly risky. If you need more proof of why this is a bad idea, using cut content to support 'the canon', look into the development of ds3 and how often they shuffled around bosses and rewrote lore to make the final product we got work. It gets messy quick. Unless you're a dev for FROM, the multitude of reasons you gave for why content gets cut should be the precise reasons as to not take cut content seriously. We simply don't know.
                        >If you need more proof of why this is a bad idea, using cut content to support 'the canon'  
  
And yet, that's actual storyline material that was at least written at some point.  Just looking at in game assets doesn't always make some material canon either, for example look at the pillars with symbols on them underground that people made elaborate theories on only to later realize it was an asset that anyone could purchase and use.
                            >that's actual storyline material that was at least written at some point.

storyline material that was deliberately deleted before they released the game.

&#x200B;

>look at the pillars with symbols on them underground that people made elaborate theories on only to later realize it was an asset that anyone could purchase and use.

What do you mean?   You don't have to create 100% of your assets you assign meaning to that you use in a video game. For all you and I know, that asset looking close to the symbolism they were trying to convey was the exact reason they went with it. They can create whatever association they want within the context of the game, it doesn't matter that the same asset is used in Destiny. We're not playing Destiny. To the flip side of this, and yet it could very well just be a cool ass generic pillar they wanted to use and didn't think twice about it. It can go either way, depending on how immersed you want to get in the game.  Debating whether or not assets were meant to convey a deeper meaning isn't the same as whether or not cut dialogue or quests should be taken as the game canon.
                Ahhh, yeah I haven’t paid attention to data mines and cut content, so that explains it. Feels a bit weird to include since there is a reason it is not included, but can definitely be an interesting thing to analyze and it makes some sense in this case
                    I 100% agree with you. Context matters!
            He can order the gates to open, means he has some authority.
            There isn't concrete lore.

It's pretty much this:

-Gostoc is one of the very few characters in the game with "go" as the start of his name. 

-Gostoc has some sort of position of power.

-Gostoc knows Godrick personally, and despises him.

-Gostoc looks somewhat like Godrick, with his pale, saggy skin and white long hair.

-when he kills the player he says: "Oh, don't worry, I've got big plans for what's left of you..."

Godrick is looking for tarnished limbs to graft. So when Gostoc says he has big plans with your body, I'd assume it's because he wants to graft your parts onto himself. 


I'd say it's just as possible that Gostoc is Godrick's brother or nephew or something. I at least think it makes a lot of sense for him to be closely related to Godrick.
        Wait Godrick isn't one of his kids
            Great great great [...] Great grandkids
                Ok, but is Marika the great  great ... grandmother then?
        Also Godefroy is descended from that line, right? Or am I going insane?
            Yes, Godefroy as well
        Pro tip: in elden ring, if the names are alliterative then they're related
        I wonder if gostoc and Godrick are brothers and maybe godrick was the "blessed brother" who was able to graft, and he used this ability to take gostocs arm to prove a point and show his superiority?
            Gostoc is his son according to cut dialogues
        And Godefroy
        And Godefroy
        What about Godefroy?
        Even Nepheli is.
        What about Godfroy?
    It all makes sense now. Rick, Soldier of God is part of Radagon's family tree
    Mohg and Morgott are also Godfrey's sons.
        yeah i wanted to separate them from Godwyn

if their names started with G's, Marika&Godfrey would have 3 daughters(strating with M) and 3 sons (starting with G), the sons would take their fathers letter, and daughters would take their mothers letter, im not sure why these two imbalance it

maybe because they're cursed omen? maybe because they're not as close to Godfrey? they probably couldnt become king because they're Omen so they couldnt be his successor?
            I'd guess it's to exclude them from the Golden lineage, since the omen brother's were hidden down in the sewers. The people of the lands between didn't know about them.

And then later Morgott rose as the veiled monarch, and people seemed to hold him in high steem even though they never saw him. But if he was Godgott i'd bet people would want to meet this dude and find out his a disgusting omen.
                Most likely this. Mohg and Morgott also sounds nasty too, comparing to something like Godwyn
                    It sounds straight out of Tolkien's names for evil things, lol. If you're not familiar with Tolkien, Morgoth was the first dark lord in his legendarium, and his main liutenant, lord of balrogs, was Gothmog.
                Gorgott and Gohg would have been funny names 😂
            Miquella is a boy (even if he has his alter ego that's fem), but it seems the correlation is they take after merikas name if they are cursed at birth. The Godfry naming convention would have all been born normal and then been fucked up later
            Marika and Godfrey don't have 3 daughters, Malenia and Miquella are children of Marika and Radagon, also, Miquella isn't even a girl, he's multiple times mentioned as a young boy with female traces, and about Melina, since there's no much information of her, it is wrong to say that she is also Marika's daughter, it is still too early for that, and for now it is just a theory
    And possibly millicent.
        Millicent is more of a shoot. She has other sisters whom are considered imperfect versions. Just like plant life
            And they, of course are named Millicent, Maureen, Mary, Amy, and Polyanna
        Milicent and her sisters are like bog creatures who just sort of emerged out of the primordial soup of Malenias red swamp

Putting that together like that makes it feel like there's some sort of menstrual metaphor going on actually. Maybe something leftover from bloodborne where that was a big thing.
    >and Godwyn, who is her only human male child     




Then what the fuck is Miquella
        a guy? mmh i was sure they're a woman, i see them in my sleep sometimes, st. trina...
    Wait... Are we now hard assuming that Melina is Marika's kid?!

I could also be way slow and behind the times as I don't find her all that interesting but what supporting evidence is there if any?
        On top of her name being a hint like all the other characters, Melina telling us her mother is inside the Erdtree, and Melina's whole purpose (given to her by her mother) is to help burn down the Erdtree and finish what Marika started, there's also the matter of the butterflies. There's three types of butterflies in the game: Aeonian (rotted) for Malenia, Nascent (eternally young) for Miquella, and Smoldering (fiery) for Melina.

Honestly, there are way more obtuse theories that are just basically accepted as gospel by the community, I don't understand why Melina being Marika's daughter is so obscure to so many people.
            I’ve always assumed that Melina is the “human” side of Marika, whereas the part controlled by the Golden Order remains chained. The reason Melina sacrifices herself is to fix her own mistakes.

I do not discard the daughter theory, but it has always made more sense to me that Marika herself would be Melina, rather than an previously unknown child made for the express purpose of sacrificing itself.
            not to mention that, with Marika and Radagon being kind of sort of the same person, all three of their kids had some huge abnormalities. Miquella stayed a child forever, Malenia was born with the scarlet rot, and Melina either burned to death or only exists as a sort of ghost next to sites of grace (bonfires).
                Very true, I did leave that out from my comment, but excellent point.
            i feel like it’s directly stated by the game lmfao didn’t realize it was considered a theory
            Honestly I just never considered it and I totally forgot about the butterflies theory. 

Melina is just so poorly utilized given her importance and comes ide as a brat so I just disliked her entirely.

But that's for the reply!
        She's referred to as "MaricaOfDaughter" in the game files. 

That doesn't mean they couldn't have changed it at some point (I think Roderika is referred to as "Farnese", after the Berserk character she was inspired by), but it's a very strong lead.
            Right but if we did that the misbegotten also are named children of Radagon (presumably discarded bastards). Which honestly fully explains why they have 3 of the Legendary armaments.

Side note Fromsofts cut content always is the stuff that went so hard.
                Radagon seriously got around. 

If we take the game files as gospel, the misbegotten may have been created as punishment for Radagon making contact with the Crucible, so maybe Melina was born in a similar way, when Marica made contact with the Frenzied Flame.
                    Now that's some head cannon I can get into. The fact she has no cut content and her entire life is a whiny brat still agitated me. If you go under the assumption she just wants to get it over with and you happen to be the best option then sure? Maybe I get her lack of involvement in any of this?
                        Yeah, it's strange that she's one of the most mysterious NPCs and she's with us for 80% of the game. 

We do know why she chooses to travel with the player, however. It's because Torrent approved of us. She's just deferring to his judgement.
        Did she not say her mother remains in the Erdtree or something?
            Well anyone who dies is absorbed into the Erdtree again so while sure she could be vague about it I would have no idea why she would be.
        There are plenty of strong reasons to believe Melina is Marika's daughter.

Melina uses the moveset of the black knives. They are Numen, just like Marika.

Melina uses a unique erdtree incantation, which would indicate she is strongly connected to the erdtree. Of all characters besides Melina, Marika is most strongly connected to the erdtree.

Melina can speak Marika's echoes.

Melina's name is clearly quite similar to Malenia, Miquella and Marika. Going by the naming conventions of the game, she's a demigod with Marika's blood in her.

"Me, I'm searching for my purpose given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree long ago"

Hmmmm, do we know of a motherly figure who is inside the erdtree??
    This is not uncommon in fantasy literature, Tolkien did it way before grrm.

Gimli, gloin, groin
Aragorn, arathorn, arador
        And FromSoft has done it since at least dark souls. Gwyn, Gwyndolin, Gwynevere
        Finwë, Findis, Fingolfin, Finarfin, Fingon, Finrod, Finduilas
    Marika was the cursed one all along???????
    >and Godwyn, who is her only human male child, and is son of Godfrey

Arent Morgott and Mohg sons of Godfrey too, and the whole reason Marika didn't want any more children from Godfrey / humans?
    God I love this game
    Omen ARE human, just a little extra horny
    I don't think Godwyn is human lol.
    And Godefroy who’s TOTALLY canon right guys haha
    Godwyn was a demigod not human and since nephli comes from his bloodline from before he was elden lord they wouldn't be siblings at all she becomes the lord of stormveil because it's implied she's also the bloodline of the first lord because you give her the storm hawk ashes the lord could've been horaux but that's muddled by alot of other descriptions
        Nelphi is daughter to Godfrey.
            I'm pretty sure shes his granddaughter not his daughter but still she's not a child of Marika so she's not really a sibling to godrick at all
                I think it was confirmed but I may be wrong.
                    I'm not sure what you mean was confirmed?
                        Naah, it's like she "might" be Godfrey's daughter so it is not 100% certain.
                            Yea I thought when you talked to her through the quest she or Gideon mentions being the granddaughter of a chieftain which would be Horah loux but it's been a while since I did her quest
                                Yeah that's what I had in mind. But I don't know if Gideon said daughter or granddaughter. Sadly that I cannot find the dialog in Elden Rings wiki page.
    So Demi-human queen Margot is actually Marika’s child? Interesting…very interesting…Elden Beast you have some explaining to do!
    Is Melina confirmed to be Marika's daughter?
        see this is what really gave it away for me [https://i.imgur.com/VNTSlov.png](https://i.imgur.com/VNTSlov.png)

there's also dialogue from melina implying she's Marika's daughter so yeah it's pretty much confirmed
        Yes, no other person trapped in the erdtree. Also ton of evidence radagon is her father
    This is a very GRRM thing to do, but it’s also a very FromSoft thing to do. Gwyn, gwyndolin, gwynevere. Seigmeyer, Seiglinde, Seigward. It’s a common fantasy thing to do
    So, you're saying there's only 26 families in the whole game!

/s
    Melina are her children??? I didn't heard about it before,is it confirm???
        She has dialogue basically directly stating it. Then from there we can take evidence like Melina's name, the 3 butterfly items, and Melina's hair to conclude she's radagons daughter too
    Ever since I noticed this I've wondered if they got the inspiration for this from Norse poetry, as it was common in Norse poetry to give related characters similar names. The standard poetic structure used lines beginning with the same sound instead of ending with the same sound, so naming schemes like that worked really well for it.
    Note morgot and mohg have an O just like gOdfrey and gOdwyn. 

Meanwhile malenia miquella and melina all fit together quite easily
    What makes you think that Miquella isn't human? I get the whole thing with >! Radagon!< But still
        im gonna be honest i kinda forgot about him when i wrote that, maybe because of his eternal childhood and being very womanlike >also st. trina
            Forgetfulness is a good explanation i guess
    Well rykard... idk
        Still Rykard is a cool name for a cool boss.
    Sooo, I know it's not stated, but are Morgott and Mogh possibly just the children of Marika? I always found it weird that their names started with M. Though, Godfrey definitely holds some love for Morgott, either as a surface father or relative. 

I do love and hate tbe spotty history of tbe land between.
Martin and Miyazaki have both done this in their past works as well. It's based on real world naming conventions used by certain royal families where each of them had some variation of the same name.
    Tolkien is another one who does this.
        Aragorn son of arathorn!
            Dwarves especially

Thorin son of Thrain
Thrain son of Thror
Gimli son of Gloin

Then you have non-generational connections
Fili and Killi
Balin and Dwalin
Dori, Nori, and Ori
Bofur and Bombur with their cousin Bifur
                Yeah. It’s pretty consistent with the Children of Iluvatar as well. As one comment below me mentioned, the Elvish house of Finwe. 

Also consider Theodred, son of Theoden; Eomer and Eowyn son and daughter of Theodwyn, sister of Theoden; Theoden, son of Thengel, son of Fengel. 

I love it when fantasy authors incorporate this kind of real-life historical detail.
            Frodo son of Drogo!
                The stallion who mounts the world.
        It's always funny seeing people complain about similar names in Elden Ring as a Tolkien fan, like come back when you're trying to remember the entire House of Finwe.
            It's also a common thing in real life. Plenty of siblings share parts of their name.
        Yes, and he had a huge influence on both Miyazaki and Martin.
    Ah so some real world royal families actually did this? Always thought it was simply because the author can't think of better names that show how two or more characters are related lol
        It's funny because that could easily have been the logic used by royals when deciding to use similar names.
            And dont forget that they literally named their sons after themselves and added a number next to it and called it a day
                Exactly, they're big on branding. Toyal families are more like companies than families as we think of them.
    It’s common to skip it in storytelling just to help the audience out, so people aren’t as used to it sometimes.

That said, I thought OP was talking about the names being G R R Martin’s initials all over the place.
        Oh, good catch!
    That’s not what OP asked about, it’s that the letters he chose are the three letters in his initials
George offered an absolute KING answer when asked about this, which was essentially "Why would I need to hide my initials in the game? My name is on the box."
    Yeah, that was cool. I like that guy.
        He just needs to finish his books now
            He won't.
            I've been begging for this for 20 years. I've consigned myself to the fact that he will never tie up the storyline of A Song of Ice and Fire. 😣
    Here's the source, if anyone's wondering: https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2022/03/21/this-that-and-tother-things/
    I mean ye but surely it's not a coincidence. I don't believe him lol
    … I dont get it…
        "I don't need to hide myself in the game because GEORGE R.R. MARTIN WORKED ON THIS GAME is the first thing they ever told you about it" is a pretty cool answer to this persistent belief.
    all his interviews are amazing, he is incredibly funny, quick with the jokes and he has an amazing vocabulary to express himself
Sure, this is totally diffenent from the whole Gwyn, Gwyndolin, Gwynevere, Quelaag, Quelana, Quelaan, Fina, Velka, Caitha thing that dark souls had going on...
    What do the last three have to do with it? Do they have family that fits with their naming, or is it just the ending in a?
        They are the less important gods in the games with no screentime at all and they also all end with an A
            Ah okay. 
    Yeah it’s different because GRRM is using the exact same letters as his initials. Also those last three names I would say have nothing to do with this, it’s just a common thing to make female names end with the letter a
I love the random hungarian names they used like Marika, Istvan, Margit, they all sound soo cool and posh in english. Then you hear a hungarian person pronounce them and they're suddenly lmao.

Also for the record:

Marika = Maria

Istvan = Stephen
    Kind of fitting since ASOIAF has Tyrion and Danaerys alongside Jaime and Jon.
        I’m so sick of acronyms.
            A song of Ice and Frenchfries.
    Margit just sounds weird to me, not posh at all. Probably because it ends in git and sounds vaguely like a truncated version of Margaret
    Marika is also a slur in Spanish so they changed her name to Marida lol
    As a Steve I didn’t realize I should be rocking the Bull Goat set.
        Istvan is swagging the scale set
You missed Godefroy.
    Was going to say this. The special cousin Godefroy.
its on purpose
    Here's the long version -

GRRM has made note in interviews ref ASOIAF of how he likes to give multiple characters the same/similar names. This is contrary to the standard writing 'rule' of giving every character a distinct name for reader clarity. But GRRM prefers not to abide by that rule, because he sees it as unrealistic. In reality, families + medieval families in particular have a tendancy to repeat names, and repreat syllables, within the family. The example he gives are the many King Edwards.

A few examples:

\- Aegon, Aemond, Daemon

\- Rhaegar, Rhaelle, Rhaena, Rhaenys

\- Tywald, Tytos, Tywin, Tyrion,

\- Rickon, Rickard, Eddard

&#x200B;

So, he's doing a similar thing here in Elden Ring. It's just a way of grouping characters by family, and by their nobility.

However, why he specifically chose (either deliberately or subconciously) the letters GR&M... I think we can make a safe guess.
        Honestly, one of my favourite things about ASOIAF is that they name people realistically. Ned names his sons after his king/bestie, his brother and his father. This is fairly normal behaviour through a decent chunk of human history… especially so for royal/noble families that have to think about lineage. 

It’s also totally fine for people to have the same name. There were 5 Lauras in my year at school!
            Also while it might require a little more attention to differentiate between family members, it makes it easier to keep track of who belongs to which political faction.
            It also allows for readability.  Fantasy is hard to chew on when the names just do not sound well on the tongue.   I love the wheel of time but it is guilty of this cheesy naming style.
                nothing gets me more than two much proper noun usage.  "(long obtuse proper noun) went with (long obtuse proper noun), and his lord (long obtuse proper noun) to (long obtuse proper noun but used as a verb)" sick i have no idea what happened.
            yea I know a guy as "black ryan" hes a friend of a friend. i thought it was a bit too on the nose till i found out that there were 5+ ryans in that friend group and after awhile you gotta differentiate them somehow.
                IM DEADDD
            He also names Jon after Jon Arryn who p much raised him, which follows the symbolism of him raising Jon.
    The dude himself answered this question and said he didn't do it on purpose, but find the coincidence funny
        The dude said he'd totally for real 100% finish his book, too

Every few years he says it

For over a decade

Call me crazy but I don't think he's all that honest
            You telling me he's been yankin' my chain for 12 years?
                At least
            >Call me crazy but I don't think he's all that honest

Okay: you're crazy.

There's a pretty obvious difference between *wanting to and intending to* finish a book and just being unable to (due to lack of motivation for example); and lying.
                My biggest craw is the people that think GRRM made any sort of timeline for ER, when the whole issue with ASOIAF is he's not great at outlining stories.
            Yeah he usually says that while sitting on a beach somewhere drinking margaritas, waiting for the Grateful Dead show to start. Doubt.


I also saw he has 4 books he plans on writing before starting the final GoT book. So that ain't happening. 
                every second that man breaths is a fucking gift at his weight. sucks that we wont get the final/next book but good on him for selling out and living the high life on the beach.
            no he haven't said it even once.
    [deleted]
        You read that from other fans' speculation.


The only time he has commented on it publically, he said it was not intentional.
George has already said in his personal "Not a blog" blog, that it was not intentional:

[https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2022/03/21/this-that-and-tother-things/](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2022/03/21/this-that-and-tother-things/)

&#x200B;

Gotta say, it is still an interesting coincidence since you can get the names Godfrey, Renala Radagon, Marika, with the initials GRRM, and all demi-gods are blood related to these characters and also have names that start with those initials. 

The only characters that dont comply with this rule are characters that are not related to either Marika or Radagon, which are technically not demi-gods (Astel, Fortisax, etc...)
And this is why I don’t remember any of their names
    And here I thought this was the reason I know all their names...
        Let me rephrase that lol. This is why I can never remember who is who
            That's very foul tarnished of you.
No. His response to this when asked was literally "why would I need to do that? My name's on the frickin box".
Godwyn from wish lol
It’s just a crazy coincidence.
    I don’t believe in coincidences!
        Noone asked you to
    Second this.
    It’s not. FromSoft always does family names like that.
        He means the fact that they correspond with George’s initials is a coincidence
Doubt it. I honestly think it's just a coincidence, and M, R and G happen to be some good initial letters for names.
    It's not even that big of a coincidence as GRRM likes to name people related to each other similarly. So you really only need 3 main characters with this naming convention and the rest of their family tree will fall in line
        It's less that he likes to do it, and more that it was legitimately a thing in the past. Inheriting names or naming someone after a relative was a way to show off your "pedigree"
    Dude come on
I don’t think he named them. He himself said he did not build the story but was just writing lore and world-building
    i dunno, they really seem like GRRM names. hard to be certain but they do give off that vibe
Bran, Bronn, Bryanne... Godrick, Godfrey, Godfroy
I think people give G.R.R. Martin more credit than he deserves for Elden ring. Him being involved was no more than a marketing ploy imo.
    Is this... based on anything or just a feeling?
    Yeah. Nobody wants to admit it though.

Miyazaki even likened the writing process to a D&D game. Where they were just building off a rough framework GRRM laid down.

It’s pretty typical for a D&D game to not directly build off of any official Forgotten Realms lore…
You can sing them in PokeRap style…
Sorry I’ve been binging Indigo League this week
You forgot Melania, Milena, Margott and Miquel Jackson.
Didn't make that connection. I figured it was how people in olden times named their offspring. To make it easier they just usually spelled each name slightly different. I feel like there are funny bit like examples of this but I can't think of any at this time.
Nope - G. R. R. M.
He claims it was coincidence. We all know in our hearts and souls he’s a mother fucking liar.
Mohg? Mogged? Mogged? Looksmaxxing?????
I just wanted to say 

ER is my first fromsoft game and Lurking in this sub is full of legends like you all that just know everything about this. This sub is the best how to and lore learning. And fightincowboy too. I’m always amazed at how much I don’t know in this game and how much everyone else does know lol

So thanks strangers!
I see no respect for Rick, Soldier of God.
Also the first four bosses you fight in order are typically GRRM.
    And it doesn’t matter what order you do it in lol. Unless you’re crazy it’ll always be Godrick, Rennala, either Rykard or Radahn, and then Morgott. That’s cool as hell if you really think about it.
        Right that's what I was thinking!
            I mean there’s always the chance they’ll go for Mohg. But what are the odds on a first playthrough that they know about Mohg, and are legitimately prepared to fight Mohg before Morgott? Probably extremely slim judging by the fact that Mohg is considered as difficult as Malenia lol
                I'm playing back through now for the second time after beating it at release and completely forgot mohg was at the bottom of leyndell until stumbling upon him, got him on my second try though. So I guess I beat him before morgott, but still did Godrick, Rennala, Radahn, mohg. I don't remember doing mohg until after the capital last time.
                    Oh I’m talking about Mohg, Lord of Blood. Mohg, the Omen is down underneath Leyndell. He’s guarding the Three Fingers. I could be wrong but I’m also pretty sure that Morgott has a wall that guards the flame of frenzy down below Leyndell? Again, could be completely wrong here.
                        Could be, I didn't see that, but I also didnt see the three fingers after killing mohg the omen, was there something else I needed to do to find it? Could someone have killed mohg lord of blood before morgott? Isn't he in mountaintops of the giants?
                            So you can technically do Mohg, Lord of Blood at any time that you want. You don’t actually have to go all the way to Consecrated Snowfield to get there. If you complete White Mask Varre’s questline, he gives you an item called ‘Lord of Blood’s Exultation’ and if you use it, it takes you straight there.

After Mohg, the Omen, all you have to do is go back to that site of grace after you kill him. Once you’re there, literally all you have to do is smack the altar. The altar will open and there’s a passageway that leads down to the three fingers. It’s a little bit tricky to get down to the fingers because of the platforms, but it’s possible. It’ll definitely make you rage a little bit.

Sorry if my response is a little jumbled, I was writing this while at work lol.
                                All good, I appreciate it! But man, this game has so much I missed the first time. I never even made it to deep root the first time and just fought fias champions this time. I'll need to go back down there and check that out, I dont even know if I knew varre had a quest, lol. What a game
                                    Oh this game is so complex. I think my first playthrough took me like, 93 hours or something like that. I explored every area so much and STILL missed a whole bunch of stuff. The amount of detail that went into this game is just so amazing.
why do y'all hate this man😂
    Forreal like the backstory he wrote is fucking great
        What back story?
            The one you didn’t pay attention to apparently
                GRRM didn’t write shit for the game that we play.
                    What did he write, O learned one?
                        Crazy how he ghosted, I was excited to be educated
                            Me too! I guess he had to go drop epic knowledge bombs somewhere else…
There’s either an interview or comment where he debunks doing it on purpose
    There is a thing people do nowadays called “lying”. Now I’m not saying he for sure did, but him saying that he didn’t name them his initials on purpose doesn’t exactly shut down the argument. Like why would he say that he did? That would be arrogant as fuck to do.
        Refer to comment by u/wangchangbackup . If you’re a massively successful writer and associated with the game publicly why bother lying about something so stupid?
I mean look at game of thrones, almost every targaryen starts with an A or R
    Daenerys, Daemon, Daeron, Viserys, Jahaerys, Maegor, Maekar, Baelor.
        Aegon, Aenys, Aerys, Aerea, Aerion, Alysanne, Aenar, Aemond, Aelor
            Rhaenys, Rhaegar.



Helaena, Visenya, Daenys, Gaemon, Gimli.
Why is it the first time I see Godwyn s face ? Is this picture official?
    No
    That’s what I’m saying
Are you telling me GRRM was involved in elden ring?
    He wrote the story fs got all the games lore from…
Perhaps he isn’t the most inspired author…
    > Sunset found her squatting in the grass, groaning. Every stool was looser than the one before, and smelled fouler. By the time the moon came up, she was shitting brown water. The more she drank the more she shat, but the more she shat, the thirstier she grew.
        That's straight up poetry
        It must have been pretty hard for him to write that part with only one hand
Man did you really need to ask lol?
    according to these comments, it seems like a very fair question lol
If he based it in his initials that is a teeny bit narcissistic. Honestly I don't think he did any writing. They just slapped his name on it for publicity. Dude can't finish his own life's work.
    Even if you ignore half of the alphabet as being less common starting letters for names it's still like a 1 in 10000 type chance to get those exact 3 letters.
First you have to be 100% sure that mayazaki or his team didn't change the original names. During marketing people will say anything to keep the hype going.
    [deleted]
        Bro, come on.
I doubt a lot of his contributions to the game. I think they slapped his name on the credits for more recognition and for the salivating mouths of game of thrones fans
You cracked the code
I originally bought Elden Ring bc of the GRRM connection. One thing I loved about the GoT books was the way he twists classic high fantasy (e.g. LotR) into a world with a similar brutality and moral ambiguity as our own real-world history.

After playing A LOT of Skyrim I still yearned for a game that could put a similar twist on the fantasy RPG genre. Elder Scrolls had become so vanilla and predictable (don’t get me started on Elder Scrolls online) it was such a relief to finally have a game that struck the perfect chord of terrifying & bizarre while still drawing on the medieval fantasy, swords & spells tradition.

Don’t bother finishing that book, G. Let’s get that vibe going for Elden Ring 2!
I wonder if the ones that begin with an M are all chosen by a god.

Marika : Greater will

Miquella : ??? but we know he is an empyrean

Mohg : formless mother

Malenia: the god of Rot

Morgott: god of those nasty grippers

am I missing anyone?
No it was a total coincidence
Complete accident actually.
He claims that it is stupid to think he did it on purpose. Many fans argue the same.

But yes, he obviously did it on purpose.
Everyone who thinks it's a coincidence is delusional. Just take the parents names of all Demigods:
G-odfrey
R-enalla
R-adagon
M-arika
It's GRRM initials right there.
Yes, because his ego is the size of the Hindenburg
Godfrey: George

Radagon: R

Renalla: R 

Marika: Martin

Not a coincidence lol. Respect to George.
Imagine if he put this type of thought (or any at all) into actually publishing the books that made him famous.
    He publishes his own books?
On a side note 

Fuck George r r Martin 

I love his work but he broke my heart
    Still waiting for Winds?
        Yep winds and how the show ended (not his fault really but there’s enough hate for it he can get some too) 

I simply must know how it ends!
TOGETHA!!
Yes he did. He always does this with his characters
Yes
Yes
I noticed that along time ago; and I'm pretty certain the answer is a resounding "Yes."
Me?
I'm pretty sure the closer they are in similarity the closer they are in their family 

Its like when you meet a large family they all have similar names
Naw, completely accidental.
That madman
Honestly just respect
He said in an interview once he prefers similar sounding names for members of the same dynasty
You forgot [Gumbo and Gunther](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/18ov3ut/guther_or_whatever_his_name_is/?rdt=61683).
Hundred %, all started either with M or R
Yep.
In interviews Miyazaki has said he always chooses all the names himself.
He actually did yeah, its because he doesn’t like the rule of having different letters at the start of names. It makes far more sense. This is how it was done in real life alot of the time.
Yes he did
Wtf
Yes. I that's one of the first things people noticed when the game came out
You forgot Melina.
Fun fact Marika is actually a georgian name
Martins… PT?
G....R....M
Lot of writers like to use alteration it’s kind of addictive, but I feel like he did specifically make all the names spelled fairly similar
He did an excellent job. Love this game. Great collab.
Probably because everyone think is he’s good writer😂
    The irony.
        You’re misusing that.

Context: Mr.Obese is full of himself, because he made LORT with tits.
            He wasn't who I was talking about.
Nha u forgot Dog
„Miquella is mine, and mine alone“
„Put these foolish ambitions to rest“
„We will devouaa the gods togethaaa“
„I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella“
„Tarnished warrior. T‘was nobly fought“
„Lowly tarnished. Thourt unfit even to graft“
Yes
yes
Different strokes for different folks. I'm sure some really like these character's names and the lore behind them; As someone whose a bit dyslexic, I find them so similar that, apart from two clear standouts (Radagon and Miquilla), I couldn't tell you which one is which, and I don't care to learn. 

That's just my first impressions of the naming convention; Later in hearing about that they all fall under GRRM, intentional or not, only solidifies my dislike of them. 

I'm not about to rail on the guy, call him a hack, and stop jerking himself off... This is clearly just a "me" problem.
I think it’s coincidental.

They probably made Marika, Godfrey, Radagon, then made the names resemble them.

In Dark Souls 1 it started with Lord Gwyn, and his children, Gwendolyn and Gwynevere. 

That e in Gwen may even be a y I don’t remember. Fromsoftware seems to enjoy having similar names for their godlike royalty, which I think has historical reference. So it kinda makes sense.
Yes
Nope, it was an accident.
House of the dragon (Also his work)

Some of the most important characters on the series are named just like the same.

Aemond,Daemon and Aegon for instance
bro just put his initials in the game 💀
Well he’s a shitty self absorbed writer soooooooo probably
This is a naming convention that Martin borrowed from Tolkien. Many characters in LOTR have naming patterns that are handed down through a bloodline like Theodred son of Theoden or Aragorn son of Arathron. So the children of Marika and Radagon all have names that start with M or R and Godfrey's bloodline carries the God part of his name (Godwyn, Godrick)
Holy shit

Radagon Renalla Ranni, Radahn, Rykard

Malenia, Miquella, Melina, Morgott, Mohg,

Godwin, Godfrey, Godrick, Goderick

It's true
Martin say on his blog that is not on purpose

https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2022/03/21/this-that-and-tother-things/
Probably. This is the same guy who named like 12 different dudes 'Aegon'.
Definitely on purpose, made it very hard for me to remember and identify the characters tho. I already suck at remembering non-similar names lol
He didn’t name the characters he only made up the lore from before the shattering
    He goes on one of the late night shows and explains his part was lore from 5000 years before the present
For sure. 

In Game of thrones he created the giant-character Wun Wun (1 1) - an homage to his nr 11 favorite player from the NY giants. He likes those things.
While the names absolutely have meaning as grrm is a tricky son of a bitch they are def relating to marika and rennala more
Not true, my character's name starts with an S. 🙃
Guarantee that someone at FROM thought it would be funny, so they did it.
He sure did
gotta name my son Tomato now i guess,Tomato son of Timothy!
omg. he definitely did. good spot
He ended up being demoted to writing lore on iten pieces. He didn't do this
Holy Order, I had no idea.
Just to purposely confuse anyone trying to even know who is who
Do you think the DLC is taking so long because of him?
Wow, brain freeze head cannon. I hadn't noticed that till now. Good observation and probably like Marikas kids have Ms and Radagon and Renalla have R and Godfrey has Godwin kinda like Targaryen names where sometimes the child's name is an offshoot of the parents
Also there's a loading screen pic which looks like a sphere with rings around it just like in game of thrones intro the sphere moving around the map magnifying it and like the spheres in Old Town
You know he did. He knows he’s the GOAT. WE know he’s the GOAT. So basically, it’s just the GOAT out here doing GOAT like things.
Also Hollows might be a nod to him as Dialos says House Hoslows story is told in honor and blood iirc and both Hoslows in the game fight with Rose Petal Whips which is a nod to the loose inspiration for Game of thrones. Britains War of the Roses over succession.
Yall starting to ask the right questions.

GRRM word use strikes again!
Yes
And Godrick and Gostoc are descendants of Godfrey
    Ain't no way I just learned that Gostoc is also a descendent of Godfrey??
        The quest that would confirm it directly was cut, but Godrick and Gostoc do look quite similar, and there's a reason Gostoc can just *order* the gates to be open.
            Good point on the gates, but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.  
  
Plus, their relationship didn't seem that great.  I took it more like he was saying they had an easy prisoner if the gates were opened.
                What about Godrick makes you think he'd be a good dad? But despite their relationship, Gostoc would still be the heir and therefore of some value to Godrick - if only as a source of high-quality grafting materials (at least breeding-wise). Like, a paranoid coward like Godrick wouldn't put some random peasant who hates his guts in charge of the gates.
                    >What about Godrick makes you think he'd be a good dad?  
  
Nothing about being good really, more the fact that he's the weakest of his family, and thus would be the most interested in having some other semi formidable fighters around.  
  
More it's interesting to me that Gostoc has no grafted parts, and may or may not have lost a hand to grafting.  While the regular soldiers in the castle have been augmented, such as the blades on the birds and the grafted enemy and such.
                        [deleted]
                            Given the second ass kicking he took in his castle getting assaulted by something from the ocean (looks like a sea creature hit it), maybe he should be rethinking that.
                                [deleted]
                        Godrick is actually the opposite. He’s not only the weakest, but he’s the most cowardly in his family. He’s terrified that anyone with a modicum of strength will try to take the little bit of power he’s managed to take for himself, so he surrounds himself with peons. He ensures that everyone around him is either far weaker than him, or under his direct control. Rather than having powerful fighters assist him, he takes their limbs and grafts them onto himself for the small fraction of their strength that gives him
                    Don't forget he has the ability to steal your runes
                >but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.

It's only a hand, and there's no proof it was taken for grafting. Gostoc steals your runes when you die and his merchant inventory hints that he stole those items as well. Having a hand cut off was a punishment for thieves in older days.
                Just because they’re related doesn’t mean they get along. Don’t you have relatives you loathe?
                You can actually find Gostoc following you through stormveil leading up to Godrick fight. As you're walking up to him in these three spots, his idle dialogue would suggest that he's examining body parts for his own desire to graft. If you also attack him at the start and he kills you, he will say that he'll take good care of your parts. Credit to VaatiVidya for that knowledge.
                >but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.  

Why? If Godrick is so obsessed with his royal heritage, his own son would also have that golden lineage blood.
            If it was cut then he isn't. It's literally not in the game.
                It's literally in the game, just not in a way that's accessible without outside tools. And if we only considered the text when researching lore, there wouldn't *be* any lore. So many youtubers would lose their jobs. 13+ hour long part one video woud be ten minutes long. We would never see Strider ported into the Lands Between. Etc.
                    This is absolutely delusional. It was left in the code but it's clearly not in the game since you need to bloody hack it to see it in its raw form. You can't acces it through gameplay, how can you even argue it's part of the game?
                        Cut content in these games often comes back as dlc. Big L for you no more lore 4 you
                            Then it's not cut anymore...
                                See?  Now you're getting it! Ya fucking onion
                        The phrasing was "literally in the game", not "accessible normally through gameplay". And *literally*? It's in the game.
                            If it's called cut content, then explain what was it cut *from*? It's in the code, not in the game. Devs clearly didn't want this to be part of it.
                                It was cut from the game, of course!


However, that doesn't mean it's been removed, it was just hidden. Still in the game files, with partial dialogue and voices, and mechanical stuff - scripts and shit, unlike anything the devs actually didn't want to use. And there are many reasons something they really wanted to use would be cut - maybe not enough time, maybe it was interfering with other events, maybe they didn't want to overcrowd Limgrave with quests.


My point is - it's still in the game, it wasn't just some first draft stuff discarded at the planning stage, effort was clearly put into it, it can be modded in if you know the game dev sorcery (like that guy fromsoftserve who re-remasters DS1 on youtube), or it could even be added later by FS themselves, now that they had time to work on it! (Wishful thinking). That's the reason why cut content like that is generally accepted as canon.
            How does he look similar? He has same model and outfit like all the other commoners 😅
        Yeah Godstoc was the family pet
            I thought that was godrick
                Nah, that was Rick, Soldier of God.
        Go back into Godrick's arena after sitting at a grace (might need to pass time/sit outside the arena), but before completing Nepheli's questline.

Gostoc can be found talking mad shit over Godrick's nubby corpse.

So, double TiL, gostoc has daddy issues.

Triple, TiL (maybe not for you but for those unaware, at least): nepheli loux, descendant of Hoarah loux, Warrior, would be a sibling of godrick.

This is why she gets the crown and stormveil in her questline. That detail is not very nuanced and I'm skipping over a few things, but ye.
            Isn't that mentioned directly in her questline that they need someone from that family line?  It's right after you clear the guys castle I thought.
                It says that godrick usurped the throne. Iirc, it never says who from but only that nepheli is heir, later revealed. 

We don't even learn of Hoarah loux until right at the end of the storyline. Not to mention From notoriously does not hold up flashing signs that point to these details; there's a ton of gaps but just enough solid info to cause great debates lol
                    >We don't even learn of Hoarah loux until right at the end of the storyline

He's in the opening cutscene when you start the game...
                        I'm gonna level with you. It's been like two years since I watched that. Was he called Hoarah loux or Godfrey in that video?
                            They refer to him as Hoarah Loux. It's the image of him and Serosh being crucified
                            He's referred to as "Hoarah Loux, Chieftain of the Badlands"
                Kenneth mentions that, but I think Nepheli just says it’s because she command the hawk that only obeys said bloodline. She just wonders why the hawk listens to her I think.
            >Triple, TiL (maybe not for you but for those unaware, at least): nepheli loux, descendant of Hoarah loux, Warrior, would be a sibling of godrick.

Nice catch!

What makes Sir Gideon Ofnir though? Isn't he her daddy?
                Adopted
                Adoptive daddy.

He says he "took her in" at a young age.
                Others have answered, but the various dialogue with gideon and nepheli reveals a few things.

Nepheli was part of a village that was massacred, much like the albinauric village under moonlight altar, which left her not just orphaned, but completely alone.

Gideon took her in and raised her, making her loyal to the roundtable hold until she found what Gideon did to the albinauric village in the name of his own pursuits. This is why she feels betrayed and can be found in the lower parts of the hold feeling dejected and lost. And Gideon does not care. So fourth fun fact, nepheli also has daddy issues lol.

I'm still missing some information myself on the link between the spirit ashes you give her that leads her to stormveil, but at face value she becomes the lord of the castle and swears fealty to you because you cheered her up with N O S T A L G I A!

Shame that didn't mean you could summon her more often as a cooperator... you know, versus the alternative ending where you can summon her pretty freely.
                    Nepheli and Gideon have known each other Nepheli's whole life as Nepheli says but Gideon specifies he didn't adopt her until she lost her grace. After they had both lived out their first lives, died and then after the Shattering were resurrected to come back to the Lands Between and eventually Nepheli like most Tarnished in the game beside Gideon and Godfrey, lost her grace again. He didn't raise her per se.
            Hey, so that's foreshadowing Hoarah Loux identity as well! I never connected the dots.
            >Triple, TiL (maybe not for you but for those unaware, at least): nepheli loux, descendant of Hoarah loux, Warrior, would be a sibling of godrick.

Not a sibling at all. More like a distant cousin of some sort. Nepheli Loux probably is a child of Godfrey's Hoarah Loux persona, and has nothing to do with Marika.
                TiL if my dad has a child with someone, who is not my mom, that doesn't make the child a half-sibling but


>More like a distant cousin of some sort.

Get out of here, my guy! If you said daughter of Godfrey's sibling, Gregory Loux, then yeah that would make her a cousin of godrick.

No such sibling is named, the only person carrying that name is hoarah. The implication, as you state yourself is that nepheli is Hoarah's daughter. This means when Hoarah/Godfrey sired Godrick with Marika, that makes Godfrey's daughter Godricks half-sibling
                    >TiL if my dad has a child with someone, who is not my mom, that doesn't make the child a half-sibling but

Godrick isn't Godfrey's child.

>This means when Hoarah/Godfrey sired Godrick with Marika,

He didn't though... godrick is a distant descendant of Godfrey. This is made explicit in game dialogue.

>The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika. Godrick the Grafted was but a distant relation... The runt of the litter, his divine blood sorely diluted".
        Even more important: is godrick and godefroy related?
        It’s confirmed by cut content. There’s a cut line of dialogue where Gostoc straight up says “I am the son of Godrick” or something along those lines. I chose to believe it’s canon though.
    Where is the lore for Gostoc being a descendant? Not saying he isn’t but is there an item or dialogue that confirms that?
        They're referencing cut content. People tend to canonize cut quest lines, but FROM intentionally cut it out of the game so if they didn't want it in the game, then it's not canon.  [V-Limit made a video discussing all the cut content surrounding Gostoc](https://youtu.be/LadiFWjWhMI?si=w6pV4gjAum_yHKMa)
            Gostoc does look like Godrick though, and he's clearly got a personal grudge against Godrick too. Also that creepy line about doing anything he wants - why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?
                >Also that creepy line about doing anything he wants - why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?


I can see why some people tend to canonize cut content, sometimes it makes more sense than what they ended up leaving in.
                    It would be easier to dismiss if it was completely cut
                    The creepy line wasn't cut.
                        I know, that's not what I meant. 


Gastocs current version, where he says that line, makes more sense when paired with the original cut content. Without it, what he says doesn't really make any sense if the final version is supposed to be just some random little dude running around. If he's a part of Godrick's lineage, then naturally the line makes sense.
                            It makes sense on its own. The Lord of the castle he resides in has been killed, and he had no heir. There's no one left with authority over Gostoc, so he's free to do as he likes. The 'cut content' changes the context.
                    I completely agree with you, but just because something makes more sense doesn't make it canon. Especially in this context when it wasn't disclosed that their familial relation was found in a cut quest. I like Gostoc's cut quests they're very interesting, and I hope a lot of the discovered cut quest lines end up being restored in SotE.
                        I'm completely in favour of disregarding cut content if was replaced or the context for it was changed, but in this case they just pruned the quest a bit, with seemingly no changes to the remaining ending or any of the npcs related to it. It's basically cannon.
                            >It's basically cannon


You're free to head-canonize whatever you'd like, but like I said earlier if you need a PC + external software to support your claim of what's canon or not, it's not canon. If you can't boot up Elden Ring right now and support the claim being made, it cannot be considered 'canon.' Canon should only include things that can be verified within the confines of the game we can all boot up and play right now.(ex - Ranni is an Empyrean. Placidusaxx was an Elden Lord. Radagon is preventing our entry to the Erdtree.) Everything else is conjecture, speculation, or theory. (Ex -Melina is the GEQ. Miquella is St Trina. Marika helped orchestrate the NotBK)

I'm not trying to be a hard ass about this, exploring the conjecture, theory, and speculation spaces this game provides the player is why I love these games so much! However, there does need distinctions between these concepts or you end up with people proudly proclaiming shit about the game that isn't technically true.
                                100%. i was going to say, 'idk why you're being downvoted' but i do know. stop disrupting the head canon!

not that this is datamining related, but this all harkens back to when people were taking the ancientDragon=aldia to be canon, during dks2 vanilla days. there was no text to support it, just a bunch of wildly formed connections.
                    Same with the cut content about the nomadic merchants being blamed for worshipping the frenzy flame. It’s all in a cut quest for Kale. There’s still stuff in game for it tho like the dead merchants in the shunning grounds and the nomadic merchant in Altus who uses frenzy flame incantations
                >why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?

You're asking a question about cut content relating back to other cut content. You're welcome to canonize Gostoc and Godrick being related, the only point I was trying to make is that the theory originates from cut content and anything that derives from that should be taken with a dump truck amount of salt. It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line. Sure, it might be restored in some fashion in the DLC, but until then it's just fanfic.
                    I was talking about this line:


>Now, I supposed I'm free. I can do whatever takes my fancy...Can't I, mate?


Which is not cut content. I remembered it being a bit more in favour of that hypothesis - something more like "I can do whatever I want *with this place*". Still, the rest - the name, the face, the personal connection etc - is enough for me.
                        He can do what he wants because you murdered the Lord of the castle. That doesn't insinuate anything about them being related. 

>Still, the rest - the name, the face, the personal connection etc - is enough for me.

And that's totally fine by me! I have my own crazy theories about the game that rely on speculation, it's why these games are as fun to delve into as they are. I replied with the 'its not canon' comment because the initial reply stating that Gostoc and Godrick are related stated it as fact instead of simply saying "We actually don't know, but, there's cut content in the game suggesting ____" 

That comment has like +200 upvotes. People are gonna see that little fun fact and start spewing it around, and now, something that was intentionally removed from the game for one reason or another, is being spread as fact. It's not a fact, the 'fact' is supported by content you cannot access without a PC and third party software because the developers did not want you to see it.
                    >It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line

Just because some connections got cut, doesn't mean all of it's gone. The lilies and fevor's cookbook still clearly show a very strong connection. 

"A record of crafting techniques left by a man who was utterly captivated by St. Trina. He continued the search for her in his slumber.

Acquire the knowledge to craft the following:

- Bewitching Branch"
                        >Just because some connections got cut, doesn't mean all of it's gone. The lilies and fevor's cookbook still clearly show a very strong connection. 

I would love for you to read my comment in its entirety, because no where did I say they cut the whole thing out. I'm fully aware of the subtle inferences the game makes towards things we speculate on in the game, but we're not talking about that, we're talking about things the game explicitly explains to us. Neither Gostoc being related to Godrick nor St Trina being Miquella is directly stated in the current version of the game, and until otherwise both theories have to rely on using speculation, conjecture, or data mining. For as much as this game relies on ambiguity the community sure seems to struggle with differentiating between the things the game tells us outright(canon) and the popular theories the community has come up with to help with the cohesion of the overarching story. Both are great, but they aren't the same thing. St Trina in the current version of the game is basically an irrelevant character. The only reason that theory got the community's attention IS the cut quest line relating to her.
                            >It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line

It is not *all* from a cut questline though. Sure, the things that directly, explicitely state Miquella is Trina are cut. But not all the strong connections are cut.

>I would love for you to read my comment in its entirety

I did. 



>For as much as this game relies on ambiguity the community sure seems to struggle with differentiating between the things the game tells us outright(canon) and the popular theories the community has come up with

Well I don't? So? I'm literally just saying that there are strong points in favour of Miquella being Trina that didn't get cut. Which is true.

Even without the cut quest, the lilies are an extremely obvious connection, as is the fact that a fevor's cookbook is given to us when we find Miquella, and it lets us craft a Miquella item. I genuinely don't even know much of anything about the cut questline.
                                I hope I'm not coming off that I'm arguing that the current subtle references between Miquella and St Trina don't exist, because they do and I see them.  Within the confines of the game, there's enough there to make the player ask the question, 'hey what's the deal with these two?' My point is that the references aren't concrete enough to say with absolute certainty that they are the exact same person. You keep saying otherwise so at this point we're debating how to define a fact and I'm not interested in that sort of conversation.
            I mean, cut content can certainly be contradicted later without repercussion, but generally cut content at that point is going to have lore written into whatever is officially referenced for the game.  And the content is cut for other reasons such as time, game pacing, technical issues, quality, or other reasons.
                Regardless of the reason, it was cut. Cut content can provide context of the development cycle and plans for certain aspects of the game, but at the end of the day it didn't make the final product of the game, and referencing assets that aren't accessible in the main game to answer questions we have is incredibly risky. If you need more proof of why this is a bad idea, using cut content to support 'the canon', look into the development of ds3 and how often they shuffled around bosses and rewrote lore to make the final product we got work. It gets messy quick. Unless you're a dev for FROM, the multitude of reasons you gave for why content gets cut should be the precise reasons as to not take cut content seriously. We simply don't know.
                    >If you need more proof of why this is a bad idea, using cut content to support 'the canon'  
  
And yet, that's actual storyline material that was at least written at some point.  Just looking at in game assets doesn't always make some material canon either, for example look at the pillars with symbols on them underground that people made elaborate theories on only to later realize it was an asset that anyone could purchase and use.
                        >that's actual storyline material that was at least written at some point.

storyline material that was deliberately deleted before they released the game.

&#x200B;

>look at the pillars with symbols on them underground that people made elaborate theories on only to later realize it was an asset that anyone could purchase and use.

What do you mean?   You don't have to create 100% of your assets you assign meaning to that you use in a video game. For all you and I know, that asset looking close to the symbolism they were trying to convey was the exact reason they went with it. They can create whatever association they want within the context of the game, it doesn't matter that the same asset is used in Destiny. We're not playing Destiny. To the flip side of this, and yet it could very well just be a cool ass generic pillar they wanted to use and didn't think twice about it. It can go either way, depending on how immersed you want to get in the game.  Debating whether or not assets were meant to convey a deeper meaning isn't the same as whether or not cut dialogue or quests should be taken as the game canon.
            Ahhh, yeah I haven’t paid attention to data mines and cut content, so that explains it. Feels a bit weird to include since there is a reason it is not included, but can definitely be an interesting thing to analyze and it makes some sense in this case
                I 100% agree with you. Context matters!
        He can order the gates to open, means he has some authority.
        There isn't concrete lore.

It's pretty much this:

-Gostoc is one of the very few characters in the game with "go" as the start of his name. 

-Gostoc has some sort of position of power.

-Gostoc knows Godrick personally, and despises him.

-Gostoc looks somewhat like Godrick, with his pale, saggy skin and white long hair.

-when he kills the player he says: "Oh, don't worry, I've got big plans for what's left of you..."

Godrick is looking for tarnished limbs to graft. So when Gostoc says he has big plans with your body, I'd assume it's because he wants to graft your parts onto himself. 


I'd say it's just as possible that Gostoc is Godrick's brother or nephew or something. I at least think it makes a lot of sense for him to be closely related to Godrick.
    Wait Godrick isn't one of his kids
        Great great great [...] Great grandkids
            Ok, but is Marika the great  great ... grandmother then?
    Also Godefroy is descended from that line, right? Or am I going insane?
        Yes, Godefroy as well
    Pro tip: in elden ring, if the names are alliterative then they're related
    I wonder if gostoc and Godrick are brothers and maybe godrick was the "blessed brother" who was able to graft, and he used this ability to take gostocs arm to prove a point and show his superiority?
        Gostoc is his son according to cut dialogues
    And Godefroy
    And Godefroy
    What about Godefroy?
    Even Nepheli is.
    What about Godfroy?
It all makes sense now. Rick, Soldier of God is part of Radagon's family tree
Mohg and Morgott are also Godfrey's sons.
    yeah i wanted to separate them from Godwyn

if their names started with G's, Marika&Godfrey would have 3 daughters(strating with M) and 3 sons (starting with G), the sons would take their fathers letter, and daughters would take their mothers letter, im not sure why these two imbalance it

maybe because they're cursed omen? maybe because they're not as close to Godfrey? they probably couldnt become king because they're Omen so they couldnt be his successor?
        I'd guess it's to exclude them from the Golden lineage, since the omen brother's were hidden down in the sewers. The people of the lands between didn't know about them.

And then later Morgott rose as the veiled monarch, and people seemed to hold him in high steem even though they never saw him. But if he was Godgott i'd bet people would want to meet this dude and find out his a disgusting omen.
            Most likely this. Mohg and Morgott also sounds nasty too, comparing to something like Godwyn
                It sounds straight out of Tolkien's names for evil things, lol. If you're not familiar with Tolkien, Morgoth was the first dark lord in his legendarium, and his main liutenant, lord of balrogs, was Gothmog.
            Gorgott and Gohg would have been funny names 😂
        Miquella is a boy (even if he has his alter ego that's fem), but it seems the correlation is they take after merikas name if they are cursed at birth. The Godfry naming convention would have all been born normal and then been fucked up later
        Marika and Godfrey don't have 3 daughters, Malenia and Miquella are children of Marika and Radagon, also, Miquella isn't even a girl, he's multiple times mentioned as a young boy with female traces, and about Melina, since there's no much information of her, it is wrong to say that she is also Marika's daughter, it is still too early for that, and for now it is just a theory
And possibly millicent.
    Millicent is more of a shoot. She has other sisters whom are considered imperfect versions. Just like plant life
        And they, of course are named Millicent, Maureen, Mary, Amy, and Polyanna
    Milicent and her sisters are like bog creatures who just sort of emerged out of the primordial soup of Malenias red swamp

Putting that together like that makes it feel like there's some sort of menstrual metaphor going on actually. Maybe something leftover from bloodborne where that was a big thing.
>and Godwyn, who is her only human male child     




Then what the fuck is Miquella
    a guy? mmh i was sure they're a woman, i see them in my sleep sometimes, st. trina...
Wait... Are we now hard assuming that Melina is Marika's kid?!

I could also be way slow and behind the times as I don't find her all that interesting but what supporting evidence is there if any?
    On top of her name being a hint like all the other characters, Melina telling us her mother is inside the Erdtree, and Melina's whole purpose (given to her by her mother) is to help burn down the Erdtree and finish what Marika started, there's also the matter of the butterflies. There's three types of butterflies in the game: Aeonian (rotted) for Malenia, Nascent (eternally young) for Miquella, and Smoldering (fiery) for Melina.

Honestly, there are way more obtuse theories that are just basically accepted as gospel by the community, I don't understand why Melina being Marika's daughter is so obscure to so many people.
        I’ve always assumed that Melina is the “human” side of Marika, whereas the part controlled by the Golden Order remains chained. The reason Melina sacrifices herself is to fix her own mistakes.

I do not discard the daughter theory, but it has always made more sense to me that Marika herself would be Melina, rather than an previously unknown child made for the express purpose of sacrificing itself.
        not to mention that, with Marika and Radagon being kind of sort of the same person, all three of their kids had some huge abnormalities. Miquella stayed a child forever, Malenia was born with the scarlet rot, and Melina either burned to death or only exists as a sort of ghost next to sites of grace (bonfires).
            Very true, I did leave that out from my comment, but excellent point.
        i feel like it’s directly stated by the game lmfao didn’t realize it was considered a theory
        Honestly I just never considered it and I totally forgot about the butterflies theory. 

Melina is just so poorly utilized given her importance and comes ide as a brat so I just disliked her entirely.

But that's for the reply!
    She's referred to as "MaricaOfDaughter" in the game files. 

That doesn't mean they couldn't have changed it at some point (I think Roderika is referred to as "Farnese", after the Berserk character she was inspired by), but it's a very strong lead.
        Right but if we did that the misbegotten also are named children of Radagon (presumably discarded bastards). Which honestly fully explains why they have 3 of the Legendary armaments.

Side note Fromsofts cut content always is the stuff that went so hard.
            Radagon seriously got around. 

If we take the game files as gospel, the misbegotten may have been created as punishment for Radagon making contact with the Crucible, so maybe Melina was born in a similar way, when Marica made contact with the Frenzied Flame.
                Now that's some head cannon I can get into. The fact she has no cut content and her entire life is a whiny brat still agitated me. If you go under the assumption she just wants to get it over with and you happen to be the best option then sure? Maybe I get her lack of involvement in any of this?
                    Yeah, it's strange that she's one of the most mysterious NPCs and she's with us for 80% of the game. 

We do know why she chooses to travel with the player, however. It's because Torrent approved of us. She's just deferring to his judgement.
    Did she not say her mother remains in the Erdtree or something?
        Well anyone who dies is absorbed into the Erdtree again so while sure she could be vague about it I would have no idea why she would be.
    There are plenty of strong reasons to believe Melina is Marika's daughter.

Melina uses the moveset of the black knives. They are Numen, just like Marika.

Melina uses a unique erdtree incantation, which would indicate she is strongly connected to the erdtree. Of all characters besides Melina, Marika is most strongly connected to the erdtree.

Melina can speak Marika's echoes.

Melina's name is clearly quite similar to Malenia, Miquella and Marika. Going by the naming conventions of the game, she's a demigod with Marika's blood in her.

"Me, I'm searching for my purpose given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree long ago"

Hmmmm, do we know of a motherly figure who is inside the erdtree??
This is not uncommon in fantasy literature, Tolkien did it way before grrm.

Gimli, gloin, groin
Aragorn, arathorn, arador
    And FromSoft has done it since at least dark souls. Gwyn, Gwyndolin, Gwynevere
    Finwë, Findis, Fingolfin, Finarfin, Fingon, Finrod, Finduilas
Marika was the cursed one all along???????
>and Godwyn, who is her only human male child, and is son of Godfrey

Arent Morgott and Mohg sons of Godfrey too, and the whole reason Marika didn't want any more children from Godfrey / humans?
God I love this game
Omen ARE human, just a little extra horny
I don't think Godwyn is human lol.
And Godefroy who’s TOTALLY canon right guys haha
Godwyn was a demigod not human and since nephli comes from his bloodline from before he was elden lord they wouldn't be siblings at all she becomes the lord of stormveil because it's implied she's also the bloodline of the first lord because you give her the storm hawk ashes the lord could've been horaux but that's muddled by alot of other descriptions
    Nelphi is daughter to Godfrey.
        I'm pretty sure shes his granddaughter not his daughter but still she's not a child of Marika so she's not really a sibling to godrick at all
            I think it was confirmed but I may be wrong.
                I'm not sure what you mean was confirmed?
                    Naah, it's like she "might" be Godfrey's daughter so it is not 100% certain.
                        Yea I thought when you talked to her through the quest she or Gideon mentions being the granddaughter of a chieftain which would be Horah loux but it's been a while since I did her quest
                            Yeah that's what I had in mind. But I don't know if Gideon said daughter or granddaughter. Sadly that I cannot find the dialog in Elden Rings wiki page.
So Demi-human queen Margot is actually Marika’s child? Interesting…very interesting…Elden Beast you have some explaining to do!
Is Melina confirmed to be Marika's daughter?
    see this is what really gave it away for me [https://i.imgur.com/VNTSlov.png](https://i.imgur.com/VNTSlov.png)

there's also dialogue from melina implying she's Marika's daughter so yeah it's pretty much confirmed
    Yes, no other person trapped in the erdtree. Also ton of evidence radagon is her father
This is a very GRRM thing to do, but it’s also a very FromSoft thing to do. Gwyn, gwyndolin, gwynevere. Seigmeyer, Seiglinde, Seigward. It’s a common fantasy thing to do
So, you're saying there's only 26 families in the whole game!

/s
Melina are her children??? I didn't heard about it before,is it confirm???
    She has dialogue basically directly stating it. Then from there we can take evidence like Melina's name, the 3 butterfly items, and Melina's hair to conclude she's radagons daughter too
Ever since I noticed this I've wondered if they got the inspiration for this from Norse poetry, as it was common in Norse poetry to give related characters similar names. The standard poetic structure used lines beginning with the same sound instead of ending with the same sound, so naming schemes like that worked really well for it.
Note morgot and mohg have an O just like gOdfrey and gOdwyn. 

Meanwhile malenia miquella and melina all fit together quite easily
What makes you think that Miquella isn't human? I get the whole thing with >! Radagon!< But still
    im gonna be honest i kinda forgot about him when i wrote that, maybe because of his eternal childhood and being very womanlike >also st. trina
        Forgetfulness is a good explanation i guess
Well rykard... idk
    Still Rykard is a cool name for a cool boss.
Sooo, I know it's not stated, but are Morgott and Mogh possibly just the children of Marika? I always found it weird that their names started with M. Though, Godfrey definitely holds some love for Morgott, either as a surface father or relative. 

I do love and hate tbe spotty history of tbe land between.
Tolkien is another one who does this.
    Aragorn son of arathorn!
        Dwarves especially

Thorin son of Thrain
Thrain son of Thror
Gimli son of Gloin

Then you have non-generational connections
Fili and Killi
Balin and Dwalin
Dori, Nori, and Ori
Bofur and Bombur with their cousin Bifur
            Yeah. It’s pretty consistent with the Children of Iluvatar as well. As one comment below me mentioned, the Elvish house of Finwe. 

Also consider Theodred, son of Theoden; Eomer and Eowyn son and daughter of Theodwyn, sister of Theoden; Theoden, son of Thengel, son of Fengel. 

I love it when fantasy authors incorporate this kind of real-life historical detail.
        Frodo son of Drogo!
            The stallion who mounts the world.
    It's always funny seeing people complain about similar names in Elden Ring as a Tolkien fan, like come back when you're trying to remember the entire House of Finwe.
        It's also a common thing in real life. Plenty of siblings share parts of their name.
    Yes, and he had a huge influence on both Miyazaki and Martin.
Ah so some real world royal families actually did this? Always thought it was simply because the author can't think of better names that show how two or more characters are related lol
    It's funny because that could easily have been the logic used by royals when deciding to use similar names.
        And dont forget that they literally named their sons after themselves and added a number next to it and called it a day
            Exactly, they're big on branding. Toyal families are more like companies than families as we think of them.
It’s common to skip it in storytelling just to help the audience out, so people aren’t as used to it sometimes.

That said, I thought OP was talking about the names being G R R Martin’s initials all over the place.
    Oh, good catch!
That’s not what OP asked about, it’s that the letters he chose are the three letters in his initials
Yeah, that was cool. I like that guy.
    He just needs to finish his books now
        He won't.
        I've been begging for this for 20 years. I've consigned myself to the fact that he will never tie up the storyline of A Song of Ice and Fire. 😣
Here's the source, if anyone's wondering: https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2022/03/21/this-that-and-tother-things/
I mean ye but surely it's not a coincidence. I don't believe him lol
… I dont get it…
    "I don't need to hide myself in the game because GEORGE R.R. MARTIN WORKED ON THIS GAME is the first thing they ever told you about it" is a pretty cool answer to this persistent belief.
all his interviews are amazing, he is incredibly funny, quick with the jokes and he has an amazing vocabulary to express himself
What do the last three have to do with it? Do they have family that fits with their naming, or is it just the ending in a?
    They are the less important gods in the games with no screentime at all and they also all end with an A
        Ah okay. 
Yeah it’s different because GRRM is using the exact same letters as his initials. Also those last three names I would say have nothing to do with this, it’s just a common thing to make female names end with the letter a
Kind of fitting since ASOIAF has Tyrion and Danaerys alongside Jaime and Jon.
    I’m so sick of acronyms.
        A song of Ice and Frenchfries.
Margit just sounds weird to me, not posh at all. Probably because it ends in git and sounds vaguely like a truncated version of Margaret
Marika is also a slur in Spanish so they changed her name to Marida lol
As a Steve I didn’t realize I should be rocking the Bull Goat set.
    Istvan is swagging the scale set
Was going to say this. The special cousin Godefroy.
Here's the long version -

GRRM has made note in interviews ref ASOIAF of how he likes to give multiple characters the same/similar names. This is contrary to the standard writing 'rule' of giving every character a distinct name for reader clarity. But GRRM prefers not to abide by that rule, because he sees it as unrealistic. In reality, families + medieval families in particular have a tendancy to repeat names, and repreat syllables, within the family. The example he gives are the many King Edwards.

A few examples:

\- Aegon, Aemond, Daemon

\- Rhaegar, Rhaelle, Rhaena, Rhaenys

\- Tywald, Tytos, Tywin, Tyrion,

\- Rickon, Rickard, Eddard

&#x200B;

So, he's doing a similar thing here in Elden Ring. It's just a way of grouping characters by family, and by their nobility.

However, why he specifically chose (either deliberately or subconciously) the letters GR&M... I think we can make a safe guess.
    Honestly, one of my favourite things about ASOIAF is that they name people realistically. Ned names his sons after his king/bestie, his brother and his father. This is fairly normal behaviour through a decent chunk of human history… especially so for royal/noble families that have to think about lineage. 

It’s also totally fine for people to have the same name. There were 5 Lauras in my year at school!
        Also while it might require a little more attention to differentiate between family members, it makes it easier to keep track of who belongs to which political faction.
        It also allows for readability.  Fantasy is hard to chew on when the names just do not sound well on the tongue.   I love the wheel of time but it is guilty of this cheesy naming style.
            nothing gets me more than two much proper noun usage.  "(long obtuse proper noun) went with (long obtuse proper noun), and his lord (long obtuse proper noun) to (long obtuse proper noun but used as a verb)" sick i have no idea what happened.
        yea I know a guy as "black ryan" hes a friend of a friend. i thought it was a bit too on the nose till i found out that there were 5+ ryans in that friend group and after awhile you gotta differentiate them somehow.
            IM DEADDD
        He also names Jon after Jon Arryn who p much raised him, which follows the symbolism of him raising Jon.
The dude himself answered this question and said he didn't do it on purpose, but find the coincidence funny
    The dude said he'd totally for real 100% finish his book, too

Every few years he says it

For over a decade

Call me crazy but I don't think he's all that honest
        You telling me he's been yankin' my chain for 12 years?
            At least
        >Call me crazy but I don't think he's all that honest

Okay: you're crazy.

There's a pretty obvious difference between *wanting to and intending to* finish a book and just being unable to (due to lack of motivation for example); and lying.
            My biggest craw is the people that think GRRM made any sort of timeline for ER, when the whole issue with ASOIAF is he's not great at outlining stories.
        Yeah he usually says that while sitting on a beach somewhere drinking margaritas, waiting for the Grateful Dead show to start. Doubt.


I also saw he has 4 books he plans on writing before starting the final GoT book. So that ain't happening. 
            every second that man breaths is a fucking gift at his weight. sucks that we wont get the final/next book but good on him for selling out and living the high life on the beach.
        no he haven't said it even once.
[deleted]
    You read that from other fans' speculation.


The only time he has commented on it publically, he said it was not intentional.
And here I thought this was the reason I know all their names...
    Let me rephrase that lol. This is why I can never remember who is who
        That's very foul tarnished of you.
I don’t believe in coincidences!
    Noone asked you to
Second this.
It’s not. FromSoft always does family names like that.
    He means the fact that they correspond with George’s initials is a coincidence
It's not even that big of a coincidence as GRRM likes to name people related to each other similarly. So you really only need 3 main characters with this naming convention and the rest of their family tree will fall in line
    It's less that he likes to do it, and more that it was legitimately a thing in the past. Inheriting names or naming someone after a relative was a way to show off your "pedigree"
Dude come on
i dunno, they really seem like GRRM names. hard to be certain but they do give off that vibe
Is this... based on anything or just a feeling?
Yeah. Nobody wants to admit it though.

Miyazaki even likened the writing process to a D&D game. Where they were just building off a rough framework GRRM laid down.

It’s pretty typical for a D&D game to not directly build off of any official Forgotten Realms lore…
And it doesn’t matter what order you do it in lol. Unless you’re crazy it’ll always be Godrick, Rennala, either Rykard or Radahn, and then Morgott. That’s cool as hell if you really think about it.
    Right that's what I was thinking!
        I mean there’s always the chance they’ll go for Mohg. But what are the odds on a first playthrough that they know about Mohg, and are legitimately prepared to fight Mohg before Morgott? Probably extremely slim judging by the fact that Mohg is considered as difficult as Malenia lol
            I'm playing back through now for the second time after beating it at release and completely forgot mohg was at the bottom of leyndell until stumbling upon him, got him on my second try though. So I guess I beat him before morgott, but still did Godrick, Rennala, Radahn, mohg. I don't remember doing mohg until after the capital last time.
                Oh I’m talking about Mohg, Lord of Blood. Mohg, the Omen is down underneath Leyndell. He’s guarding the Three Fingers. I could be wrong but I’m also pretty sure that Morgott has a wall that guards the flame of frenzy down below Leyndell? Again, could be completely wrong here.
                    Could be, I didn't see that, but I also didnt see the three fingers after killing mohg the omen, was there something else I needed to do to find it? Could someone have killed mohg lord of blood before morgott? Isn't he in mountaintops of the giants?
                        So you can technically do Mohg, Lord of Blood at any time that you want. You don’t actually have to go all the way to Consecrated Snowfield to get there. If you complete White Mask Varre’s questline, he gives you an item called ‘Lord of Blood’s Exultation’ and if you use it, it takes you straight there.

After Mohg, the Omen, all you have to do is go back to that site of grace after you kill him. Once you’re there, literally all you have to do is smack the altar. The altar will open and there’s a passageway that leads down to the three fingers. It’s a little bit tricky to get down to the fingers because of the platforms, but it’s possible. It’ll definitely make you rage a little bit.

Sorry if my response is a little jumbled, I was writing this while at work lol.
                            All good, I appreciate it! But man, this game has so much I missed the first time. I never even made it to deep root the first time and just fought fias champions this time. I'll need to go back down there and check that out, I dont even know if I knew varre had a quest, lol. What a game
                                Oh this game is so complex. I think my first playthrough took me like, 93 hours or something like that. I explored every area so much and STILL missed a whole bunch of stuff. The amount of detail that went into this game is just so amazing.
Forreal like the backstory he wrote is fucking great
    What back story?
        The one you didn’t pay attention to apparently
            GRRM didn’t write shit for the game that we play.
                What did he write, O learned one?
                    Crazy how he ghosted, I was excited to be educated
                        Me too! I guess he had to go drop epic knowledge bombs somewhere else…
There is a thing people do nowadays called “lying”. Now I’m not saying he for sure did, but him saying that he didn’t name them his initials on purpose doesn’t exactly shut down the argument. Like why would he say that he did? That would be arrogant as fuck to do.
    Refer to comment by u/wangchangbackup . If you’re a massively successful writer and associated with the game publicly why bother lying about something so stupid?
Daenerys, Daemon, Daeron, Viserys, Jahaerys, Maegor, Maekar, Baelor.
    Aegon, Aenys, Aerys, Aerea, Aerion, Alysanne, Aenar, Aemond, Aelor
        Rhaenys, Rhaegar.



Helaena, Visenya, Daenys, Gaemon, Gimli.
No
That’s what I’m saying
He wrote the story fs got all the games lore from…
> Sunset found her squatting in the grass, groaning. Every stool was looser than the one before, and smelled fouler. By the time the moon came up, she was shitting brown water. The more she drank the more she shat, but the more she shat, the thirstier she grew.
    That's straight up poetry
    It must have been pretty hard for him to write that part with only one hand
according to these comments, it seems like a very fair question lol
Even if you ignore half of the alphabet as being less common starting letters for names it's still like a 1 in 10000 type chance to get those exact 3 letters.
[deleted]
    Bro, come on.
He publishes his own books?
Still waiting for Winds?
    Yep winds and how the show ended (not his fault really but there’s enough hate for it he can get some too) 

I simply must know how it ends!
The irony.
    You’re misusing that.

Context: Mr.Obese is full of himself, because he made LORT with tits.
        He wasn't who I was talking about.
He goes on one of the late night shows and explains his part was lore from 5000 years before the present
Ain't no way I just learned that Gostoc is also a descendent of Godfrey??
    The quest that would confirm it directly was cut, but Godrick and Gostoc do look quite similar, and there's a reason Gostoc can just *order* the gates to be open.
        Good point on the gates, but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.  
  
Plus, their relationship didn't seem that great.  I took it more like he was saying they had an easy prisoner if the gates were opened.
            What about Godrick makes you think he'd be a good dad? But despite their relationship, Gostoc would still be the heir and therefore of some value to Godrick - if only as a source of high-quality grafting materials (at least breeding-wise). Like, a paranoid coward like Godrick wouldn't put some random peasant who hates his guts in charge of the gates.
                >What about Godrick makes you think he'd be a good dad?  
  
Nothing about being good really, more the fact that he's the weakest of his family, and thus would be the most interested in having some other semi formidable fighters around.  
  
More it's interesting to me that Gostoc has no grafted parts, and may or may not have lost a hand to grafting.  While the regular soldiers in the castle have been augmented, such as the blades on the birds and the grafted enemy and such.

                        Given the second ass kicking he took in his castle getting assaulted by something from the ocean (looks like a sea creature hit it), maybe he should be rethinking that.

                    Godrick is actually the opposite. He’s not only the weakest, but he’s the most cowardly in his family. He’s terrified that anyone with a modicum of strength will try to take the little bit of power he’s managed to take for himself, so he surrounds himself with peons. He ensures that everyone around him is either far weaker than him, or under his direct control. Rather than having powerful fighters assist him, he takes their limbs and grafts them onto himself for the small fraction of their strength that gives him
                Don't forget he has the ability to steal your runes
            >but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.

It's only a hand, and there's no proof it was taken for grafting. Gostoc steals your runes when you die and his merchant inventory hints that he stole those items as well. Having a hand cut off was a punishment for thieves in older days.
            Just because they’re related doesn’t mean they get along. Don’t you have relatives you loathe?
            You can actually find Gostoc following you through stormveil leading up to Godrick fight. As you're walking up to him in these three spots, his idle dialogue would suggest that he's examining body parts for his own desire to graft. If you also attack him at the start and he kills you, he will say that he'll take good care of your parts. Credit to VaatiVidya for that knowledge.
            >but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.  

Why? If Godrick is so obsessed with his royal heritage, his own son would also have that golden lineage blood.
        If it was cut then he isn't. It's literally not in the game.
            It's literally in the game, just not in a way that's accessible without outside tools. And if we only considered the text when researching lore, there wouldn't *be* any lore. So many youtubers would lose their jobs. 13+ hour long part one video woud be ten minutes long. We would never see Strider ported into the Lands Between. Etc.
                This is absolutely delusional. It was left in the code but it's clearly not in the game since you need to bloody hack it to see it in its raw form. You can't acces it through gameplay, how can you even argue it's part of the game?
                    Cut content in these games often comes back as dlc. Big L for you no more lore 4 you
                        Then it's not cut anymore...
                            See?  Now you're getting it! Ya fucking onion
                    The phrasing was "literally in the game", not "accessible normally through gameplay". And *literally*? It's in the game.
                        If it's called cut content, then explain what was it cut *from*? It's in the code, not in the game. Devs clearly didn't want this to be part of it.
                            It was cut from the game, of course!


However, that doesn't mean it's been removed, it was just hidden. Still in the game files, with partial dialogue and voices, and mechanical stuff - scripts and shit, unlike anything the devs actually didn't want to use. And there are many reasons something they really wanted to use would be cut - maybe not enough time, maybe it was interfering with other events, maybe they didn't want to overcrowd Limgrave with quests.


My point is - it's still in the game, it wasn't just some first draft stuff discarded at the planning stage, effort was clearly put into it, it can be modded in if you know the game dev sorcery (like that guy fromsoftserve who re-remasters DS1 on youtube), or it could even be added later by FS themselves, now that they had time to work on it! (Wishful thinking). That's the reason why cut content like that is generally accepted as canon.
        How does he look similar? He has same model and outfit like all the other commoners 😅
    Yeah Godstoc was the family pet
        I thought that was godrick
            Nah, that was Rick, Soldier of God.
    Go back into Godrick's arena after sitting at a grace (might need to pass time/sit outside the arena), but before completing Nepheli's questline.

Gostoc can be found talking mad shit over Godrick's nubby corpse.

So, double TiL, gostoc has daddy issues.

Triple, TiL (maybe not for you but for those unaware, at least): nepheli loux, descendant of Hoarah loux, Warrior, would be a sibling of godrick.

This is why she gets the crown and stormveil in her questline. That detail is not very nuanced and I'm skipping over a few things, but ye.
        Isn't that mentioned directly in her questline that they need someone from that family line?  It's right after you clear the guys castle I thought.
            It says that godrick usurped the throne. Iirc, it never says who from but only that nepheli is heir, later revealed. 

We don't even learn of Hoarah loux until right at the end of the storyline. Not to mention From notoriously does not hold up flashing signs that point to these details; there's a ton of gaps but just enough solid info to cause great debates lol
                >We don't even learn of Hoarah loux until right at the end of the storyline

He's in the opening cutscene when you start the game...
                    I'm gonna level with you. It's been like two years since I watched that. Was he called Hoarah loux or Godfrey in that video?
                        They refer to him as Hoarah Loux. It's the image of him and Serosh being crucified
                        He's referred to as "Hoarah Loux, Chieftain of the Badlands"
            Kenneth mentions that, but I think Nepheli just says it’s because she command the hawk that only obeys said bloodline. She just wonders why the hawk listens to her I think.
        >Triple, TiL (maybe not for you but for those unaware, at least): nepheli loux, descendant of Hoarah loux, Warrior, would be a sibling of godrick.

Nice catch!

What makes Sir Gideon Ofnir though? Isn't he her daddy?
            Adopted
            Adoptive daddy.

He says he "took her in" at a young age.
            Others have answered, but the various dialogue with gideon and nepheli reveals a few things.

Nepheli was part of a village that was massacred, much like the albinauric village under moonlight altar, which left her not just orphaned, but completely alone.

Gideon took her in and raised her, making her loyal to the roundtable hold until she found what Gideon did to the albinauric village in the name of his own pursuits. This is why she feels betrayed and can be found in the lower parts of the hold feeling dejected and lost. And Gideon does not care. So fourth fun fact, nepheli also has daddy issues lol.

I'm still missing some information myself on the link between the spirit ashes you give her that leads her to stormveil, but at face value she becomes the lord of the castle and swears fealty to you because you cheered her up with N O S T A L G I A!

Shame that didn't mean you could summon her more often as a cooperator... you know, versus the alternative ending where you can summon her pretty freely.
                Nepheli and Gideon have known each other Nepheli's whole life as Nepheli says but Gideon specifies he didn't adopt her until she lost her grace. After they had both lived out their first lives, died and then after the Shattering were resurrected to come back to the Lands Between and eventually Nepheli like most Tarnished in the game beside Gideon and Godfrey, lost her grace again. He didn't raise her per se.
        Hey, so that's foreshadowing Hoarah Loux identity as well! I never connected the dots.
        >Triple, TiL (maybe not for you but for those unaware, at least): nepheli loux, descendant of Hoarah loux, Warrior, would be a sibling of godrick.

Not a sibling at all. More like a distant cousin of some sort. Nepheli Loux probably is a child of Godfrey's Hoarah Loux persona, and has nothing to do with Marika.
            TiL if my dad has a child with someone, who is not my mom, that doesn't make the child a half-sibling but


>More like a distant cousin of some sort.

Get out of here, my guy! If you said daughter of Godfrey's sibling, Gregory Loux, then yeah that would make her a cousin of godrick.

No such sibling is named, the only person carrying that name is hoarah. The implication, as you state yourself is that nepheli is Hoarah's daughter. This means when Hoarah/Godfrey sired Godrick with Marika, that makes Godfrey's daughter Godricks half-sibling
                >TiL if my dad has a child with someone, who is not my mom, that doesn't make the child a half-sibling but

Godrick isn't Godfrey's child.

>This means when Hoarah/Godfrey sired Godrick with Marika,

He didn't though... godrick is a distant descendant of Godfrey. This is made explicit in game dialogue.

>The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika. Godrick the Grafted was but a distant relation... The runt of the litter, his divine blood sorely diluted".
    Even more important: is godrick and godefroy related?
    It’s confirmed by cut content. There’s a cut line of dialogue where Gostoc straight up says “I am the son of Godrick” or something along those lines. I chose to believe it’s canon though.
Where is the lore for Gostoc being a descendant? Not saying he isn’t but is there an item or dialogue that confirms that?
    They're referencing cut content. People tend to canonize cut quest lines, but FROM intentionally cut it out of the game so if they didn't want it in the game, then it's not canon.  [V-Limit made a video discussing all the cut content surrounding Gostoc](https://youtu.be/LadiFWjWhMI?si=w6pV4gjAum_yHKMa)
        Gostoc does look like Godrick though, and he's clearly got a personal grudge against Godrick too. Also that creepy line about doing anything he wants - why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?
            >Also that creepy line about doing anything he wants - why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?


I can see why some people tend to canonize cut content, sometimes it makes more sense than what they ended up leaving in.
                It would be easier to dismiss if it was completely cut
                The creepy line wasn't cut.
                    I know, that's not what I meant. 


Gastocs current version, where he says that line, makes more sense when paired with the original cut content. Without it, what he says doesn't really make any sense if the final version is supposed to be just some random little dude running around. If he's a part of Godrick's lineage, then naturally the line makes sense.
                        It makes sense on its own. The Lord of the castle he resides in has been killed, and he had no heir. There's no one left with authority over Gostoc, so he's free to do as he likes. The 'cut content' changes the context.
                I completely agree with you, but just because something makes more sense doesn't make it canon. Especially in this context when it wasn't disclosed that their familial relation was found in a cut quest. I like Gostoc's cut quests they're very interesting, and I hope a lot of the discovered cut quest lines end up being restored in SotE.
                    I'm completely in favour of disregarding cut content if was replaced or the context for it was changed, but in this case they just pruned the quest a bit, with seemingly no changes to the remaining ending or any of the npcs related to it. It's basically cannon.
                        >It's basically cannon


You're free to head-canonize whatever you'd like, but like I said earlier if you need a PC + external software to support your claim of what's canon or not, it's not canon. If you can't boot up Elden Ring right now and support the claim being made, it cannot be considered 'canon.' Canon should only include things that can be verified within the confines of the game we can all boot up and play right now.(ex - Ranni is an Empyrean. Placidusaxx was an Elden Lord. Radagon is preventing our entry to the Erdtree.) Everything else is conjecture, speculation, or theory. (Ex -Melina is the GEQ. Miquella is St Trina. Marika helped orchestrate the NotBK)

I'm not trying to be a hard ass about this, exploring the conjecture, theory, and speculation spaces this game provides the player is why I love these games so much! However, there does need distinctions between these concepts or you end up with people proudly proclaiming shit about the game that isn't technically true.
                            100%. i was going to say, 'idk why you're being downvoted' but i do know. stop disrupting the head canon!

not that this is datamining related, but this all harkens back to when people were taking the ancientDragon=aldia to be canon, during dks2 vanilla days. there was no text to support it, just a bunch of wildly formed connections.
                Same with the cut content about the nomadic merchants being blamed for worshipping the frenzy flame. It’s all in a cut quest for Kale. There’s still stuff in game for it tho like the dead merchants in the shunning grounds and the nomadic merchant in Altus who uses frenzy flame incantations
            >why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?

You're asking a question about cut content relating back to other cut content. You're welcome to canonize Gostoc and Godrick being related, the only point I was trying to make is that the theory originates from cut content and anything that derives from that should be taken with a dump truck amount of salt. It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line. Sure, it might be restored in some fashion in the DLC, but until then it's just fanfic.
                I was talking about this line:


>Now, I supposed I'm free. I can do whatever takes my fancy...Can't I, mate?


Which is not cut content. I remembered it being a bit more in favour of that hypothesis - something more like "I can do whatever I want *with this place*". Still, the rest - the name, the face, the personal connection etc - is enough for me.
                    He can do what he wants because you murdered the Lord of the castle. That doesn't insinuate anything about them being related. 

>Still, the rest - the name, the face, the personal connection etc - is enough for me.

And that's totally fine by me! I have my own crazy theories about the game that rely on speculation, it's why these games are as fun to delve into as they are. I replied with the 'its not canon' comment because the initial reply stating that Gostoc and Godrick are related stated it as fact instead of simply saying "We actually don't know, but, there's cut content in the game suggesting ____" 

That comment has like +200 upvotes. People are gonna see that little fun fact and start spewing it around, and now, something that was intentionally removed from the game for one reason or another, is being spread as fact. It's not a fact, the 'fact' is supported by content you cannot access without a PC and third party software because the developers did not want you to see it.
                >It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line

Just because some connections got cut, doesn't mean all of it's gone. The lilies and fevor's cookbook still clearly show a very strong connection. 

"A record of crafting techniques left by a man who was utterly captivated by St. Trina. He continued the search for her in his slumber.

Acquire the knowledge to craft the following:

- Bewitching Branch"
                    >Just because some connections got cut, doesn't mean all of it's gone. The lilies and fevor's cookbook still clearly show a very strong connection. 

I would love for you to read my comment in its entirety, because no where did I say they cut the whole thing out. I'm fully aware of the subtle inferences the game makes towards things we speculate on in the game, but we're not talking about that, we're talking about things the game explicitly explains to us. Neither Gostoc being related to Godrick nor St Trina being Miquella is directly stated in the current version of the game, and until otherwise both theories have to rely on using speculation, conjecture, or data mining. For as much as this game relies on ambiguity the community sure seems to struggle with differentiating between the things the game tells us outright(canon) and the popular theories the community has come up with to help with the cohesion of the overarching story. Both are great, but they aren't the same thing. St Trina in the current version of the game is basically an irrelevant character. The only reason that theory got the community's attention IS the cut quest line relating to her.
                        >It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line

It is not *all* from a cut questline though. Sure, the things that directly, explicitely state Miquella is Trina are cut. But not all the strong connections are cut.

>I would love for you to read my comment in its entirety

I did. 



>For as much as this game relies on ambiguity the community sure seems to struggle with differentiating between the things the game tells us outright(canon) and the popular theories the community has come up with

Well I don't? So? I'm literally just saying that there are strong points in favour of Miquella being Trina that didn't get cut. Which is true.

Even without the cut quest, the lilies are an extremely obvious connection, as is the fact that a fevor's cookbook is given to us when we find Miquella, and it lets us craft a Miquella item. I genuinely don't even know much of anything about the cut questline.
                            I hope I'm not coming off that I'm arguing that the current subtle references between Miquella and St Trina don't exist, because they do and I see them.  Within the confines of the game, there's enough there to make the player ask the question, 'hey what's the deal with these two?' My point is that the references aren't concrete enough to say with absolute certainty that they are the exact same person. You keep saying otherwise so at this point we're debating how to define a fact and I'm not interested in that sort of conversation.
        I mean, cut content can certainly be contradicted later without repercussion, but generally cut content at that point is going to have lore written into whatever is officially referenced for the game.  And the content is cut for other reasons such as time, game pacing, technical issues, quality, or other reasons.
            Regardless of the reason, it was cut. Cut content can provide context of the development cycle and plans for certain aspects of the game, but at the end of the day it didn't make the final product of the game, and referencing assets that aren't accessible in the main game to answer questions we have is incredibly risky. If you need more proof of why this is a bad idea, using cut content to support 'the canon', look into the development of ds3 and how often they shuffled around bosses and rewrote lore to make the final product we got work. It gets messy quick. Unless you're a dev for FROM, the multitude of reasons you gave for why content gets cut should be the precise reasons as to not take cut content seriously. We simply don't know.
                >If you need more proof of why this is a bad idea, using cut content to support 'the canon'  
  
And yet, that's actual storyline material that was at least written at some point.  Just looking at in game assets doesn't always make some material canon either, for example look at the pillars with symbols on them underground that people made elaborate theories on only to later realize it was an asset that anyone could purchase and use.
                    >that's actual storyline material that was at least written at some point.

storyline material that was deliberately deleted before they released the game.

&#x200B;

>look at the pillars with symbols on them underground that people made elaborate theories on only to later realize it was an asset that anyone could purchase and use.

What do you mean?   You don't have to create 100% of your assets you assign meaning to that you use in a video game. For all you and I know, that asset looking close to the symbolism they were trying to convey was the exact reason they went with it. They can create whatever association they want within the context of the game, it doesn't matter that the same asset is used in Destiny. We're not playing Destiny. To the flip side of this, and yet it could very well just be a cool ass generic pillar they wanted to use and didn't think twice about it. It can go either way, depending on how immersed you want to get in the game.  Debating whether or not assets were meant to convey a deeper meaning isn't the same as whether or not cut dialogue or quests should be taken as the game canon.
        Ahhh, yeah I haven’t paid attention to data mines and cut content, so that explains it. Feels a bit weird to include since there is a reason it is not included, but can definitely be an interesting thing to analyze and it makes some sense in this case
            I 100% agree with you. Context matters!
    He can order the gates to open, means he has some authority.
    There isn't concrete lore.

It's pretty much this:

-Gostoc is one of the very few characters in the game with "go" as the start of his name. 

-Gostoc has some sort of position of power.

-Gostoc knows Godrick personally, and despises him.

-Gostoc looks somewhat like Godrick, with his pale, saggy skin and white long hair.

-when he kills the player he says: "Oh, don't worry, I've got big plans for what's left of you..."

Godrick is looking for tarnished limbs to graft. So when Gostoc says he has big plans with your body, I'd assume it's because he wants to graft your parts onto himself. 


I'd say it's just as possible that Gostoc is Godrick's brother or nephew or something. I at least think it makes a lot of sense for him to be closely related to Godrick.
Wait Godrick isn't one of his kids
    Great great great [...] Great grandkids
        Ok, but is Marika the great  great ... grandmother then?
Also Godefroy is descended from that line, right? Or am I going insane?
    Yes, Godefroy as well
Pro tip: in elden ring, if the names are alliterative then they're related
I wonder if gostoc and Godrick are brothers and maybe godrick was the "blessed brother" who was able to graft, and he used this ability to take gostocs arm to prove a point and show his superiority?
    Gostoc is his son according to cut dialogues
And Godefroy
And Godefroy
What about Godefroy?
Even Nepheli is.
What about Godfroy?
yeah i wanted to separate them from Godwyn

if their names started with G's, Marika&Godfrey would have 3 daughters(strating with M) and 3 sons (starting with G), the sons would take their fathers letter, and daughters would take their mothers letter, im not sure why these two imbalance it

maybe because they're cursed omen? maybe because they're not as close to Godfrey? they probably couldnt become king because they're Omen so they couldnt be his successor?
    I'd guess it's to exclude them from the Golden lineage, since the omen brother's were hidden down in the sewers. The people of the lands between didn't know about them.

And then later Morgott rose as the veiled monarch, and people seemed to hold him in high steem even though they never saw him. But if he was Godgott i'd bet people would want to meet this dude and find out his a disgusting omen.
        Most likely this. Mohg and Morgott also sounds nasty too, comparing to something like Godwyn
            It sounds straight out of Tolkien's names for evil things, lol. If you're not familiar with Tolkien, Morgoth was the first dark lord in his legendarium, and his main liutenant, lord of balrogs, was Gothmog.
        Gorgott and Gohg would have been funny names 😂
    Miquella is a boy (even if he has his alter ego that's fem), but it seems the correlation is they take after merikas name if they are cursed at birth. The Godfry naming convention would have all been born normal and then been fucked up later
    Marika and Godfrey don't have 3 daughters, Malenia and Miquella are children of Marika and Radagon, also, Miquella isn't even a girl, he's multiple times mentioned as a young boy with female traces, and about Melina, since there's no much information of her, it is wrong to say that she is also Marika's daughter, it is still too early for that, and for now it is just a theory
Millicent is more of a shoot. She has other sisters whom are considered imperfect versions. Just like plant life
    And they, of course are named Millicent, Maureen, Mary, Amy, and Polyanna
Milicent and her sisters are like bog creatures who just sort of emerged out of the primordial soup of Malenias red swamp

Putting that together like that makes it feel like there's some sort of menstrual metaphor going on actually. Maybe something leftover from bloodborne where that was a big thing.
a guy? mmh i was sure they're a woman, i see them in my sleep sometimes, st. trina...
On top of her name being a hint like all the other characters, Melina telling us her mother is inside the Erdtree, and Melina's whole purpose (given to her by her mother) is to help burn down the Erdtree and finish what Marika started, there's also the matter of the butterflies. There's three types of butterflies in the game: Aeonian (rotted) for Malenia, Nascent (eternally young) for Miquella, and Smoldering (fiery) for Melina.

Honestly, there are way more obtuse theories that are just basically accepted as gospel by the community, I don't understand why Melina being Marika's daughter is so obscure to so many people.
    I’ve always assumed that Melina is the “human” side of Marika, whereas the part controlled by the Golden Order remains chained. The reason Melina sacrifices herself is to fix her own mistakes.

I do not discard the daughter theory, but it has always made more sense to me that Marika herself would be Melina, rather than an previously unknown child made for the express purpose of sacrificing itself.
    not to mention that, with Marika and Radagon being kind of sort of the same person, all three of their kids had some huge abnormalities. Miquella stayed a child forever, Malenia was born with the scarlet rot, and Melina either burned to death or only exists as a sort of ghost next to sites of grace (bonfires).
        Very true, I did leave that out from my comment, but excellent point.
    i feel like it’s directly stated by the game lmfao didn’t realize it was considered a theory
    Honestly I just never considered it and I totally forgot about the butterflies theory. 

Melina is just so poorly utilized given her importance and comes ide as a brat so I just disliked her entirely.

But that's for the reply!
She's referred to as "MaricaOfDaughter" in the game files. 

That doesn't mean they couldn't have changed it at some point (I think Roderika is referred to as "Farnese", after the Berserk character she was inspired by), but it's a very strong lead.
    Right but if we did that the misbegotten also are named children of Radagon (presumably discarded bastards). Which honestly fully explains why they have 3 of the Legendary armaments.

Side note Fromsofts cut content always is the stuff that went so hard.
        Radagon seriously got around. 

If we take the game files as gospel, the misbegotten may have been created as punishment for Radagon making contact with the Crucible, so maybe Melina was born in a similar way, when Marica made contact with the Frenzied Flame.
            Now that's some head cannon I can get into. The fact she has no cut content and her entire life is a whiny brat still agitated me. If you go under the assumption she just wants to get it over with and you happen to be the best option then sure? Maybe I get her lack of involvement in any of this?
                Yeah, it's strange that she's one of the most mysterious NPCs and she's with us for 80% of the game. 

We do know why she chooses to travel with the player, however. It's because Torrent approved of us. She's just deferring to his judgement.
Did she not say her mother remains in the Erdtree or something?
    Well anyone who dies is absorbed into the Erdtree again so while sure she could be vague about it I would have no idea why she would be.
There are plenty of strong reasons to believe Melina is Marika's daughter.

Melina uses the moveset of the black knives. They are Numen, just like Marika.

Melina uses a unique erdtree incantation, which would indicate she is strongly connected to the erdtree. Of all characters besides Melina, Marika is most strongly connected to the erdtree.

Melina can speak Marika's echoes.

Melina's name is clearly quite similar to Malenia, Miquella and Marika. Going by the naming conventions of the game, she's a demigod with Marika's blood in her.

"Me, I'm searching for my purpose given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree long ago"

Hmmmm, do we know of a motherly figure who is inside the erdtree??
And FromSoft has done it since at least dark souls. Gwyn, Gwyndolin, Gwynevere
Finwë, Findis, Fingolfin, Finarfin, Fingon, Finrod, Finduilas
Nelphi is daughter to Godfrey.
    I'm pretty sure shes his granddaughter not his daughter but still she's not a child of Marika so she's not really a sibling to godrick at all
        I think it was confirmed but I may be wrong.
            I'm not sure what you mean was confirmed?
                Naah, it's like she "might" be Godfrey's daughter so it is not 100% certain.
                    Yea I thought when you talked to her through the quest she or Gideon mentions being the granddaughter of a chieftain which would be Horah loux but it's been a while since I did her quest
                        Yeah that's what I had in mind. But I don't know if Gideon said daughter or granddaughter. Sadly that I cannot find the dialog in Elden Rings wiki page.
see this is what really gave it away for me [https://i.imgur.com/VNTSlov.png](https://i.imgur.com/VNTSlov.png)

there's also dialogue from melina implying she's Marika's daughter so yeah it's pretty much confirmed
Yes, no other person trapped in the erdtree. Also ton of evidence radagon is her father
She has dialogue basically directly stating it. Then from there we can take evidence like Melina's name, the 3 butterfly items, and Melina's hair to conclude she's radagons daughter too
im gonna be honest i kinda forgot about him when i wrote that, maybe because of his eternal childhood and being very womanlike >also st. trina
    Forgetfulness is a good explanation i guess
Still Rykard is a cool name for a cool boss.
Aragorn son of arathorn!
    Dwarves especially

Thorin son of Thrain
Thrain son of Thror
Gimli son of Gloin

Then you have non-generational connections
Fili and Killi
Balin and Dwalin
Dori, Nori, and Ori
Bofur and Bombur with their cousin Bifur
        Yeah. It’s pretty consistent with the Children of Iluvatar as well. As one comment below me mentioned, the Elvish house of Finwe. 

Also consider Theodred, son of Theoden; Eomer and Eowyn son and daughter of Theodwyn, sister of Theoden; Theoden, son of Thengel, son of Fengel. 

I love it when fantasy authors incorporate this kind of real-life historical detail.
    Frodo son of Drogo!
        The stallion who mounts the world.
It's always funny seeing people complain about similar names in Elden Ring as a Tolkien fan, like come back when you're trying to remember the entire House of Finwe.
    It's also a common thing in real life. Plenty of siblings share parts of their name.
Yes, and he had a huge influence on both Miyazaki and Martin.
It's funny because that could easily have been the logic used by royals when deciding to use similar names.
    And dont forget that they literally named their sons after themselves and added a number next to it and called it a day
        Exactly, they're big on branding. Toyal families are more like companies than families as we think of them.
Oh, good catch!
He just needs to finish his books now
    He won't.
    I've been begging for this for 20 years. I've consigned myself to the fact that he will never tie up the storyline of A Song of Ice and Fire. 😣
"I don't need to hide myself in the game because GEORGE R.R. MARTIN WORKED ON THIS GAME is the first thing they ever told you about it" is a pretty cool answer to this persistent belief.
They are the less important gods in the games with no screentime at all and they also all end with an A
    Ah okay. 
I’m so sick of acronyms.

Istvan is swagging the scale set
Honestly, one of my favourite things about ASOIAF is that they name people realistically. Ned names his sons after his king/bestie, his brother and his father. This is fairly normal behaviour through a decent chunk of human history… especially so for royal/noble families that have to think about lineage. 

It’s also totally fine for people to have the same name. There were 5 Lauras in my year at school!
    Also while it might require a little more attention to differentiate between family members, it makes it easier to keep track of who belongs to which political faction.
    It also allows for readability.  Fantasy is hard to chew on when the names just do not sound well on the tongue.   I love the wheel of time but it is guilty of this cheesy naming style.
        nothing gets me more than two much proper noun usage.  "(long obtuse proper noun) went with (long obtuse proper noun), and his lord (long obtuse proper noun) to (long obtuse proper noun but used as a verb)" sick i have no idea what happened.
    yea I know a guy as "black ryan" hes a friend of a friend. i thought it was a bit too on the nose till i found out that there were 5+ ryans in that friend group and after awhile you gotta differentiate them somehow.
        IM DEADDD
    He also names Jon after Jon Arryn who p much raised him, which follows the symbolism of him raising Jon.
The dude said he'd totally for real 100% finish his book, too

Every few years he says it

For over a decade

Call me crazy but I don't think he's all that honest
    You telling me he's been yankin' my chain for 12 years?
        At least
    >Call me crazy but I don't think he's all that honest

Okay: you're crazy.

There's a pretty obvious difference between *wanting to and intending to* finish a book and just being unable to (due to lack of motivation for example); and lying.
        My biggest craw is the people that think GRRM made any sort of timeline for ER, when the whole issue with ASOIAF is he's not great at outlining stories.
    Yeah he usually says that while sitting on a beach somewhere drinking margaritas, waiting for the Grateful Dead show to start. Doubt.


I also saw he has 4 books he plans on writing before starting the final GoT book. So that ain't happening. 
        every second that man breaths is a fucking gift at his weight. sucks that we wont get the final/next book but good on him for selling out and living the high life on the beach.
    no he haven't said it even once.
You read that from other fans' speculation.


The only time he has commented on it publically, he said it was not intentional.
Let me rephrase that lol. This is why I can never remember who is who
    That's very foul tarnished of you.
Noone asked you to
He means the fact that they correspond with George’s initials is a coincidence
It's less that he likes to do it, and more that it was legitimately a thing in the past. Inheriting names or naming someone after a relative was a way to show off your "pedigree"
Right that's what I was thinking!
    I mean there’s always the chance they’ll go for Mohg. But what are the odds on a first playthrough that they know about Mohg, and are legitimately prepared to fight Mohg before Morgott? Probably extremely slim judging by the fact that Mohg is considered as difficult as Malenia lol
        I'm playing back through now for the second time after beating it at release and completely forgot mohg was at the bottom of leyndell until stumbling upon him, got him on my second try though. So I guess I beat him before morgott, but still did Godrick, Rennala, Radahn, mohg. I don't remember doing mohg until after the capital last time.
            Oh I’m talking about Mohg, Lord of Blood. Mohg, the Omen is down underneath Leyndell. He’s guarding the Three Fingers. I could be wrong but I’m also pretty sure that Morgott has a wall that guards the flame of frenzy down below Leyndell? Again, could be completely wrong here.
                Could be, I didn't see that, but I also didnt see the three fingers after killing mohg the omen, was there something else I needed to do to find it? Could someone have killed mohg lord of blood before morgott? Isn't he in mountaintops of the giants?
                    So you can technically do Mohg, Lord of Blood at any time that you want. You don’t actually have to go all the way to Consecrated Snowfield to get there. If you complete White Mask Varre’s questline, he gives you an item called ‘Lord of Blood’s Exultation’ and if you use it, it takes you straight there.

After Mohg, the Omen, all you have to do is go back to that site of grace after you kill him. Once you’re there, literally all you have to do is smack the altar. The altar will open and there’s a passageway that leads down to the three fingers. It’s a little bit tricky to get down to the fingers because of the platforms, but it’s possible. It’ll definitely make you rage a little bit.

Sorry if my response is a little jumbled, I was writing this while at work lol.
                        All good, I appreciate it! But man, this game has so much I missed the first time. I never even made it to deep root the first time and just fought fias champions this time. I'll need to go back down there and check that out, I dont even know if I knew varre had a quest, lol. What a game
                            Oh this game is so complex. I think my first playthrough took me like, 93 hours or something like that. I explored every area so much and STILL missed a whole bunch of stuff. The amount of detail that went into this game is just so amazing.
What back story?
    The one you didn’t pay attention to apparently
        GRRM didn’t write shit for the game that we play.
            What did he write, O learned one?
                Crazy how he ghosted, I was excited to be educated
                    Me too! I guess he had to go drop epic knowledge bombs somewhere else…
Refer to comment by u/wangchangbackup . If you’re a massively successful writer and associated with the game publicly why bother lying about something so stupid?

It must have been pretty hard for him to write that part with only one hand
Bro, come on.
Yep winds and how the show ended (not his fault really but there’s enough hate for it he can get some too) 

I simply must know how it ends!
You’re misusing that.

Context: Mr.Obese is full of himself, because he made LORT with tits.
    He wasn't who I was talking about.
The quest that would confirm it directly was cut, but Godrick and Gostoc do look quite similar, and there's a reason Gostoc can just *order* the gates to be open.
    Good point on the gates, but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.  
  
Plus, their relationship didn't seem that great.  I took it more like he was saying they had an easy prisoner if the gates were opened.
        What about Godrick makes you think he'd be a good dad? But despite their relationship, Gostoc would still be the heir and therefore of some value to Godrick - if only as a source of high-quality grafting materials (at least breeding-wise). Like, a paranoid coward like Godrick wouldn't put some random peasant who hates his guts in charge of the gates.
            >What about Godrick makes you think he'd be a good dad?  
  
Nothing about being good really, more the fact that he's the weakest of his family, and thus would be the most interested in having some other semi formidable fighters around.  
  
More it's interesting to me that Gostoc has no grafted parts, and may or may not have lost a hand to grafting.  While the regular soldiers in the castle have been augmented, such as the blades on the birds and the grafted enemy and such.
                [deleted]
                    Given the second ass kicking he took in his castle getting assaulted by something from the ocean (looks like a sea creature hit it), maybe he should be rethinking that.
                        [deleted]
                Godrick is actually the opposite. He’s not only the weakest, but he’s the most cowardly in his family. He’s terrified that anyone with a modicum of strength will try to take the little bit of power he’s managed to take for himself, so he surrounds himself with peons. He ensures that everyone around him is either far weaker than him, or under his direct control. Rather than having powerful fighters assist him, he takes their limbs and grafts them onto himself for the small fraction of their strength that gives him
            Don't forget he has the ability to steal your runes
        >but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.

It's only a hand, and there's no proof it was taken for grafting. Gostoc steals your runes when you die and his merchant inventory hints that he stole those items as well. Having a hand cut off was a punishment for thieves in older days.
        Just because they’re related doesn’t mean they get along. Don’t you have relatives you loathe?
        You can actually find Gostoc following you through stormveil leading up to Godrick fight. As you're walking up to him in these three spots, his idle dialogue would suggest that he's examining body parts for his own desire to graft. If you also attack him at the start and he kills you, he will say that he'll take good care of your parts. Credit to VaatiVidya for that knowledge.
        >but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.  

Why? If Godrick is so obsessed with his royal heritage, his own son would also have that golden lineage blood.
    If it was cut then he isn't. It's literally not in the game.
        It's literally in the game, just not in a way that's accessible without outside tools. And if we only considered the text when researching lore, there wouldn't *be* any lore. So many youtubers would lose their jobs. 13+ hour long part one video woud be ten minutes long. We would never see Strider ported into the Lands Between. Etc.
            This is absolutely delusional. It was left in the code but it's clearly not in the game since you need to bloody hack it to see it in its raw form. You can't acces it through gameplay, how can you even argue it's part of the game?
                Cut content in these games often comes back as dlc. Big L for you no more lore 4 you
                    Then it's not cut anymore...
                        See?  Now you're getting it! Ya fucking onion
                The phrasing was "literally in the game", not "accessible normally through gameplay". And *literally*? It's in the game.
                    If it's called cut content, then explain what was it cut *from*? It's in the code, not in the game. Devs clearly didn't want this to be part of it.
                        It was cut from the game, of course!


However, that doesn't mean it's been removed, it was just hidden. Still in the game files, with partial dialogue and voices, and mechanical stuff - scripts and shit, unlike anything the devs actually didn't want to use. And there are many reasons something they really wanted to use would be cut - maybe not enough time, maybe it was interfering with other events, maybe they didn't want to overcrowd Limgrave with quests.


My point is - it's still in the game, it wasn't just some first draft stuff discarded at the planning stage, effort was clearly put into it, it can be modded in if you know the game dev sorcery (like that guy fromsoftserve who re-remasters DS1 on youtube), or it could even be added later by FS themselves, now that they had time to work on it! (Wishful thinking). That's the reason why cut content like that is generally accepted as canon.
    How does he look similar? He has same model and outfit like all the other commoners 😅
Yeah Godstoc was the family pet
    I thought that was godrick
        Nah, that was Rick, Soldier of God.
Go back into Godrick's arena after sitting at a grace (might need to pass time/sit outside the arena), but before completing Nepheli's questline.

Gostoc can be found talking mad shit over Godrick's nubby corpse.

So, double TiL, gostoc has daddy issues.

Triple, TiL (maybe not for you but for those unaware, at least): nepheli loux, descendant of Hoarah loux, Warrior, would be a sibling of godrick.

This is why she gets the crown and stormveil in her questline. That detail is not very nuanced and I'm skipping over a few things, but ye.
    Isn't that mentioned directly in her questline that they need someone from that family line?  It's right after you clear the guys castle I thought.
        It says that godrick usurped the throne. Iirc, it never says who from but only that nepheli is heir, later revealed. 

We don't even learn of Hoarah loux until right at the end of the storyline. Not to mention From notoriously does not hold up flashing signs that point to these details; there's a ton of gaps but just enough solid info to cause great debates lol
            >We don't even learn of Hoarah loux until right at the end of the storyline

He's in the opening cutscene when you start the game...
                I'm gonna level with you. It's been like two years since I watched that. Was he called Hoarah loux or Godfrey in that video?
                    They refer to him as Hoarah Loux. It's the image of him and Serosh being crucified
                    He's referred to as "Hoarah Loux, Chieftain of the Badlands"
        Kenneth mentions that, but I think Nepheli just says it’s because she command the hawk that only obeys said bloodline. She just wonders why the hawk listens to her I think.
    >Triple, TiL (maybe not for you but for those unaware, at least): nepheli loux, descendant of Hoarah loux, Warrior, would be a sibling of godrick.

Nice catch!

What makes Sir Gideon Ofnir though? Isn't he her daddy?
        Adopted
        Adoptive daddy.

He says he "took her in" at a young age.
        Others have answered, but the various dialogue with gideon and nepheli reveals a few things.

Nepheli was part of a village that was massacred, much like the albinauric village under moonlight altar, which left her not just orphaned, but completely alone.

Gideon took her in and raised her, making her loyal to the roundtable hold until she found what Gideon did to the albinauric village in the name of his own pursuits. This is why she feels betrayed and can be found in the lower parts of the hold feeling dejected and lost. And Gideon does not care. So fourth fun fact, nepheli also has daddy issues lol.

I'm still missing some information myself on the link between the spirit ashes you give her that leads her to stormveil, but at face value she becomes the lord of the castle and swears fealty to you because you cheered her up with N O S T A L G I A!

Shame that didn't mean you could summon her more often as a cooperator... you know, versus the alternative ending where you can summon her pretty freely.
            Nepheli and Gideon have known each other Nepheli's whole life as Nepheli says but Gideon specifies he didn't adopt her until she lost her grace. After they had both lived out their first lives, died and then after the Shattering were resurrected to come back to the Lands Between and eventually Nepheli like most Tarnished in the game beside Gideon and Godfrey, lost her grace again. He didn't raise her per se.
    Hey, so that's foreshadowing Hoarah Loux identity as well! I never connected the dots.
    >Triple, TiL (maybe not for you but for those unaware, at least): nepheli loux, descendant of Hoarah loux, Warrior, would be a sibling of godrick.

Not a sibling at all. More like a distant cousin of some sort. Nepheli Loux probably is a child of Godfrey's Hoarah Loux persona, and has nothing to do with Marika.
        TiL if my dad has a child with someone, who is not my mom, that doesn't make the child a half-sibling but


>More like a distant cousin of some sort.

Get out of here, my guy! If you said daughter of Godfrey's sibling, Gregory Loux, then yeah that would make her a cousin of godrick.

No such sibling is named, the only person carrying that name is hoarah. The implication, as you state yourself is that nepheli is Hoarah's daughter. This means when Hoarah/Godfrey sired Godrick with Marika, that makes Godfrey's daughter Godricks half-sibling
            >TiL if my dad has a child with someone, who is not my mom, that doesn't make the child a half-sibling but

Godrick isn't Godfrey's child.

>This means when Hoarah/Godfrey sired Godrick with Marika,

He didn't though... godrick is a distant descendant of Godfrey. This is made explicit in game dialogue.

>The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika. Godrick the Grafted was but a distant relation... The runt of the litter, his divine blood sorely diluted".
Even more important: is godrick and godefroy related?
It’s confirmed by cut content. There’s a cut line of dialogue where Gostoc straight up says “I am the son of Godrick” or something along those lines. I chose to believe it’s canon though.
They're referencing cut content. People tend to canonize cut quest lines, but FROM intentionally cut it out of the game so if they didn't want it in the game, then it's not canon.  [V-Limit made a video discussing all the cut content surrounding Gostoc](https://youtu.be/LadiFWjWhMI?si=w6pV4gjAum_yHKMa)
    Gostoc does look like Godrick though, and he's clearly got a personal grudge against Godrick too. Also that creepy line about doing anything he wants - why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?
        >Also that creepy line about doing anything he wants - why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?


I can see why some people tend to canonize cut content, sometimes it makes more sense than what they ended up leaving in.
            It would be easier to dismiss if it was completely cut
            The creepy line wasn't cut.
                I know, that's not what I meant. 


Gastocs current version, where he says that line, makes more sense when paired with the original cut content. Without it, what he says doesn't really make any sense if the final version is supposed to be just some random little dude running around. If he's a part of Godrick's lineage, then naturally the line makes sense.
                    It makes sense on its own. The Lord of the castle he resides in has been killed, and he had no heir. There's no one left with authority over Gostoc, so he's free to do as he likes. The 'cut content' changes the context.
            I completely agree with you, but just because something makes more sense doesn't make it canon. Especially in this context when it wasn't disclosed that their familial relation was found in a cut quest. I like Gostoc's cut quests they're very interesting, and I hope a lot of the discovered cut quest lines end up being restored in SotE.
                I'm completely in favour of disregarding cut content if was replaced or the context for it was changed, but in this case they just pruned the quest a bit, with seemingly no changes to the remaining ending or any of the npcs related to it. It's basically cannon.
                    >It's basically cannon


You're free to head-canonize whatever you'd like, but like I said earlier if you need a PC + external software to support your claim of what's canon or not, it's not canon. If you can't boot up Elden Ring right now and support the claim being made, it cannot be considered 'canon.' Canon should only include things that can be verified within the confines of the game we can all boot up and play right now.(ex - Ranni is an Empyrean. Placidusaxx was an Elden Lord. Radagon is preventing our entry to the Erdtree.) Everything else is conjecture, speculation, or theory. (Ex -Melina is the GEQ. Miquella is St Trina. Marika helped orchestrate the NotBK)

I'm not trying to be a hard ass about this, exploring the conjecture, theory, and speculation spaces this game provides the player is why I love these games so much! However, there does need distinctions between these concepts or you end up with people proudly proclaiming shit about the game that isn't technically true.
                        100%. i was going to say, 'idk why you're being downvoted' but i do know. stop disrupting the head canon!

not that this is datamining related, but this all harkens back to when people were taking the ancientDragon=aldia to be canon, during dks2 vanilla days. there was no text to support it, just a bunch of wildly formed connections.
            Same with the cut content about the nomadic merchants being blamed for worshipping the frenzy flame. It’s all in a cut quest for Kale. There’s still stuff in game for it tho like the dead merchants in the shunning grounds and the nomadic merchant in Altus who uses frenzy flame incantations
        >why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?

You're asking a question about cut content relating back to other cut content. You're welcome to canonize Gostoc and Godrick being related, the only point I was trying to make is that the theory originates from cut content and anything that derives from that should be taken with a dump truck amount of salt. It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line. Sure, it might be restored in some fashion in the DLC, but until then it's just fanfic.
            I was talking about this line:


>Now, I supposed I'm free. I can do whatever takes my fancy...Can't I, mate?


Which is not cut content. I remembered it being a bit more in favour of that hypothesis - something more like "I can do whatever I want *with this place*". Still, the rest - the name, the face, the personal connection etc - is enough for me.
                He can do what he wants because you murdered the Lord of the castle. That doesn't insinuate anything about them being related. 

>Still, the rest - the name, the face, the personal connection etc - is enough for me.

And that's totally fine by me! I have my own crazy theories about the game that rely on speculation, it's why these games are as fun to delve into as they are. I replied with the 'its not canon' comment because the initial reply stating that Gostoc and Godrick are related stated it as fact instead of simply saying "We actually don't know, but, there's cut content in the game suggesting ____" 

That comment has like +200 upvotes. People are gonna see that little fun fact and start spewing it around, and now, something that was intentionally removed from the game for one reason or another, is being spread as fact. It's not a fact, the 'fact' is supported by content you cannot access without a PC and third party software because the developers did not want you to see it.
            >It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line

Just because some connections got cut, doesn't mean all of it's gone. The lilies and fevor's cookbook still clearly show a very strong connection. 

"A record of crafting techniques left by a man who was utterly captivated by St. Trina. He continued the search for her in his slumber.

Acquire the knowledge to craft the following:

- Bewitching Branch"
                >Just because some connections got cut, doesn't mean all of it's gone. The lilies and fevor's cookbook still clearly show a very strong connection. 

I would love for you to read my comment in its entirety, because no where did I say they cut the whole thing out. I'm fully aware of the subtle inferences the game makes towards things we speculate on in the game, but we're not talking about that, we're talking about things the game explicitly explains to us. Neither Gostoc being related to Godrick nor St Trina being Miquella is directly stated in the current version of the game, and until otherwise both theories have to rely on using speculation, conjecture, or data mining. For as much as this game relies on ambiguity the community sure seems to struggle with differentiating between the things the game tells us outright(canon) and the popular theories the community has come up with to help with the cohesion of the overarching story. Both are great, but they aren't the same thing. St Trina in the current version of the game is basically an irrelevant character. The only reason that theory got the community's attention IS the cut quest line relating to her.
                    >It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line

It is not *all* from a cut questline though. Sure, the things that directly, explicitely state Miquella is Trina are cut. But not all the strong connections are cut.

>I would love for you to read my comment in its entirety

I did. 



>For as much as this game relies on ambiguity the community sure seems to struggle with differentiating between the things the game tells us outright(canon) and the popular theories the community has come up with

Well I don't? So? I'm literally just saying that there are strong points in favour of Miquella being Trina that didn't get cut. Which is true.

Even without the cut quest, the lilies are an extremely obvious connection, as is the fact that a fevor's cookbook is given to us when we find Miquella, and it lets us craft a Miquella item. I genuinely don't even know much of anything about the cut questline.
                        I hope I'm not coming off that I'm arguing that the current subtle references between Miquella and St Trina don't exist, because they do and I see them.  Within the confines of the game, there's enough there to make the player ask the question, 'hey what's the deal with these two?' My point is that the references aren't concrete enough to say with absolute certainty that they are the exact same person. You keep saying otherwise so at this point we're debating how to define a fact and I'm not interested in that sort of conversation.
    I mean, cut content can certainly be contradicted later without repercussion, but generally cut content at that point is going to have lore written into whatever is officially referenced for the game.  And the content is cut for other reasons such as time, game pacing, technical issues, quality, or other reasons.
        Regardless of the reason, it was cut. Cut content can provide context of the development cycle and plans for certain aspects of the game, but at the end of the day it didn't make the final product of the game, and referencing assets that aren't accessible in the main game to answer questions we have is incredibly risky. If you need more proof of why this is a bad idea, using cut content to support 'the canon', look into the development of ds3 and how often they shuffled around bosses and rewrote lore to make the final product we got work. It gets messy quick. Unless you're a dev for FROM, the multitude of reasons you gave for why content gets cut should be the precise reasons as to not take cut content seriously. We simply don't know.
            >If you need more proof of why this is a bad idea, using cut content to support 'the canon'  
  
And yet, that's actual storyline material that was at least written at some point.  Just looking at in game assets doesn't always make some material canon either, for example look at the pillars with symbols on them underground that people made elaborate theories on only to later realize it was an asset that anyone could purchase and use.
                >that's actual storyline material that was at least written at some point.

storyline material that was deliberately deleted before they released the game.

&#x200B;

>look at the pillars with symbols on them underground that people made elaborate theories on only to later realize it was an asset that anyone could purchase and use.

What do you mean?   You don't have to create 100% of your assets you assign meaning to that you use in a video game. For all you and I know, that asset looking close to the symbolism they were trying to convey was the exact reason they went with it. They can create whatever association they want within the context of the game, it doesn't matter that the same asset is used in Destiny. We're not playing Destiny. To the flip side of this, and yet it could very well just be a cool ass generic pillar they wanted to use and didn't think twice about it. It can go either way, depending on how immersed you want to get in the game.  Debating whether or not assets were meant to convey a deeper meaning isn't the same as whether or not cut dialogue or quests should be taken as the game canon.
    Ahhh, yeah I haven’t paid attention to data mines and cut content, so that explains it. Feels a bit weird to include since there is a reason it is not included, but can definitely be an interesting thing to analyze and it makes some sense in this case
        I 100% agree with you. Context matters!
He can order the gates to open, means he has some authority.
There isn't concrete lore.

It's pretty much this:

-Gostoc is one of the very few characters in the game with "go" as the start of his name. 

-Gostoc has some sort of position of power.

-Gostoc knows Godrick personally, and despises him.

-Gostoc looks somewhat like Godrick, with his pale, saggy skin and white long hair.

-when he kills the player he says: "Oh, don't worry, I've got big plans for what's left of you..."

Godrick is looking for tarnished limbs to graft. So when Gostoc says he has big plans with your body, I'd assume it's because he wants to graft your parts onto himself. 


I'd say it's just as possible that Gostoc is Godrick's brother or nephew or something. I at least think it makes a lot of sense for him to be closely related to Godrick.
Great great great [...] Great grandkids
    Ok, but is Marika the great  great ... grandmother then?
Yes, Godefroy as well
Gostoc is his son according to cut dialogues
I'd guess it's to exclude them from the Golden lineage, since the omen brother's were hidden down in the sewers. The people of the lands between didn't know about them.

And then later Morgott rose as the veiled monarch, and people seemed to hold him in high steem even though they never saw him. But if he was Godgott i'd bet people would want to meet this dude and find out his a disgusting omen.
    Most likely this. Mohg and Morgott also sounds nasty too, comparing to something like Godwyn
        It sounds straight out of Tolkien's names for evil things, lol. If you're not familiar with Tolkien, Morgoth was the first dark lord in his legendarium, and his main liutenant, lord of balrogs, was Gothmog.
    Gorgott and Gohg would have been funny names 😂
Miquella is a boy (even if he has his alter ego that's fem), but it seems the correlation is they take after merikas name if they are cursed at birth. The Godfry naming convention would have all been born normal and then been fucked up later
Marika and Godfrey don't have 3 daughters, Malenia and Miquella are children of Marika and Radagon, also, Miquella isn't even a girl, he's multiple times mentioned as a young boy with female traces, and about Melina, since there's no much information of her, it is wrong to say that she is also Marika's daughter, it is still too early for that, and for now it is just a theory
And they, of course are named Millicent, Maureen, Mary, Amy, and Polyanna
I’ve always assumed that Melina is the “human” side of Marika, whereas the part controlled by the Golden Order remains chained. The reason Melina sacrifices herself is to fix her own mistakes.

I do not discard the daughter theory, but it has always made more sense to me that Marika herself would be Melina, rather than an previously unknown child made for the express purpose of sacrificing itself.
not to mention that, with Marika and Radagon being kind of sort of the same person, all three of their kids had some huge abnormalities. Miquella stayed a child forever, Malenia was born with the scarlet rot, and Melina either burned to death or only exists as a sort of ghost next to sites of grace (bonfires).
    Very true, I did leave that out from my comment, but excellent point.
i feel like it’s directly stated by the game lmfao didn’t realize it was considered a theory
Honestly I just never considered it and I totally forgot about the butterflies theory. 

Melina is just so poorly utilized given her importance and comes ide as a brat so I just disliked her entirely.

But that's for the reply!
Right but if we did that the misbegotten also are named children of Radagon (presumably discarded bastards). Which honestly fully explains why they have 3 of the Legendary armaments.

Side note Fromsofts cut content always is the stuff that went so hard.
    Radagon seriously got around. 

If we take the game files as gospel, the misbegotten may have been created as punishment for Radagon making contact with the Crucible, so maybe Melina was born in a similar way, when Marica made contact with the Frenzied Flame.
        Now that's some head cannon I can get into. The fact she has no cut content and her entire life is a whiny brat still agitated me. If you go under the assumption she just wants to get it over with and you happen to be the best option then sure? Maybe I get her lack of involvement in any of this?
            Yeah, it's strange that she's one of the most mysterious NPCs and she's with us for 80% of the game. 

We do know why she chooses to travel with the player, however. It's because Torrent approved of us. She's just deferring to his judgement.
Well anyone who dies is absorbed into the Erdtree again so while sure she could be vague about it I would have no idea why she would be.
I'm pretty sure shes his granddaughter not his daughter but still she's not a child of Marika so she's not really a sibling to godrick at all
    I think it was confirmed but I may be wrong.
        I'm not sure what you mean was confirmed?
            Naah, it's like she "might" be Godfrey's daughter so it is not 100% certain.
                Yea I thought when you talked to her through the quest she or Gideon mentions being the granddaughter of a chieftain which would be Horah loux but it's been a while since I did her quest
                    Yeah that's what I had in mind. But I don't know if Gideon said daughter or granddaughter. Sadly that I cannot find the dialog in Elden Rings wiki page.
Forgetfulness is a good explanation i guess
Dwarves especially

Thorin son of Thrain
Thrain son of Thror
Gimli son of Gloin

Then you have non-generational connections
Fili and Killi
Balin and Dwalin
Dori, Nori, and Ori
Bofur and Bombur with their cousin Bifur
    Yeah. It’s pretty consistent with the Children of Iluvatar as well. As one comment below me mentioned, the Elvish house of Finwe. 

Also consider Theodred, son of Theoden; Eomer and Eowyn son and daughter of Theodwyn, sister of Theoden; Theoden, son of Thengel, son of Fengel. 

I love it when fantasy authors incorporate this kind of real-life historical detail.
Frodo son of Drogo!
    The stallion who mounts the world.
It's also a common thing in real life. Plenty of siblings share parts of their name.
And dont forget that they literally named their sons after themselves and added a number next to it and called it a day
    Exactly, they're big on branding. Toyal families are more like companies than families as we think of them.
He won't.
I've been begging for this for 20 years. I've consigned myself to the fact that he will never tie up the storyline of A Song of Ice and Fire. 😣
Ah okay. 
A song of Ice and Frenchfries.
Also while it might require a little more attention to differentiate between family members, it makes it easier to keep track of who belongs to which political faction.
It also allows for readability.  Fantasy is hard to chew on when the names just do not sound well on the tongue.   I love the wheel of time but it is guilty of this cheesy naming style.
    nothing gets me more than two much proper noun usage.  "(long obtuse proper noun) went with (long obtuse proper noun), and his lord (long obtuse proper noun) to (long obtuse proper noun but used as a verb)" sick i have no idea what happened.
yea I know a guy as "black ryan" hes a friend of a friend. i thought it was a bit too on the nose till i found out that there were 5+ ryans in that friend group and after awhile you gotta differentiate them somehow.
    IM DEADDD
He also names Jon after Jon Arryn who p much raised him, which follows the symbolism of him raising Jon.
You telling me he's been yankin' my chain for 12 years?
    At least
>Call me crazy but I don't think he's all that honest

Okay: you're crazy.

There's a pretty obvious difference between *wanting to and intending to* finish a book and just being unable to (due to lack of motivation for example); and lying.
    My biggest craw is the people that think GRRM made any sort of timeline for ER, when the whole issue with ASOIAF is he's not great at outlining stories.
Yeah he usually says that while sitting on a beach somewhere drinking margaritas, waiting for the Grateful Dead show to start. Doubt.


I also saw he has 4 books he plans on writing before starting the final GoT book. So that ain't happening. 
    every second that man breaths is a fucking gift at his weight. sucks that we wont get the final/next book but good on him for selling out and living the high life on the beach.
no he haven't said it even once.
That's very foul tarnished of you.
I mean there’s always the chance they’ll go for Mohg. But what are the odds on a first playthrough that they know about Mohg, and are legitimately prepared to fight Mohg before Morgott? Probably extremely slim judging by the fact that Mohg is considered as difficult as Malenia lol
    I'm playing back through now for the second time after beating it at release and completely forgot mohg was at the bottom of leyndell until stumbling upon him, got him on my second try though. So I guess I beat him before morgott, but still did Godrick, Rennala, Radahn, mohg. I don't remember doing mohg until after the capital last time.
        Oh I’m talking about Mohg, Lord of Blood. Mohg, the Omen is down underneath Leyndell. He’s guarding the Three Fingers. I could be wrong but I’m also pretty sure that Morgott has a wall that guards the flame of frenzy down below Leyndell? Again, could be completely wrong here.
            Could be, I didn't see that, but I also didnt see the three fingers after killing mohg the omen, was there something else I needed to do to find it? Could someone have killed mohg lord of blood before morgott? Isn't he in mountaintops of the giants?
                So you can technically do Mohg, Lord of Blood at any time that you want. You don’t actually have to go all the way to Consecrated Snowfield to get there. If you complete White Mask Varre’s questline, he gives you an item called ‘Lord of Blood’s Exultation’ and if you use it, it takes you straight there.

After Mohg, the Omen, all you have to do is go back to that site of grace after you kill him. Once you’re there, literally all you have to do is smack the altar. The altar will open and there’s a passageway that leads down to the three fingers. It’s a little bit tricky to get down to the fingers because of the platforms, but it’s possible. It’ll definitely make you rage a little bit.

Sorry if my response is a little jumbled, I was writing this while at work lol.
                    All good, I appreciate it! But man, this game has so much I missed the first time. I never even made it to deep root the first time and just fought fias champions this time. I'll need to go back down there and check that out, I dont even know if I knew varre had a quest, lol. What a game
                        Oh this game is so complex. I think my first playthrough took me like, 93 hours or something like that. I explored every area so much and STILL missed a whole bunch of stuff. The amount of detail that went into this game is just so amazing.
The one you didn’t pay attention to apparently
    GRRM didn’t write shit for the game that we play.
        What did he write, O learned one?
            Crazy how he ghosted, I was excited to be educated
                Me too! I guess he had to go drop epic knowledge bombs somewhere else…
Rhaenys, Rhaegar.



Helaena, Visenya, Daenys, Gaemon, Gimli.
He wasn't who I was talking about.
Good point on the gates, but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.  
  
Plus, their relationship didn't seem that great.  I took it more like he was saying they had an easy prisoner if the gates were opened.
    What about Godrick makes you think he'd be a good dad? But despite their relationship, Gostoc would still be the heir and therefore of some value to Godrick - if only as a source of high-quality grafting materials (at least breeding-wise). Like, a paranoid coward like Godrick wouldn't put some random peasant who hates his guts in charge of the gates.
        >What about Godrick makes you think he'd be a good dad?  
  
Nothing about being good really, more the fact that he's the weakest of his family, and thus would be the most interested in having some other semi formidable fighters around.  
  
More it's interesting to me that Gostoc has no grafted parts, and may or may not have lost a hand to grafting.  While the regular soldiers in the castle have been augmented, such as the blades on the birds and the grafted enemy and such.
            [deleted]
                Given the second ass kicking he took in his castle getting assaulted by something from the ocean (looks like a sea creature hit it), maybe he should be rethinking that.
                    [deleted]
            Godrick is actually the opposite. He’s not only the weakest, but he’s the most cowardly in his family. He’s terrified that anyone with a modicum of strength will try to take the little bit of power he’s managed to take for himself, so he surrounds himself with peons. He ensures that everyone around him is either far weaker than him, or under his direct control. Rather than having powerful fighters assist him, he takes their limbs and grafts them onto himself for the small fraction of their strength that gives him
        Don't forget he has the ability to steal your runes
    >but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.

It's only a hand, and there's no proof it was taken for grafting. Gostoc steals your runes when you die and his merchant inventory hints that he stole those items as well. Having a hand cut off was a punishment for thieves in older days.
    Just because they’re related doesn’t mean they get along. Don’t you have relatives you loathe?
    You can actually find Gostoc following you through stormveil leading up to Godrick fight. As you're walking up to him in these three spots, his idle dialogue would suggest that he's examining body parts for his own desire to graft. If you also attack him at the start and he kills you, he will say that he'll take good care of your parts. Credit to VaatiVidya for that knowledge.
    >but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.  

Why? If Godrick is so obsessed with his royal heritage, his own son would also have that golden lineage blood.
If it was cut then he isn't. It's literally not in the game.
    It's literally in the game, just not in a way that's accessible without outside tools. And if we only considered the text when researching lore, there wouldn't *be* any lore. So many youtubers would lose their jobs. 13+ hour long part one video woud be ten minutes long. We would never see Strider ported into the Lands Between. Etc.
        This is absolutely delusional. It was left in the code but it's clearly not in the game since you need to bloody hack it to see it in its raw form. You can't acces it through gameplay, how can you even argue it's part of the game?
            Cut content in these games often comes back as dlc. Big L for you no more lore 4 you
                Then it's not cut anymore...
                    See?  Now you're getting it! Ya fucking onion
            The phrasing was "literally in the game", not "accessible normally through gameplay". And *literally*? It's in the game.
                If it's called cut content, then explain what was it cut *from*? It's in the code, not in the game. Devs clearly didn't want this to be part of it.
                    It was cut from the game, of course!


However, that doesn't mean it's been removed, it was just hidden. Still in the game files, with partial dialogue and voices, and mechanical stuff - scripts and shit, unlike anything the devs actually didn't want to use. And there are many reasons something they really wanted to use would be cut - maybe not enough time, maybe it was interfering with other events, maybe they didn't want to overcrowd Limgrave with quests.


My point is - it's still in the game, it wasn't just some first draft stuff discarded at the planning stage, effort was clearly put into it, it can be modded in if you know the game dev sorcery (like that guy fromsoftserve who re-remasters DS1 on youtube), or it could even be added later by FS themselves, now that they had time to work on it! (Wishful thinking). That's the reason why cut content like that is generally accepted as canon.
How does he look similar? He has same model and outfit like all the other commoners 😅
I thought that was godrick
    Nah, that was Rick, Soldier of God.
Isn't that mentioned directly in her questline that they need someone from that family line?  It's right after you clear the guys castle I thought.
    It says that godrick usurped the throne. Iirc, it never says who from but only that nepheli is heir, later revealed. 

We don't even learn of Hoarah loux until right at the end of the storyline. Not to mention From notoriously does not hold up flashing signs that point to these details; there's a ton of gaps but just enough solid info to cause great debates lol
        >We don't even learn of Hoarah loux until right at the end of the storyline

He's in the opening cutscene when you start the game...
            I'm gonna level with you. It's been like two years since I watched that. Was he called Hoarah loux or Godfrey in that video?
                They refer to him as Hoarah Loux. It's the image of him and Serosh being crucified
                He's referred to as "Hoarah Loux, Chieftain of the Badlands"
    Kenneth mentions that, but I think Nepheli just says it’s because she command the hawk that only obeys said bloodline. She just wonders why the hawk listens to her I think.
>Triple, TiL (maybe not for you but for those unaware, at least): nepheli loux, descendant of Hoarah loux, Warrior, would be a sibling of godrick.

Nice catch!

What makes Sir Gideon Ofnir though? Isn't he her daddy?
    Adopted
    Adoptive daddy.

He says he "took her in" at a young age.
    Others have answered, but the various dialogue with gideon and nepheli reveals a few things.

Nepheli was part of a village that was massacred, much like the albinauric village under moonlight altar, which left her not just orphaned, but completely alone.

Gideon took her in and raised her, making her loyal to the roundtable hold until she found what Gideon did to the albinauric village in the name of his own pursuits. This is why she feels betrayed and can be found in the lower parts of the hold feeling dejected and lost. And Gideon does not care. So fourth fun fact, nepheli also has daddy issues lol.

I'm still missing some information myself on the link between the spirit ashes you give her that leads her to stormveil, but at face value she becomes the lord of the castle and swears fealty to you because you cheered her up with N O S T A L G I A!

Shame that didn't mean you could summon her more often as a cooperator... you know, versus the alternative ending where you can summon her pretty freely.
        Nepheli and Gideon have known each other Nepheli's whole life as Nepheli says but Gideon specifies he didn't adopt her until she lost her grace. After they had both lived out their first lives, died and then after the Shattering were resurrected to come back to the Lands Between and eventually Nepheli like most Tarnished in the game beside Gideon and Godfrey, lost her grace again. He didn't raise her per se.
Hey, so that's foreshadowing Hoarah Loux identity as well! I never connected the dots.
>Triple, TiL (maybe not for you but for those unaware, at least): nepheli loux, descendant of Hoarah loux, Warrior, would be a sibling of godrick.

Not a sibling at all. More like a distant cousin of some sort. Nepheli Loux probably is a child of Godfrey's Hoarah Loux persona, and has nothing to do with Marika.
    TiL if my dad has a child with someone, who is not my mom, that doesn't make the child a half-sibling but


>More like a distant cousin of some sort.

Get out of here, my guy! If you said daughter of Godfrey's sibling, Gregory Loux, then yeah that would make her a cousin of godrick.

No such sibling is named, the only person carrying that name is hoarah. The implication, as you state yourself is that nepheli is Hoarah's daughter. This means when Hoarah/Godfrey sired Godrick with Marika, that makes Godfrey's daughter Godricks half-sibling
        >TiL if my dad has a child with someone, who is not my mom, that doesn't make the child a half-sibling but

Godrick isn't Godfrey's child.

>This means when Hoarah/Godfrey sired Godrick with Marika,

He didn't though... godrick is a distant descendant of Godfrey. This is made explicit in game dialogue.

>The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika. Godrick the Grafted was but a distant relation... The runt of the litter, his divine blood sorely diluted".
Gostoc does look like Godrick though, and he's clearly got a personal grudge against Godrick too. Also that creepy line about doing anything he wants - why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?
    >Also that creepy line about doing anything he wants - why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?


I can see why some people tend to canonize cut content, sometimes it makes more sense than what they ended up leaving in.
        It would be easier to dismiss if it was completely cut
        The creepy line wasn't cut.
            I know, that's not what I meant. 


Gastocs current version, where he says that line, makes more sense when paired with the original cut content. Without it, what he says doesn't really make any sense if the final version is supposed to be just some random little dude running around. If he's a part of Godrick's lineage, then naturally the line makes sense.
                It makes sense on its own. The Lord of the castle he resides in has been killed, and he had no heir. There's no one left with authority over Gostoc, so he's free to do as he likes. The 'cut content' changes the context.
        I completely agree with you, but just because something makes more sense doesn't make it canon. Especially in this context when it wasn't disclosed that their familial relation was found in a cut quest. I like Gostoc's cut quests they're very interesting, and I hope a lot of the discovered cut quest lines end up being restored in SotE.
            I'm completely in favour of disregarding cut content if was replaced or the context for it was changed, but in this case they just pruned the quest a bit, with seemingly no changes to the remaining ending or any of the npcs related to it. It's basically cannon.
                >It's basically cannon


You're free to head-canonize whatever you'd like, but like I said earlier if you need a PC + external software to support your claim of what's canon or not, it's not canon. If you can't boot up Elden Ring right now and support the claim being made, it cannot be considered 'canon.' Canon should only include things that can be verified within the confines of the game we can all boot up and play right now.(ex - Ranni is an Empyrean. Placidusaxx was an Elden Lord. Radagon is preventing our entry to the Erdtree.) Everything else is conjecture, speculation, or theory. (Ex -Melina is the GEQ. Miquella is St Trina. Marika helped orchestrate the NotBK)

I'm not trying to be a hard ass about this, exploring the conjecture, theory, and speculation spaces this game provides the player is why I love these games so much! However, there does need distinctions between these concepts or you end up with people proudly proclaiming shit about the game that isn't technically true.
                    100%. i was going to say, 'idk why you're being downvoted' but i do know. stop disrupting the head canon!

        Same with the cut content about the nomadic merchants being blamed for worshipping the frenzy flame. It’s all in a cut quest for Kale. There’s still stuff in game for it tho like the dead merchants in the shunning grounds and the nomadic merchant in Altus who uses frenzy flame incantations
    >why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?

You're asking a question about cut content relating back to other cut content. You're welcome to canonize Gostoc and Godrick being related, the only point I was trying to make is that the theory originates from cut content and anything that derives from that should be taken with a dump truck amount of salt. It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line. Sure, it might be restored in some fashion in the DLC, but until then it's just fanfic.
        I was talking about this line:


>Now, I supposed I'm free. I can do whatever takes my fancy...Can't I, mate?


Which is not cut content. I remembered it being a bit more in favour of that hypothesis - something more like "I can do whatever I want *with this place*". Still, the rest - the name, the face, the personal connection etc - is enough for me.
            He can do what he wants because you murdered the Lord of the castle. That doesn't insinuate anything about them being related. 

>Still, the rest - the name, the face, the personal connection etc - is enough for me.

And that's totally fine by me! I have my own crazy theories about the game that rely on speculation, it's why these games are as fun to delve into as they are. I replied with the 'its not canon' comment because the initial reply stating that Gostoc and Godrick are related stated it as fact instead of simply saying "We actually don't know, but, there's cut content in the game suggesting ____" 

That comment has like +200 upvotes. People are gonna see that little fun fact and start spewing it around, and now, something that was intentionally removed from the game for one reason or another, is being spread as fact. It's not a fact, the 'fact' is supported by content you cannot access without a PC and third party software because the developers did not want you to see it.
        >It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line

Just because some connections got cut, doesn't mean all of it's gone. The lilies and fevor's cookbook still clearly show a very strong connection. 

"A record of crafting techniques left by a man who was utterly captivated by St. Trina. He continued the search for her in his slumber.

            >Just because some connections got cut, doesn't mean all of it's gone. The lilies and fevor's cookbook still clearly show a very strong connection. 

I would love for you to read my comment in its entirety, because no where did I say they cut the whole thing out. I'm fully aware of the subtle inferences the game makes towards things we speculate on in the game, but we're not talking about that, we're talking about things the game explicitly explains to us. Neither Gostoc being related to Godrick nor St Trina being Miquella is directly stated in the current version of the game, and until otherwise both theories have to rely on using speculation, conjecture, or data mining. For as much as this game relies on ambiguity the community sure seems to struggle with differentiating between the things the game tells us outright(canon) and the popular theories the community has come up with to help with the cohesion of the overarching story. Both are great, but they aren't the same thing. St Trina in the current version of the game is basically an irrelevant character. The only reason that theory got the community's attention IS the cut quest line relating to her.
                >It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line

It is not *all* from a cut questline though. Sure, the things that directly, explicitely state Miquella is Trina are cut. But not all the strong connections are cut.

>I would love for you to read my comment in its entirety

I did. 



>For as much as this game relies on ambiguity the community sure seems to struggle with differentiating between the things the game tells us outright(canon) and the popular theories the community has come up with

Well I don't? So? I'm literally just saying that there are strong points in favour of Miquella being Trina that didn't get cut. Which is true.

Even without the cut quest, the lilies are an extremely obvious connection, as is the fact that a fevor's cookbook is given to us when we find Miquella, and it lets us craft a Miquella item. I genuinely don't even know much of anything about the cut questline.
                    I hope I'm not coming off that I'm arguing that the current subtle references between Miquella and St Trina don't exist, because they do and I see them.  Within the confines of the game, there's enough there to make the player ask the question, 'hey what's the deal with these two?' My point is that the references aren't concrete enough to say with absolute certainty that they are the exact same person. You keep saying otherwise so at this point we're debating how to define a fact and I'm not interested in that sort of conversation.
I mean, cut content can certainly be contradicted later without repercussion, but generally cut content at that point is going to have lore written into whatever is officially referenced for the game.  And the content is cut for other reasons such as time, game pacing, technical issues, quality, or other reasons.
    Regardless of the reason, it was cut. Cut content can provide context of the development cycle and plans for certain aspects of the game, but at the end of the day it didn't make the final product of the game, and referencing assets that aren't accessible in the main game to answer questions we have is incredibly risky. If you need more proof of why this is a bad idea, using cut content to support 'the canon', look into the development of ds3 and how often they shuffled around bosses and rewrote lore to make the final product we got work. It gets messy quick. Unless you're a dev for FROM, the multitude of reasons you gave for why content gets cut should be the precise reasons as to not take cut content seriously. We simply don't know.
        >If you need more proof of why this is a bad idea, using cut content to support 'the canon'  
  
And yet, that's actual storyline material that was at least written at some point.  Just looking at in game assets doesn't always make some material canon either, for example look at the pillars with symbols on them underground that people made elaborate theories on only to later realize it was an asset that anyone could purchase and use.
            >that's actual storyline material that was at least written at some point.

storyline material that was deliberately deleted before they released the game.

&#x200B;

>look at the pillars with symbols on them underground that people made elaborate theories on only to later realize it was an asset that anyone could purchase and use.

What do you mean?   You don't have to create 100% of your assets you assign meaning to that you use in a video game. For all you and I know, that asset looking close to the symbolism they were trying to convey was the exact reason they went with it. They can create whatever association they want within the context of the game, it doesn't matter that the same asset is used in Destiny. We're not playing Destiny. To the flip side of this, and yet it could very well just be a cool ass generic pillar they wanted to use and didn't think twice about it. It can go either way, depending on how immersed you want to get in the game.  Debating whether or not assets were meant to convey a deeper meaning isn't the same as whether or not cut dialogue or quests should be taken as the game canon.
Ahhh, yeah I haven’t paid attention to data mines and cut content, so that explains it. Feels a bit weird to include since there is a reason it is not included, but can definitely be an interesting thing to analyze and it makes some sense in this case
    I 100% agree with you. Context matters!
Ok, but is Marika the great  great ... grandmother then?
Most likely this. Mohg and Morgott also sounds nasty too, comparing to something like Godwyn
    It sounds straight out of Tolkien's names for evil things, lol. If you're not familiar with Tolkien, Morgoth was the first dark lord in his legendarium, and his main liutenant, lord of balrogs, was Gothmog.
Gorgott and Gohg would have been funny names 😂
Very true, I did leave that out from my comment, but excellent point.
Radagon seriously got around. 

If we take the game files as gospel, the misbegotten may have been created as punishment for Radagon making contact with the Crucible, so maybe Melina was born in a similar way, when Marica made contact with the Frenzied Flame.
    Now that's some head cannon I can get into. The fact she has no cut content and her entire life is a whiny brat still agitated me. If you go under the assumption she just wants to get it over with and you happen to be the best option then sure? Maybe I get her lack of involvement in any of this?
        Yeah, it's strange that she's one of the most mysterious NPCs and she's with us for 80% of the game. 

We do know why she chooses to travel with the player, however. It's because Torrent approved of us. She's just deferring to his judgement.
I think it was confirmed but I may be wrong.
    I'm not sure what you mean was confirmed?
        Naah, it's like she "might" be Godfrey's daughter so it is not 100% certain.
            Yea I thought when you talked to her through the quest she or Gideon mentions being the granddaughter of a chieftain which would be Horah loux but it's been a while since I did her quest
                Yeah that's what I had in mind. But I don't know if Gideon said daughter or granddaughter. Sadly that I cannot find the dialog in Elden Rings wiki page.
Yeah. It’s pretty consistent with the Children of Iluvatar as well. As one comment below me mentioned, the Elvish house of Finwe. 

Also consider Theodred, son of Theoden; Eomer and Eowyn son and daughter of Theodwyn, sister of Theoden; Theoden, son of Thengel, son of Fengel. 

I love it when fantasy authors incorporate this kind of real-life historical detail.
The stallion who mounts the world.
Exactly, they're big on branding. Toyal families are more like companies than families as we think of them.
nothing gets me more than two much proper noun usage.  "(long obtuse proper noun) went with (long obtuse proper noun), and his lord (long obtuse proper noun) to (long obtuse proper noun but used as a verb)" sick i have no idea what happened.
IM DEADDD
At least
My biggest craw is the people that think GRRM made any sort of timeline for ER, when the whole issue with ASOIAF is he's not great at outlining stories.
every second that man breaths is a fucking gift at his weight. sucks that we wont get the final/next book but good on him for selling out and living the high life on the beach.
I'm playing back through now for the second time after beating it at release and completely forgot mohg was at the bottom of leyndell until stumbling upon him, got him on my second try though. So I guess I beat him before morgott, but still did Godrick, Rennala, Radahn, mohg. I don't remember doing mohg until after the capital last time.
    Oh I’m talking about Mohg, Lord of Blood. Mohg, the Omen is down underneath Leyndell. He’s guarding the Three Fingers. I could be wrong but I’m also pretty sure that Morgott has a wall that guards the flame of frenzy down below Leyndell? Again, could be completely wrong here.
        Could be, I didn't see that, but I also didnt see the three fingers after killing mohg the omen, was there something else I needed to do to find it? Could someone have killed mohg lord of blood before morgott? Isn't he in mountaintops of the giants?
            So you can technically do Mohg, Lord of Blood at any time that you want. You don’t actually have to go all the way to Consecrated Snowfield to get there. If you complete White Mask Varre’s questline, he gives you an item called ‘Lord of Blood’s Exultation’ and if you use it, it takes you straight there.

After Mohg, the Omen, all you have to do is go back to that site of grace after you kill him. Once you’re there, literally all you have to do is smack the altar. The altar will open and there’s a passageway that leads down to the three fingers. It’s a little bit tricky to get down to the fingers because of the platforms, but it’s possible. It’ll definitely make you rage a little bit.

Sorry if my response is a little jumbled, I was writing this while at work lol.
                All good, I appreciate it! But man, this game has so much I missed the first time. I never even made it to deep root the first time and just fought fias champions this time. I'll need to go back down there and check that out, I dont even know if I knew varre had a quest, lol. What a game
                    Oh this game is so complex. I think my first playthrough took me like, 93 hours or something like that. I explored every area so much and STILL missed a whole bunch of stuff. The amount of detail that went into this game is just so amazing.
GRRM didn’t write shit for the game that we play.
    What did he write, O learned one?
        Crazy how he ghosted, I was excited to be educated
            Me too! I guess he had to go drop epic knowledge bombs somewhere else…
What about Godrick makes you think he'd be a good dad? But despite their relationship, Gostoc would still be the heir and therefore of some value to Godrick - if only as a source of high-quality grafting materials (at least breeding-wise). Like, a paranoid coward like Godrick wouldn't put some random peasant who hates his guts in charge of the gates.
    >What about Godrick makes you think he'd be a good dad?  
  
Nothing about being good really, more the fact that he's the weakest of his family, and thus would be the most interested in having some other semi formidable fighters around.  
  
More it's interesting to me that Gostoc has no grafted parts, and may or may not have lost a hand to grafting.  While the regular soldiers in the castle have been augmented, such as the blades on the birds and the grafted enemy and such.
        [deleted]
            Given the second ass kicking he took in his castle getting assaulted by something from the ocean (looks like a sea creature hit it), maybe he should be rethinking that.
                [deleted]
        Godrick is actually the opposite. He’s not only the weakest, but he’s the most cowardly in his family. He’s terrified that anyone with a modicum of strength will try to take the little bit of power he’s managed to take for himself, so he surrounds himself with peons. He ensures that everyone around him is either far weaker than him, or under his direct control. Rather than having powerful fighters assist him, he takes their limbs and grafts them onto himself for the small fraction of their strength that gives him
    Don't forget he has the ability to steal your runes
>but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.

It's only a hand, and there's no proof it was taken for grafting. Gostoc steals your runes when you die and his merchant inventory hints that he stole those items as well. Having a hand cut off was a punishment for thieves in older days.
Just because they’re related doesn’t mean they get along. Don’t you have relatives you loathe?
You can actually find Gostoc following you through stormveil leading up to Godrick fight. As you're walking up to him in these three spots, his idle dialogue would suggest that he's examining body parts for his own desire to graft. If you also attack him at the start and he kills you, he will say that he'll take good care of your parts. Credit to VaatiVidya for that knowledge.
>but you would think one of his arms wouldn't have been taken to be grafted if so.  

Why? If Godrick is so obsessed with his royal heritage, his own son would also have that golden lineage blood.
It's literally in the game, just not in a way that's accessible without outside tools. And if we only considered the text when researching lore, there wouldn't *be* any lore. So many youtubers would lose their jobs. 13+ hour long part one video woud be ten minutes long. We would never see Strider ported into the Lands Between. Etc.
    This is absolutely delusional. It was left in the code but it's clearly not in the game since you need to bloody hack it to see it in its raw form. You can't acces it through gameplay, how can you even argue it's part of the game?
        Cut content in these games often comes back as dlc. Big L for you no more lore 4 you
            Then it's not cut anymore...
                See?  Now you're getting it! Ya fucking onion
        The phrasing was "literally in the game", not "accessible normally through gameplay". And *literally*? It's in the game.
            If it's called cut content, then explain what was it cut *from*? It's in the code, not in the game. Devs clearly didn't want this to be part of it.
                It was cut from the game, of course!


However, that doesn't mean it's been removed, it was just hidden. Still in the game files, with partial dialogue and voices, and mechanical stuff - scripts and shit, unlike anything the devs actually didn't want to use. And there are many reasons something they really wanted to use would be cut - maybe not enough time, maybe it was interfering with other events, maybe they didn't want to overcrowd Limgrave with quests.


My point is - it's still in the game, it wasn't just some first draft stuff discarded at the planning stage, effort was clearly put into it, it can be modded in if you know the game dev sorcery (like that guy fromsoftserve who re-remasters DS1 on youtube), or it could even be added later by FS themselves, now that they had time to work on it! (Wishful thinking). That's the reason why cut content like that is generally accepted as canon.
Nah, that was Rick, Soldier of God.
It says that godrick usurped the throne. Iirc, it never says who from but only that nepheli is heir, later revealed. 

We don't even learn of Hoarah loux until right at the end of the storyline. Not to mention From notoriously does not hold up flashing signs that point to these details; there's a ton of gaps but just enough solid info to cause great debates lol
    >We don't even learn of Hoarah loux until right at the end of the storyline

He's in the opening cutscene when you start the game...
        I'm gonna level with you. It's been like two years since I watched that. Was he called Hoarah loux or Godfrey in that video?
            They refer to him as Hoarah Loux. It's the image of him and Serosh being crucified
            He's referred to as "Hoarah Loux, Chieftain of the Badlands"
Kenneth mentions that, but I think Nepheli just says it’s because she command the hawk that only obeys said bloodline. She just wonders why the hawk listens to her I think.
Adopted
Adoptive daddy.

He says he "took her in" at a young age.
Others have answered, but the various dialogue with gideon and nepheli reveals a few things.

Nepheli was part of a village that was massacred, much like the albinauric village under moonlight altar, which left her not just orphaned, but completely alone.

Gideon took her in and raised her, making her loyal to the roundtable hold until she found what Gideon did to the albinauric village in the name of his own pursuits. This is why she feels betrayed and can be found in the lower parts of the hold feeling dejected and lost. And Gideon does not care. So fourth fun fact, nepheli also has daddy issues lol.

I'm still missing some information myself on the link between the spirit ashes you give her that leads her to stormveil, but at face value she becomes the lord of the castle and swears fealty to you because you cheered her up with N O S T A L G I A!

Shame that didn't mean you could summon her more often as a cooperator... you know, versus the alternative ending where you can summon her pretty freely.
    Nepheli and Gideon have known each other Nepheli's whole life as Nepheli says but Gideon specifies he didn't adopt her until she lost her grace. After they had both lived out their first lives, died and then after the Shattering were resurrected to come back to the Lands Between and eventually Nepheli like most Tarnished in the game beside Gideon and Godfrey, lost her grace again. He didn't raise her per se.
TiL if my dad has a child with someone, who is not my mom, that doesn't make the child a half-sibling but


>More like a distant cousin of some sort.

Get out of here, my guy! If you said daughter of Godfrey's sibling, Gregory Loux, then yeah that would make her a cousin of godrick.

No such sibling is named, the only person carrying that name is hoarah. The implication, as you state yourself is that nepheli is Hoarah's daughter. This means when Hoarah/Godfrey sired Godrick with Marika, that makes Godfrey's daughter Godricks half-sibling
    >TiL if my dad has a child with someone, who is not my mom, that doesn't make the child a half-sibling but

Godrick isn't Godfrey's child.

>This means when Hoarah/Godfrey sired Godrick with Marika,

He didn't though... godrick is a distant descendant of Godfrey. This is made explicit in game dialogue.

>The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika. Godrick the Grafted was but a distant relation... The runt of the litter, his divine blood sorely diluted".
>Also that creepy line about doing anything he wants - why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?


I can see why some people tend to canonize cut content, sometimes it makes more sense than what they ended up leaving in.
    It would be easier to dismiss if it was completely cut
    The creepy line wasn't cut.
        I know, that's not what I meant. 


Gastocs current version, where he says that line, makes more sense when paired with the original cut content. Without it, what he says doesn't really make any sense if the final version is supposed to be just some random little dude running around. If he's a part of Godrick's lineage, then naturally the line makes sense.
            It makes sense on its own. The Lord of the castle he resides in has been killed, and he had no heir. There's no one left with authority over Gostoc, so he's free to do as he likes. The 'cut content' changes the context.
    I completely agree with you, but just because something makes more sense doesn't make it canon. Especially in this context when it wasn't disclosed that their familial relation was found in a cut quest. I like Gostoc's cut quests they're very interesting, and I hope a lot of the discovered cut quest lines end up being restored in SotE.
        I'm completely in favour of disregarding cut content if was replaced or the context for it was changed, but in this case they just pruned the quest a bit, with seemingly no changes to the remaining ending or any of the npcs related to it. It's basically cannon.
            >It's basically cannon


You're free to head-canonize whatever you'd like, but like I said earlier if you need a PC + external software to support your claim of what's canon or not, it's not canon. If you can't boot up Elden Ring right now and support the claim being made, it cannot be considered 'canon.' Canon should only include things that can be verified within the confines of the game we can all boot up and play right now.(ex - Ranni is an Empyrean. Placidusaxx was an Elden Lord. Radagon is preventing our entry to the Erdtree.) Everything else is conjecture, speculation, or theory. (Ex -Melina is the GEQ. Miquella is St Trina. Marika helped orchestrate the NotBK)

I'm not trying to be a hard ass about this, exploring the conjecture, theory, and speculation spaces this game provides the player is why I love these games so much! However, there does need distinctions between these concepts or you end up with people proudly proclaiming shit about the game that isn't technically true.
                100%. i was going to say, 'idk why you're being downvoted' but i do know. stop disrupting the head canon!

not that this is datamining related, but this all harkens back to when people were taking the ancientDragon=aldia to be canon, during dks2 vanilla days. there was no text to support it, just a bunch of wildly formed connections.
    Same with the cut content about the nomadic merchants being blamed for worshipping the frenzy flame. It’s all in a cut quest for Kale. There’s still stuff in game for it tho like the dead merchants in the shunning grounds and the nomadic merchant in Altus who uses frenzy flame incantations
>why would the death of the lord make a simple gatekeeper the new lord, or put him in charge in any way?

You're asking a question about cut content relating back to other cut content. You're welcome to canonize Gostoc and Godrick being related, the only point I was trying to make is that the theory originates from cut content and anything that derives from that should be taken with a dump truck amount of salt.

Just looking at in game assets doesn't always make some material canon either, for example look at the pillars with symbols on them underground that people made elaborate theories on only to later realize it was an asset that anyone could purchase and use.
        >that's actual storyline material that was at least written at some point.

storyline material that was deliberately deleted before they released the game.

What do you mean?   You don't have to create 100% of your assets you assign meaning to that you use in a video game. For all you and I know, that asset looking close to the symbolism they were trying to convey was the exact reason they went with it. They can create whatever association they want within the context of the game, it doesn't matter that the same asset is used in Destiny. We're not playing Destiny. To the flip side of this, and yet it could very well just be a cool ass generic pillar they wanted to use and didn't think twice about it. It can go either way, depending on how immersed you want to get in the game.  Debating whether or not assets were meant to convey a deeper meaning isn't the same as whether or not cut dialogue or quests should be taken as the game canon.
I 100% agree with you. Context matters!
It sounds straight out of Tolkien's names for evil things, lol. If you're not familiar with Tolkien, Morgoth was the first dark lord in his legendarium, and his main liutenant, lord of balrogs, was Gothmog.
Now that's some head cannon I can get into. The fact she has no cut content and her entire life is a whiny brat still agitated me. If you go under the assumption she just wants to get it over with and you happen to be the best option then sure? Maybe I get her lack of involvement in any of this?
    Yeah, it's strange that she's one of the most mysterious NPCs and she's with us for 80% of the game. 

We do know why she chooses to travel with the player, however. It's because Torrent approved of us. She's just deferring to his judgement.
I'm not sure what you mean was confirmed?
    Naah, it's like she "might" be Godfrey's daughter so it is not 100% certain.
        Yea I thought when you talked to her through the quest she or Gideon mentions being the granddaughter of a chieftain which would be Horah loux but it's been a while since I did her quest
            Yeah that's what I had in mind. But I don't know if Gideon said daughter or granddaughter. Sadly that I cannot find the dialog in Elden Rings wiki page.
Oh I’m talking about Mohg, Lord of Blood. Mohg, the Omen is down underneath Leyndell. He’s guarding the Three Fingers. I could be wrong but I’m also pretty sure that Morgott has a wall that guards the flame of frenzy down below Leyndell? Again, could be completely wrong here.
    Could be, I didn't see that, but I also didnt see the three fingers after killing mohg the omen, was there something else I needed to do to find it? Could someone have killed mohg lord of blood before morgott? Isn't he in mountaintops of the giants?
        So you can technically do Mohg, Lord of Blood at any time that you want. You don’t actually have to go all the way to Consecrated Snowfield to get there. If you complete White Mask Varre’s questline, he gives you an item called ‘Lord of Blood’s Exultation’ and if you use it, it takes you straight there.

After Mohg, the Omen, all you have to do is go back to that site of grace after you kill him. Once you’re there, literally all you have to do is smack the altar. The altar will open and there’s a passageway that leads down to the three fingers. It’s a little bit tricky to get down to the fingers because of the platforms, but it’s possible. It’ll definitely make you rage a little bit.

Sorry if my response is a little jumbled, I was writing this while at work lol.
            All good, I appreciate it! But man, this game has so much I missed the first time. I never even made it to deep root the first time and just fought fias champions this time. I'll need to go back down there and check that out, I dont even know if I knew varre had a quest, lol. What a game
                Oh this game is so complex. I think my first playthrough took me like, 93 hours or something like that. I explored every area so much and STILL missed a whole bunch of stuff. The amount of detail that went into this game is just so amazing.
What did he write, O learned one?
    Crazy how he ghosted, I was excited to be educated
        Me too! I guess he had to go drop epic knowledge bombs somewhere else…
>What about Godrick makes you think he'd be a good dad?  
  
Nothing about being good really, more the fact that he's the weakest of his family, and thus would be the most interested in having some other semi formidable fighters around.  
  
More it's interesting to me that Gostoc has no grafted parts, and may or may not have lost a hand to grafting.  While the regular soldiers in the castle have been augmented, such as the blades on the birds and the grafted enemy and such.
    [deleted]
        Given the second ass kicking he took in his castle getting assaulted by something from the ocean (looks like a sea creature hit it), maybe he should be rethinking that.
            [deleted]
    Godrick is actually the opposite. He’s not only the weakest, but he’s the most cowardly in his family. He’s terrified that anyone with a modicum of strength will try to take the little bit of power he’s managed to take for himself, so he surrounds himself with peons. He ensures that everyone around him is either far weaker than him, or under his direct control. Rather than having powerful fighters assist him, he takes their limbs and grafts them onto himself for the small fraction of their strength that gives him
Don't forget he has the ability to steal your runes
This is absolutely delusional. It was left in the code but it's clearly not in the game since you need to bloody hack it to see it in its raw form. You can't acces it through gameplay, how can you even argue it's part of the game?
    Cut content in these games often comes back as dlc. Big L for you no more lore 4 you
        Then it's not cut anymore...
            See?  Now you're getting it! Ya fucking onion
    The phrasing was "literally in the game", not "accessible normally through gameplay". And *literally*? It's in the game.
        If it's called cut content, then explain what was it cut *from*? It's in the code, not in the game. Devs clearly didn't want this to be part of it.
            It was cut from the game, of course!


However, that doesn't mean it's been removed, it was just hidden. Still in the game files, with partial dialogue and voices, and mechanical stuff - scripts and shit, unlike anything the devs actually didn't want to use. And there are many reasons something they really wanted to use would be cut - maybe not enough time, maybe it was interfering with other events, maybe they didn't want to overcrowd Limgrave with quests.


My point is - it's still in the game, it wasn't just some first draft stuff discarded at the planning stage, effort was clearly put into it, it can be modded in if you know the game dev sorcery (like that guy fromsoftserve who re-remasters DS1 on youtube), or it could even be added later by FS themselves, now that they had time to work on it! (Wishful thinking). That's the reason why cut content like that is generally accepted as canon.
>We don't even learn of Hoarah loux until right at the end of the storyline

He's in the opening cutscene when you start the game...
    I'm gonna level with you. It's been like two years since I watched that. Was he called Hoarah loux or Godfrey in that video?
        They refer to him as Hoarah Loux. It's the image of him and Serosh being crucified
        He's referred to as "Hoarah Loux, Chieftain of the Badlands"
Nepheli and Gideon have known each other Nepheli's whole life as Nepheli says but Gideon specifies he didn't adopt her until she lost her grace. After they had both lived out their first lives, died and then after the Shattering were resurrected to come back to the Lands Between and eventually Nepheli like most Tarnished in the game beside Gideon and Godfrey, lost her grace again. He didn't raise her per se.
>TiL if my dad has a child with someone, who is not my mom, that doesn't make the child a half-sibling but

Godrick isn't Godfrey's child.

>This means when Hoarah/Godfrey sired Godrick with Marika,

He didn't though... godrick is a distant descendant of Godfrey. This is made explicit in game dialogue.

>The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika. Godrick the Grafted was but a distant relation... The runt of the litter, his divine blood sorely diluted".
It would be easier to dismiss if it was completely cut
The creepy line wasn't cut.
    I know, that's not what I meant. 


Gastocs current version, where he says that line, makes more sense when paired with the original cut content. Without it, what he says doesn't really make any sense if the final version is supposed to be just some random little dude running around. If he's a part of Godrick's lineage, then naturally the line makes sense.
        It makes sense on its own. The Lord of the castle he resides in has been killed, and he had no heir. There's no one left with authority over Gostoc, so he's free to do as he likes. The 'cut content' changes the context.
I completely agree with you, but just because something makes more sense doesn't make it canon. Especially in this context when it wasn't disclosed that their familial relation was found in a cut quest. I like Gostoc's cut quests they're very interesting, and I hope a lot of the discovered cut quest lines end up being restored in SotE.
    I'm completely in favour of disregarding cut content if was replaced or the context for it was changed, but in this case they just pruned the quest a bit, with seemingly no changes to the remaining ending or any of the npcs related to it. It's basically cannon.
        >It's basically cannon


You're free to head-canonize whatever you'd like, but like I said earlier if you need a PC + external software to support your claim of what's canon or not, it's not canon. If you can't boot up Elden Ring right now and support the claim being made, it cannot be considered 'canon.' Canon should only include things that can be verified within the confines of the game we can all boot up and play right now.(ex - Ranni is an Empyrean. Placidusaxx was an Elden Lord. Radagon is preventing our entry to the Erdtree.) Everything else is conjecture, speculation, or theory. (Ex -Melina is the GEQ. Miquella is St Trina. Marika helped orchestrate the NotBK)

I'm not trying to be a hard ass about this, exploring the conjecture, theory, and speculation spaces this game provides the player is why I love these games so much! However, there does need distinctions between these concepts or you end up with people proudly proclaiming shit about the game that isn't technically true.
            100%. i was going to say, 'idk why you're being downvoted' but i do know. stop disrupting the head canon!

not that this is datamining related, but this all harkens back to when people were taking the ancientDragon=aldia to be canon, during dks2 vanilla days. there was no text to support it, just a bunch of wildly formed connections.
Same with the cut content about the nomadic merchants being blamed for worshipping the frenzy flame. It’s all in a cut quest for Kale. There’s still stuff in game for it tho like the dead merchants in the shunning grounds and the nomadic merchant in Altus who uses frenzy flame incantations
I was talking about this line:


>Now, I supposed I'm free. I can do whatever takes my fancy...Can't I, mate?


Which is not cut content. I remembered it being a bit more in favour of that hypothesis - something more like "I can do whatever I want *with this place*". Still, the rest - the name, the face, the personal connection etc - is enough for me.
    He can do what he wants because you murdered the Lord of the castle. That doesn't insinuate anything about them being related. 

>Still, the rest - the name, the face, the personal connection etc - is enough for me.

And that's totally fine by me! I have my own crazy theories about the game that rely on speculation, it's why these games are as fun to delve into as they are. I replied with the 'its not canon' comment because the initial reply stating that Gostoc and Godrick are related stated it as fact instead of simply saying "We actually don't know, but, there's cut content in the game suggesting ____" 

That comment has like +200 upvotes. People are gonna see that little fun fact and start spewing it around, and now, something that was intentionally removed from the game for one reason or another, is being spread as fact. It's not a fact, the 'fact' is supported by content you cannot access without a PC and third party software because the developers did not want you to see it.
>It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line

Just because some connections got cut, doesn't mean all of it's gone. The lilies and fevor's cookbook still clearly show a very strong connection. 

"A record of crafting techniques left by a man who was utterly captivated by St. Trina. He continued the search for her in his slumber.

Acquire the knowledge to craft the following:

- Bewitching Branch"
    >Just because some connections got cut, doesn't mean all of it's gone. The lilies and fevor's cookbook still clearly show a very strong connection. 

I would love for you to read my comment in its entirety, because no where did I say they cut the whole thing out. I'm fully aware of the subtle inferences the game makes towards things we speculate on in the game, but we're not talking about that, we're talking about things the game explicitly explains to us. Neither Gostoc being related to Godrick nor St Trina being Miquella is directly stated in the current version of the game, and until otherwise both theories have to rely on using speculation, conjecture, or data mining. For as much as this game relies on ambiguity the community sure seems to struggle with differentiating between the things the game tells us outright(canon) and the popular theories the community has come up with to help with the cohesion of the overarching story. Both are great, but they aren't the same thing. St Trina in the current version of the game is basically an irrelevant character. The only reason that theory got the community's attention IS the cut quest line relating to her.
        >It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line

It is not *all* from a cut questline though. Sure, the things that directly, explicitely state Miquella is Trina are cut. But not all the strong connections are cut.

>I would love for you to read my comment in its entirety

I did. 



>For as much as this game relies on ambiguity the community sure seems to struggle with differentiating between the things the game tells us outright(canon) and the popular theories the community has come up with

Well I don't? So? I'm literally just saying that there are strong points in favour of Miquella being Trina that didn't get cut. Which is true.

Even without the cut quest, the lilies are an extremely obvious connection, as is the fact that a fevor's cookbook is given to us when we find Miquella, and it lets us craft a Miquella item. I genuinely don't even know much of anything about the cut questline.
            I hope I'm not coming off that I'm arguing that the current subtle references between Miquella and St Trina don't exist, because they do and I see them.  Within the confines of the game, there's enough there to make the player ask the question, 'hey what's the deal with these two?' My point is that the references aren't concrete enough to say with absolute certainty that they are the exact same person. You keep saying otherwise so at this point we're debating how to define a fact and I'm not interested in that sort of conversation.
>If you need more proof of why this is a bad idea, using cut content to support 'the canon'

    It was cut from the game, of course!


However, that doesn't mean it's been removed, it was just hidden. Still in the game files, with partial dialogue and voices, and mechanical stuff - scripts and shit, unlike anything the devs actually didn't want to use. And there are many reasons something they really wanted to use would be cut - maybe not enough time, maybe it was interfering with other events, maybe they didn't want to overcrowd Limgrave with quests.


My point is - it's still in the game, it wasn't just some first draft stuff discarded at the planning stage, effort was clearly put into it, it can be modded in if you know the game dev sorcery (like that guy fromsoftserve who re-remasters DS1 on youtube), or it could even be added later by FS themselves, now that they had time to work on it! (Wishful thinking). That's the reason why cut content like that is generally accepted as canon.
They refer to him as Hoarah Loux. It's the image of him and Serosh being crucified
He's referred to as "Hoarah Loux, Chieftain of the Badlands"
It makes sense on its own. The Lord of the castle he resides in has been killed, and he had no heir. There's no one left with authority over Gostoc, so he's free to do as he likes. The 'cut content' changes the context.
>It's basically cannon


You're free to head-canonize whatever you'd like, but like I said earlier if you need a PC + external software to support your claim of what's canon or not, it's not canon. If you can't boot up Elden Ring right now and support the claim being made, it cannot be considered 'canon.' Canon should only include things that can be verified within the confines of the game we can all boot up and play right now.(ex - Ranni is an Empyrean. Placidusaxx was an Elden Lord. Radagon is preventing our entry to the Erdtree.) Everything else is conjecture, speculation, or theory. (Ex -Melina is the GEQ. Miquella is St Trina. Marika helped orchestrate the NotBK)

I'm not trying to be a hard ass about this, exploring the conjecture, theory, and speculation spaces this game provides the player is why I love these games so much! However, there does need distinctions between these concepts or you end up with people proudly proclaiming shit about the game that isn't technically true.
    100%. i was going to say, 'idk why you're being downvoted' but i do know. stop disrupting the head canon!

not that this is datamining related, but this all harkens back to when people were taking the ancientDragon=aldia to be canon, during dks2 vanilla days. there was no text to support it, just a bunch of wildly formed connections.
>It's the Same thing with the St Trina = Miquella lore. It's all from a cut quest line

It is not *all* from a cut questline though. Sure, the things that directly, explicitely state Miquella is Trina are cut. But not all the strong connections are cut.

>I would love for you to read my comment in its entirety

I did. 



>For as much as this game relies on ambiguity the community sure seems to struggle with differentiating between the things the game tells us outright(canon) and the popular theories the community has come up with

Well I don't? So? I'm literally just saying that there are strong points in favour of Miquella being Trina that didn't get cut. Which is true.

Even without the cut quest, the lilies are an extremely obvious connection, as is the fact that a fevor's cookbook is given to us when we find Miquella, and it lets us craft a Miquella item. I genuinely don't even know much of anything about the cut questline.
    I hope I'm not coming off that I'm arguing that the current subtle references between Miquella and St Trina don't exist, because they do and I see them.  Within the confines of the game, there's enough there to make the player ask the question, 'hey what's the deal with these two?' My point is that the references aren't concrete enough to say with absolute certainty that they are the exact same person. You keep saying otherwise so at this point we're debating how to define a fact and I'm not interested in that sort of conversation.
Yeah that's what I had in mind. But I don't know if Gideon said daughter or granddaughter. Sadly that I cannot find the dialog in Elden Rings wiki page.
All good, I appreciate it! But man, this game has so much I missed the first time. I never even made it to deep root the first time and just fought fias champions this time. I'll need to go back down there and check that out, I dont even know if I knew varre had a quest, lol. What a game
    Oh this game is so complex. I think my first playthrough took me like, 93 hours or something like that. I explored every area so much and STILL missed a whole bunch of stuff. The amount of detail that went into this game is just so amazing.
