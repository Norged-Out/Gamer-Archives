[[Congrats on the 1000th Malenia kill Let Me Solo Her!]]





"Let me watch" just makes them sound like they have a cuckold fetish
    I mean they are watching someone get fucked, be it the player or melania
        I don't know if it's a meme, but seeing the name written as Melania triggers the shit out of me.
            You'd think all these people getting the shit beaten out of them would remember it correctly, considering she literally says it every time they die.
                I am FeMalenia, maid of Bliquella… not only have I heard and read it hundreds of times but my mind eventually twisted it too.
                    IRON MALENIA
                Maybe they have mentally blocked the name from their mind.
                Yeah, it's Melanoma
                They summoned LMSH first try so they never heard :)
                not me, I cheese her every time lol
                So that is why she keeps repeating her name.
            Ikr? Everytime it makes me think of Trump's wife.
                It's probably auto correcting
                    Me, who can just click the word with the red line if I misspell something like a normal person: y tho?
                        Well it's not gonna red line an actual word. Melania and Malenia aren't gonna give red lines. And if your using swipe is even more of a pain if you don't notice after the post.
                            I meant that there's no reason to use auto-correct. It's just a crutch that doesn't work half the time. Use proper grammar, lest I part thee in twain.
                                Isn't grammar the proper structure of sentences and orthography the usage of correct spelling?
                                    Yes. If you look at those sentences, they lack proper structure.
                                We're both saying the same then. Most the time auto correct doesn't work. It'll give you the wrong word.. so it's probably one reason.
                                    Ye
            I am Melania, blade of Marika.
            At least Melania's a real name.  The number of times I've seen guys named "Michael" written as "Micheal" is absurd.  Whenever I watch a Youtube video by a guy named Michael (which is weirdly specific but like, seems to pop up pretty frequently?) I swear half the comments are referencing some mythical person named "Micheal" who doesn't exist.
            I'm too dyslexic to notice half the time
            It's largely genuine error. There's a few common ones: Melania, Mogh,  and Malekith are the three I see misspelled most often.
                Atlus
                    Bro it's obvious though, I know it's altus, but I truly believe it's an anagram and homage to Atlus, the publisher of many a niche but usually awesome game .

Ogre Battle was the first nuke Atlus unleashed in the snes days, one of my all time favorite games.

Also Atlus published demons souls here in the west originally, so um, without Atlus there would be no souls games.

At least that's my theory
                        Altus is latin for high. As spanish comes from latin, many words sounds similar.

\[Latin\] \[Spanish\] \[English\]

Altus - Alto - High

Tres - Tres - Three

Duo - Dos - Two

Unus - Uno - One

Nihil - Nada - Nothing \[Zero doesn't exist in latin\]

NIHIL

NIHIIIIL!!!
                            Nullus, nulla, nullum.
                            I I did know that, what I'm saying is are you trying to say is that it couldn't possibly have been chosen for both meanings?
                        I love it.

Interestingly enough, Altus means high in Latin.
                        Nah, Altus means high. It's literally just the high plateau
                            Damn wish I was
                It took me a lot longer than it should to realise its written moGh

Apparently the fact i didn't realise it was written mogh was enough to downvote me,lol
                    >Apparently the fact i didn't realise it was written mogh was enough to downvote me,lol

Probably because it's written Mohg, not Mogh

Edit: Whoever downvoted me for being correct, here you go https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mohg,+Lord+of+Blood
                        And i am stating how in coment previous to mine it took me a while to see it was written moGh i never stated it was mogh in game i am not stupid
                            No you're just bad at communicating then, because it sounds like you're agreeing with the incorrect spelling. 

Edit: Downvote me all you want, the fact that your original comment is at -4 proves my point.
                                I think you're bad at reading if anything,i just said how it took me a lot longer to realise it was written moGh after PFFT why would the first comment have the context for the latter ones after all
                                    I assure you you aren't being as clear as you think you are.
            I had to re read your comment before I understood the name was written the wrong way.
        Malenia\*

            ....yall seeing this shit? Dude copy and pasted the last sentence of a comment further up thread. 

Bot activity?
    Will Smith has entered the Fog wall
    Voyeurism and cuckoldry are very different.
    Thats literally the joke
    That's redditors for ya
When I got too Melenia, I was hoping I’d find “let me solo her” instead after 9 failed summons I found this dude bare ass naked with a turtle helmet and he fought her with me and attacked every time I needed to heal, gently holding my hand as I both fought and ran away from her. I’ll never forget you random named turtle head man
    You can always trust the nudists in FromSoft games
        How else are peacocks supposed to fly?
        Trust them to either carry you or bury you with ease.
    I know about the turtle shield but where do you find a turtle helmet?
        There is no such helmet, they probably mean the akbinauric helmet or the land octopus helmet ( first things I could think of).
            Fingers crossed for a Miriel Helm in DLC
                Monkey paw curls and you have to kill Miriel to get this helmet.
        I think they meant those frog dudes
            Ah, the Albinauric Helm gotcha. Thank you.
    I had a person named something like Let Me Die Solo, dual wielding massive hammers that absolutely carried me and obliterated her lol.

Thank you PSN strangers for carrying me through my game.
    I got a hardcore mf named BEEEEEANS who I danced the most scintillating dance of death with. Our movements were so accidentally coordinated that I think we might actually be married now. We took turns getting her aggro back and forth for the duration of the first phase and in the second they would hold her attention so she would Aeonia them while I hit her with the Baja blaster (Azures comet). It was truly beautiful.
    Turtle helmet? Albinuriac?
    That’s the whole deal.  The moment her attention shifts, you run in and smack her a couple times, then run away, waiting for that player to heal/smack her back.
    I got LMSH on the first try, but he got disconnected in the middle of the fight. I then died. I tried four or five other summons, and they all died pretty fast.

I switched my build to ROB, used the mimic, and stomped her. The only boss who gave me more trouble was Radagon. I probably fought him twice as many times before I got it right, which was just today.
After the 1000th kill everyone in the comments of the stream was clamoring he unjar himself and do a face reveal of his character lmao that was fun as fuck to watch

He ended without unjarring though sadly :(
    I think the point is to be faceless, like anyone can do it.
        The real Let Me Solo Her are the friends we made along the way?
            That's not how it....


Yes. You're right. Pats head*
        The Jar isn't for you Let me Solo Her. It is to protect the ones you care about.
        Probably isn't that deep lol, i think iys just a dude who thought the pot looked funny
        Ya but he had a male body so only if your a guy.
        Holy Batman !!
        "I am Let Me Solo Her"
    Unjars himself to reveal a blazing flame of frenzy where his head should have been.
        may chaos take the world
            MAY CHAAAAOS. TAKE. THE WOOoOORld
        I really wish we'd get that headpiece after the ending.  
Like the weightless seal is good too! but Man i twould be nice to have that as a helmet slot.
    I'm glad he didn't. His chat Mod said multiple time that he's going to remain a mystery because "LMSH could be anyone."
    Damn, that's pretty jarring

            That moment when killing Melenia is profitable. Dude made easily $5000 from all the donations that rolled in after the kill
                If I were him I'd put it on my CV lol. Payable skill: beat Malenia.
When ur so good at the game that the hardest boss activates cheats to try and kill you at the last second.

And you STILL clap her
    ? Did the game really do that to someone?
        If you watch their last fight Malenia power slides in Scarlet Aeonia across the arena
            She did that in a lot of the fights on the first rot bomb of the second phase. I’ve never seen it before but it might be a multiplayer thing. But I noticed it each time because it was so weird. As far as Malenia cheating though, that’s 100% her personality to avoid defeat. She did it with Rahdan and I think that was the message of Millicent’s quest.
                I thought that was from lag.
                She didn't cheat vs Radahn lol

It was a stalemate then she lost control

Also wtf is cheating in a fight to the death between demigods where one is a warlord just trying to kill you cause he can?
                    I wouldn't say anything is cheating in a war but Malenia was the one who brought her army to Caelid so your last statement is false
                    Do we actually know why that clash happened?  
I would assume the redmane knights are the natives of Caelid?
                    >It was a stalemate then she lost control

Looked like she lost an arm and was stabbed by a massive sword, while landing nothing on Radahn. How's that a stalemate?
                        &#x200B;

ill take the word of the actual game over Radahn simps on reddit tyvm. the game literally explicitly tells us it was a draw even before she bloomed. multiple times.
                            You can take whatever you want, the trailer says you're wrong lol.
            I don’t understand “power slides in Scarlett aeonia”
                I wasn't there, but if I'm understanding correctly he's saying that she slid across the room while in the Scarlet Aeonia flower.
                    And that usually that doesn’t happen? (I haven’t fought her yet)
                        Nope. Normally she does the attack and just sits there for a bit. Doesn't normally start sliding across the room.
                        It only happens in coop because lag.
                This happens when your pc thinks the ai is targeting one guy, but it's actually targeting you on the host's screen. Basically, from your perspective M will fly over and land near one guy, then the flower will skate across the ground towards you at mach 500 and explode. You need to act like she's targeting you beforehand, then you can dodge it
                    That makes a lot of sense

Thank you
I let someone Solo Malenia. I feel, unsatisfied. 
I feel upset that I could beat every other boss exept her. I accidentally summoned "Godskin Let me solo"
I wanted to respect his name and skill so I let him do it.
He was able to do it. And allowed me to get the killing blow. But I just feel, unsatisfied. I didn't earn that victory. He did really good and I respect his skill. Props to him. But I 100% regret it. 
Am I dumbass or is this reasonable 💀
    Ng+ awaits even the craven, young tarnished. Redeem yourself.
        Are you here for spirit tuning?
            I fucking love Roderika. She was my favorite NPC. She was so sweet.
                I feel so bad for her at the end, she has to sit there and watch Hewg deteriorate, and she's always so disappointed when she sees us and knows we are just there for her services, not for her.  "Oh, you are here for spirit tuning, I see..."
        Much easier in ng+, too... beat her 2nd attempt, after like 3 hours at it on first playthru.

Used Black Knife Tiche first time, Mimic Tear in ng+
        Yes. I will do it. 
No more letting someone else do the work for me :>
    I understand completely. I have 4 different characters all with different builds and none of them could solo her but did beat every other boss. I would kill Radagon and still get curb stomped by Melania, made me almost go hollow. 

But don't give up, I eventually beat her on my newest build, after dozens of attempts across multiple accounts.
    Eh... just do it yourself in ng+ better to just head straight over if you dont want to be overpowered
        Do you have the entire map unlocked from the start of NG+? I’ve been wanting to start it but really enjoying pvp so don’t want to have to get back to the academy before I can play it again
            If I remember correctly, you have the map but not the graces.
                Going through Elphael again is much more daunting for me than Malenia herself.
                    Yeah, that place is painful.
            As the other person said, you have the map, but not the graces... you also have to activate the summoning pools again
    Now you must take up the mantle. Remove thy attire and don the head of the misbegotten. It is time that you give into others what was given to you. It is time for you to solo her, in another's behalf.
    Totally reasonable
    This is how I felt too. I tried my best to solo it all to prove to myself I could. It's my first Souls game, after all.  But I just couldn't do it. Had to get help and having that rune just feels kinda empty.
        Don't beat yourself up. I've completed all the Dark Souls games, Demon Souls and Sekiro and I still had to get help from someone to beat her. All the RNG bullshit makes it hard to deal with. I must have fought Malenia 50+ times and I'm not sure I managed to once, avoid the waterfowl dance in it's entirety. Even knowing it was coming I was always caught partially by it.

At least with Isshin Sword Saint in Sekiro you could learn the patterns and whilst an extremely hard fight, it did feel somewhat fair. A lot of the enemies in Elden Ring stunlock you to death or plain up gank you, which does make it frustrating.
            > stunlock you to death

I can already see the next patch: 

>removed Malenia's healing when it wasn't intended

> accidentally added 3 revenants to the Malenia boss arena.
                :D
            >At least with Isshin Sword Saint in Sekiro you could learn the patterns

If one can't learn the patterns with Malenia then how come many of us solo her consistently? Sounds like you need to git gud
    Lol it all looks the same on the scorecard, kid.
    Don’t feel bad, you can always have another go at it on NG+. I have tried many times (probably 4-5hrs) trying to solo her without my mimic on my 1 giant-crusher jumping build, but the problem is the fight just takes too dam long and I have to play it at near perfect level or else she just ends up healing the damage. If I wasn’t at level 175+ (I tend to full clear on first playthrough) with mimic+10 I most likely would have asked for help too.
    Lol was it “Godskin Solo Her” on playstation?
        YES HIM. I thought I was spellnt it wrong. He did very good. He is very skilled.
            Haha it’s actually me. Sorry to hear you were disappointed
                WAIT WHAT OMG.
NONONONONO.
I'm not disappointed in the slightest. You did very good. I genuinely didn't think I would meet you 😭
I was just being dumb. Don't worry about it. You did very good, and I respect your effort and skill :)
                    Nah it’s totally cool. My goal is definitely to help people out who are frustrated or stuck for a long time but I figured along the way there would be some who felt the way you do
                        Yeah. That's very kind of you. When I saw your name I wanted to respect and. And I did, tbh I genuinely didn't think I would see you again. You are really good, keep up the good work :))
i'd rather masturbate than fuck with vik vaughn
    If I had an award to give away sir
I just beat Malenia after getting home from work today. I did the fight co-op, but it was hard to tell the difference between meme summons who would get wrecked in moments and people who actually fucked shit up. Shout out to "Jaira" and "Zimeno" for being competent fighters and seeing me through to the end.
That was truly a delight to watch. I admire the sheer will and determination that comes with taking down an enemy like that 1000 times across as many universes as possible.
He's making so much fucking money off that stream god damn
    What stream?

    Now he can solo her with RTX on
    I watched it on YouTube. He/she only had like 5.5k people watching
        “Only” that’s a lot homie
        towards the end he had about 9k people, for a youtube livestream thats pretty insane
        "Only."

Can you count?
        And more than a few people dropped 1k donation. On top of the hundreds they were making. Good for them.
            Who the fuck just has a thousand bucks to donate to a random guy streaming? That's wild
                A few people, Bandai and a few YouTubers were watching as well. He’s also not really a “random” either.
                    Yeah, he's become sort of internet famous at this point. Anyone loosely following the game has probably heard of him *somewhere*. Popped up in a completely unrelated conversation at school as well.
                    Bandai were watching? Did they mention/stream it?
                Rich gamers exist
                people donated 1000 in currencies other than usd, i dont think anyone actually dropped 1000 dollars, there were quite a few 100 dollar ones though
                I see you have never heard of Twitch
                I considered dropping 1k on the kill. Bills told me "not today," though.

I take it you're not familiar with Twitch Streamers? I've seen multiple 1,000 - 2,000+ donos (or even more) for really popular Streamers (Maximilian comes to mind).

There are literal oil princes who fund these people. They're just the current day's form of TV stars, really.
        Every time I see pronouns, I am inspired by the absolute laws of the universe to type this out.

You got it set to "M" for mini, when it should be set to "W" for wumbo. Come on. You know: I wumbo, you wumbo, he/she/we wumbo, wumbo, wumboing. Wumbology, the study of wumbo? It's first grade, SpongeBob!

    How are you seeing that
Awesome. Now let me start up my new viral elden ring character named “let me die to her”
    "Let Her Solo Me"
        I think that’s already been done
    That would be short lived
        Literally
That flower sliding train was insane. Not sure if that were a bug or lag.
    i think it’s both, a bug caused by lag.

    I thought I was gonna have a heart attack lmao
Hey that's me! (https://imgur.com/a/bsx6oFA) (proof he helped me : https://imgur.com/a/fMBfIoO) I was alt-tabbing to watch the stream and I guess it messed up the connection twice. I really REALLY did not mean to screw up two of his attempts. I did eventually rename myself to "let me Not Lag" and spammed the prayer emote, hoping the connection remained stable.
While I'm over here wondering how we know it's 1000?
    He live streamed his 982nd - 1000th kills earlier today
        Ah tyty
And then he just started NG+ lmao
The series villain?
make a circle jerk sub for this guy at this point so these posts can stop
    For real, I thought this sub was over that phase, but I guess once LMSH saw that his popularity was fading, he had to announce this chicanery.
        still can't believe how little it took for a guy to be considered god
            Like anything it was good timing and luck.  Same reason movie stars get popular.
            Meanwhile people who no hit the entire games get barely any recognition compared to this. Go figure.
                ye, even fucking PewDiePie did it and noone cares. but some random nobody with a haha jar on head naked man solos malenia with two strongest katanas in the game, and everyone loses their shit. pathetic really.

edit: PewDiePie did no deaths run, not no hit. Otzdarva did no hit on ds2 tho and that's most impressive to me by far.
                    The happy hob did the entire soulsborne series (minus ER iirc) no hit consecutively. That’s absolutely insane compared to soloing malenia
                    he's elevated to mythic status because of a word of mouth cult of personality that has been created by his consistent interaction *with* the community and if you can't figure that out then you're probably confused by most things.

happyhob sat in a room alone chasing his own ego, lmsh *helps 1000 other individual players* in a one on one interaction and you're absolutely shocked to see one guy is more popular than the other.
                        Not worth the effort trying to reason with people that get upset over what content they’re seeing on a subreddit.


If they can’t understand the concept of just ignoring/downvoting posts they don’t like and moving on with their days, they’re terminally online and won’t be reasoned with.
                    Graceless e-Flamer.  

What is thy business with these memes?  

Let Me Solo Her, the Yeeted.  The twin prodigies, Let Her Solo Me and Let Me Date Her.  General Let Me Watch.  Lunar Princess Let Me Solo Me.  

Thy kind are all of a piece. Wilful Karens, all. Emboldened by the flame of shitty PewDiePie streams.  Have it writ upon thy meagre grave: "Felled by King LMSH!  Last of all kings."
                        Comparing this fool to Morgott is insulting

                No hit is already a tiresome circlejerk. Stealing clout away from the chasers is a good thing.
                    What? Beating the entire game without getting hit is far more praiseworthy and interesting than killing the same boss in a mundane way over and over again
                        Says who exactly? 

No hit is oversaturated and played out at this point. People are getting tried of "world's first" clout chasers.
                            I don't really think enough people have done a no-hit run for it to be even close to oversaturated or played out. I'm only aware of a single one, but there's probably a couple more considering ER's popularity

>People are getting tried of "world's first" clout chasers.

                    Your parents are related by blood, aren't they?

                well, that guy sat in a room alone and didn't help anybody else meanwhile the entire point of LMSH's "career" is too assist other people and interact with them, directly, on a one-to-one basis.

1000 times, he has done this.

I can also show you that the music of Necrophagist is significantly more technically demanding than whatever is on the top 40, but you've probably never ever ever ever ever heard of Necrophagist, have you?

                                oh, I'll never recover
            I legit just feel it was a weird transition of people that hated Malenia, both character and boss wise, who were also Radahn fans, to gush over another cool dude who could skillfully beat her once the Radahn circlejerk petered out after a month and a half
                true, the amount of circlejerk on this sub been insane and by far worst of all souls subs I've been into.
                    I wanna make sure that I’m not shitting on LMSH for just being good at near consistently beating her, she IS a pretty difficult fight. I don’t wanna put that down. But I dunno, it’s hard for me to be impressed when he’s using bleed based dual katana weapons, quite literally one of, if not, the best weapon setups in the game’s meta.



And I really don’t wanna legit sound like a contraction elitist prick, I really don’t. But I agree—the circlejerk here and everywhere online tbh in some communities is unbearable. And as someone that likes Malenia’s lore and character, not even fucking in love with her, March and most of April were fucking awful since it was just constant bashing of her that I don’t think I’ve seen with any other character in the Souls games.



Im sorry for the random venting rant. Could be I’m a petty simp bitch or whatever . I feel like the phenomenon of LMSH’s popularity is just weird.
                        I agree with everything you said wholeheartedly, my thoughts exactly. there is nothing impressive about soloing her with not only bleed build but strongest katanas in the game.
                        Bleed AND frost all while having phantom lag bailing him out of the actually difficult dodge timing

End of the day hes just a competant phantom who had a gimmick and got elevated by all the people who convinced themselves malenia is some outrageously difficult and frustrating fight when it's not even one of the hardest or most annoying fights in the series.

There's also a lot of gamer(tm) hate towards Malenia, but at least LMSH is one of the least toxic ways of venting annoyance at her I've seen lmao. Complaining about the mechanics of the fight isn't enough, gotta talk about having sex with her or draw her being raped which im sure would 100% also happen if she were male /s
                        I think he can even solo her level 1. Probably The only reason I believe he is using the dual bleed katanas is because otherwise the fights will drag on too long.
                            If he’s gonna keep being upheld as a legend in this fanbase for however long it is, I’d like to see some variety from him. Again, I know I’m being a bit of a prick about this, but I legitimately can’t see his appeal when there are thousands of other players that go unnoticed. I’m more impressed with Ongbal since he showcases in multiple ways how good he is against Malenia and the rest of the game with the different weapons and tools and builds and parries he uses.



EDIT: also aren’t his fights with her usually long? He always runs back and baits outs attacks that he knows he can punish, prove a status effect, and then runs back again to repeat
                                They don't fully understand the fight is why it drags on so long. They don't take advantage of all the safe openings, entirely rely on basically jumping attacks and they don't know the correct dodges.

The only reason people think they're actually good is because the average player on this sub is *even worse* than they are.
                            You're joking right? His dodges are terrible. If they were to fight malenia as a host they would get destroyed. They're taking advantage of latency and the easier dodges that come with it. 

There's a reason they've not uploaded a video of them flawlessly fighting them as a solo host.
                                Idk man at this point I think he can beat Malenia flawless most of the time. He does say the time that he gets hit is mostly due to connection lag. 

I agree it's not like the most amazing thing in the game. I mean the no hit- runs are way more impressive than this and respect the abilities of those people more.
                                    You didn't read what I said. His dodges are TERRIBLE. He is only not getting hit because he is a phantom and benefitting from latency. I know because I've fought her a stupid number of times as a phantom and doing solo hitless runs using a save-state with different weapons.

Best example is every single waterfowl dance would kill him with the way they're dodging it. It only works as a phantom and the move is stupidly easy to dodge as a phantom. They conveniently don't mention the fact that latency actually makes the fight a hell of a lot easier for phantoms compared to hosts because that would make them look worse.
        this seems like your Machiavellian paranoia a lot more than the actual explanation for this post
    Even a flair would be nice so we can filter it. These posts are common enough to justify it at this point.

The best thing is getting praised by Malenia 1000x times
Malenia had been destroyed by Let me solo her in 1000 parallel world.
    so Lmsh is Funny Valentine all along
Damnit. He tried helping me a few hours ago and unfortunately was not successful. But it was so cool watching him! Such a cool dude.
    I summoned him back in mid March before his popularity.  Just one of about a hundred tarnished I summoned to help with her.  None succeeded (not even LMSH), but as a longtime sunbro I respect the help I got from each one despite the losses.
Thousand kills and has to rely on latency to get away with poor dodges. That's rough.
The villain when you fought against them vs When you convinced them to join your side
I felt bad the first time I beat malenia, like I knew I wasn’t worthy since it took me 100 tries.
    How are you 'not worthy'? You persevered instead of having someone beat the boss for you
    This guy has stated it took him over 240 tries to get proficient at fighting Malenia.  It's about the eventual success, not how many failures it took to get there.
    Took me easily like 400 to beat her with no summons or ashes
this guy single handedly gave a thousand noobs waterfoul dance reeee
I WAS THERE
He should've just named himself "cuck me"
Enough with this redditry cringeathon jerking it to this guy.
I hate fighting her, beating her once was such a struggle and I can't imagine beating her 1000 times although at that point LMSH could just fight her blindfolded at this point.
Jesus christ can you let the meme die already?

    That quote is sooo dumb lol, BTW I wasn't the one who downvoted you.
        May be I should change it to “Malenia fear not the man who has killed 1000 demigods once, but she fear the man who has solo her 1000 times. “ ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm) But I do like Bruce lee’s line a lot.
I don’t get how she is hard I was literally playing around to beat her 🤣🤣 I fear no man………..but fire giant…… he scares me

Let me solo her should be in the end credits
When are they on (zulu time).... i don't think i can take another wombo combo with like three hits till shes dead

    I don't know if it's a meme, but seeing the name written as Melania triggers the shit out of me.
        You'd think all these people getting the shit beaten out of them would remember it correctly, considering she literally says it every time they die.
            I am FeMalenia, maid of Bliquella… not only have I heard and read it hundreds of times but my mind eventually twisted it too.

            Maybe they have mentally blocked the name from their mind.
            Yeah, it's Melanoma
            They summoned LMSH first try so they never heard :)
            not me, I cheese her every time lol
            So that is why she keeps repeating her name.
        Ikr? Everytime it makes me think of Trump's wife.
            It's probably auto correcting
                Me, who can just click the word with the red line if I misspell something like a normal person: y tho?
                    Well it's not gonna red line an actual word. Melania and Malenia aren't gonna give red lines. And if your using swipe is even more of a pain if you don't notice after the post.
                        I meant that there's no reason to use auto-correct. It's just a crutch that doesn't work half the time. Use proper grammar, lest I part thee in twain.
                            Isn't grammar the proper structure of sentences and orthography the usage of correct spelling?
                                Yes. If you look at those sentences, they lack proper structure.
                            We're both saying the same then. Most the time auto correct doesn't work. It'll give you the wrong word.. so it's probably one reason.
                                Ye
        I am Melania, blade of Marika.
        At least Melania's a real name.  The number of times I've seen guys named "Michael" written as "Micheal" is absurd.  Whenever I watch a Youtube video by a guy named Michael (which is weirdly specific but like, seems to pop up pretty frequently?) I swear half the comments are referencing some mythical person named "Micheal" who doesn't exist.
        I'm too dyslexic to notice half the time
        It's largely genuine error. There's a few common ones: Melania, Mogh,  and Malekith are the three I see misspelled most often.
            Atlus
                Bro it's obvious though, I know it's altus, but I truly believe it's an anagram and homage to Atlus, the publisher of many a niche but usually awesome game .

Ogre Battle was the first nuke Atlus unleashed in the snes days, one of my all time favorite games.

Also Atlus published demons souls here in the west originally, so um, without Atlus there would be no souls games.

At least that's my theory
                    Altus is latin for high. As spanish comes from latin, many words sounds similar.

\[Latin\] \[Spanish\] \[English\]

Altus - Alto - High

Tres - Tres - Three

Duo - Dos - Two

Unus - Uno - One

Nihil - Nada - Nothing \[Zero doesn't exist in latin\]

NIHIL

NIHIIIIL!!!
                        Nullus, nulla, nullum.
                        I I did know that, what I'm saying is are you trying to say is that it couldn't possibly have been chosen for both meanings?
                    I love it.

Interestingly enough, Altus means high in Latin.
                    Nah, Altus means high. It's literally just the high plateau

Probably because it's written Mohg, not Mogh

                        No you're just bad at communicating then, because it sounds like you're agreeing with the incorrect spelling. 

Edit: Downvote me all you want, the fact that your original comment is at -4 proves my point.
                            I think you're bad at reading if anything,i just said how it took me a lot longer to realise it was written moGh after PFFT why would the first comment have the context for the latter ones after all

    There is no such helmet, they probably mean the akbinauric helmet or the land octopus helmet ( first things I could think of).

            Monkey paw curls and you have to kill Miriel to get this helmet.
    I think they meant those frog dudes
        Ah, the Albinauric Helm gotcha. Thank you.
I had a person named something like Let Me Die Solo, dual wielding massive hammers that absolutely carried me and obliterated her lol.

Thank you PSN strangers for carrying me through my game.
I got a hardcore mf named BEEEEEANS who I danced the most scintillating dance of death with. Our movements were so accidentally coordinated that I think we might actually be married now. We took turns getting her aggro back and forth for the duration of the first phase and in the second they would hold her attention so she would Aeonia them while I hit her with the Baja blaster (Azures comet). It was truly beautiful.
Turtle helmet? Albinuriac?
That’s the whole deal.  The moment her attention shifts, you run in and smack her a couple times, then run away, waiting for that player to heal/smack her back.
I got LMSH on the first try, but he got disconnected in the middle of the fight. I then died. I tried four or five other summons, and they all died pretty fast.

I switched my build to ROB, used the mimic, and stomped her. The only boss who gave me more trouble was Radagon. I probably fought him twice as many times before I got it right, which was just today.
I think the point is to be faceless, like anyone can do it.
    The real Let Me Solo Her are the friends we made along the way?
        That's not how it....


Yes. You're right. Pats head*

        That moment when killing Melenia is profitable. Dude made easily $5000 from all the donations that rolled in after the kill
            If I were him I'd put it on my CV lol. Payable skill: beat Malenia.
? Did the game really do that to someone?
    If you watch their last fight Malenia power slides in Scarlet Aeonia across the arena
        She did that in a lot of the fights on the first rot bomb of the second phase. I’ve never seen it before but it might be a multiplayer thing. But I noticed it each time because it was so weird. As far as Malenia cheating though, that’s 100% her personality to avoid defeat. She did it with Rahdan and I think that was the message of Millicent’s quest.
            I thought that was from lag.
            She didn't cheat vs Radahn lol

It was a stalemate then she lost control

Also wtf is cheating in a fight to the death between demigods where one is a warlord just trying to kill you cause he can?
                I wouldn't say anything is cheating in a war but Malenia was the one who brought her army to Caelid so your last statement is false
                Do we actually know why that clash happened?  
I would assume the redmane knights are the natives of Caelid?
                >It was a stalemate then she lost control

Looked like she lost an arm and was stabbed by a massive sword, while landing nothing on Radahn. How's that a stalemate?
                    &#x200B;

ill take the word of the actual game over Radahn simps on reddit tyvm. the game literally explicitly tells us it was a draw even before she bloomed. multiple times.
                        You can take whatever you want, the trailer says you're wrong lol.
        I don’t understand “power slides in Scarlett aeonia”
            I wasn't there, but if I'm understanding correctly he's saying that she slid across the room while in the Scarlet Aeonia flower.
                And that usually that doesn’t happen? (I haven’t fought her yet)
                    Nope. Normally she does the attack and just sits there for a bit. Doesn't normally start sliding across the room.
                    It only happens in coop because lag.
            This happens when your pc thinks the ai is targeting one guy, but it's actually targeting you on the host's screen. Basically, from your perspective M will fly over and land near one guy, then the flower will skate across the ground towards you at mach 500 and explode. You need to act like she's targeting you beforehand, then you can dodge it
                That makes a lot of sense

Thank you
Ng+ awaits even the craven, young tarnished. Redeem yourself.
    Are you here for spirit tuning?
        I fucking love Roderika. She was my favorite NPC. She was so sweet.
            I feel so bad for her at the end, she has to sit there and watch Hewg deteriorate, and she's always so disappointed when she sees us and knows we are just there for her services, not for her.  "Oh, you are here for spirit tuning, I see..."
    Much easier in ng+, too... beat her 2nd attempt, after like 3 hours at it on first playthru.

Used Black Knife Tiche first time, Mimic Tear in ng+
    Yes. I will do it. 
No more letting someone else do the work for me :>
I understand completely. I have 4 different characters all with different builds and none of them could solo her but did beat every other boss. I would kill Radagon and still get curb stomped by Melania, made me almost go hollow. 

But don't give up, I eventually beat her on my newest build, after dozens of attempts across multiple accounts.
Eh... just do it yourself in ng+ better to just head straight over if you dont want to be overpowered
    Do you have the entire map unlocked from the start of NG+? I’ve been wanting to start it but really enjoying pvp so don’t want to have to get back to the academy before I can play it again
        If I remember correctly, you have the map but not the graces.
            Going through Elphael again is much more daunting for me than Malenia herself.
                Yeah, that place is painful.
        As the other person said, you have the map, but not the graces... you also have to activate the summoning pools again
Now you must take up the mantle. Remove thy attire and don the head of the misbegotten. It is time that you give into others what was given to you. It is time for you to solo her, in another's behalf.
Totally reasonable
This is how I felt too. I tried my best to solo it all to prove to myself I could. It's my first Souls game, after all.  But I just couldn't do it. Had to get help and having that rune just feels kinda empty.
    Don't beat yourself up. I've completed all the Dark Souls games, Demon Souls and Sekiro and I still had to get help from someone to beat her. All the RNG bullshit makes it hard to deal with. I must have fought Malenia 50+ times and I'm not sure I managed to once, avoid the waterfowl dance in it's entirety. Even knowing it was coming I was always caught partially by it.

At least with Isshin Sword Saint in Sekiro you could learn the patterns and whilst an extremely hard fight, it did feel somewhat fair. A lot of the enemies in Elden Ring stunlock you to death or plain up gank you, which does make it frustrating.
        > stunlock you to death

I can already see the next patch: 

>removed Malenia's healing when it wasn't intended

> accidentally added 3 revenants to the Malenia boss arena.
            :D
        >At least with Isshin Sword Saint in Sekiro you could learn the patterns

If one can't learn the patterns with Malenia then how come many of us solo her consistently? Sounds like you need to git gud
Lol it all looks the same on the scorecard, kid.
Don’t feel bad, you can always have another go at it on NG+. I have tried many times (probably 4-5hrs) trying to solo her without my mimic on my 1 giant-crusher jumping build, but the problem is the fight just takes too dam long and I have to play it at near perfect level or else she just ends up healing the damage. If I wasn’t at level 175+ (I tend to full clear on first playthrough) with mimic+10 I most likely would have asked for help too.
Lol was it “Godskin Solo Her” on playstation?
    YES HIM. I thought I was spellnt it wrong. He did very good. He is very skilled.
        Haha it’s actually me. Sorry to hear you were disappointed
            WAIT WHAT OMG.
NONONONONO.
I'm not disappointed in the slightest. You did very good. I genuinely didn't think I would meet you 😭
I was just being dumb. Don't worry about it. You did very good, and I respect your effort and skill :)
                Nah it’s totally cool. My goal is definitely to help people out who are frustrated or stuck for a long time but I figured along the way there would be some who felt the way you do
                    Yeah. That's very kind of you. When I saw your name I wanted to respect and. And I did, tbh I genuinely didn't think I would see you again. You are really good, keep up the good work :))

Now he can solo her with RTX on
I watched it on YouTube. He/she only had like 5.5k people watching
    “Only” that’s a lot homie
    towards the end he had about 9k people, for a youtube livestream thats pretty insane
    "Only."

Can you count?
    And more than a few people dropped 1k donation. On top of the hundreds they were making. Good for them.
        Who the fuck just has a thousand bucks to donate to a random guy streaming? That's wild
            A few people, Bandai and a few YouTubers were watching as well. He’s also not really a “random” either.
                Yeah, he's become sort of internet famous at this point. Anyone loosely following the game has probably heard of him *somewhere*. Popped up in a completely unrelated conversation at school as well.
                Bandai were watching? Did they mention/stream it?
            Rich gamers exist
            people donated 1000 in currencies other than usd, i dont think anyone actually dropped 1000 dollars, there were quite a few 100 dollar ones though
            I see you have never heard of Twitch
            I considered dropping 1k on the kill. Bills told me "not today," though.

I take it you're not familiar with Twitch Streamers? I've seen multiple 1,000 - 2,000+ donos (or even more) for really popular Streamers (Maximilian comes to mind).

There are literal oil princes who fund these people. They're just the current day's form of TV stars, really.

How are you seeing that
"Let Her Solo Me"
    I think that’s already been done
That would be short lived
    Literally
i think it’s both, a bug caused by lag.
I thought I was gonna have a heart attack lmao
He live streamed his 982nd - 1000th kills earlier today
    Ah tyty
For real, I thought this sub was over that phase, but I guess once LMSH saw that his popularity was fading, he had to announce this chicanery.
    still can't believe how little it took for a guy to be considered god
        Like anything it was good timing and luck.  Same reason movie stars get popular.
        Meanwhile people who no hit the entire games get barely any recognition compared to this. Go figure.
            ye, even fucking PewDiePie did it and noone cares. but some random nobody with a haha jar on head naked man solos malenia with two strongest katanas in the game, and everyone loses their shit. pathetic really.

edit: PewDiePie did no deaths run, not no hit. Otzdarva did no hit on ds2 tho and that's most impressive to me by far.
                The happy hob did the entire soulsborne series (minus ER iirc) no hit consecutively. That’s absolutely insane compared to soloing malenia
                he's elevated to mythic status because of a word of mouth cult of personality that has been created by his consistent interaction *with* the community and if you can't figure that out then you're probably confused by most things.

happyhob sat in a room alone chasing his own ego, lmsh *helps 1000 other individual players* in a one on one interaction and you're absolutely shocked to see one guy is more popular than the other.
                    Not worth the effort trying to reason with people that get upset over what content they’re seeing on a subreddit.


If they can’t understand the concept of just ignoring/downvoting posts they don’t like and moving on with their days, they’re terminally online and won’t be reasoned with.

What is thy business with these memes?  

Let Me Solo Her, the Yeeted.  The twin prodigies, Let Her Solo Me and Let Me Date Her.  General Let Me Watch.  Lunar Princess Let Me Solo Me.  

Thy kind are all of a piece. Wilful Karens, all. Emboldened by the flame of shitty PewDiePie streams.  Have it writ upon thy meagre grave: "Felled by King LMSH!  Last of all kings."
                    Comparing this fool to Morgott is insulting

            No hit is already a tiresome circlejerk. Stealing clout away from the chasers is a good thing.
                What? Beating the entire game without getting hit is far more praiseworthy and interesting than killing the same boss in a mundane way over and over again
                    Says who exactly? 

No hit is oversaturated and played out at this point. People are getting tried of "world's first" clout chasers.
                        I don't really think enough people have done a no-hit run for it to be even close to oversaturated or played out. I'm only aware of a single one, but there's probably a couple more considering ER's popularity

>People are getting tried of "world's first" clout chasers.

Says who exactly?
                Your parents are related by blood, aren't they?
                    Average hitless fan. Rabid and always quick to the insults.
                        So yes then.
            well, that guy sat in a room alone and didn't help anybody else meanwhile the entire point of LMSH's "career" is too assist other people and interact with them, directly, on a one-to-one basis.

1000 times, he has done this.

I can also show you that the music of Necrophagist is significantly more technically demanding than whatever is on the top 40, but you've probably never ever ever ever ever heard of Necrophagist, have you?

                            oh, I'll never recover
        I legit just feel it was a weird transition of people that hated Malenia, both character and boss wise, who were also Radahn fans, to gush over another cool dude who could skillfully beat her once the Radahn circlejerk petered out after a month and a half
            true, the amount of circlejerk on this sub been insane and by far worst of all souls subs I've been into.
                I wanna make sure that I’m not shitting on LMSH for just being good at near consistently beating her, she IS a pretty difficult fight. I don’t wanna put that down. But I dunno, it’s hard for me to be impressed when he’s using bleed based dual katana weapons, quite literally one of, if not, the best weapon setups in the game’s meta.



And I really don’t wanna legit sound like a contraction elitist prick, I really don’t. But I agree—the circlejerk here and everywhere online tbh in some communities is unbearable. And as someone that likes Malenia’s lore and character, not even fucking in love with her, March and most of April were fucking awful since it was just constant bashing of her that I don’t think I’ve seen with any other character in the Souls games.



Im sorry for the random venting rant. Could be I’m a petty simp bitch or whatever . I feel like the phenomenon of LMSH’s popularity is just weird.
                    I agree with everything you said wholeheartedly, my thoughts exactly. there is nothing impressive about soloing her with not only bleed build but strongest katanas in the game.
                    Bleed AND frost all while having phantom lag bailing him out of the actually difficult dodge timing

End of the day hes just a competant phantom who had a gimmick and got elevated by all the people who convinced themselves malenia is some outrageously difficult and frustrating fight when it's not even one of the hardest or most annoying fights in the series.

There's also a lot of gamer(tm) hate towards Malenia, but at least LMSH is one of the least toxic ways of venting annoyance at her I've seen lmao. Complaining about the mechanics of the fight isn't enough, gotta talk about having sex with her or draw her being raped which im sure would 100% also happen if she were male /s
                    I think he can even solo her level 1. Probably The only reason I believe he is using the dual bleed katanas is because otherwise the fights will drag on too long.
                        If he’s gonna keep being upheld as a legend in this fanbase for however long it is, I’d like to see some variety from him. Again, I know I’m being a bit of a prick about this, but I legitimately can’t see his appeal when there are thousands of other players that go unnoticed. I’m more impressed with Ongbal since he showcases in multiple ways how good he is against Malenia and the rest of the game with the different weapons and tools and builds and parries he uses.



EDIT: also aren’t his fights with her usually long? He always runs back and baits outs attacks that he knows he can punish, prove a status effect, and then runs back again to repeat
                            They don't fully understand the fight is why it drags on so long. They don't take advantage of all the safe openings, entirely rely on basically jumping attacks and they don't know the correct dodges.

The only reason people think they're actually good is because the average player on this sub is *even worse* than they are.
                        You're joking right? His dodges are terrible. If they were to fight malenia as a host they would get destroyed. They're taking advantage of latency and the easier dodges that come with it. 

There's a reason they've not uploaded a video of them flawlessly fighting them as a solo host.
                            Idk man at this point I think he can beat Malenia flawless most of the time. He does say the time that he gets hit is mostly due to connection lag. 

I agree it's not like the most amazing thing in the game. I mean the no hit- runs are way more impressive than this and respect the abilities of those people more.
                                You didn't read what I said. His dodges are TERRIBLE. He is only not getting hit because he is a phantom and benefitting from latency. I know because I've fought her a stupid number of times as a phantom and doing solo hitless runs using a save-state with different weapons.

Best example is every single waterfowl dance would kill him with the way they're dodging it. It only works as a phantom and the move is stupidly easy to dodge as a phantom. They conveniently don't mention the fact that latency actually makes the fight a hell of a lot easier for phantoms compared to hosts because that would make them look worse.
    this seems like your Machiavellian paranoia a lot more than the actual explanation for this post
Even a flair would be nice so we can filter it. These posts are common enough to justify it at this point.

Those people are not just "memeing" they are being 100% serious and you know it.
                Aaaah, yes, writings on the internet, the famous medium that is always 100% factual.
so Lmsh is Funny Valentine all along
I summoned him back in mid March before his popularity.  Just one of about a hundred tarnished I summoned to help with her.  None succeeded (not even LMSH), but as a longtime sunbro I respect the help I got from each one despite the losses.
How are you 'not worthy'? You persevered instead of having someone beat the boss for you
This guy has stated it took him over 240 tries to get proficient at fighting Malenia.  It's about the eventual success, not how many failures it took to get there.
Took me easily like 400 to beat her with no summons or ashes
Only Malenia dies in this subreddit.
    Idk my will to live does an any % speedrun pretty regularly on this subreddit.
    Melania
That quote is sooo dumb lol, BTW I wasn't the one who downvoted you.
    May be I should change it to “Malenia fear not the man who has killed 1000 demigods once, but she fear the man who has solo her 1000 times. “ ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm) But I do like Bruce lee’s line a lot.
If only everyone was so humble.
Then change mid flight to dual katana mid flight! What a chad
I don't know if it's a meme, but seeing the name written as Melania triggers the shit out of me.
    You'd think all these people getting the shit beaten out of them would remember it correctly, considering she literally says it every time they die.
        I am FeMalenia, maid of Bliquella… not only have I heard and read it hundreds of times but my mind eventually twisted it too.
            IRON MALENIA
        Maybe they have mentally blocked the name from their mind.
        Yeah, it's Melanoma
        They summoned LMSH first try so they never heard :)
        not me, I cheese her every time lol
        So that is why she keeps repeating her name.
    Ikr? Everytime it makes me think of Trump's wife.
        It's probably auto correcting
            Me, who can just click the word with the red line if I misspell something like a normal person: y tho?
                Well it's not gonna red line an actual word. Melania and Malenia aren't gonna give red lines. And if your using swipe is even more of a pain if you don't notice after the post.
                    I meant that there's no reason to use auto-correct. It's just a crutch that doesn't work half the time. Use proper grammar, lest I part thee in twain.
                        Isn't grammar the proper structure of sentences and orthography the usage of correct spelling?
                            Yes. If you look at those sentences, they lack proper structure.
                        We're both saying the same then. Most the time auto correct doesn't work. It'll give you the wrong word.. so it's probably one reason.
                            Ye
    I am Melania, blade of Marika.
    At least Melania's a real name.  The number of times I've seen guys named "Michael" written as "Micheal" is absurd.  Whenever I watch a Youtube video by a guy named Michael (which is weirdly specific but like, seems to pop up pretty frequently?) I swear half the comments are referencing some mythical person named "Micheal" who doesn't exist.
    I'm too dyslexic to notice half the time
    It's largely genuine error. There's a few common ones: Melania, Mogh,  and Malekith are the three I see misspelled most often.
        Atlus
            Bro it's obvious though, I know it's altus, but I truly believe it's an anagram and homage to Atlus, the publisher of many a niche but usually awesome game .

Ogre Battle was the first nuke Atlus unleashed in the snes days, one of my all time favorite games.

Also Atlus published demons souls here in the west originally, so um, without Atlus there would be no souls games.

At least that's my theory
                Altus is latin for high. As spanish comes from latin, many words sounds similar.

\[Latin\] \[Spanish\] \[English\]

Altus - Alto - High

Tres - Tres - Three

Duo - Dos - Two

Unus - Uno - One

Nihil - Nada - Nothing \[Zero doesn't exist in latin\]

NIHIL

NIHIIIIL!!!
                    Nullus, nulla, nullum.
                    I I did know that, what I'm saying is are you trying to say is that it couldn't possibly have been chosen for both meanings?
                I love it.

Interestingly enough, Altus means high in Latin.
                Nah, Altus means high. It's literally just the high plateau
                    Damn wish I was
        It took me a lot longer than it should to realise its written moGh

Apparently the fact i didn't realise it was written mogh was enough to downvote me,lol
            >Apparently the fact i didn't realise it was written mogh was enough to downvote me,lol

Probably because it's written Mohg, not Mogh

Edit: Whoever downvoted me for being correct, here you go https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mohg,+Lord+of+Blood
                And i am stating how in coment previous to mine it took me a while to see it was written moGh i never stated it was mogh in game i am not stupid
                    No you're just bad at communicating then, because it sounds like you're agreeing with the incorrect spelling. 

Edit: Downvote me all you want, the fact that your original comment is at -4 proves my point.
                        I think you're bad at reading if anything,i just said how it took me a lot longer to realise it was written moGh after PFFT why would the first comment have the context for the latter ones after all
                            I assure you you aren't being as clear as you think you are.
    I had to re read your comment before I understood the name was written the wrong way.

There is no such helmet, they probably mean the akbinauric helmet or the land octopus helmet ( first things I could think of).
    Fingers crossed for a Miriel Helm in DLC
        Monkey paw curls and you have to kill Miriel to get this helmet.
I think they meant those frog dudes
    Ah, the Albinauric Helm gotcha. Thank you.

    That moment when killing Melenia is profitable. Dude made easily $5000 from all the donations that rolled in after the kill
        If I were him I'd put it on my CV lol. Payable skill: beat Malenia.
If you watch their last fight Malenia power slides in Scarlet Aeonia across the arena
    She did that in a lot of the fights on the first rot bomb of the second phase. I’ve never seen it before but it might be a multiplayer thing. But I noticed it each time because it was so weird. As far as Malenia cheating though, that’s 100% her personality to avoid defeat. She did it with Rahdan and I think that was the message of Millicent’s quest.
        I thought that was from lag.
        She didn't cheat vs Radahn lol

It was a stalemate then she lost control

Also wtf is cheating in a fight to the death between demigods where one is a warlord just trying to kill you cause he can?
            I wouldn't say anything is cheating in a war but Malenia was the one who brought her army to Caelid so your last statement is false
            Do we actually know why that clash happened?  
I would assume the redmane knights are the natives of Caelid?
            >It was a stalemate then she lost control

Looked like she lost an arm and was stabbed by a massive sword, while landing nothing on Radahn. How's that a stalemate?
                &#x200B;

ill take the word of the actual game over Radahn simps on reddit tyvm. the game literally explicitly tells us it was a draw even before she bloomed. multiple times.
                    You can take whatever you want, the trailer says you're wrong lol.
    I don’t understand “power slides in Scarlett aeonia”
        I wasn't there, but if I'm understanding correctly he's saying that she slid across the room while in the Scarlet Aeonia flower.
            And that usually that doesn’t happen? (I haven’t fought her yet)
                Nope. Normally she does the attack and just sits there for a bit. Doesn't normally start sliding across the room.
                It only happens in coop because lag.
        This happens when your pc thinks the ai is targeting one guy, but it's actually targeting you on the host's screen. Basically, from your perspective M will fly over and land near one guy, then the flower will skate across the ground towards you at mach 500 and explode. You need to act like she's targeting you beforehand, then you can dodge it
            That makes a lot of sense

Thank you
Are you here for spirit tuning?
    I fucking love Roderika. She was my favorite NPC. She was so sweet.
        I feel so bad for her at the end, she has to sit there and watch Hewg deteriorate, and she's always so disappointed when she sees us and knows we are just there for her services, not for her.  "Oh, you are here for spirit tuning, I see..."
Much easier in ng+, too... beat her 2nd attempt, after like 3 hours at it on first playthru.

Used Black Knife Tiche first time, Mimic Tear in ng+
Yes. I will do it. 
No more letting someone else do the work for me :>
Do you have the entire map unlocked from the start of NG+? I’ve been wanting to start it but really enjoying pvp so don’t want to have to get back to the academy before I can play it again
    If I remember correctly, you have the map but not the graces.
        Going through Elphael again is much more daunting for me than Malenia herself.
            Yeah, that place is painful.
    As the other person said, you have the map, but not the graces... you also have to activate the summoning pools again
Don't beat yourself up. I've completed all the Dark Souls games, Demon Souls and Sekiro and I still had to get help from someone to beat her. All the RNG bullshit makes it hard to deal with. I must have fought Malenia 50+ times and I'm not sure I managed to once, avoid the waterfowl dance in it's entirety. Even knowing it was coming I was always caught partially by it.

At least with Isshin Sword Saint in Sekiro you could learn the patterns and whilst an extremely hard fight, it did feel somewhat fair. A lot of the enemies in Elden Ring stunlock you to death or plain up gank you, which does make it frustrating.
    > stunlock you to death

I can already see the next patch: 

>removed Malenia's healing when it wasn't intended

> accidentally added 3 revenants to the Malenia boss arena.
        :D
    >At least with Isshin Sword Saint in Sekiro you could learn the patterns

If one can't learn the patterns with Malenia then how come many of us solo her consistently? Sounds like you need to git gud
YES HIM. I thought I was spellnt it wrong. He did very good. He is very skilled.
    Haha it’s actually me. Sorry to hear you were disappointed
        WAIT WHAT OMG.
NONONONONO.
I'm not disappointed in the slightest. You did very good. I genuinely didn't think I would meet you 😭
I was just being dumb. Don't worry about it. You did very good, and I respect your effort and skill :)
            Nah it’s totally cool. My goal is definitely to help people out who are frustrated or stuck for a long time but I figured along the way there would be some who felt the way you do
                Yeah. That's very kind of you. When I saw your name I wanted to respect and. And I did, tbh I genuinely didn't think I would see you again. You are really good, keep up the good work :))

"Only."

Can you count?
And more than a few people dropped 1k donation. On top of the hundreds they were making. Good for them.
    Who the fuck just has a thousand bucks to donate to a random guy streaming? That's wild

    Meanwhile people who no hit the entire games get barely any recognition compared to this. Go figure.
        ye, even fucking PewDiePie did it and noone cares. but some random nobody with a haha jar on head naked man solos malenia with two strongest katanas in the game, and everyone loses their shit. pathetic really.

edit: PewDiePie did no deaths run, not no hit. Otzdarva did no hit on ds2 tho and that's most impressive to me by far.
            The happy hob did the entire soulsborne series (minus ER iirc) no hit consecutively. That’s absolutely insane compared to soloing malenia
            he's elevated to mythic status because of a word of mouth cult of personality that has been created by his consistent interaction *with* the community and if you can't figure that out then you're probably confused by most things.

happyhob sat in a room alone chasing his own ego, lmsh *helps 1000 other individual players* in a one on one interaction and you're absolutely shocked to see one guy is more popular than the other.

        No hit is already a tiresome circlejerk. Stealing clout away from the chasers is a good thing.
            What? Beating the entire game without getting hit is far more praiseworthy and interesting than killing the same boss in a mundane way over and over again
                Says who exactly? 

No hit is oversaturated and played out at this point. People are getting tried of "world's first" clout chasers.
                    I don't really think enough people have done a no-hit run for it to be even close to oversaturated or played out. I'm only aware of a single one, but there's probably a couple more considering ER's popularity

        well, that guy sat in a room alone and didn't help anybody else meanwhile the entire point of LMSH's "career" is too assist other people and interact with them, directly, on a one-to-one basis.

1000 times, he has done this.

I can also show you that the music of Necrophagist is significantly more technically demanding than whatever is on the top 40, but you've probably never ever ever ever ever heard of Necrophagist, have you?

    I legit just feel it was a weird transition of people that hated Malenia, both character and boss wise, who were also Radahn fans, to gush over another cool dude who could skillfully beat her once the Radahn circlejerk petered out after a month and a half
        true, the amount of circlejerk on this sub been insane and by far worst of all souls subs I've been into.
            I wanna make sure that I’m not shitting on LMSH for just being good at near consistently beating her, she IS a pretty difficult fight. I don’t wanna put that down. But I dunno, it’s hard for me to be impressed when he’s using bleed based dual katana weapons, quite literally one of, if not, the best weapon setups in the game’s meta.



And I really don’t wanna legit sound like a contraction elitist prick, I really don’t. But I agree—the circlejerk here and everywhere online tbh in some communities is unbearable. And as someone that likes Malenia’s lore and character, not even fucking in love with her, March and most of April were fucking awful since it was just constant bashing of her that I don’t think I’ve seen with any other character in the Souls games.



Im sorry for the random venting rant. Could be I’m a petty simp bitch or whatever . I feel like the phenomenon of LMSH’s popularity is just weird.
                I agree with everything you said wholeheartedly, my thoughts exactly. there is nothing impressive about soloing her with not only bleed build but strongest katanas in the game.
                Bleed AND frost all while having phantom lag bailing him out of the actually difficult dodge timing

End of the day hes just a competant phantom who had a gimmick and got elevated by all the people who convinced themselves malenia is some outrageously difficult and frustrating fight when it's not even one of the hardest or most annoying fights in the series.

There's also a lot of gamer(tm) hate towards Malenia, but at least LMSH is one of the least toxic ways of venting annoyance at her I've seen lmao. Complaining about the mechanics of the fight isn't enough, gotta talk about having sex with her or draw her being raped which im sure would 100% also happen if she were male /s
                I think he can even solo her level 1. Probably The only reason I believe he is using the dual bleed katanas is because otherwise the fights will drag on too long.
                    If he’s gonna keep being upheld as a legend in this fanbase for however long it is, I’d like to see some variety from him. Again, I know I’m being a bit of a prick about this, but I legitimately can’t see his appeal when there are thousands of other players that go unnoticed. I’m more impressed with Ongbal since he showcases in multiple ways how good he is against Malenia and the rest of the game with the different weapons and tools and builds and parries he uses.



EDIT: also aren’t his fights with her usually long? He always runs back and baits outs attacks that he knows he can punish, prove a status effect, and then runs back again to repeat
                        They don't fully understand the fight is why it drags on so long. They don't take advantage of all the safe openings, entirely rely on basically jumping attacks and they don't know the correct dodges.

The only reason people think they're actually good is because the average player on this sub is *even worse* than they are.
                    You're joking right? His dodges are terrible. If they were to fight malenia as a host they would get destroyed. They're taking advantage of latency and the easier dodges that come with it. 

There's a reason they've not uploaded a video of them flawlessly fighting them as a solo host.
                        Idk man at this point I think he can beat Malenia flawless most of the time. He does say the time that he gets hit is mostly due to connection lag. 

I agree it's not like the most amazing thing in the game. I mean the no hit- runs are way more impressive than this and respect the abilities of those people more.
                            You didn't read what I said. His dodges are TERRIBLE. He is only not getting hit because he is a phantom and benefitting from latency. I know because I've fought her a stupid number of times as a phantom and doing solo hitless runs using a save-state with different weapons.

Best example is every single waterfowl dance would kill him with the way they're dodging it. It only works as a phantom and the move is stupidly easy to dodge as a phantom. They conveniently don't mention the fact that latency actually makes the fight a hell of a lot easier for phantoms compared to hosts because that would make them look worse.
this seems like your Machiavellian paranoia a lot more than the actual explanation for this post

Those people are not just "memeing" they are being 100% serious and you know it.
            Aaaah, yes, writings on the internet, the famous medium that is always 100% factual.
Idk my will to live does an any % speedrun pretty regularly on this subreddit.
Melania
May be I should change it to “Malenia fear not the man who has killed 1000 demigods once, but she fear the man who has solo her 1000 times. “ ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm) But I do like Bruce lee’s line a lot.
You'd think all these people getting the shit beaten out of them would remember it correctly, considering she literally says it every time they die.
    I am FeMalenia, maid of Bliquella… not only have I heard and read it hundreds of times but my mind eventually twisted it too.
        IRON MALENIA
    Maybe they have mentally blocked the name from their mind.
    Yeah, it's Melanoma
    They summoned LMSH first try so they never heard :)
    not me, I cheese her every time lol
    So that is why she keeps repeating her name.
Ikr? Everytime it makes me think of Trump's wife.
    It's probably auto correcting
        Me, who can just click the word with the red line if I misspell something like a normal person: y tho?
            Well it's not gonna red line an actual word. Melania and Malenia aren't gonna give red lines. And if your using swipe is even more of a pain if you don't notice after the post.
                I meant that there's no reason to use auto-correct. It's just a crutch that doesn't work half the time. Use proper grammar, lest I part thee in twain.
                    Isn't grammar the proper structure of sentences and orthography the usage of correct spelling?
                        Yes. If you look at those sentences, they lack proper structure.
                    We're both saying the same then. Most the time auto correct doesn't work. It'll give you the wrong word.. so it's probably one reason.
                        Ye
I am Melania, blade of Marika.
At least Melania's a real name.  The number of times I've seen guys named "Michael" written as "Micheal" is absurd.  Whenever I watch a Youtube video by a guy named Michael (which is weirdly specific but like, seems to pop up pretty frequently?) I swear half the comments are referencing some mythical person named "Micheal" who doesn't exist.
I'm too dyslexic to notice half the time
It's largely genuine error. There's a few common ones: Melania, Mogh,  and Malekith are the three I see misspelled most often.
    Atlus
        Bro it's obvious though, I know it's altus, but I truly believe it's an anagram and homage to Atlus, the publisher of many a niche but usually awesome game .

Ogre Battle was the first nuke Atlus unleashed in the snes days, one of my all time favorite games.

Also Atlus published demons souls here in the west originally, so um, without Atlus there would be no souls games.

At least that's my theory
            Altus is latin for high. As spanish comes from latin, many words sounds similar.

\[Latin\] \[Spanish\] \[English\]

Altus - Alto - High

Tres - Tres - Three

Duo - Dos - Two

Unus - Uno - One

Nihil - Nada - Nothing \[Zero doesn't exist in latin\]

NIHIL

NIHIIIIL!!!
                Nullus, nulla, nullum.
                I I did know that, what I'm saying is are you trying to say is that it couldn't possibly have been chosen for both meanings?
            I love it.

Interestingly enough, Altus means high in Latin.
            Nah, Altus means high. It's literally just the high plateau
                Damn wish I was
    It took me a lot longer than it should to realise its written moGh

Apparently the fact i didn't realise it was written mogh was enough to downvote me,lol
        >Apparently the fact i didn't realise it was written mogh was enough to downvote me,lol

Probably because it's written Mohg, not Mogh

Edit: Whoever downvoted me for being correct, here you go https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mohg,+Lord+of+Blood
            And i am stating how in coment previous to mine it took me a while to see it was written moGh i never stated it was mogh in game i am not stupid
                No you're just bad at communicating then, because it sounds like you're agreeing with the incorrect spelling. 

Edit: Downvote me all you want, the fact that your original comment is at -4 proves my point.
                    I think you're bad at reading if anything,i just said how it took me a lot longer to realise it was written moGh after PFFT why would the first comment have the context for the latter ones after all
                        I assure you you aren't being as clear as you think you are.
I had to re read your comment before I understood the name was written the wrong way.
....yall seeing this shit? Dude copy and pasted the last sentence of a comment further up thread. 

Bot activity?
Fingers crossed for a Miriel Helm in DLC
    Monkey paw curls and you have to kill Miriel to get this helmet.
Ah, the Albinauric Helm gotcha. Thank you.
That's not how it....


Yes. You're right. Pats head*
MAY CHAAAAOS. TAKE. THE WOOoOORld
That moment when killing Melenia is profitable. Dude made easily $5000 from all the donations that rolled in after the kill
    If I were him I'd put it on my CV lol. Payable skill: beat Malenia.
She did that in a lot of the fights on the first rot bomb of the second phase. I’ve never seen it before but it might be a multiplayer thing. But I noticed it each time because it was so weird. As far as Malenia cheating though, that’s 100% her personality to avoid defeat. She did it with Rahdan and I think that was the message of Millicent’s quest.
    I thought that was from lag.
    She didn't cheat vs Radahn lol

It was a stalemate then she lost control

Also wtf is cheating in a fight to the death between demigods where one is a warlord just trying to kill you cause he can?
        I wouldn't say anything is cheating in a war but Malenia was the one who brought her army to Caelid so your last statement is false
        Do we actually know why that clash happened?  
I would assume the redmane knights are the natives of Caelid?
        >It was a stalemate then she lost control

Looked like she lost an arm and was stabbed by a massive sword, while landing nothing on Radahn. How's that a stalemate?
            &#x200B;

ill take the word of the actual game over Radahn simps on reddit tyvm. the game literally explicitly tells us it was a draw even before she bloomed. multiple times.
                You can take whatever you want, the trailer says you're wrong lol.
I don’t understand “power slides in Scarlett aeonia”
    I wasn't there, but if I'm understanding correctly he's saying that she slid across the room while in the Scarlet Aeonia flower.
        And that usually that doesn’t happen? (I haven’t fought her yet)
            Nope. Normally she does the attack and just sits there for a bit. Doesn't normally start sliding across the room.
            It only happens in coop because lag.
    This happens when your pc thinks the ai is targeting one guy, but it's actually targeting you on the host's screen. Basically, from your perspective M will fly over and land near one guy, then the flower will skate across the ground towards you at mach 500 and explode. You need to act like she's targeting you beforehand, then you can dodge it
        That makes a lot of sense

Thank you
I fucking love Roderika. She was my favorite NPC. She was so sweet.
    I feel so bad for her at the end, she has to sit there and watch Hewg deteriorate, and she's always so disappointed when she sees us and knows we are just there for her services, not for her.  "Oh, you are here for spirit tuning, I see..."
If I remember correctly, you have the map but not the graces.
    Going through Elphael again is much more daunting for me than Malenia herself.
        Yeah, that place is painful.
As the other person said, you have the map, but not the graces... you also have to activate the summoning pools again
> stunlock you to death

I can already see the next patch: 

>removed Malenia's healing when it wasn't intended

> accidentally added 3 revenants to the Malenia boss arena.
    :D
>At least with Isshin Sword Saint in Sekiro you could learn the patterns

If one can't learn the patterns with Malenia then how come many of us solo her consistently? Sounds like you need to git gud
Haha it’s actually me. Sorry to hear you were disappointed
    WAIT WHAT OMG.
NONONONONO.
I'm not disappointed in the slightest. You did very good. I genuinely didn't think I would meet you 😭
I was just being dumb. Don't worry about it. You did very good, and I respect your effort and skill :)
        Nah it’s totally cool. My goal is definitely to help people out who are frustrated or stuck for a long time but I figured along the way there would be some who felt the way you do
            Yeah. That's very kind of you. When I saw your name I wanted to respect and. And I did, tbh I genuinely didn't think I would see you again. You are really good, keep up the good work :))
Malenia.
    Yeah you wanna be careful talking about killing Melania that could get you a visit from the secret service

Who the fuck just has a thousand bucks to donate to a random guy streaming? That's wild
    A few people, Bandai and a few YouTubers were watching as well. He’s also not really a “random” either.
        Yeah, he's become sort of internet famous at this point. Anyone loosely following the game has probably heard of him *somewhere*. Popped up in a completely unrelated conversation at school as well.
        Bandai were watching? Did they mention/stream it?
    Rich gamers exist
    people donated 1000 in currencies other than usd, i dont think anyone actually dropped 1000 dollars, there were quite a few 100 dollar ones though
    I see you have never heard of Twitch
    I considered dropping 1k on the kill. Bills told me "not today," though.

I take it you're not familiar with Twitch Streamers? I've seen multiple 1,000 - 2,000+ donos (or even more) for really popular Streamers (Maximilian comes to mind).

There are literal oil princes who fund these people. They're just the current day's form of TV stars, really.

    He/she/we
Like anything it was good timing and luck.  Same reason movie stars get popular.
Meanwhile people who no hit the entire games get barely any recognition compared to this. Go figure.

"He deserves our respect"  


"He's a legend"  


Those people are not just "memeing" they are being 100% serious and you know it.
        Aaaah, yes, writings on the internet, the famous medium that is always 100% factual.
I am FeMalenia, maid of Bliquella… not only have I heard and read it hundreds of times but my mind eventually twisted it too.
    IRON MALENIA
Maybe they have mentally blocked the name from their mind.
Yeah, it's Melanoma
They summoned LMSH first try so they never heard :)
not me, I cheese her every time lol
So that is why she keeps repeating her name.
It's probably auto correcting
    Me, who can just click the word with the red line if I misspell something like a normal person: y tho?
        Well it's not gonna red line an actual word. Melania and Malenia aren't gonna give red lines. And if your using swipe is even more of a pain if you don't notice after the post.
            I meant that there's no reason to use auto-correct. It's just a crutch that doesn't work half the time. Use proper grammar, lest I part thee in twain.
                Isn't grammar the proper structure of sentences and orthography the usage of correct spelling?
                    Yes. If you look at those sentences, they lack proper structure.
                We're both saying the same then. Most the time auto correct doesn't work. It'll give you the wrong word.. so it's probably one reason.
                    Ye
Atlus
    Bro it's obvious though, I know it's altus, but I truly believe it's an anagram and homage to Atlus, the publisher of many a niche but usually awesome game .

Ogre Battle was the first nuke Atlus unleashed in the snes days, one of my all time favorite games.

Also Atlus published demons souls here in the west originally, so um, without Atlus there would be no souls games.

At least that's my theory
        Altus is latin for high. As spanish comes from latin, many words sounds similar.

\[Latin\] \[Spanish\] \[English\]

Altus - Alto - High

Tres - Tres - Three

Duo - Dos - Two

Unus - Uno - One

Nihil - Nada - Nothing \[Zero doesn't exist in latin\]

NIHIL

NIHIIIIL!!!
            Nullus, nulla, nullum.
            I I did know that, what I'm saying is are you trying to say is that it couldn't possibly have been chosen for both meanings?
        I love it.

Interestingly enough, Altus means high in Latin.
        Nah, Altus means high. It's literally just the high plateau
            Damn wish I was
It took me a lot longer than it should to realise its written moGh

Apparently the fact i didn't realise it was written mogh was enough to downvote me,lol
    >Apparently the fact i didn't realise it was written mogh was enough to downvote me,lol

Probably because it's written Mohg, not Mogh

Edit: Whoever downvoted me for being correct, here you go https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mohg,+Lord+of+Blood
        And i am stating how in coment previous to mine it took me a while to see it was written moGh i never stated it was mogh in game i am not stupid
            No you're just bad at communicating then, because it sounds like you're agreeing with the incorrect spelling. 

Edit: Downvote me all you want, the fact that your original comment is at -4 proves my point.
                I think you're bad at reading if anything,i just said how it took me a lot longer to realise it was written moGh after PFFT why would the first comment have the context for the latter ones after all
                    I assure you you aren't being as clear as you think you are.
Monkey paw curls and you have to kill Miriel to get this helmet.
If I were him I'd put it on my CV lol. Payable skill: beat Malenia.
I thought that was from lag.
She didn't cheat vs Radahn lol

It was a stalemate then she lost control

Also wtf is cheating in a fight to the death between demigods where one is a warlord just trying to kill you cause he can?
    I wouldn't say anything is cheating in a war but Malenia was the one who brought her army to Caelid so your last statement is false
    Do we actually know why that clash happened?  
I would assume the redmane knights are the natives of Caelid?
    >It was a stalemate then she lost control

Looked like she lost an arm and was stabbed by a massive sword, while landing nothing on Radahn. How's that a stalemate?
        &#x200B;

ill take the word of the actual game over Radahn simps on reddit tyvm. the game literally explicitly tells us it was a draw even before she bloomed. multiple times.
            You can take whatever you want, the trailer says you're wrong lol.
I wasn't there, but if I'm understanding correctly he's saying that she slid across the room while in the Scarlet Aeonia flower.
    And that usually that doesn’t happen? (I haven’t fought her yet)
        Nope. Normally she does the attack and just sits there for a bit. Doesn't normally start sliding across the room.
        It only happens in coop because lag.
This happens when your pc thinks the ai is targeting one guy, but it's actually targeting you on the host's screen. Basically, from your perspective M will fly over and land near one guy, then the flower will skate across the ground towards you at mach 500 and explode. You need to act like she's targeting you beforehand, then you can dodge it
    That makes a lot of sense

Thank you
I feel so bad for her at the end, she has to sit there and watch Hewg deteriorate, and she's always so disappointed when she sees us and knows we are just there for her services, not for her.  "Oh, you are here for spirit tuning, I see..."
Going through Elphael again is much more daunting for me than Malenia herself.
    Yeah, that place is painful.
:D
WAIT WHAT OMG.
NONONONONO.
I'm not disappointed in the slightest. You did very good. I genuinely didn't think I would meet you 😭
I was just being dumb. Don't worry about it. You did very good, and I respect your effort and skill :)
    Nah it’s totally cool. My goal is definitely to help people out who are frustrated or stuck for a long time but I figured along the way there would be some who felt the way you do
        Yeah. That's very kind of you. When I saw your name I wanted to respect and. And I did, tbh I genuinely didn't think I would see you again. You are really good, keep up the good work :))
Yeah you wanna be careful talking about killing Melania that could get you a visit from the secret service
when i made that comment it was a couple hours ago
Hearsay!
🤡
A few people, Bandai and a few YouTubers were watching as well. He’s also not really a “random” either.
    Yeah, he's become sort of internet famous at this point. Anyone loosely following the game has probably heard of him *somewhere*. Popped up in a completely unrelated conversation at school as well.
    Bandai were watching? Did they mention/stream it?
Rich gamers exist
people donated 1000 in currencies other than usd, i dont think anyone actually dropped 1000 dollars, there were quite a few 100 dollar ones though
I see you have never heard of Twitch
I considered dropping 1k on the kill. Bills told me "not today," though.

I take it you're not familiar with Twitch Streamers? I've seen multiple 1,000 - 2,000+ donos (or even more) for really popular Streamers (Maximilian comes to mind).

There are literal oil princes who fund these people. They're just the current day's form of TV stars, really.
He/she/we
ye, even fucking PewDiePie did it and noone cares. but some random nobody with a haha jar on head naked man solos malenia with two strongest katanas in the game, and everyone loses their shit. pathetic really.

edit: PewDiePie did no deaths run, not no hit. Otzdarva did no hit on ds2 tho and that's most impressive to me by far.
    The happy hob did the entire soulsborne series (minus ER iirc) no hit consecutively. That’s absolutely insane compared to soloing malenia
    he's elevated to mythic status because of a word of mouth cult of personality that has been created by his consistent interaction *with* the community and if you can't figure that out then you're probably confused by most things.

happyhob sat in a room alone chasing his own ego, lmsh *helps 1000 other individual players* in a one on one interaction and you're absolutely shocked to see one guy is more popular than the other.
        Not worth the effort trying to reason with people that get upset over what content they’re seeing on a subreddit.


If they can’t understand the concept of just ignoring/downvoting posts they don’t like and moving on with their days, they’re terminally online and won’t be reasoned with.
    Graceless e-Flamer.  

What is thy business with these memes?  

Let Me Solo Her, the Yeeted.  The twin prodigies, Let Her Solo Me and Let Me Date Her.  General Let Me Watch.  Lunar Princess Let Me Solo Me.  

Thy kind are all of a piece. Wilful Karens, all. Emboldened by the flame of shitty PewDiePie streams.  Have it writ upon thy meagre grave: "Felled by King LMSH!  Last of all kings."
        Comparing this fool to Morgott is insulting

No hit is already a tiresome circlejerk. Stealing clout away from the chasers is a good thing.
    What? Beating the entire game without getting hit is far more praiseworthy and interesting than killing the same boss in a mundane way over and over again
        Says who exactly? 

No hit is oversaturated and played out at this point. People are getting tried of "world's first" clout chasers.
            I don't really think enough people have done a no-hit run for it to be even close to oversaturated or played out. I'm only aware of a single one, but there's probably a couple more considering ER's popularity

>People are getting tried of "world's first" clout chasers.

Says who exactly?
    Your parents are related by blood, aren't they?
        Average hitless fan. Rabid and always quick to the insults.
            So yes then.
well, that guy sat in a room alone and didn't help anybody else meanwhile the entire point of LMSH's "career" is too assist other people and interact with them, directly, on a one-to-one basis.

1000 times, he has done this.

I can also show you that the music of Necrophagist is significantly more technically demanding than whatever is on the top 40, but you've probably never ever ever ever ever heard of Necrophagist, have you?

similar principles enacted
    Yeah I'm not reading that, man.
        [removed]
            Mad.
                oh, I'll never recover
true, the amount of circlejerk on this sub been insane and by far worst of all souls subs I've been into.
    I wanna make sure that I’m not shitting on LMSH for just being good at near consistently beating her, she IS a pretty difficult fight. I don’t wanna put that down. But I dunno, it’s hard for me to be impressed when he’s using bleed based dual katana weapons, quite literally one of, if not, the best weapon setups in the game’s meta.



And I really don’t wanna legit sound like a contraction elitist prick, I really don’t. But I agree—the circlejerk here and everywhere online tbh in some communities is unbearable. And as someone that likes Malenia’s lore and character, not even fucking in love with her, March and most of April were fucking awful since it was just constant bashing of her that I don’t think I’ve seen with any other character in the Souls games.



Im sorry for the random venting rant. Could be I’m a petty simp bitch or whatever . I feel like the phenomenon of LMSH’s popularity is just weird.
        I agree with everything you said wholeheartedly, my thoughts exactly. there is nothing impressive about soloing her with not only bleed build but strongest katanas in the game.
        Bleed AND frost all while having phantom lag bailing him out of the actually difficult dodge timing

End of the day hes just a competant phantom who had a gimmick and got elevated by all the people who convinced themselves malenia is some outrageously difficult and frustrating fight when it's not even one of the hardest or most annoying fights in the series.

There's also a lot of gamer(tm) hate towards Malenia, but at least LMSH is one of the least toxic ways of venting annoyance at her I've seen lmao. Complaining about the mechanics of the fight isn't enough, gotta talk about having sex with her or draw her being raped which im sure would 100% also happen if she were male /s
        I think he can even solo her level 1. Probably The only reason I believe he is using the dual bleed katanas is because otherwise the fights will drag on too long.
            If he’s gonna keep being upheld as a legend in this fanbase for however long it is, I’d like to see some variety from him. Again, I know I’m being a bit of a prick about this, but I legitimately can’t see his appeal when there are thousands of other players that go unnoticed. I’m more impressed with Ongbal since he showcases in multiple ways how good he is against Malenia and the rest of the game with the different weapons and tools and builds and parries he uses.



EDIT: also aren’t his fights with her usually long? He always runs back and baits outs attacks that he knows he can punish, prove a status effect, and then runs back again to repeat
                They don't fully understand the fight is why it drags on so long. They don't take advantage of all the safe openings, entirely rely on basically jumping attacks and they don't know the correct dodges.

The only reason people think they're actually good is because the average player on this sub is *even worse* than they are.
            You're joking right? His dodges are terrible. If they were to fight malenia as a host they would get destroyed. They're taking advantage of latency and the easier dodges that come with it. 

There's a reason they've not uploaded a video of them flawlessly fighting them as a solo host.
                Idk man at this point I think he can beat Malenia flawless most of the time. He does say the time that he gets hit is mostly due to connection lag. 

I agree it's not like the most amazing thing in the game. I mean the no hit- runs are way more impressive than this and respect the abilities of those people more.
                    You didn't read what I said. His dodges are TERRIBLE. He is only not getting hit because he is a phantom and benefitting from latency. I know because I've fought her a stupid number of times as a phantom and doing solo hitless runs using a save-state with different weapons.

Best example is every single waterfowl dance would kill him with the way they're dodging it. It only works as a phantom and the move is stupidly easy to dodge as a phantom. They conveniently don't mention the fact that latency actually makes the fight a hell of a lot easier for phantoms compared to hosts because that would make them look worse.
no i don't think i will
Does nobody remember the stupid origins of this sub? It's meme worship all the way down

Yeah. That's very kind of you. When I saw your name I wanted to respect and. And I did, tbh I genuinely didn't think I would see you again. You are really good, keep up the good work :))
Not worth the effort trying to reason with people that get upset over what content they’re seeing on a subreddit.


If they can’t understand the concept of just ignoring/downvoting posts they don’t like and moving on with their days, they’re terminally online and won’t be reasoned with.
Comparing this fool to Morgott is insulting
    Graceless e-Flamer.

What is thy business with these memes?

Let Me Solo Her, the Yeeted. The twin prodigies, Let Her Solo Me and Let Me Date Her. General Let Me Watch. Lunar Princess Let Me Solo Me.

Thy kind are all of a piece. Wilful Karens, all. Emboldened by the flame of shitty PewDiePie streams. Have it writ upon thy meagre grave: "Felled by King LMSH! Last of all kings."
Says who exactly? 

No hit is oversaturated and played out at this point. People are getting tried of "world's first" clout chasers.
    I don't really think enough people have done a no-hit run for it to be even close to oversaturated or played out. I'm only aware of a single one, but there's probably a couple more considering ER's popularity

Average hitless fan. Rabid and always quick to the insults.
    So yes then.

    Mad.
        oh, I'll never recover
I agree with everything you said wholeheartedly, my thoughts exactly. there is nothing impressive about soloing her with not only bleed build but strongest katanas in the game.
Bleed AND frost all while having phantom lag bailing him out of the actually difficult dodge timing

End of the day hes just a competant phantom who had a gimmick and got elevated by all the people who convinced themselves malenia is some outrageously difficult and frustrating fight when it's not even one of the hardest or most annoying fights in the series.

There's also a lot of gamer(tm) hate towards Malenia, but at least LMSH is one of the least toxic ways of venting annoyance at her I've seen lmao. Complaining about the mechanics of the fight isn't enough, gotta talk about having sex with her or draw her being raped which im sure would 100% also happen if she were male /s
I think he can even solo her level 1. Probably The only reason I believe he is using the dual bleed katanas is because otherwise the fights will drag on too long.
    If he’s gonna keep being upheld as a legend in this fanbase for however long it is, I’d like to see some variety from him. Again, I know I’m being a bit of a prick about this, but I legitimately can’t see his appeal when there are thousands of other players that go unnoticed. I’m more impressed with Ongbal since he showcases in multiple ways how good he is against Malenia and the rest of the game with the different weapons and tools and builds and parries he uses.



EDIT: also aren’t his fights with her usually long? He always runs back and baits outs attacks that he knows he can punish, prove a status effect, and then runs back again to repeat
        They don't fully understand the fight is why it drags on so long. They don't take advantage of all the safe openings, entirely rely on basically jumping attacks and they don't know the correct dodges.

The only reason people think they're actually good is because the average player on this sub is *even worse* than they are.
    You're joking right? His dodges are terrible. If they were to fight malenia as a host they would get destroyed. They're taking advantage of latency and the easier dodges that come with it. 

There's a reason they've not uploaded a video of them flawlessly fighting them as a solo host.
        Idk man at this point I think he can beat Malenia flawless most of the time. He does say the time that he gets hit is mostly due to connection lag. 

I agree it's not like the most amazing thing in the game. I mean the no hit- runs are way more impressive than this and respect the abilities of those people more.
            You didn't read what I said. His dodges are TERRIBLE. He is only not getting hit because he is a phantom and benefitting from latency. I know because I've fought her a stupid number of times as a phantom and doing solo hitless runs using a save-state with different weapons.

Best example is every single waterfowl dance would kill him with the way they're dodging it. It only works as a phantom and the move is stupidly easy to dodge as a phantom. They conveniently don't mention the fact that latency actually makes the fight a hell of a lot easier for phantoms compared to hosts because that would make them look worse.
I meant that there's no reason to use auto-correct. It's just a crutch that doesn't work half the time. Use proper grammar, lest I part thee in twain.
    Isn't grammar the proper structure of sentences and orthography the usage of correct spelling?
        Yes. If you look at those sentences, they lack proper structure.
    We're both saying the same then. Most the time auto correct doesn't work. It'll give you the wrong word.. so it's probably one reason.
        Ye
Nullus, nulla, nullum.
I I did know that, what I'm saying is are you trying to say is that it couldn't possibly have been chosen for both meanings?
Damn wish I was
No you're just bad at communicating then, because it sounds like you're agreeing with the incorrect spelling. 

Edit: Downvote me all you want, the fact that your original comment is at -4 proves my point.
    I think you're bad at reading if anything,i just said how it took me a lot longer to realise it was written moGh after PFFT why would the first comment have the context for the latter ones after all
        I assure you you aren't being as clear as you think you are.
You can take whatever you want, the trailer says you're wrong lol.
