[[Miyazaki the ultimate underseller]]





Yeah I’d be surprised  if it’s not 40+ hours of content
    Not to mention the hundreds of additional hours you might get simply from enjoying the base game but with a dlc weapon that makes it feel fresh
        I have 700 hours and I’m still not bored of the base games weapons. I’m so hyped
            Same, this is one of my main excitement points. The game is still drawing me back to it with new builds i havent tried yet, and now were getting so many new weapons and even new weapon types? And new enemies to test all of it on? Man, im hyped as well
                Going to do another playthrough after a year long break today, any wacky fun builds you'd recommend?
                    depends on what you've already done

powerstanced Great Hammers on a pure str/end build was probably my favorite. but it means farming the duelists outside the lyendell colosseum for a second hammer. (the brick hammer in stormveil is good for the first)

it's probably not as "good" as a giant crusher or GUGS build, but it's fun

i also had a lot of fun powerstancing the DMGS and Helphen's Steeple, because you look pretty cool when you have both AOWs active. Plus you can still be a very good caster, you'll be pretty limited on armor choices though.

edit: if you can't tell i think powerstancing weapons is really fun and you should try it if you haven't on past playthroughs

edit 2: dual straight swords is actually really fun as well. square off is the most underrated skill in the game, because no one uses straight swords after the first hour unless it's a SONAF build.
                        Great Mace is also a free pickup in a chest before the Grand Lift of Dectus, middle of that camp near the siege weapons.

You can also get two Great Stars now in Altus Plateau, free bleed and heal on hit. There's one in the caravan on the Road of Iniquity Side Path and one at the Writheblood Ruins when you progress Varré's quest to where he gives bloody fingers for invading. A sign for invading Magnus the Beast Claw is around and beating him rewards the second Great Stars.

The Battle Hammer great hammer is my favorite fashion hammer, just sucks you need to farm those Duelists for it but the drop rate isn't horrendous with some boosted item discovery.
                            I was mostly recommending the battle hammer for fashion purposes.

Twin great stars is probably better just bc bleed is so strong.
                                Yeah but fashion is tops therefore Battle Hammer is best! But some might not wanna do that farm so I was giving backup options. Great Stars is one of my faves but it looks horrid with most armor sets lol
                        The duelist greataxe is pretty awesome too, did a stark cosplay with it and the drake knight armor, looked pretty sick
                            i do love obnoxiously heavy dex weapons. hopefully the Exile GS from DS3 makes a return
                        Came here to say that dual straight swords and square off carried me through a RL1 playthrough.  It's fast, strong and fun.  Only downside is that I played for 500 hours before giving straight swords a chance.
                            i thought square off  had to be bugged when i first went back to it. the stance damage is so strong for such a fast and light weapon.
                        I’m using Blaidd’s set with the Raging Wolf helm and it looks pretty lit with the Ghostflame active.  Kind of have a spirit wolf theme going using Latenna’s ashes as well.
                        what's DGMS
                            Dark moon greatsword
                                ohh ok thank you
                                    No worries, hopefully I've convinced you that two glowing magic swords are better than one
                    Wacky is fun, but I'll chime in and say I consistently had best experience (pve and pvp) by going back to the roots. 

Shield and mace. Big bonk colossal. Straight sword and pyro incantations in offhand. These kinds of builds have repeatedly proven to have a very solid core gameplay, with enough room for weaponplay and expression to feel interesting. Ever beat malenia by simply blocking her waterfowl with 2h weapon, or killed an invader by sending them to the moon with Upward Cut, then pointed up? It feels sublime.
                        I killed an invader with Niall's thunder kick, and used crucible horns to knock people over guard rails to fall to their death 🤣


Pvp is fun
                            Yesssss someone else finally mentioned Niall's peg leg! I feel like nobody knows how fun it is.
                                You best believe im making a build all around this new jump kick weapon 
                                    Bonefist 2 hallow boogaloo
                    Faith Lightdiscuss from the Rotspears of Malenias Knights + Magic-Reflection Shield. You shoot your discus, when it returns you reflect it for INSANE dmg. It is hard to pull off, but absolutely fun and satisfying to me.

  
Sorry, i do not remember the actual names :D Think the Spear is the Cleanrot-Spear and has an abysmal dropchance :>
                    Anything combo'd with ARC is good if you know where to look, INT probably is the worst stat to combo with right now as you just have bubble spells which are okay but definitely weird. ARC/FTH for dragon communion incantations. DEX/ARC for bleed weapons like Rivers of Blood, Eleonoras Poleblade, Godskin Peeler. STR/ARC for Mohg Spear and even the Marais Executioner Sword, plus any weapons with innate Bleed are amazing for ARC as you can put Occult affinity on them for good damage and better bleed both, it's a great pure ARC affinity.

FTH can do everything too, pairs well with all stats and lets you do a variety of builds.
                    It's a long time to get going, but a Frenzy build is crazy. Not good, but crazy.
                    my current playthrough is naked with the large club. nothing like running around killing gods in a loincloth with a big stick
                    I recommend either going wacky heal focused faith build with the heal on hit weapons and blasphemous blade focused with great stars secondaries

- key focus is on the healing vs maxing damage with it.

Or 

Ultimate use everything build ready for DLC
Focus on getting all stats to 20-25 via both levels and items

Only level vigor, endurance etc for equip load, with a lil of fp leveling.

Go into DLC being able to test out anything you pickup
                Same lol said I was gonna replay it after beating it after about 2 months came back and beat it like 3 times lol
            But club go bonk
                but maybe new DLC club so we can bonk twice at once
                    *Unga Bunga intensifies*
                        one bonk good, so two bonks better!
            Yea man, experimenting different kinds of weapons are my go to, even fully upgrading all of em (60% progress of leveling all weapons)
        Im 100% doing all NG+ with the karate moveset
        It's also an endgame dlc so you'll probably want to go through NG+ once or twice with lots of shiny new toys. Amount of hours expected for play is deceiving in a souls game, usually in the players favor.
        Someone pointed out that the weapon they do the crucible move with is an actual shield weapon and I'm so excited
            Maybe its an ash of war you can put on anything
        Finally going to bonk elden beast with some martial arts
            We can finally kick runebears in the nuts
        Fuck me, the dickriding is insane. People like you piss me off and are the reason why the gaming industry is as shit as it is. Have some standards ffs
            Shut up loser
    100+ hours of poison swamp, with sleep this time.
        The sleep swamp is just math class
        And deathblight
    It absolutely needs to be to justify the price tag. This DLC costs 70% of the game.
        2.5 years development work on a 10/10 platform of a game. I bet it's freaking massive! But ya, if ER had 80 bosses the dlc needs at least 50 new ones.
    It's the highest priced DLC we've ever gotten in Souls, so I'm betting you're right with that estimate. FromSoft never price gouges just for the starpower of their developer name, it always reflects the amount of content in the DLC.

Not to mention, this is by far the longest development cycle for any of their DLCs as well.

We're gonna be eatin' good.
        Myazaki also said this is the biggest DLC they have ever made.
        This means they’ll finally get around to the sekiro dlc right
    I mean, let's be realistic:

10 bosses can, for example, be as simple as Tree Sentinel, Night's Cavalry, Agheel, Pumpkinhead duo, Margit, an Erdtree Avatar, an Erdtree Wiggly Worm, Godrick and an Erdtree Burial Guardian. So imagine the content traversed to reach them.

Or another example that's easier to place in terms of gameplay time: Radagon/Elden Beast, Godfrey, Gideon, Maliketh, Draconic Knight, Godskin Duo, Fire Giant, Spiritcaller Snail (with Godskin duo), Borealis, and a Death Rite Bird.

The latter example is probably a bit better, because if it's just 10 bosses, it's far more likely the DLC is structured in such a way that we're intended to see most along our "linear" journey (linear in terms of progress, not in terms of exploration) with only 1-2 being more hidden, potentially.

So IMO, we can imagine a gameplay space similar to the Mountaintop of Giants and beyond. The endgame has an abnormally dense rate of bosses, so if we account for that, Mountaintop and beyond pretty much what we get. This is less concerned with exact land mass size and instead concerned with how they typically space out their bosses.
        I imagine we're getting 10 or more unique bosses. DLCs tend to have lots of high quality bosses relative to the actual size of the DLC, so hopefully it's 10 or more remembrance bosses.
            I wouldn't needlessly hype ourselves up like that.

10 unique bosses? Yes.

"Akshually there's more than 10 and they meant just 10 uniques?" No.

The only thing worth noting is that *world* bosses can be significant without necessarily being bosses. Golems for example are not actual bosses (ok once, as a beginner boss for one earlygame cave) but are still a significant fight. From the trailer alone, I could see the hippo, lion and wicker man all being world "bosses" or significant enemies and not adding to the boss count.
                Miyazaki said at least 10 bosses. That was the wording. And I can't imagine it would be anything but new bosses.

The quality of the bosses is still unknown. I'm hoping for Remembrance level bosses. BB and DS3's DLCs had lots of high quality bosses. Considering Shadow of the Erdtree is a way bigger DLC than any of those I'd expect nothing less than 5 Remembrance tier bosses.
                didnt miyazaki literally say more than 10 nee bosses? lmao
        It's definitely more than just 10 bosses. I count at least 8 enemies that are definitely bosses, and a few more that are probably bosses.

1. Wicker man

2. Lion Dancers

3. Messmer

4. The Twinblade Knight that gets kicked (Looks like boss arena, fogwall in the background, has the twinblade used at the end of the trailer)

5. Gravity lance boar rider

6. Hippo-porcupine

7. The thing riding the half dissolved horse

8. The dude pulling the sword out of himself

And maybe bosses: 

1. The Nox/Carian person

2. Leech snake thing (honestly not too sure about this one)

2. The three things the reverse grip sword user fights (looks like a boss arena)

3. The red dancer lady
            Twin blade knight feels like a Soldier of Godrick situation to me. His design is too basic to be a unique, 1 and done boss. I imagine after this fight he’ll appear more commonly as a regular mob. So I wouldn’t count him personally
                I agree he doesn't look like boss material. I wouldn't think he was a boss either if it wasn't for the very obvious boss room he's placed in. However, I also don't think it makes sense for him to be a Soldier of Godrick type boss. Soldier of Godrick is a tutorial boss. The DLC is tuned for endgame, and is locked behind Mohg and Radahn, that's rather far into the game for a single generic looking knight to be a boss. 


I think it's much more likely that he's *not* the boss, but is a part of a larger boss fight, like the soldiers Niall summons.
                    Could also be a "enemy outside the boss room" situation. But yeah i hope future interviews give some clarification on that metric. Ideally, they're 10+ remembrance calibur bosses/bosses too unique to show up twice. It would fit the pricing at least. 2/3 the price of the game and 2/3 the number of remembrance bosses. 

&#x200B;

No way did they reveal about 8 of the at least 11 bosses in the first trailer unless the boss number is 15 or more i hope.
    It better be because im spending 50 bucks on it
    I just hope the price tag is fully justified, whether it's 30 hours packed with insane content, or 60 hours packed with similarly good content.
    For the price of the whole game in my region, it should be.
    For that long wait I’ll hope for Michael Zaki that it is indeed over 40 hrs…
Technically, the entire Elden Ring map is "bigger then Limgrave", so....
     No that’s red Limgrave, snowy Limgrave, dark Limgrave, buried Limgrave, all is limgrave
        Wait, it’s all limgrave?
            Always has been
                limgrave deez nuts
                    Got em
            It's all Limgrave except for the Haligtree, which is only not Limgrave because Limgrave doesn't know how to get there to annex it (they can't look out up because they don't have Internet access)
            Other than the part that is Ohio
                And Australia
        You can definitely map out all the graves ive made for myself all over the Lands Between
        Damn, true, my bad...
            Under Limgrave, all things converge.
                yessir
                    What kind of fool do you take me for? He's Limgrave, he's Limgrave, you're Limgrave... I'm Limgrave! Are there any other Limb-graves I should know about?!
                        Floating limgrave ……
                        Hi Limgrave,

Please meet my friend Limgrave,

Yours Limgravely,

Limgrave
                        Would the real Limgrave please stand up
        Kenneth Haight, supreme ruler of all creation
        Don’t forget about wet Limgrave!
            Of course of course and wet limgrave
        dont forget golden limgrave!
        And Broken Limgrave
        Limgrave beyond time, alternative tree Limgrave, and the other Limgrave that no one talks about
    I remember when the map was just scaled to limgrave and thinking "whoa this is pretty decently sized, not bad!"

And then I went south and it was a little bigger "Whoa, more content?!?! Jesus!"

And I got teleported to caelid and the map basically exploding in size and was just awestruck. Man playing the game when it was new and unknown was such a damn treat.
        Then later on finding the teleport to the top of Leyndell. I think at that point my brain just broke.
        Dunkey described this perfectly in his Elden ring video
    Well, he didn't say it's bigger than Limgrave, he said it's slightly bigger than Limgrave.
        Technically, the entire ER map is "slightly bigger" than Limgrave.
    I heard the DLC will take more than a few minutes to complete
Underselling? Na man he expected us all to be much better at the game and finish it in 30 hours. We just all suck and keep dying.
    I was over level 150 the first time I beat the game and some people on here were like “wtf are you doing dude” 🤣

Just killin stuff
        Bro i m 212 before i finished, if i die to a boss 10 times i would go level up 5 or so times then come back try again. Melania got me from like 120 to 190.
            I…uh…missed her in my first play through. 

I actually missed the entire Consecrated Snowfield (and albunaric village) and only went to it to get the Haligdrake Talisman to beat Radagon/Elden Beast
                I missed out on a few things because i literally start choppin at whatever I see, ended up killing a few NPCs like patches and boc.
        150 is pretty standard for a playthrough where explore a bunch tbh
        I was over 200 when I finished the game. Got sidetracked, did a bunch of other stuff, then went to wipe the floor with Maliketh.

…


…

Still got my shit pushed in.
        I just completed my 4th playthrough and I still was almost level 150 when I beat it despite not even trying to be super thorough about exploring literally everything lol. I did use gold fowl feet for bosses to be fair.
        Fk…I’m around 150 and probably died to Elden beast 100 times now…with mimic tear… certified garbage player
            Don't worry about it bro, and don't call yourself garbage. Just keep at it Tarnished! You got this! Don't think about how you fare against others, each of us has different experiences, reactions to things, and most importantly, take in information very differently.
                Haha yea…haven’t enjoyed gaming this much in 10+ years. Never tried this genre before Elden ring. I remember picking it up and giving up after a few hours, came back a month later and here I am now.  Picked up lies of P after I got tired of dying to Elden beast lol, also fun but didn’t hit the same way.
                    Well welcome to the genre! Defo look for older souls titles as those were really good, especially for their time, but stuff like sekiro, dark souls 3 and even bloodborne still hold up to today's standards imo!

Glad to hear you are having a blast!
        This was me too but I did a ton of exploring and wanted to make sure I didn’t miss anything major like Malenia.
        *Coughs in dozens mohgwyn birb massacres*


Edit: my fist play through ended at lvl 278
    The "story" of the game is quite short, really. get two Great Runes, get to Altus somehow, get into the city and then it's a linear path to the end if you want it to be. The vast majority of the game is completely optional.
    I have so many fucking hours and I’ve made probably 20-30 characters and still haven’t beaten it yet. I have so many ways i want to play and i can’t get enough of just one playstyle. Also souls games character creator is top tier
    I guess it also depends on how much side stuff you do. Cause technically you could skip out all of Caelid (besides maybe Radahn), all the underground stuff, Malenia/ haligtree, smaller dungeons such as Caria Manor, etc

If we skipped out all that it probably would be closer to 30 hrs, but then we would feel pretty under levelled the entire game, so we would have to be even more skilled 😅
Keep in mind Limgrave is actually pretty big. Stormveil, Weeping Peninsula, and a good bit of land west of Caelid all belong to Limgrave. Heck, you can even argue Sofria counts too. It just feels smaller with it having clearly defined roads and wide open spaces. Depending on how the land is shaped, this DLC could be utterly massive.
    Not only that. 

He stated that the World will be as big if not a bit bigger than Limgrave 

AND he said there will be multiple Legacy Dungeons (lets just assume 2 because of different translations) and multiple smaller Legacys (probably like castle morne). Limgrave only had one of each. 

He also said something about a new kind of dungeons, that are more interconnected to the world. We just don't know if that just referes to the already mentioned ones or if that add on top of those.
        AFAIK Lower Sofria River is called "Limgrave Misc." in the game files for difficulty scaling.

however the rest of Siofra like Mogywyn Palace and Nokron have their own names in the area scalings
        I thinks the new dungeon type he was talking about thats more, to paraphrase, "integrated into the overworld" will be an elaboration of the ruins. So instead of each Ruin just having 1 boss room/chest room, they'll have a couple, perhaps interconnected underground, and will be bigger.
        > new kind of dungeons, that are more interconnected to the world

I swear, if I end up in Blackreach again...
        so is the DLC more game than the base game?
            No. It is still smaller than the base game. But even more dense. So from what he said we can assume more content that the size of the map will make it seem. So more Game than limgrave
                My guess would maybe be… 1/4th or 1/3rd of the base game in terms of content?

Seeing as Elden Ring has 6 legacy dungeons and this dlc will have at least 2, it’s definitely going to be jam packed with content.
    It's also a beginner area and hence has a flatter terrain. There is a lot more verticality in the Shadow realm also that castle in the trailer looks a shit ton bigger than Stormveil or my eyes maybe deceiving me. Dlc has 10+ endgame boss. DLC is gonna have a lot more quality over quantity.
    Also keep in mind that size isnt all.

For example starfied is definetly bigger than limgrave, but that doesnt mean that all of those empty planets are as good as limgrave...
        They said they wanted to make it more dense so a Limgrave sized area with about twice or three times as much to do in it is... a lot.
            *runs away from problem straight into open mouth of other problem*
            More dense? I can see how you can save on some longer roads, but besides that the game was already pretty close packed. Myazaki what you done this time
                Man, have you not heard the open-world bitchers roaming around whining about the open-world aspects of the game?
                    No. Actually I havent
                        Here's a thread:
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/t30r97/open_world_boring/

You'll find them roaming through the forums randomly stating how they would like elden ring so much more if it wasn't open world.
                            I believe you that they exist. But for real I just didnt have them on my radar. I mean I also like Fromsofts linear Formular more, but I also want them to try stuff out and improve. You cant progress when you stagnate lol
            I'm sure we'll still be left feeling a little bit worse about ourselves for having interacted with anyone at all, with luck.
                what
                    I was saying npc questlines will probably still be sad. Which I like about these games. 

Downvotes gonna downvote though.
        That entire game isn’t as good as Limgrave LMAO.
            I probably spent more hours in Stormveil Castle than in Starfield.
            When after the tutorial that dude was like


"Yeah man I'll just work your grueling manual labor job even though my robot is RIGHT HERE, you take my ship and fly around the galaxy in it ☺️"


I dipped
                You got further than me. I stopped when the game was so consistent and immersive with a story so well connected to the World, that after I woke up from character creation, I was told by the NPC that it makes no sense for me to be there. It was also never mentioned ever at any point after
 The game just accepted that it already broke its World building before the Tutorial came to an end and that is unexcusable.
                that isn’t what happens at all lol
            I liked it for a bit but when gameplay became running back to the 2 human cities to re-buy ammo for the only guns I had worth a fuck while the ammo most peons dropped were for guns that tickled enemies, I got bored fast
        Phantom liberty map was so small compared to the city but damn was it packed
    Also keep in mind that when we all first played the game and thought Limgrave was all there was we were still thinking: Wow this game is big
        Tbh if the DLC is as big and polished as Limgrave, but at an endgame difficulty level, then it would be great. Limgrave was probably the most fun I had in Elden Ring since everything was new, exploration was really rewarding with tons of cool encounters you'd just run into and the quest design was more logical than the rest of the game.
            I didnt find Torrent for probably 3-4 hours, just wondering the countryside taking my time, ducking in and out of trouble, mapping the world, getting my ass kicked. I think I spent 20 hours at least picking apart Limgrave on my first playthrough, excited and terrified of what horrible surprise would come next (after discovering the caelid trap chest lol)... couldn't believe how massive the game ended up being. Hope to get that same feeling of awe and discovery in the DLC
    Siofra has its own region banner so the developers probably don't count Siofra as part of Limgrave.

Based on the region banners in the game we have 5 overworld and 3 underground regions

1: Limgrave (+ Weeping Peninsula)

2: Liurnia

3: Caelid

4: Altus Plateau (+ Mt. Gelmir + Leyndell)

5: Mountaintops (+ Snowfields)

6: Siofra River (+ Nokron + Mohgwyn Palace)

7: Ainsel River (+ Nokstella + Lake of Rot)

8: Deeproot Depths

Miquella's Haligtree and Crumbling Farum Azula don't seem to belong to any region and I'm thinking that's because they're separate legacy dungeons that you need to teleport to get to.
        I feel so vindicated seeing your comment list every name correctly. People out here really played the game for hundreds of hours but can't spell "Liurnia" or "Siofra", wtf
            People keep spelling Melania and Malekit as if they don't tell you their name after every time you die.
            Dys Lexia the Spellbane continues to be the hardest boss in souls history.
    Is Weeping Peninsula considered part of Limgrave?

I thought it was technically a different area
        I don't think Weeping Peninsula has its own label on the world map, like the major areas have (Limgrave, Caelid, Liurnia, etc.). But that doesn't have to mean anything anyway.
        Yes. Like the Dragonbarrow is still part of Caelid.
    Size matters not. Look at Phantom Liberty. The dogtown map was a tiny portion of Night City but it was wayyy more densely packed. It's all how the content is laid out.
    Does the weeping peninsula count as Limgrave? I was sort of just imagining the main part of Limgrave excluding the peninsula.

If Miyazaki considers Limgrave to include the peninsula, and he says the DLC is slightly bigger than that, then I am HYYYYYYPED
    Weeping Peninsula is a separate location to Limgrave. Technically so is Stormveil. We don't really know what Miyazaki had in mind here.
My first playthriugh I think I beat the game after 130+ hours. Every dungeon, cave, and hero grave, I would explore every nook and cranny. I loved it. Can't wait for the dlc to do the same. I wish I could get amnesia or something and do the main game the same way again.
    I did the same on 3 characters and haven't touched the game in probably a year.

I have been jonesing to do another run but am doing my best to hold off to try to forget where most things are.  Was praying for a march or april release but the longer I wait the fresher I hope the game feels.

Elden ring .5 (DS2) in the meantime!
        Yeah, can’t wait for dark souls II 2 part 2 this june
    Same. I remember being slightly disappointed when it was first announced that it would only take like 30 hours to beat. And then I spent 130 hours on a playthrough and even after 5 full runs with new characters, I’ve yet to finish a run in less than 90 hours.
    Time for bonkus of the konkus
Watch it be like the size of Limgrave, Liurnia and Caelid combined or something insane like that
    It'll be about as big as the [Strider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9XHn33WWHo) from Armor Core 6.
        The scaling of stuff in AC6 is so hilarious to me, everytime I’m in an elevator with a 1000 ft ceiling I’m just like… who TF built this? Lmao

Don’t even get me started on the Coral funnel, literally larger than multiple planets lol
            Yeah the vascular plant is basically the size of Pluto, how tf did Rubicon even build something like that without mining a planet the size of Jupiter for all the raw materials.
                If it’s the size of Pluto, couldn’t they just disassemble a dwarf planet the size of Pluto? Doesn’t seem that crazy.
                    They could, if the planet is composed of 100% metal.
                        Well alright, disassemble a few. There’s more than one dwarf planet in our solar system.

Edit: really the crazy thing seems more how quickly they seemed to do it, rather than that they did it at all.
                I had the exact same thought, but hey, Rule of Cool
        That thing honestly blew my mind.

Hmm i gotta climb some AT-AT / Tallneck thingy? No sweat! 

Then i come face to face with it struggling to boost up this thing. My En barely makes it in a lot of sections. Then you consider our ACs are actually giant robots akin to most buildings..

Strider is YUGE
    Lets not overhype it.
        Exactly and the size shouldn’t be the end all be ball thing anyway. I’ll take an old hunters/ringed city size dlc packed with great content over a huge empty and repetitive open world land mass like base er any day of the week
    Anything smaller than that would surprise me. It took 2 years of development and costs 66% as much as the main game.

I don't need it to be enormous as long as the content is really good, but yeah I except it to be at least as big as the lower plateau.
        To be fair the base game was an insane value relative. I got 100 hours on my first playthrough and now up to 350 even if the base game was $120 it would be more than worth it for me. So $40 for even 10 hours of content is worth it in my book.
    That's what I was expecting. Three main zones of the original map.
    I still think that’s underestimating it tbh
I actually love this advertisement strategy. It means our expectations can only be exceeded.
    It's generally better to underpromise and overdeliver. That strategy leads to amazed, surprised and excited fans, the other way around, they'll be simply content if things go according to the plan, or even disappointed if you ultimately can't deliver on your promises for any reason.
        Yeah u don’t wanna say ‘it’s two times the size of the ER map’ and then it’s the size of Weeping Penninsula
            It doesn't even have to be a false promise… you may have every intention of fulfilling it when you say it, but then you hit development setbacks, cuts or deadlines – or you realize the original vision evolved and you no longer wish to aim for sheer scale, rather do something more interesting in a smaller area – and then you either have to break your promise, or ditch your vision.

So when you “promise” to *definitely* do something in a DLC, it's often already done.
        I’d think most marketing divisions prefer to overpromise, because they can get amazed, surprised and excited fans *early*. That way they’re more likely to boost preorder sales - which management loves - and probably claim their bonuses & celebratory champagne ahead of time.

“You’re worries about the fans & dev team after the game launches? Eh, not *my* KPI”
    as opposed to "the first AAAA game" that is skull and bones
        cyberpunk 77
            Honestly, once they fixed a lot of the bugs and improved some of the optimization and crowd generation, it really did live up to a lot of its promise. It still lacked a few things, but it was largely held back by technical flaws, not lack of content.
            cyberpunk in its current state is right up there in quality with elden ring.
                Man I wish I could get into it. I've tried multiple times now. Maybe it's just too overwhelming for me?
                    Ur talking about cyberpunk?
                        I am.
                            It took me 4 or 5 attempts to finally get into it. If you enjoy the genre and games like it, id say just try to keep going and see if it eventually clicks. Easily atleast an 8/10 game for me. And if it never does click, sobeit, not all games are for everyone.
                                I will try again. I want to love it.
                To me Cyberpunk is no better than Far Cry 5 and nowhere near The Witcher 3 or Elden Ring
Did he actually say it'll be bigger than limgrave?
    The phrasing from [the IGN interview](https://www.ign.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-interview) is:

>It's hard to answer without giving away too much and to a high degree of accuracy, but if you think in terms of scale or size, it's probably comparable, if not larger, than the area of Limgrave from the base game.

The [Eurogamer interview](https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-fromsoftwares-largest-expansion-ever) is similar:

>In terms of pure surface area, you could think of something larger even than Limgrave in the base game.
        Pure Surface area.

What about underground area?
            Asking the right questions.
                Ok Danvers
            It's the size of the entire elden ring map excluding the existing underground areas. The underground map after dlc will be filled like the normal map.
        Thx.

Funny thing is I found that article seconds after I posted this comment!
When it came out I spent like 50 hours in just Limgrave before I went on to Lunaria
    When it released I spent my first 12 hours stuck in that one cave above aeonia swamp, that the one portal chest by dragon Agheel takes you to. And then also aeonia swamp.

Because I didn't realize fast travel from anywhere was possible.
        When it released I got stuck on character creation to this day
            Damn. I couldn't even get past the screen that says "Press any button".
                Where is the any button?
                    Yeah I can't find that either. I really don't want to mess something up by hitting the wrong button, so I've been unable to play the game.
        It’s so funny how our first time that place was like hell and so hard to escape. 

Then yesterday I started a new playthrough and went through it just for shits and giggles and left the cave unscathed and teleported back in probably 3 minutes
            It wasn't bad for me because I found the entrance pretty fast. If you go the wrong way and don't realize you can just leave than yeah it could be rough.
            It's my preferred area to play in now. Wish there was more content there.
        I still remember fighting that star beast at launch after being sent there with the chest from limgrave... took me many hours to beat at like soul level 20 or so XD and I was using a flail, that was rough! Turns out a few patches later they even realised that the ''fully grown'' fallingstar beast was in there, rather than the younger variant. 

One of my proudest moments!
    Literally how is that possible. Were you just walking everywhere and dying 100s of times ?
        You only get 1 first playthrough and I wanted to take my time with it. I checked every corner of the map, killed every boss, then helped another player kill the boss at least once as a summon. Hunted invaders. All solo cuz summoning help isn't fun for me so naturally I would die more often from learning the bosses.
    Yeah same
I beat it around 110-115 hours I think? Missed tons of stuff that I am still discovering on subsequent playthroughs.
    I did it in 60, but that’s probably with 2/3rd of the side stuff being uncompleted. I just wanted to end the suffering lol
What matters is how densely placed actual content is.  I'll be disappointed if it's big and empty like mountaintop, but I have a feeling it's actually going to be more like altis/leyindel from what we've seen
    I mean just looking at the surface in the trailer, I doubt it will be as empty as the mountaintops
    In an interview they stated that the dlc was supposed to be more dense with more intricate level design in the open world.
        Do you know where this was said?
The DLC map seems to have way more content than Limgrave, even if the size is technically the same. Just on the surface alone there are already a bunch of Stormveil sized castles, not to mention all the underground dungeons and potentially areas we havent really seen yet.
He said it's the biggest DLC they have done. If it's bigger than the Ringed City or Artorias of the Abyss, we really have nothing to worry about.
    Ringed city was also less than half the price (and $25 got you both dlcs) so I certainly hope it's much bigger.
Even if it was just roughly The size of Limgrave, From is good about making areas really dense, so you’d still be stumbling over a boss/catacomb/npc every 5 steps.
I could see the map being genuinely "just a little bit larger than Limgrave" as stated, but actually *packed*. Not to say Limgrave isn't packed, but there are areas in Elden Ring that are probably just as big if not bigger than Limgrave but actually have about the same amount of content as Limgrave (despite map size differences) or actually even less than Limgrave. 

So rather than a huge map with a whole lot of nothing, I could see the map being more compact but "full" to the brim - if that makes sense. In the interview, he also seems to imply the "transitions" between dungeons will be more "seemless" too. 

> "This time, we wanted to go more in depth and bring a denser and richer level design, which brings these types of layout together a little more seamlessly," said Miyazaki. "There of course will be large open areas, there of course will be legacy dungeons, but we've also experimented with something a little more in-between these as well to bring a more diverse gameplay experience." 

I think everything will be far better connected and compacted than ever before. 

&nbsp;

Also keep in mind... Underground map is a thing too. Whatever the size the map ends up being...there's always the possibility to go underground, and basically get the same map size...but below the surface this time around.
I mean I can beat the ER main story in like 8ish hours now. But goddamn. Easily put 180 hours on my first playthrough.
    Yeah if you aren't meandering around, you can beat the game pretty fast even if you're not an expert or speedrunner.

I 100% the game in almost exactly 100 hours, and that includes more than one playthrough. Some people just play games faster than others.
    Not sure about a new character, but sometimes, I mindlessly go through NG+ when I'm trying to decompress. Literally only doing required bosses, it takes about 2 hours or more.
He also said "over 10 bosses". Which is ridiculous unless you narrow that down to only a specific subset of bosses, like required story bosses or something. Limgrave alone has 31 bosses and the DLC is supposed to be larger, so even if it has fewer bosses going from over 30 to just over 10 is a huge downgrade. I'd expect it to be around 40 bosses with a "boss health bar" if it really is bigger than Limgrave.
    10+ bosses is still a lot. For comparison both DS3 DLCs combined have 7, DS2's has 9, Bloodborne's has 5, and DS1's has 4. 


If we're getting 40 bosses, that's 15 more than every other game's DLC combined.
        Well that's certainly true, but I guess what I mean to say is that the way Elden Ring is designed, having only like, say, 12 bosses in a region is incongruous with the rest of the game.

Take for example Runebears. There are like 40 in the game, but only one is a "boss", at the end of Earthbore Cave. In a previous Souls game they wouldn't bother making an enemy like a Runebear a full boss, but in Elden Ring they made it a dungeon boss one time. I suppose some people might call that a "mini-boss" but I consider anything with a boss health bar to be a boss.

So when Miyazaki says we're getting just over 10 bosses, I assume we're getting 10 "major" bosses, and that we're getting 20-30 "minor" bosses like field bosses or dungeon bosses. I'm willing to be wrong but I'm just basing my prediction on how the rest of the game is put together.
            Oh for sure I expect a bunch of "mini bosses" scattered around to fill the space.


10-15 main bosses would be pretty much on average for the past DLCs size, so we're eating good.
            I remember someone datamine during colosseum update that they found 30 boss tag or something like that. Could be the case. Or it could be they scrap 30 boss during development maybe.
            Based off of cutscenes alone, I'd say it's 10 bosses with cutscenes, for whatever that is worth. Bosses from the small dungeons and caves don't get cutscenes, so I'm guessing he's not counting those.

If we take everything at face value, this interview could be disappointing. 10 bosses when the main game has 120, 1/6th the size of the base game in area, all for $40. But I'm sure once it comes out we'll probably be more than satisfied. The map could be much less open and much more jam packed with stuff. Based on surface area alone, you could probably almost fit the entirety of dark souls 3 into limgrave.
            Fun fact, depending on if you kill a mini boss, a big boss, or a legacy dungeon demi god, there is different text for what you've slain, so there are not all viewed as ''bosses'' in the same way.
            > region is incongruous with the rest of the game

The DLC will (and should) be incongruous with the base game, all their DLC are usually minor evolution of the base game, they take all the lessons learned making the base game into the DLC, that's why they usually are the best content they produce.
            Watch it be 3 unique remembrances and 7 base game reskins
                I mean based on the trailer feel like that’s easily off
        Plus a lot of the bosses in the base game are repeats of things you can fight elsewhere. If they're doing fewer bosses in Shadow of the Erdtree, then hopefully they're all unique and more meaningful.
        Ds3 dlc has 6 bosses 🤓
            Technically 7 since Demon In Pain and Demon From Below have separate healthbars
                I mean, technically 9 then, Friede, Friede & Ariandel, Blackflame Friede
                    Also wolf and the gladiator right?
    Im fairly sure those are 10+ unique main bosses, plus we know there will be optional bosses on the level of Melania
        I can't imagine that optional bosses akin to Melania aren't counted in this metric. But they are also probably not counting every encounter like the ones at the small dungeons.

Like, I can't imagine Miyazaki counting a Crucible Knight (which is a normal enemy that gets used as a boss early in the game) and something like Godrick or Maliketh as the same kind of boss.
            Yes I think what miyazakis point is that there are 10 "great enemy felled" moments 
    By over 10 bosses he is certainly referring to solely the “main” bosses in the DLC, which would be significant encounters like Morgott, Malenia, etc.

My guess is we’ll get 5 or 6 remembrance bosses, and 7 bosses that are unique encounters/fights but are less charismatic and less important to the narrative (i.e. Loretta, Leonine Misbegotten, Dragonkin Soldierof Nokstella, etc.). Then we’ll get about 20 other “bosses” like the ones we see in hero’s graves, which will be new elite enemies and stuff like that.
        Seems likely
    By 10 bosses he probably means story bosses like the remembrance ones from the base game
        Which is insane because there are only 15 Remembrance bosses in the main game. Not saying all 10 of these "Unique" main bosses will have remembrances but if they do we're gonna be spending a ton of time in this expansion.
            I mean, they better be worth the 40 bucks they are charging for it
                I have never been disappointed in a single dime I have spent on From Soft games and I have bought every game and DLC since Dark Souls 1 at full price.
    I figured that meant 10 new remberances like that level of boss
    Limgrave only has 1 remembrance boss and 3 achievement bosses. 

The DLC will surely have at least 5 remembrance bosses.
The DLC is also a lot more expensive than past Fromsoft games. I know it won't disappoint but at the same time I'd hope the content reflects the price increase.
    I have such high hopes for this. The last time I paid for a game was in 2013. Just got the entire ER+dlc bundle. Oh man.
Limgrave is huge west east south is a big land mass and you have to account for the underground area and possibly a sky island
    Siofra is certainly counted as its own region if we're talking about "the size of Limgrave"
This is awesome. I’ve only ever felt hype like this once, and it was for the base game lmao
If he ever says "this might be a bit difficult", we're so fucked.
Fromsoft knows what your money is worth. They wouldn’t have spent 2 years and charged 2/3 of the base game’s price if it wasn’t worth every cent.
because he hadn't talked about the twenty six underground areas
I'm just saying, but y'all are setting yourselves up with insane expectations from the hype. It's not gonna essentially be Elden Ring 2. Expect smaller, and you'll be pleasantly surprised when it releases if it's bigger.
    I'm not really expecting anything insane like I have seen so many people do here. I am just poking fun at doomers that immediatly think that this means it's tiny, eventhough Limgrave is huge
        I getchu. I mainly meant the other dudes in here speculating it'll be Limgrave and Liurnia sized conjoined
I prefer that over a lying Todd talking about 16 times the emptiness.
I really hope theres underground areas in the dlc. Those were my favorites. Could be some cool bosses, especially with what we find in those areas.
Limgrave was freaking huge if you included the area that opened up middish game...
Underpromise, over deliver. Take notes Todd
“It’s a DLC”

It’s actually a full on sequel accessible through the first game
Basic marketing plan, tell people they're getting a good deal and then give them a heaping pile of extra and you'll have happier and very loyal consumers. A lot of "AAA" companies should take note of this, as most games now days over hype and under deliver.
Im setting my expectations low just for the sake of it
Size doesn't mean much, you could fit like five lordrans inside limgrave 
My first run took 160 hours.  My latest full, get everything run, took about 25 hours.  So 30 hours is accurate as long as you know what you're doing
So it's gonna be about as big as Limgrave on the surface, but it's gonna have multiple layers and massive underground zone. Gotcha.
Took me 190 hours, i did go on youtube after every area to check if i missed something.
About as big as Limgrave.zip
What if they mean it’s as big as Limgrave AND underground sections of Limgrave.
Oh sweet, so another 2000ish hours of gameplay
Underselling this dlc just like Elden ring so we are especially wowed
Only 100 hours? Are you guys speedrunning or something?
Bigger than limgrave? It took me weeks to leave that place, i love it too much
Completion time mainly depends on the player, but the total size of the map is objective
I don't think the "30-hour story" is underselling anything. Miyazaki was referring to how long he thinks the game will take if you're just focusing on mandatory content; Likely from the perspective of someone who kind of knows what they're doing. If you do as little of the optional content as possible, you essentially just need to get 2 great runes, kill Morgott, the fire giant, and Maliketh, then do the end game boss rush. Even if you take a suboptimal route and kill Godrick and Rennala,  then head straight to Leyndell, it's still not too difficult to finish the game in 30 hours or less.

If I'm playing a NG+ cycle and I just want to beat the game as someone who knows what they're doing, I can do it in under 8 hours fairly easily.
Miyazaki watching everyone take 100+ hours on a game he soloed in 30: "Pathetic."
Didn't he say specifically that the SURFACE map was the comparable to Limgrave? Underground zones+caves+dungeons could mean the actual travel distance could be waaaay larger
30 hours IS accurate because if you strictly aim for the main bosses (aka the story) only, you're done within that time. Most people that took 100 hours were either brand new to the game or got sidetracked too hard.

So I think that the size he describes is accurate.
I got the plat in 80 hours. Ofc I already knew everything to do from my previous console which I spent about 200+ hrs on.
180 hours for first playthrough lol
“A bit bigger than limgrave” *proceeds to make dlc map the same size as the base game map* 😂😂
I expect the poison swamp alone to be as big as Limgrave...☠️
I love his stoic, laconic persona.   

A true genius of our time.
Miyazaki is the one director to undersell the scope of his projects. He knows he doesn't need to exaggerate to get excitement
I think my first playthrough, and I know I missed some night time bosses, dungeons and the ilk. Took me 185 hours.
Guys! He always does! This is why this man is the single most top producer and director, and President of From.

I can't imagine playing any other rpgs (aside from turn-based) than the Demon Souls leading up to Elden Ring. Literally every single one of them are great! Even DS2.  I feel like the combat system they have created is beyond any others. Combat wise, It feels and looks more realistic than other fantasy game. I like that it takes time to cast spells and prayers, because it reminds me of DnD.  Hands down, the best underseller in the market.
200h and have no idea how to upgrade the magic stick. Just bonking through the base game.
I HOPE SOMEONE WILL NOTICE THIS PLS HELP


So i have my Physical disc of 'ELDEN RING (R3)" with 300+ hrs of game file saved on it, if i buy the "ELDEN RING (R3) with dlc" on it, does the saved file readable to the "E.R w DLC?"

Note: Im using U.S psn account not knowing about the region lock years ago when i make my first PS acc and buying random disc without knowing these (R1-2-3-4) whatsoever
a bit bigger than Limgrave? sad.
The opposite of Todd Howard
Tbh "a bit bigger than Limgrave" doesn't really sound THAT big, conisidering how massive the rest of the game is. Limgrave does not probably account for even 10% of the entire base game's world map, including the underground.

Percentage wise, SotE seems to align with DS3's 2 DLCs. So I honestly hope we don't really have the full picture yet.
Please don't be as open world-y. I just want more carefully designed levels like Stormveil and less empty spaces with nothing going on other than the same catacombs over and over. Proper dungeons over big fields of nothingness.

I know this sub doesn't like negativity but the open world was easily the worst part of the entire game to me. Cool for the first 40 hours, then just boring and uninspired. Also stopped me from beating the game countless times like the other Souls games. I was in front of the final boss in one afternoon in my first NG+ run which kinda showed me how short the game really is if you ignore the filler content.

(game is still amazing and probably top 4/3 souls game to me, though)
I'm thinking that means it's going to be a quarter of the base game, contained to an area no bigger than Limgrave+Weeping Peninsula. About 10 hrs of content when all is said and done, but 20 hours of dying and figuring things out.
    The Ringed City is an average of 8 1/2 hours, according to How Long to Beat. Shadow of the Erdtree is definitely going to be longer than 10.


Just going by the price (which is three times higher) it should be at least 30.
        I seen people get stuck on Malenia for 20+ hours. The DLC will surely bring at least one or two bosses on her level. 

The play time will be huge.
That would be actually great imo, because Eldena Ring felt too stretched and repetitive for a souls like and open world game.

Just my opinion though.
The story isnt 30 hours wtf there’s thousands of hours of video trying to explain it and we’re still not done
    The base story (Elden lord achievement) can be completed relatively quickly if you just go for the base ending.
    You can become Elden Lord in a really short amount of time. If your skills are up to par. Beat Godfrey, beat Really and off you go to the endgame.
        Thats the main quest. Im clearly not just talking about the main quest
We just waited 2 years almost of ‘’a bit bigger than Limgrave ?’’ 
Disappointing
To be fair, in one of my run, I was able to finish the game in 30 hrs, just like him intended.
    That doesn't count the second run imo, discovering the game takes much more time, it takes only 1 hour if u speedrun the game but it implies that ur already know what the game contains
Most players beat Elden Ring in about 60 hours
    Avg completion time is 110 hrs according HLTB & various websites that track player progression
        Me and all my friends clocked in near the 70-80 hour mark I can see the dlc being 30 hours if you have half a brain and a competent build
    I doubt that.
        Well it's true.
This is what we need In games !!!! under promise and over deliver !!!!!!!!!!!!
To be fair the main story is probably about 30 hours or less if you’re gud 

After I went to NG+ at lvl 150 I smashed the main story line without an issues in less than 15 and I was kind of diddy-dallying
For $40 we better get half the whole map
For reference base game is 50gb size. The DLC is stated as being 60gb I don’t know if that is just the dlc or if it’s base game +dlc but I’m assuming it’s just dlc THAT MEANS THE DLC IS LARGER THAM BASE GAME… am I wrong???
    The specs are probably just copypasted from the base game. Happens a lot with DLCs, for example DS3, AoA and RC.
    Downvote me more Reddit.
Such an awful game
I have yet to start a new game and I’m only at lvl 205. I’m still finding stuff. I hope they have some larval tears in the dlc.
    Or better yet, farmable tears.
Im out here thinking a re skinned base map but since we are in a different ream everything looks different 

*and yes, caelid is the deathblight swamp in this “new map”*
Hahaha exactly ! Thought the same thing
I made a lot of screenshots from the trailer to look at them in more detail. I think it will be immensely large and I think I can spend another 50-100 hours on it the first time.
We played the "light of the erdtree" map until now. In the DLC its gonna be the dark version.
Man I hope there new summons
I have a feeling it’ll be about the size of all the legacy dungeons put together (as I’m sure some levels with be based on levels from the base game), with a bit of open world areas, but we won’t see many or any caves or catacombs. Overall I’ll say it’ll be roughly half the size of the base game
Opposite of Peter Molyneux
I think it is going to be roughly the size of Limgrave but more densely packed with content. They're talking about 10 bosses and more than 1 big legacy dungeon. I think they're going for some kind of hybrid open-world/legacy-style-world about the size of Limgrave.

To be honest, whatever the DLC brings I'm gonna be happy. Having Elden Ring is already good enough for me.
Yes, it's time to rewatch the trailer
Bit bigger than Limgrave...

Before you get to the increadibly deep underground section.
cant wait for the 5mn speed run of the dlc lmao
Took me 140H to finish my first blind run, I'm not new to fromsoftware  games, and ok, I took it slow, but my god...what a journey!

Can't wait the dlc
Technically he wasn't lying about the 30 hours thing. Someone on this sub made a chart showing exactly what areas and bosses you actually have to complete in order to beat the game. The conclusion was that basically 80% of Elden Ring is optional and not needed to complete the story.

In that context, 30 hours makes sense.
I have 1.5k hours on ds3 with both dlcs. And 1.1k hours on Elden ring without dlcs. God knows how many more hours I’m about to drop once the dlc is out
"bigger than limgrave" *reveals that it's the same size as base map*
My hopes are Limgrave and the WP combined (dungeons and underground included)
There will be a quick way to beat it. (You only need two runes and the medallion to the mountain tops to become elden lord.) But I'm sure it will have tonnes of optional stuff
Looking at the diversity of locations in the trailer, I’m pretty sure it’s going to be bigger than Liurnia
I just started NG+, should I finish this first before the DLC comes out? Or is it better to play NG+ WITH the DLC?
What does he count as "Limgrave" here? Does Weeping Peninsula count, too? The sub-dungeons and all that?
I mean he didn’t lie… if you do story content alone to get to the ending 30 hours is a fair estimate. It’s optional stuff that makes it 100 hours.
im more excited by the new weapon classes. ive heard rumors of katana great sword and colossal swords. also the hand to hand combat looks fun.
To be fair I blew through the main story in 1h 45m (chapel to end cutscene) on NG+. It's not actually that long if you can steamroll everyone with a dark moon Great sword. 

That doesn't include any other questlines though.
Did he really say 30 hours? Who was beta testing his game, DougDoug?
    That bald hack would take 400 hours he can’t even do 2d platformers.
After the BANGER that is Dark Souls III DLC, I have high expectations.
I remember a quote from someone saying that they were "adding a bloodbornes worth of content" so uh
Well The Ringed City was about 10-12 hours and the main game on near full completion was over 100 so if you compare that to elden ring where most of the game is around 150 hours we might get 20 or so hours for SOTE, which is larger than some games base story
I mean if you know what you’re doing and focus on what’s necessary, even without speedrunning you can beat the game within 30h. I’m on my 4th run through doing most of everything and I beat Morgott with 45h on the clock. Surely if I had skipped Mount Gelmir and Raya Lucaria altogether I’d be around there, even less if I hadn’t looked for catacombs.
from what i saw in the trailer i’d guess about limgrave+caelid-dragonbarrow
Contemplating starting a new game now and progressing on that when the DLC drops or start a new game when the DLC is live. What do you guys think?
100 hours? I'm currently at 183 hours and still have soo much to do before I'm ready to claim the Elden Throne
I'm hyped for this.. Does anyone know how much it's expected to cost? Same price as a new title? a bit less?
A bit bigger than limgrave, a lot dense tho
i only did 1 playthrough at launch with a bleed katana build..

&#x200B;

i guess its time to start a second run few weeks before DLC drops as a magic caster or maybe str build :D
People really underestimate how big limgrave actually is
>The Games Story is 30 Hours

Maybe he's just THAT good at the Game and y'all just need to step up your game
I am so hyped for the martial arts
People get his message wrong. 

The story in Elden Ring is super short. Story only Cycle in NG+ is easy 2-5 hours depending on route and skill. You only need some extra hours to level up so it's easier to beat the bosses. If you would just concentrate on the story and the necessary lvl grind, it's really a short game.

Nearly the entire game is optional and/or necessary for level ups.

I believe him when he says size is a little bit above the size of limgrave but I see this as a win, because the later regions suffered because of the stretch and the deadline. 

Mountaintops is a pretty bad world design and nearly has no new enemies. 

Smaller and better rounded world is what I would want, because I think a fromsoft souls like is best packed into a 30-40 hour costume so the ng+ cycles can be enjoyed more. In Eldena Ring I had 0 lust for the open world dungeons. They were pretty pointless because of the copy pasted bosses.

The main route and legacy dungeons on the other hand were really great.
30 hours? Im 56 hours in and probably have 10-20 more until I beat the game(arrived at Farum Azula
Considering it costs 40€ it better be big
30hrs is wild. I've got three days in this game, and I'm just now to the point where I can walk around the map without fear of being one hitter by literally almost anyone.
Im so excited I might start a new playthrough today
You can estimate time but you can physically measure a map.
Considering its price tag at $40/£35 it costs like $/£20 cheaper than some objectively worse games 😂 The fact it’s gonna be basically another Elden ring game is such a bonus I’ll happily pay for.
I remember posts of people pushing 30+ hours and realizing that Limgrave wasn’t the whole map. Now people are worried that it’ll be too small? A 30+ hour dlc is well worth it!
It will be 4 times the size of fallout 4.
Even though I beat both ds3 dlcs it was a while ago... Where do y'all think dlc will land in terms of progression? I don't want to go in 100 levels under but also don't want to go in OP
30 hours seems somewhat realistic for just a first time story playthrough though.  
We just got lost along the way. A lot. So many optional areas in this game.
nah bro he telling us we suck at this game
Limgrave is big but it ain’t t that big (I’m lying I got no clue cause I haven’t played in over a year)
For £35 I’m expecting at least 30-40 hours of content
Limgrave is still really fucking big.
Miyazaki is like Netero from hunter x hunter, if he suggested more hours that means he underestimate the players, if he suggested fewer that mean he's challenging the players.
Yall really need to chill with your expectations. If it's "just" the size of limgrave it's still massive.
OMG, can't wait to die again and again and again, then do respec and die again and again and again, I love it!
I saw martial arts in the trailer. I am hyped for these kinds of runs. Imagine going hand to hand combat against hoarah loux.
I beat elden ring after 150 hours (100% run) and limgrave took about 25 so im definitely looking forward to this
30 hours… they really said 30 hours. My first playthrough was 180
"I meant the poison swamp was same size as limgrave teehee "-Miyazaki
I cleared my first run of ER at like 100hrs and I recently loaded back up to start looking for stuff I've missed in prep for the dlc. Shockingly I've found a lot in the 11 hours I've added so far.
Fromsoft enjoy surprising players in both good and bad ways.
Entire DLC map floor is poison swamps
The game's story is like 30ish hours though.
Hmm idk if you were to beeline for essentials only but not using speed run routes/strats, I can easily see myself getting to the end in under 30 hours tbh
When I saw this comment, sounded kinda crazy how they planned to fit all the variety we saw in the trailer into one Limgrave. 

Starting from the simple forests, to castles, to blighted villages, to some lava spaces, to open fields with the red dual-wielding lady. 

I cannot imagine how it would be the size if Limgrave unless they really really cram everything into that poor real estate
the way he mentions “legacy dungeons” in the interview seemed to imply there will be multiple, limgrave-sized areas. if i’m not mistaken, i thought legacy dungeons referred to this expansive areas, like limgrave, caelid, or liurnia. when asked about the size, it only seemed like he was talking about the size of *a* legacy dungeon being about as big as limgrave. i could very well be misunderstanding miyazaki’s syntax or the way it was translated. crossing my fingers!!
I can't believe how massive Elden ring truly is. Yesterday I finally platinumed it after getting the frenzied flame ending.... I didn't even need to go to Radahn, Rykard, Malenia, or underground at all.   


In fact, Rogier was still alive after I released destined death lol. Barely breathing but he was definitely alive.
I checked on steam and the DLC size will be 60gb which is the same as the base game. This might mean it's very big (I think)
Limgrave includes weeping peninsula, all imma say.
Did he really claim the story is only 30 hours?
I'm doing a fresh save 100%.
Yeah, when he said that about Limgrave, I just laughed cuz I know what we're actually in for
This is gonna be like genshin where a map or new area seems small but they have undergrounds and multiple layers of area to be explored
weeping peninsula is not considered Limgrave right? Just as Mt.Gelmir isnt considered Altus Plateu? Just want to confirm that, a bit bigger than JUST Limgrave or are we including WP?
Good strat to undersell knowing very well it will exceed those expectations
Maybe Miyazaki meant 30 hours on your replay because my play throughs vary from first playthrough 130 hours to 20 hours on my fifth and my most recent is 40 although I did take my time a bit this go around
Eh im going to twmper my expectations for the map size, will probably be just alightly bigger than Limgrave like he said.
Question, can a dlc be nominated for "game of the year award"? I know it's probably impossibile and i think we should all enjoy the dlc when it comes out, without too many aspirations, but how much funny would it be for a game to be game of the year twice?!
30 hours to beat for him he probably knows all the move sets and where everything is lol
Im sure a souls veteran could’ve beat Elden ring main story in even less than 30, but beating a game is one thing, enjoying for 300 hours is another.
my base game run was 250h.. i wonder how much a new character+dlc will take
Wait didn't he say "about" the size of Limgrave? One of the translations I read had that and I was quite disappointed. Bigger than Limgrave means it could be the size of Liurnia or even bigger. We're splitting hairs but still, "bigger than Limgrave" could mean the entire game XD.
"Players will have some trouble with a couple of the bosses"
I’ve low key had the same feeling but also trying to keep my expectations in check. I think it will be amazing regardless.
Elden Ring is 60GB  
SOTE is 60GB as well on steam
In Miyazaki's interview I read that it was going to be the same or bigger than Limgrave, but there would be a lot of variety of areas under the map, which would be very big.
One thing to keep in mind as well: density. Making huge open fields is not hard, they can likely add as much of that as we want. The real thing is the content we have (bosses, items, quests, etc). They can choose to add that to a smaller area or a bigger one. I don't think they'll make it too dense where every 5 steps we have a remembrance level boss. Nor do I think they will make it so that all the content is spread to the entire base game size map. It will likely be very big and slightly dense it seems.
Does siofra river count as part of limgrave?
i am so exited for those cool lances and the grav ash of war i feel like it could be good meta pvp and i want more torches
From the scale and variety of what we've seen I find it really hard to believe that SotE is only "a little larger than Limgrave" as Miyazaki said. This looks like a damn sequel. There is so much we haven't even seen a glimpse of yet. Hell, we've probably not even seen a Legacy yet... And there are 2 huge castles back to back next to a city that looks close to the size of freaking Leyndell.

SotE is either VERY dense and wastes almost no space like Limgrave did with its huge ranges of just grass (which I still wouldn't change) or Miyazaki is fucking with us again.
I spent around 30 hours in Limgrave on my first playthrough so if it's bigger and equally dense in content this is going to be incredible.
I’d rather have this than what Peter Molyneux did to us Fable fans
I think its a good idea to remember this is a dlc and not Elden Ring 2 in terms of content.
Was elden ring actually marketed as 30 hours for story?
It took me 100 hours aswell and I appreciate single single second withon that 100 hours spend on the game (besides the first ~5 hours when I hated the game not knowing what I got myself into, first fromsoft)
He really is. Talk about a surprise playing ER.
We truly are Limming the Grave after this DLC comes out
He's wrong. It's 20 hours.
Let’s just say the stuff shown in the trailer was a hell of a lot more varied than anything from Limgrave, and he stated a goal was making sure transitions between these environments felt more natural.  So yeah, I’d say it’s Limgrave + at least half of Caelid-sized.
Well the time to beat is subjective, the size of the game world is a pretty objective information
30 hours is a pretty reasonable estimate for a playthrough if you're not trying to 100% everything, if you're just doing all Remembrances plus just the dungeons needed for whatever weapons you're using.
Tbh Elden Rings actual story isnt that long if you know what you're doing. The point is the game is gigantic with a lot of optional content to do as well. I'm sure it'll be the same for the DLC.
To be fair, the story is about 30 hours of content if you take the proper routes and beat all the demigods on the way to the erdtree assuming that you're taking the vanilla route and going straight for Elden Lord
just comparing it to the size of limgrave doesn't tell us much I think. Including weeping peninsula? Including nokron and the other areas under limgrave? 
I'd guess he meant yes/no to those questions but wouldn't be surprised if his internal definition of limgrave is different, resulting in wildly different sizes.

can't wait to embrace the withered finger and find out!
I am wondering if it will scale as the base game does for New Game+.
Most people don't realize this, but Limgrave is actually larger than the entire surface area of Elden Ring's map. Limgrave included.
lawl 30 hours. I had so little understanding what I needed to do story wise that I played for like 180hrs before I looked up a quest guide. I had killed so many of the bosses that it took me a while to figure out wtf I had to do and where I was in the game even with the guides. I hated that so much.
swaammmmmmmp

“It’s a bit bigger than limgrave…..but it has like 10 layers in it.”
I can see it being 30 hours if you really just prioritize getting through the game and it's your first playthrough (and you're just naturally really good at it lol).  I usually get burnt out playing ER tho because there's just so much in it that I want to discover/check off.  If I just go right to the main bosses and finish it then I'll have to do so knowingly passing up a bunch of mini dungeons weapons and stuff like that, which I don't have the willpower to do.

But then I go do it and it burns me out lmao.

I can see Miyazaki being technically correct about the 30 hours thing but I know I'm def not the kind of player he's talking about when he uses that estimated window lol.  Willing to bet a lot of others can't pass up exploring everywhere the first time through too.
also take into account, from what we’ve seen, there’s a lot of verticality to the new areas. that will surely make it feel much bigger and denser.
As big as Limgrave... Plus dungeons, underground areas and wherever else you get teleported to. I wouldn't be surprised if this adds up to half of the current map in size alone
I'll easily sink around about 50-100 hours into the DLC alone.
i mean it is 30 hours assuming u beat every boss in 1 try and dont ever dare stop to small the scarlet rot
I remember getting out of limgrave and being like oh so I've just got a little bit more left?
That’s an understatement. 

I didn’t even realize there was more to the Volcano Manor than the small area with NPCs. I remember just vaguely thinking, oh, blocked door. But didn’t pursue the the train of thought until much later. 

When I realized I missed cookbook 19 or something and looked up a guide I saw the illusory wall and the way in. 

Imagine not being able to look stuff up at all, and just not being able to explore a fairly large dungeon like that because it’s just so hidden from view. And From is just like "Oh well, if you didn’t find it you didn’t find it"

That’s a lot of content to just leave completely hidden. 

How people figured out where everything is is beyond me.
How much do you wanna bet he's being humble and in reality it's limgrave plus caelid
And yet I have seen so many people crying about how it's priced if you are that apprehensive then just wait to see how much content there actually is mfers out here crying as if it's something that can be completed in 1 sitting
b-BIGGER???
I can't wait to get the ash of war that allows me to kick people in the face like in the trailer.
Let’s not forget that comment was made a decent time ago and based on what we saw in the trailer it’s probably outdated info by now. It’s not uncommon to overbuild a world past what was intended originally. Regardless it’ll be worth the money with the 8 new weapon types and 10 mainline bosses added in the new area.
Not to mention the hours spent dying to bosses figuring out quests, and falling off ledges
Not to mention the hours spent dying to bosses figuring out quests, and falling off ledges
I have over 340 hrs and somehow i still haven't finished the game. Uhh
ligmagrave+morne island?
Reminder that this man does not play his own games. Also Limgrave IS pretty big if you account for Weeping Peninsula.
Better to undersell than to provoke redditor twitter hatred. Let it be 'small'
It’s gonna end up being ‘a bit bigger than limgrave’ with a subterranean area that runs beneath the entire surface level area, also a floating island that is 50% as big as limgrave and a painted world cuz why not.
I like to think he does it on purpose so when it releases the content really wow's us
Love this dude
It's actually a 1:1 replica of earth
Me *Game launch spends 50hrs just in limgrave. 
*Dlc launch spends 50hrs tryna figure out how the first enemy one shots me
I'm going to keep my expectations to exactly what he said. I do not want my hopes built up by hype that he didn't start just to be let down by exactly what he told us we were getting.
I hope so since it took two and a half years to make. Couldn't they almost make another whole Elden Ring in that time? Maybe I'm way off on how long these things take as I'm certainly not a game designer. Either way, can't wait as this is the best game I've ever played, and I've been playing games for 41 years.
    Making a whole game of that size in that time frame and then also have it be good is insane
I'm already 500 hundred hours in, third playthru so I've gotten my money's worth either way I'd say.
People forget everything under Limgrave lol
My balls itch btw what's the best pvp weapon RN I'm just getting back in and I think naked with star fists is the way to go
But limgrave with the subterranean world? Or without?
Considering that most of the people that will play the dlc already finished the base game, I don't think they will spend a lot of time to finish it
I got the platinum in 118, so I think he was right about the base game. NGL most people are just doing to much to take 100 hours on a first playthrough
I'm betting on an average of 60 hours for players who are playing consistently to get everything the expansion has to offer.

Also the map seems to have an underground zone, which could be anything from the size of the Siofra River zone to 3/4s of the complete expansion map (I don't see it having the full length of the expansion map).
Honestly, it will probably be a more dense version of limgrave in terms of size. The whole team wasn't working on this dlc. Only a small group was.
The real questions is how many poison swamps there are
While he does undersell, it makes us players all the happier when we realize our money bought us waaaaay more than we thought it would
I still haven't beaten the game, it was my first Souls game and I go back to it every now and then but I've got 3 roadblocks, Mohg, Melenia and Maliketh, hopefully I'll get around to beating them before the DLC comes out.
Still better than overselling like Ubisoft does.  AAAA my ass
I don't think it's going to be much larger than Limgrave, I doubt he would undersell the DLC. I am hoping that it's packed though. Considering the price, If it has the same amount of content as Limgrave, it's going to be a slight disappointment.  I am hoping it's not 2 main bosses and a bunch of catacombs with enemies from the main game.
Add the time spent on YouTube for knowing about different lores
I bet he’s sandbagging us and there’s double the world that we can physically see behind the shadow erdtree.
Imagine the dlc turns out to be bigger than the base game, and as you're playing, you find out that there is a whole underground map as well.
This was my first PS5 / open world game. I beat Elden beast at 170 hours, because I was so okay with riding around every single spot. Amazing!
He's not wrong tho.. the game's story is indeed barely enough to fill 30 hours.. its the sheer open world exploration, optional quests and hidden secrets, fights, bosses, etc that take over 100 hours.
Why do I have a feeling that the map will be the same as the base game but changed into miquela's disturbed dream world after being corrupted by Mohg
50 hrs of content at least, and Miyazaki goes, " ah its just a little something we cooked up nothing crazy." My ass prais3 the sun Miyazaki 🌞
Let’s be honest esmer gonna whop our ass so bad that’s 5-10 hours more playtime
I think I got the platinum trophy in just 50 hours.. or maybe I it was the main game in 50 hours.. so I don’t think the DLC will be for me 6 - 8 hours all bosses all dungeons.
Miyazaki so Chad that not only does he not need to exaggerate, he can undersell and people will worship him before and after seeing the real thing
❤️
Mans has big dong energy.
I literally perked off while watching the trailer
Lineage is actually pretty large but he def underestimates things
The main story is tho. A ton of content is optional. Only about 13 actual boss fights required and that includes "mini bosses" like Red wolf.
Did he really say 30 hrs?
I had the misfortune of my first playthrough being non-blind but it still took 120 hrs lmao
He didn't talk much about legacy dungeons, if they are like Leyndell, both in quality and size, I'll be so blown away
Here’s game of the year again
Meanwhile I have over 200 hours in between 2 playthroughs and haven't beaten the game yet. I should probably do that before the dlc comes put.
Not to mention the hundreds of additional hours you might get simply from enjoying the base game but with a dlc weapon that makes it feel fresh
    I have 700 hours and I’m still not bored of the base games weapons. I’m so hyped
        Same, this is one of my main excitement points. The game is still drawing me back to it with new builds i havent tried yet, and now were getting so many new weapons and even new weapon types? And new enemies to test all of it on? Man, im hyped as well
            Going to do another playthrough after a year long break today, any wacky fun builds you'd recommend?
                depends on what you've already done

powerstanced Great Hammers on a pure str/end build was probably my favorite. but it means farming the duelists outside the lyendell colosseum for a second hammer. (the brick hammer in stormveil is good for the first)

it's probably not as "good" as a giant crusher or GUGS build, but it's fun

i also had a lot of fun powerstancing the DMGS and Helphen's Steeple, because you look pretty cool when you have both AOWs active. Plus you can still be a very good caster, you'll be pretty limited on armor choices though.

edit: if you can't tell i think powerstancing weapons is really fun and you should try it if you haven't on past playthroughs

edit 2: dual straight swords is actually really fun as well. square off is the most underrated skill in the game, because no one uses straight swords after the first hour unless it's a SONAF build.
                    Great Mace is also a free pickup in a chest before the Grand Lift of Dectus, middle of that camp near the siege weapons.

You can also get two Great Stars now in Altus Plateau, free bleed and heal on hit. There's one in the caravan on the Road of Iniquity Side Path and one at the Writheblood Ruins when you progress Varré's quest to where he gives bloody fingers for invading. A sign for invading Magnus the Beast Claw is around and beating him rewards the second Great Stars.

The Battle Hammer great hammer is my favorite fashion hammer, just sucks you need to farm those Duelists for it but the drop rate isn't horrendous with some boosted item discovery.
                        I was mostly recommending the battle hammer for fashion purposes.

Twin great stars is probably better just bc bleed is so strong.
                            Yeah but fashion is tops therefore Battle Hammer is best! But some might not wanna do that farm so I was giving backup options. Great Stars is one of my faves but it looks horrid with most armor sets lol
                    The duelist greataxe is pretty awesome too, did a stark cosplay with it and the drake knight armor, looked pretty sick
                        i do love obnoxiously heavy dex weapons. hopefully the Exile GS from DS3 makes a return
                    Came here to say that dual straight swords and square off carried me through a RL1 playthrough.  It's fast, strong and fun.  Only downside is that I played for 500 hours before giving straight swords a chance.
                        i thought square off  had to be bugged when i first went back to it. the stance damage is so strong for such a fast and light weapon.
                    I’m using Blaidd’s set with the Raging Wolf helm and it looks pretty lit with the Ghostflame active.  Kind of have a spirit wolf theme going using Latenna’s ashes as well.
                    what's DGMS
                        Dark moon greatsword
                            ohh ok thank you
                                No worries, hopefully I've convinced you that two glowing magic swords are better than one
                Wacky is fun, but I'll chime in and say I consistently had best experience (pve and pvp) by going back to the roots. 

Shield and mace. Big bonk colossal. Straight sword and pyro incantations in offhand. These kinds of builds have repeatedly proven to have a very solid core gameplay, with enough room for weaponplay and expression to feel interesting. Ever beat malenia by simply blocking her waterfowl with 2h weapon, or killed an invader by sending them to the moon with Upward Cut, then pointed up? It feels sublime.
                    I killed an invader with Niall's thunder kick, and used crucible horns to knock people over guard rails to fall to their death 🤣


Pvp is fun
                        Yesssss someone else finally mentioned Niall's peg leg! I feel like nobody knows how fun it is.
                            You best believe im making a build all around this new jump kick weapon 
                                Bonefist 2 hallow boogaloo
                Faith Lightdiscuss from the Rotspears of Malenias Knights + Magic-Reflection Shield. You shoot your discus, when it returns you reflect it for INSANE dmg. It is hard to pull off, but absolutely fun and satisfying to me.

  
Sorry, i do not remember the actual names :D Think the Spear is the Cleanrot-Spear and has an abysmal dropchance :>
                Anything combo'd with ARC is good if you know where to look, INT probably is the worst stat to combo with right now as you just have bubble spells which are okay but definitely weird. ARC/FTH for dragon communion incantations. DEX/ARC for bleed weapons like Rivers of Blood, Eleonoras Poleblade, Godskin Peeler. STR/ARC for Mohg Spear and even the Marais Executioner Sword, plus any weapons with innate Bleed are amazing for ARC as you can put Occult affinity on them for good damage and better bleed both, it's a great pure ARC affinity.

FTH can do everything too, pairs well with all stats and lets you do a variety of builds.
                It's a long time to get going, but a Frenzy build is crazy. Not good, but crazy.
                my current playthrough is naked with the large club. nothing like running around killing gods in a loincloth with a big stick
                I recommend either going wacky heal focused faith build with the heal on hit weapons and blasphemous blade focused with great stars secondaries

- key focus is on the healing vs maxing damage with it.

Or 

Ultimate use everything build ready for DLC
Focus on getting all stats to 20-25 via both levels and items

Only level vigor, endurance etc for equip load, with a lil of fp leveling.

Go into DLC being able to test out anything you pickup
            Same lol said I was gonna replay it after beating it after about 2 months came back and beat it like 3 times lol
        But club go bonk
            but maybe new DLC club so we can bonk twice at once

                    one bonk good, so two bonks better!
        Yea man, experimenting different kinds of weapons are my go to, even fully upgrading all of em (60% progress of leveling all weapons)
    Im 100% doing all NG+ with the karate moveset
    It's also an endgame dlc so you'll probably want to go through NG+ once or twice with lots of shiny new toys. Amount of hours expected for play is deceiving in a souls game, usually in the players favor.
    Someone pointed out that the weapon they do the crucible move with is an actual shield weapon and I'm so excited
        Maybe its an ash of war you can put on anything
    Finally going to bonk elden beast with some martial arts
        We can finally kick runebears in the nuts
    Fuck me, the dickriding is insane. People like you piss me off and are the reason why the gaming industry is as shit as it is. Have some standards ffs
        Shut up loser
100+ hours of poison swamp, with sleep this time.
    The sleep swamp is just math class
    And deathblight
It absolutely needs to be to justify the price tag. This DLC costs 70% of the game.
    2.5 years development work on a 10/10 platform of a game. I bet it's freaking massive! But ya, if ER had 80 bosses the dlc needs at least 50 new ones.
It's the highest priced DLC we've ever gotten in Souls, so I'm betting you're right with that estimate. FromSoft never price gouges just for the starpower of their developer name, it always reflects the amount of content in the DLC.

Not to mention, this is by far the longest development cycle for any of their DLCs as well.

We're gonna be eatin' good.
    Myazaki also said this is the biggest DLC they have ever made.
    This means they’ll finally get around to the sekiro dlc right
I mean, let's be realistic:

10 bosses can, for example, be as simple as Tree Sentinel, Night's Cavalry, Agheel, Pumpkinhead duo, Margit, an Erdtree Avatar, an Erdtree Wiggly Worm, Godrick and an Erdtree Burial Guardian. So imagine the content traversed to reach them.

Or another example that's easier to place in terms of gameplay time: Radagon/Elden Beast, Godfrey, Gideon, Maliketh, Draconic Knight, Godskin Duo, Fire Giant, Spiritcaller Snail (with Godskin duo), Borealis, and a Death Rite Bird.

The latter example is probably a bit better, because if it's just 10 bosses, it's far more likely the DLC is structured in such a way that we're intended to see most along our "linear" journey (linear in terms of progress, not in terms of exploration) with only 1-2 being more hidden, potentially.

So IMO, we can imagine a gameplay space similar to the Mountaintop of Giants and beyond. The endgame has an abnormally dense rate of bosses, so if we account for that, Mountaintop and beyond pretty much what we get. This is less concerned with exact land mass size and instead concerned with how they typically space out their bosses.
    I imagine we're getting 10 or more unique bosses. DLCs tend to have lots of high quality bosses relative to the actual size of the DLC, so hopefully it's 10 or more remembrance bosses.
        I wouldn't needlessly hype ourselves up like that.

10 unique bosses? Yes.

"Akshually there's more than 10 and they meant just 10 uniques?" No.

The only thing worth noting is that *world* bosses can be significant without necessarily being bosses. Golems for example are not actual bosses (ok once, as a beginner boss for one earlygame cave) but are still a significant fight. From the trailer alone, I could see the hippo, lion and wicker man all being world "bosses" or significant enemies and not adding to the boss count.
            Miyazaki said at least 10 bosses. That was the wording. And I can't imagine it would be anything but new bosses.

The quality of the bosses is still unknown. I'm hoping for Remembrance level bosses. BB and DS3's DLCs had lots of high quality bosses. Considering Shadow of the Erdtree is a way bigger DLC than any of those I'd expect nothing less than 5 Remembrance tier bosses.
            didnt miyazaki literally say more than 10 nee bosses? lmao
    It's definitely more than just 10 bosses. I count at least 8 enemies that are definitely bosses, and a few more that are probably bosses.

1. Wicker man

2. Lion Dancers

3. Messmer

4. The Twinblade Knight that gets kicked (Looks like boss arena, fogwall in the background, has the twinblade used at the end of the trailer)

5. Gravity lance boar rider

6. Hippo-porcupine

7. The thing riding the half dissolved horse

8. The dude pulling the sword out of himself

And maybe bosses: 

1. The Nox/Carian person

2. Leech snake thing (honestly not too sure about this one)

2. The three things the reverse grip sword user fights (looks like a boss arena)

3. The red dancer lady
        Twin blade knight feels like a Soldier of Godrick situation to me. His design is too basic to be a unique, 1 and done boss. I imagine after this fight he’ll appear more commonly as a regular mob. So I wouldn’t count him personally
            I agree he doesn't look like boss material. I wouldn't think he was a boss either if it wasn't for the very obvious boss room he's placed in. However, I also don't think it makes sense for him to be a Soldier of Godrick type boss. Soldier of Godrick is a tutorial boss. The DLC is tuned for endgame, and is locked behind Mohg and Radahn, that's rather far into the game for a single generic looking knight to be a boss. 


I think it's much more likely that he's *not* the boss, but is a part of a larger boss fight, like the soldiers Niall summons.
                Could also be a "enemy outside the boss room" situation. But yeah i hope future interviews give some clarification on that metric. Ideally, they're 10+ remembrance calibur bosses/bosses too unique to show up twice. It would fit the pricing at least. 2/3 the price of the game and 2/3 the number of remembrance bosses. 

&#x200B;

No way did they reveal about 8 of the at least 11 bosses in the first trailer unless the boss number is 15 or more i hope.
It better be because im spending 50 bucks on it
I just hope the price tag is fully justified, whether it's 30 hours packed with insane content, or 60 hours packed with similarly good content.
For the price of the whole game in my region, it should be.
For that long wait I’ll hope for Michael Zaki that it is indeed over 40 hrs…
 No that’s red Limgrave, snowy Limgrave, dark Limgrave, buried Limgrave, all is limgrave
    Wait, it’s all limgrave?
        Always has been
            limgrave deez nuts
                Got em
        It's all Limgrave except for the Haligtree, which is only not Limgrave because Limgrave doesn't know how to get there to annex it (they can't look out up because they don't have Internet access)
        Other than the part that is Ohio
            And Australia
    You can definitely map out all the graves ive made for myself all over the Lands Between
    Damn, true, my bad...
        Under Limgrave, all things converge.
            yessir
                What kind of fool do you take me for? He's Limgrave, he's Limgrave, you're Limgrave... I'm Limgrave! Are there any other Limb-graves I should know about?!
                    Floating limgrave ……
                    Hi Limgrave,

Please meet my friend Limgrave,

Yours Limgravely,

Limgrave
                    Would the real Limgrave please stand up
    Kenneth Haight, supreme ruler of all creation
    Don’t forget about wet Limgrave!
        Of course of course and wet limgrave
    dont forget golden limgrave!
    And Broken Limgrave
    Limgrave beyond time, alternative tree Limgrave, and the other Limgrave that no one talks about
I remember when the map was just scaled to limgrave and thinking "whoa this is pretty decently sized, not bad!"

And then I went south and it was a little bigger "Whoa, more content?!?! Jesus!"

And I got teleported to caelid and the map basically exploding in size and was just awestruck. Man playing the game when it was new and unknown was such a damn treat.
    Then later on finding the teleport to the top of Leyndell. I think at that point my brain just broke.
    Dunkey described this perfectly in his Elden ring video
Well, he didn't say it's bigger than Limgrave, he said it's slightly bigger than Limgrave.
    Technically, the entire ER map is "slightly bigger" than Limgrave.
I heard the DLC will take more than a few minutes to complete
I was over level 150 the first time I beat the game and some people on here were like “wtf are you doing dude” 🤣

Just killin stuff
    Bro i m 212 before i finished, if i die to a boss 10 times i would go level up 5 or so times then come back try again. Melania got me from like 120 to 190.
        I…uh…missed her in my first play through. 

I actually missed the entire Consecrated Snowfield (and albunaric village) and only went to it to get the Haligdrake Talisman to beat Radagon/Elden Beast
            I missed out on a few things because i literally start choppin at whatever I see, ended up killing a few NPCs like patches and boc.
    150 is pretty standard for a playthrough where explore a bunch tbh
    I was over 200 when I finished the game. Got sidetracked, did a bunch of other stuff, then went to wipe the floor with Maliketh.

…


…

Still got my shit pushed in.
    I just completed my 4th playthrough and I still was almost level 150 when I beat it despite not even trying to be super thorough about exploring literally everything lol. I did use gold fowl feet for bosses to be fair.
    Fk…I’m around 150 and probably died to Elden beast 100 times now…with mimic tear… certified garbage player
        Don't worry about it bro, and don't call yourself garbage. Just keep at it Tarnished! You got this! Don't think about how you fare against others, each of us has different experiences, reactions to things, and most importantly, take in information very differently.
            Haha yea…haven’t enjoyed gaming this much in 10+ years. Never tried this genre before Elden ring. I remember picking it up and giving up after a few hours, came back a month later and here I am now.  Picked up lies of P after I got tired of dying to Elden beast lol, also fun but didn’t hit the same way.
                Well welcome to the genre! Defo look for older souls titles as those were really good, especially for their time, but stuff like sekiro, dark souls 3 and even bloodborne still hold up to today's standards imo!

Glad to hear you are having a blast!
    This was me too but I did a ton of exploring and wanted to make sure I didn’t miss anything major like Malenia.
    *Coughs in dozens mohgwyn birb massacres*


Edit: my fist play through ended at lvl 278
The "story" of the game is quite short, really. get two Great Runes, get to Altus somehow, get into the city and then it's a linear path to the end if you want it to be. The vast majority of the game is completely optional.
I have so many fucking hours and I’ve made probably 20-30 characters and still haven’t beaten it yet. I have so many ways i want to play and i can’t get enough of just one playstyle. Also souls games character creator is top tier
I guess it also depends on how much side stuff you do. Cause technically you could skip out all of Caelid (besides maybe Radahn), all the underground stuff, Malenia/ haligtree, smaller dungeons such as Caria Manor, etc

If we skipped out all that it probably would be closer to 30 hrs, but then we would feel pretty under levelled the entire game, so we would have to be even more skilled 😅
Not only that. 

He stated that the World will be as big if not a bit bigger than Limgrave 

AND he said there will be multiple Legacy Dungeons (lets just assume 2 because of different translations) and multiple smaller Legacys (probably like castle morne). Limgrave only had one of each. 

He also said something about a new kind of dungeons, that are more interconnected to the world. We just don't know if that just referes to the already mentioned ones or if that add on top of those.
    AFAIK Lower Sofria River is called "Limgrave Misc." in the game files for difficulty scaling.

however the rest of Siofra like Mogywyn Palace and Nokron have their own names in the area scalings
    I thinks the new dungeon type he was talking about thats more, to paraphrase, "integrated into the overworld" will be an elaboration of the ruins. So instead of each Ruin just having 1 boss room/chest room, they'll have a couple, perhaps interconnected underground, and will be bigger.
    > new kind of dungeons, that are more interconnected to the world

I swear, if I end up in Blackreach again...
    so is the DLC more game than the base game?
        No. It is still smaller than the base game. But even more dense. So from what he said we can assume more content that the size of the map will make it seem. So more Game than limgrave
            My guess would maybe be… 1/4th or 1/3rd of the base game in terms of content?

Seeing as Elden Ring has 6 legacy dungeons and this dlc will have at least 2, it’s definitely going to be jam packed with content.
It's also a beginner area and hence has a flatter terrain. There is a lot more verticality in the Shadow realm also that castle in the trailer looks a shit ton bigger than Stormveil or my eyes maybe deceiving me. Dlc has 10+ endgame boss. DLC is gonna have a lot more quality over quantity.
Also keep in mind that size isnt all.

For example starfied is definetly bigger than limgrave, but that doesnt mean that all of those empty planets are as good as limgrave...
    They said they wanted to make it more dense so a Limgrave sized area with about twice or three times as much to do in it is... a lot.
        *runs away from problem straight into open mouth of other problem*
        More dense? I can see how you can save on some longer roads, but besides that the game was already pretty close packed. Myazaki what you done this time
            Man, have you not heard the open-world bitchers roaming around whining about the open-world aspects of the game?
                No. Actually I havent
                    Here's a thread:
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/t30r97/open_world_boring/

You'll find them roaming through the forums randomly stating how they would like elden ring so much more if it wasn't open world.
                        I believe you that they exist. But for real I just didnt have them on my radar. I mean I also like Fromsofts linear Formular more, but I also want them to try stuff out and improve. You cant progress when you stagnate lol
        I'm sure we'll still be left feeling a little bit worse about ourselves for having interacted with anyone at all, with luck.
            what
                I was saying npc questlines will probably still be sad. Which I like about these games. 

Downvotes gonna downvote though.
    That entire game isn’t as good as Limgrave LMAO.
        I probably spent more hours in Stormveil Castle than in Starfield.
        When after the tutorial that dude was like


"Yeah man I'll just work your grueling manual labor job even though my robot is RIGHT HERE, you take my ship and fly around the galaxy in it ☺️"


I dipped
            You got further than me. I stopped when the game was so consistent and immersive with a story so well connected to the World, that after I woke up from character creation, I was told by the NPC that it makes no sense for me to be there. It was also never mentioned ever at any point after
 The game just accepted that it already broke its World building before the Tutorial came to an end and that is unexcusable.
            that isn’t what happens at all lol
        I liked it for a bit but when gameplay became running back to the 2 human cities to re-buy ammo for the only guns I had worth a fuck while the ammo most peons dropped were for guns that tickled enemies, I got bored fast
    Phantom liberty map was so small compared to the city but damn was it packed
Also keep in mind that when we all first played the game and thought Limgrave was all there was we were still thinking: Wow this game is big
    Tbh if the DLC is as big and polished as Limgrave, but at an endgame difficulty level, then it would be great. Limgrave was probably the most fun I had in Elden Ring since everything was new, exploration was really rewarding with tons of cool encounters you'd just run into and the quest design was more logical than the rest of the game.
        I didnt find Torrent for probably 3-4 hours, just wondering the countryside taking my time, ducking in and out of trouble, mapping the world, getting my ass kicked. I think I spent 20 hours at least picking apart Limgrave on my first playthrough, excited and terrified of what horrible surprise would come next (after discovering the caelid trap chest lol)... couldn't believe how massive the game ended up being. Hope to get that same feeling of awe and discovery in the DLC
Siofra has its own region banner so the developers probably don't count Siofra as part of Limgrave.

Based on the region banners in the game we have 5 overworld and 3 underground regions

1: Limgrave (+ Weeping Peninsula)

2: Liurnia

3: Caelid

4: Altus Plateau (+ Mt. Gelmir + Leyndell)

5: Mountaintops (+ Snowfields)

6: Siofra River (+ Nokron + Mohgwyn Palace)

7: Ainsel River (+ Nokstella + Lake of Rot)

8: Deeproot Depths

Miquella's Haligtree and Crumbling Farum Azula don't seem to belong to any region and I'm thinking that's because they're separate legacy dungeons that you need to teleport to get to.
    I feel so vindicated seeing your comment list every name correctly. People out here really played the game for hundreds of hours but can't spell "Liurnia" or "Siofra", wtf
        People keep spelling Melania and Malekit as if they don't tell you their name after every time you die.
        Dys Lexia the Spellbane continues to be the hardest boss in souls history.
Is Weeping Peninsula considered part of Limgrave?

I thought it was technically a different area
    I don't think Weeping Peninsula has its own label on the world map, like the major areas have (Limgrave, Caelid, Liurnia, etc.). But that doesn't have to mean anything anyway.
    Yes. Like the Dragonbarrow is still part of Caelid.
Size matters not. Look at Phantom Liberty. The dogtown map was a tiny portion of Night City but it was wayyy more densely packed. It's all how the content is laid out.
Does the weeping peninsula count as Limgrave? I was sort of just imagining the main part of Limgrave excluding the peninsula.

If Miyazaki considers Limgrave to include the peninsula, and he says the DLC is slightly bigger than that, then I am HYYYYYYPED
Weeping Peninsula is a separate location to Limgrave. Technically so is Stormveil. We don't really know what Miyazaki had in mind here.
I did the same on 3 characters and haven't touched the game in probably a year.

I have been jonesing to do another run but am doing my best to hold off to try to forget where most things are.  Was praying for a march or april release but the longer I wait the fresher I hope the game feels.

Elden ring .5 (DS2) in the meantime!
    Yeah, can’t wait for dark souls II 2 part 2 this june
Same. I remember being slightly disappointed when it was first announced that it would only take like 30 hours to beat. And then I spent 130 hours on a playthrough and even after 5 full runs with new characters, I’ve yet to finish a run in less than 90 hours.
Time for bonkus of the konkus
It'll be about as big as the [Strider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9XHn33WWHo) from Armor Core 6.
    The scaling of stuff in AC6 is so hilarious to me, everytime I’m in an elevator with a 1000 ft ceiling I’m just like… who TF built this? Lmao

Don’t even get me started on the Coral funnel, literally larger than multiple planets lol
        Yeah the vascular plant is basically the size of Pluto, how tf did Rubicon even build something like that without mining a planet the size of Jupiter for all the raw materials.
            If it’s the size of Pluto, couldn’t they just disassemble a dwarf planet the size of Pluto? Doesn’t seem that crazy.
                They could, if the planet is composed of 100% metal.
                    Well alright, disassemble a few. There’s more than one dwarf planet in our solar system.

Edit: really the crazy thing seems more how quickly they seemed to do it, rather than that they did it at all.
            I had the exact same thought, but hey, Rule of Cool
    That thing honestly blew my mind.

Hmm i gotta climb some AT-AT / Tallneck thingy? No sweat! 

Then i come face to face with it struggling to boost up this thing. My En barely makes it in a lot of sections. Then you consider our ACs are actually giant robots akin to most buildings..

Strider is YUGE
Lets not overhype it.
    Exactly and the size shouldn’t be the end all be ball thing anyway. I’ll take an old hunters/ringed city size dlc packed with great content over a huge empty and repetitive open world land mass like base er any day of the week
Anything smaller than that would surprise me. It took 2 years of development and costs 66% as much as the main game.

I don't need it to be enormous as long as the content is really good, but yeah I except it to be at least as big as the lower plateau.
    To be fair the base game was an insane value relative. I got 100 hours on my first playthrough and now up to 350 even if the base game was $120 it would be more than worth it for me. So $40 for even 10 hours of content is worth it in my book.
That's what I was expecting. Three main zones of the original map.
I still think that’s underestimating it tbh
It's generally better to underpromise and overdeliver. That strategy leads to amazed, surprised and excited fans, the other way around, they'll be simply content if things go according to the plan, or even disappointed if you ultimately can't deliver on your promises for any reason.
    Yeah u don’t wanna say ‘it’s two times the size of the ER map’ and then it’s the size of Weeping Penninsula
        It doesn't even have to be a false promise… you may have every intention of fulfilling it when you say it, but then you hit development setbacks, cuts or deadlines – or you realize the original vision evolved and you no longer wish to aim for sheer scale, rather do something more interesting in a smaller area – and then you either have to break your promise, or ditch your vision.

So when you “promise” to *definitely* do something in a DLC, it's often already done.
    I’d think most marketing divisions prefer to overpromise, because they can get amazed, surprised and excited fans *early*. That way they’re more likely to boost preorder sales - which management loves - and probably claim their bonuses & celebratory champagne ahead of time.

“You’re worries about the fans & dev team after the game launches? Eh, not *my* KPI”
as opposed to "the first AAAA game" that is skull and bones
    cyberpunk 77
        Honestly, once they fixed a lot of the bugs and improved some of the optimization and crowd generation, it really did live up to a lot of its promise. It still lacked a few things, but it was largely held back by technical flaws, not lack of content.
        cyberpunk in its current state is right up there in quality with elden ring.
            Man I wish I could get into it. I've tried multiple times now. Maybe it's just too overwhelming for me?
                Ur talking about cyberpunk?
                    I am.
                        It took me 4 or 5 attempts to finally get into it. If you enjoy the genre and games like it, id say just try to keep going and see if it eventually clicks. Easily atleast an 8/10 game for me. And if it never does click, sobeit, not all games are for everyone.
                            I will try again. I want to love it.
            To me Cyberpunk is no better than Far Cry 5 and nowhere near The Witcher 3 or Elden Ring
The phrasing from [the IGN interview](https://www.ign.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-interview) is:

>It's hard to answer without giving away too much and to a high degree of accuracy, but if you think in terms of scale or size, it's probably comparable, if not larger, than the area of Limgrave from the base game.

The [Eurogamer interview](https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-fromsoftwares-largest-expansion-ever) is similar:

>In terms of pure surface area, you could think of something larger even than Limgrave in the base game.
    Pure Surface area.

What about underground area?
        Asking the right questions.
            Ok Danvers
        It's the size of the entire elden ring map excluding the existing underground areas. The underground map after dlc will be filled like the normal map.
    Thx.

Funny thing is I found that article seconds after I posted this comment!
When it released I spent my first 12 hours stuck in that one cave above aeonia swamp, that the one portal chest by dragon Agheel takes you to. And then also aeonia swamp.

Because I didn't realize fast travel from anywhere was possible.
    When it released I got stuck on character creation to this day
        Damn. I couldn't even get past the screen that says "Press any button".
            Where is the any button?
                Yeah I can't find that either. I really don't want to mess something up by hitting the wrong button, so I've been unable to play the game.
    It’s so funny how our first time that place was like hell and so hard to escape. 

Then yesterday I started a new playthrough and went through it just for shits and giggles and left the cave unscathed and teleported back in probably 3 minutes
        It wasn't bad for me because I found the entrance pretty fast. If you go the wrong way and don't realize you can just leave than yeah it could be rough.
        It's my preferred area to play in now. Wish there was more content there.
    I still remember fighting that star beast at launch after being sent there with the chest from limgrave... took me many hours to beat at like soul level 20 or so XD and I was using a flail, that was rough! Turns out a few patches later they even realised that the ''fully grown'' fallingstar beast was in there, rather than the younger variant. 

One of my proudest moments!
Literally how is that possible. Were you just walking everywhere and dying 100s of times ?
    You only get 1 first playthrough and I wanted to take my time with it. I checked every corner of the map, killed every boss, then helped another player kill the boss at least once as a summon. Hunted invaders. All solo cuz summoning help isn't fun for me so naturally I would die more often from learning the bosses.
Yeah same
I did it in 60, but that’s probably with 2/3rd of the side stuff being uncompleted. I just wanted to end the suffering lol
I mean just looking at the surface in the trailer, I doubt it will be as empty as the mountaintops
In an interview they stated that the dlc was supposed to be more dense with more intricate level design in the open world.
    Do you know where this was said?
Ringed city was also less than half the price (and $25 got you both dlcs) so I certainly hope it's much bigger.
Yeah if you aren't meandering around, you can beat the game pretty fast even if you're not an expert or speedrunner.

I 100% the game in almost exactly 100 hours, and that includes more than one playthrough. Some people just play games faster than others.
Not sure about a new character, but sometimes, I mindlessly go through NG+ when I'm trying to decompress. Literally only doing required bosses, it takes about 2 hours or more.
10+ bosses is still a lot. For comparison both DS3 DLCs combined have 7, DS2's has 9, Bloodborne's has 5, and DS1's has 4. 


If we're getting 40 bosses, that's 15 more than every other game's DLC combined.
    Well that's certainly true, but I guess what I mean to say is that the way Elden Ring is designed, having only like, say, 12 bosses in a region is incongruous with the rest of the game.

Take for example Runebears. There are like 40 in the game, but only one is a "boss", at the end of Earthbore Cave. In a previous Souls game they wouldn't bother making an enemy like a Runebear a full boss, but in Elden Ring they made it a dungeon boss one time. I suppose some people might call that a "mini-boss" but I consider anything with a boss health bar to be a boss.

So when Miyazaki says we're getting just over 10 bosses, I assume we're getting 10 "major" bosses, and that we're getting 20-30 "minor" bosses like field bosses or dungeon bosses. I'm willing to be wrong but I'm just basing my prediction on how the rest of the game is put together.
        Oh for sure I expect a bunch of "mini bosses" scattered around to fill the space.


10-15 main bosses would be pretty much on average for the past DLCs size, so we're eating good.
        I remember someone datamine during colosseum update that they found 30 boss tag or something like that. Could be the case. Or it could be they scrap 30 boss during development maybe.
        Based off of cutscenes alone, I'd say it's 10 bosses with cutscenes, for whatever that is worth. Bosses from the small dungeons and caves don't get cutscenes, so I'm guessing he's not counting those.

If we take everything at face value, this interview could be disappointing. 10 bosses when the main game has 120, 1/6th the size of the base game in area, all for $40. But I'm sure once it comes out we'll probably be more than satisfied. The map could be much less open and much more jam packed with stuff. Based on surface area alone, you could probably almost fit the entirety of dark souls 3 into limgrave.
        Fun fact, depending on if you kill a mini boss, a big boss, or a legacy dungeon demi god, there is different text for what you've slain, so there are not all viewed as ''bosses'' in the same way.
        > region is incongruous with the rest of the game

The DLC will (and should) be incongruous with the base game, all their DLC are usually minor evolution of the base game, they take all the lessons learned making the base game into the DLC, that's why they usually are the best content they produce.
        Watch it be 3 unique remembrances and 7 base game reskins
            I mean based on the trailer feel like that’s easily off
    Plus a lot of the bosses in the base game are repeats of things you can fight elsewhere. If they're doing fewer bosses in Shadow of the Erdtree, then hopefully they're all unique and more meaningful.
    Ds3 dlc has 6 bosses 🤓
        Technically 7 since Demon In Pain and Demon From Below have separate healthbars
            I mean, technically 9 then, Friede, Friede & Ariandel, Blackflame Friede
                Also wolf and the gladiator right?
Im fairly sure those are 10+ unique main bosses, plus we know there will be optional bosses on the level of Melania
    I can't imagine that optional bosses akin to Melania aren't counted in this metric. But they are also probably not counting every encounter like the ones at the small dungeons.

Like, I can't imagine Miyazaki counting a Crucible Knight (which is a normal enemy that gets used as a boss early in the game) and something like Godrick or Maliketh as the same kind of boss.
        Yes I think what miyazakis point is that there are 10 "great enemy felled" moments 
By over 10 bosses he is certainly referring to solely the “main” bosses in the DLC, which would be significant encounters like Morgott, Malenia, etc.

My guess is we’ll get 5 or 6 remembrance bosses, and 7 bosses that are unique encounters/fights but are less charismatic and less important to the narrative (i.e. Loretta, Leonine Misbegotten, Dragonkin Soldierof Nokstella, etc.). Then we’ll get about 20 other “bosses” like the ones we see in hero’s graves, which will be new elite enemies and stuff like that.
    Seems likely
By 10 bosses he probably means story bosses like the remembrance ones from the base game
    Which is insane because there are only 15 Remembrance bosses in the main game. Not saying all 10 of these "Unique" main bosses will have remembrances but if they do we're gonna be spending a ton of time in this expansion.
        I mean, they better be worth the 40 bucks they are charging for it
            I have never been disappointed in a single dime I have spent on From Soft games and I have bought every game and DLC since Dark Souls 1 at full price.
I figured that meant 10 new remberances like that level of boss
Limgrave only has 1 remembrance boss and 3 achievement bosses. 

The DLC will surely have at least 5 remembrance bosses.
I have such high hopes for this. The last time I paid for a game was in 2013. Just got the entire ER+dlc bundle. Oh man.
Siofra is certainly counted as its own region if we're talking about "the size of Limgrave"
I'm not really expecting anything insane like I have seen so many people do here. I am just poking fun at doomers that immediatly think that this means it's tiny, eventhough Limgrave is huge
    I getchu. I mainly meant the other dudes in here speculating it'll be Limgrave and Liurnia sized conjoined
The Ringed City is an average of 8 1/2 hours, according to How Long to Beat. Shadow of the Erdtree is definitely going to be longer than 10.


Just going by the price (which is three times higher) it should be at least 30.
    I seen people get stuck on Malenia for 20+ hours. The DLC will surely bring at least one or two bosses on her level. 

The play time will be huge.
The base story (Elden lord achievement) can be completed relatively quickly if you just go for the base ending.
You can become Elden Lord in a really short amount of time. If your skills are up to par. Beat Godfrey, beat Really and off you go to the endgame.
    Thats the main quest. Im clearly not just talking about the main quest
That doesn't count the second run imo, discovering the game takes much more time, it takes only 1 hour if u speedrun the game but it implies that ur already know what the game contains
Avg completion time is 110 hrs according HLTB & various websites that track player progression
    Me and all my friends clocked in near the 70-80 hour mark I can see the dlc being 30 hours if you have half a brain and a competent build
I doubt that.
    Well it's true.
The specs are probably just copypasted from the base game. Happens a lot with DLCs, for example DS3, AoA and RC.
Downvote me more Reddit.
Or better yet, farmable tears.
That bald hack would take 400 hours he can’t even do 2d platformers.
Making a whole game of that size in that time frame and then also have it be good is insane
I have 700 hours and I’m still not bored of the base games weapons. I’m so hyped
    Same, this is one of my main excitement points. The game is still drawing me back to it with new builds i havent tried yet, and now were getting so many new weapons and even new weapon types? And new enemies to test all of it on? Man, im hyped as well
        Going to do another playthrough after a year long break today, any wacky fun builds you'd recommend?
            depends on what you've already done

powerstanced Great Hammers on a pure str/end build was probably my favorite. but it means farming the duelists outside the lyendell colosseum for a second hammer. (the brick hammer in stormveil is good for the first)

it's probably not as "good" as a giant crusher or GUGS build, but it's fun

i also had a lot of fun powerstancing the DMGS and Helphen's Steeple, because you look pretty cool when you have both AOWs active. Plus you can still be a very good caster, you'll be pretty limited on armor choices though.

edit: if you can't tell i think powerstancing weapons is really fun and you should try it if you haven't on past playthroughs

edit 2: dual straight swords is actually really fun as well. square off is the most underrated skill in the game, because no one uses straight swords after the first hour unless it's a SONAF build.
                Great Mace is also a free pickup in a chest before the Grand Lift of Dectus, middle of that camp near the siege weapons.

You can also get two Great Stars now in Altus Plateau, free bleed and heal on hit. There's one in the caravan on the Road of Iniquity Side Path and one at the Writheblood Ruins when you progress Varré's quest to where he gives bloody fingers for invading. A sign for invading Magnus the Beast Claw is around and beating him rewards the second Great Stars.

The Battle Hammer great hammer is my favorite fashion hammer, just sucks you need to farm those Duelists for it but the drop rate isn't horrendous with some boosted item discovery.
                    I was mostly recommending the battle hammer for fashion purposes.

Twin great stars is probably better just bc bleed is so strong.
                        Yeah but fashion is tops therefore Battle Hammer is best! But some might not wanna do that farm so I was giving backup options. Great Stars is one of my faves but it looks horrid with most armor sets lol
                The duelist greataxe is pretty awesome too, did a stark cosplay with it and the drake knight armor, looked pretty sick
                    i do love obnoxiously heavy dex weapons. hopefully the Exile GS from DS3 makes a return
                Came here to say that dual straight swords and square off carried me through a RL1 playthrough.  It's fast, strong and fun.  Only downside is that I played for 500 hours before giving straight swords a chance.
                    i thought square off  had to be bugged when i first went back to it. the stance damage is so strong for such a fast and light weapon.
                I’m using Blaidd’s set with the Raging Wolf helm and it looks pretty lit with the Ghostflame active.  Kind of have a spirit wolf theme going using Latenna’s ashes as well.
                what's DGMS
                    Dark moon greatsword
                        ohh ok thank you
                            No worries, hopefully I've convinced you that two glowing magic swords are better than one
            Wacky is fun, but I'll chime in and say I consistently had best experience (pve and pvp) by going back to the roots. 

Shield and mace. Big bonk colossal. Straight sword and pyro incantations in offhand. These kinds of builds have repeatedly proven to have a very solid core gameplay, with enough room for weaponplay and expression to feel interesting. Ever beat malenia by simply blocking her waterfowl with 2h weapon, or killed an invader by sending them to the moon with Upward Cut, then pointed up? It feels sublime.
                I killed an invader with Niall's thunder kick, and used crucible horns to knock people over guard rails to fall to their death 🤣


Pvp is fun
                    Yesssss someone else finally mentioned Niall's peg leg! I feel like nobody knows how fun it is.
                        You best believe im making a build all around this new jump kick weapon 
                            Bonefist 2 hallow boogaloo
            Faith Lightdiscuss from the Rotspears of Malenias Knights + Magic-Reflection Shield. You shoot your discus, when it returns you reflect it for INSANE dmg. It is hard to pull off, but absolutely fun and satisfying to me.

  
Sorry, i do not remember the actual names :D Think the Spear is the Cleanrot-Spear and has an abysmal dropchance :>
            Anything combo'd with ARC is good if you know where to look, INT probably is the worst stat to combo with right now as you just have bubble spells which are okay but definitely weird. ARC/FTH for dragon communion incantations. DEX/ARC for bleed weapons like Rivers of Blood, Eleonoras Poleblade, Godskin Peeler. STR/ARC for Mohg Spear and even the Marais Executioner Sword, plus any weapons with innate Bleed are amazing for ARC as you can put Occult affinity on them for good damage and better bleed both, it's a great pure ARC affinity.

FTH can do everything too, pairs well with all stats and lets you do a variety of builds.
            It's a long time to get going, but a Frenzy build is crazy. Not good, but crazy.
            my current playthrough is naked with the large club. nothing like running around killing gods in a loincloth with a big stick
            I recommend either going wacky heal focused faith build with the heal on hit weapons and blasphemous blade focused with great stars secondaries

- key focus is on the healing vs maxing damage with it.

Or 

Ultimate use everything build ready for DLC
Focus on getting all stats to 20-25 via both levels and items

Only level vigor, endurance etc for equip load, with a lil of fp leveling.

Go into DLC being able to test out anything you pickup
        Same lol said I was gonna replay it after beating it after about 2 months came back and beat it like 3 times lol
    But club go bonk
        but maybe new DLC club so we can bonk twice at once
            *Unga Bunga intensifies*
                one bonk good, so two bonks better!
    Yea man, experimenting different kinds of weapons are my go to, even fully upgrading all of em (60% progress of leveling all weapons)
Im 100% doing all NG+ with the karate moveset
It's also an endgame dlc so you'll probably want to go through NG+ once or twice with lots of shiny new toys. Amount of hours expected for play is deceiving in a souls game, usually in the players favor.
Someone pointed out that the weapon they do the crucible move with is an actual shield weapon and I'm so excited
    Maybe its an ash of war you can put on anything
Finally going to bonk elden beast with some martial arts
    We can finally kick runebears in the nuts
Fuck me, the dickriding is insane. People like you piss me off and are the reason why the gaming industry is as shit as it is. Have some standards ffs
    Shut up loser
The sleep swamp is just math class
And deathblight
2.5 years development work on a 10/10 platform of a game. I bet it's freaking massive! But ya, if ER had 80 bosses the dlc needs at least 50 new ones.
Myazaki also said this is the biggest DLC they have ever made.
This means they’ll finally get around to the sekiro dlc right
I imagine we're getting 10 or more unique bosses. DLCs tend to have lots of high quality bosses relative to the actual size of the DLC, so hopefully it's 10 or more remembrance bosses.
    I wouldn't needlessly hype ourselves up like that.

10 unique bosses? Yes.

"Akshually there's more than 10 and they meant just 10 uniques?" No.

The only thing worth noting is that *world* bosses can be significant without necessarily being bosses. Golems for example are not actual bosses (ok once, as a beginner boss for one earlygame cave) but are still a significant fight. From the trailer alone, I could see the hippo, lion and wicker man all being world "bosses" or significant enemies and not adding to the boss count.
        Miyazaki said at least 10 bosses. That was the wording. And I can't imagine it would be anything but new bosses.

The quality of the bosses is still unknown. I'm hoping for Remembrance level bosses. BB and DS3's DLCs had lots of high quality bosses. Considering Shadow of the Erdtree is a way bigger DLC than any of those I'd expect nothing less than 5 Remembrance tier bosses.
        didnt miyazaki literally say more than 10 nee bosses? lmao
It's definitely more than just 10 bosses. I count at least 8 enemies that are definitely bosses, and a few more that are probably bosses.

1. Wicker man

2. Lion Dancers

3. Messmer

4. The Twinblade Knight that gets kicked (Looks like boss arena, fogwall in the background, has the twinblade used at the end of the trailer)

5. Gravity lance boar rider

6. Hippo-porcupine

7. The thing riding the half dissolved horse

8. The dude pulling the sword out of himself

And maybe bosses: 

1. The Nox/Carian person

2. Leech snake thing (honestly not too sure about this one)

2. The three things the reverse grip sword user fights (looks like a boss arena)

3. The red dancer lady
    Twin blade knight feels like a Soldier of Godrick situation to me. His design is too basic to be a unique, 1 and done boss. I imagine after this fight he’ll appear more commonly as a regular mob. So I wouldn’t count him personally
        I agree he doesn't look like boss material. I wouldn't think he was a boss either if it wasn't for the very obvious boss room he's placed in. However, I also don't think it makes sense for him to be a Soldier of Godrick type boss. Soldier of Godrick is a tutorial boss. The DLC is tuned for endgame, and is locked behind Mohg and Radahn, that's rather far into the game for a single generic looking knight to be a boss. 


I think it's much more likely that he's *not* the boss, but is a part of a larger boss fight, like the soldiers Niall summons.
            Could also be a "enemy outside the boss room" situation. But yeah i hope future interviews give some clarification on that metric. Ideally, they're 10+ remembrance calibur bosses/bosses too unique to show up twice. It would fit the pricing at least. 2/3 the price of the game and 2/3 the number of remembrance bosses. 

&#x200B;

No way did they reveal about 8 of the at least 11 bosses in the first trailer unless the boss number is 15 or more i hope.
Wait, it’s all limgrave?
    Always has been
        limgrave deez nuts
            Got em
    It's all Limgrave except for the Haligtree, which is only not Limgrave because Limgrave doesn't know how to get there to annex it (they can't look out up because they don't have Internet access)
    Other than the part that is Ohio
        And Australia
You can definitely map out all the graves ive made for myself all over the Lands Between
Damn, true, my bad...
    Under Limgrave, all things converge.
        yessir
            What kind of fool do you take me for? He's Limgrave, he's Limgrave, you're Limgrave... I'm Limgrave! Are there any other Limb-graves I should know about?!
                Floating limgrave ……
                Hi Limgrave,

Please meet my friend Limgrave,

Yours Limgravely,

Limgrave
                Would the real Limgrave please stand up
Kenneth Haight, supreme ruler of all creation
Don’t forget about wet Limgrave!
    Of course of course and wet limgrave
dont forget golden limgrave!
And Broken Limgrave
Limgrave beyond time, alternative tree Limgrave, and the other Limgrave that no one talks about
Then later on finding the teleport to the top of Leyndell. I think at that point my brain just broke.
Dunkey described this perfectly in his Elden ring video
Technically, the entire ER map is "slightly bigger" than Limgrave.
Bro i m 212 before i finished, if i die to a boss 10 times i would go level up 5 or so times then come back try again. Melania got me from like 120 to 190.
    I…uh…missed her in my first play through. 

I actually missed the entire Consecrated Snowfield (and albunaric village) and only went to it to get the Haligdrake Talisman to beat Radagon/Elden Beast
        I missed out on a few things because i literally start choppin at whatever I see, ended up killing a few NPCs like patches and boc.
150 is pretty standard for a playthrough where explore a bunch tbh
I was over 200 when I finished the game. Got sidetracked, did a bunch of other stuff, then went to wipe the floor with Maliketh.

…


…

Still got my shit pushed in.
I just completed my 4th playthrough and I still was almost level 150 when I beat it despite not even trying to be super thorough about exploring literally everything lol. I did use gold fowl feet for bosses to be fair.
Fk…I’m around 150 and probably died to Elden beast 100 times now…with mimic tear… certified garbage player
    Don't worry about it bro, and don't call yourself garbage. Just keep at it Tarnished! You got this! Don't think about how you fare against others, each of us has different experiences, reactions to things, and most importantly, take in information very differently.
        Haha yea…haven’t enjoyed gaming this much in 10+ years. Never tried this genre before Elden ring. I remember picking it up and giving up after a few hours, came back a month later and here I am now.  Picked up lies of P after I got tired of dying to Elden beast lol, also fun but didn’t hit the same way.
            Well welcome to the genre! Defo look for older souls titles as those were really good, especially for their time, but stuff like sekiro, dark souls 3 and even bloodborne still hold up to today's standards imo!

Glad to hear you are having a blast!
This was me too but I did a ton of exploring and wanted to make sure I didn’t miss anything major like Malenia.
*Coughs in dozens mohgwyn birb massacres*


Edit: my fist play through ended at lvl 278
AFAIK Lower Sofria River is called "Limgrave Misc." in the game files for difficulty scaling.

however the rest of Siofra like Mogywyn Palace and Nokron have their own names in the area scalings
I thinks the new dungeon type he was talking about thats more, to paraphrase, "integrated into the overworld" will be an elaboration of the ruins. So instead of each Ruin just having 1 boss room/chest room, they'll have a couple, perhaps interconnected underground, and will be bigger.
> new kind of dungeons, that are more interconnected to the world

I swear, if I end up in Blackreach again...
so is the DLC more game than the base game?
    No. It is still smaller than the base game. But even more dense. So from what he said we can assume more content that the size of the map will make it seem. So more Game than limgrave
        My guess would maybe be… 1/4th or 1/3rd of the base game in terms of content?

Seeing as Elden Ring has 6 legacy dungeons and this dlc will have at least 2, it’s definitely going to be jam packed with content.
They said they wanted to make it more dense so a Limgrave sized area with about twice or three times as much to do in it is... a lot.
    *runs away from problem straight into open mouth of other problem*
    More dense? I can see how you can save on some longer roads, but besides that the game was already pretty close packed. Myazaki what you done this time
        Man, have you not heard the open-world bitchers roaming around whining about the open-world aspects of the game?
            No. Actually I havent
                Here's a thread:
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/t30r97/open_world_boring/

You'll find them roaming through the forums randomly stating how they would like elden ring so much more if it wasn't open world.
                    I believe you that they exist. But for real I just didnt have them on my radar. I mean I also like Fromsofts linear Formular more, but I also want them to try stuff out and improve. You cant progress when you stagnate lol
    I'm sure we'll still be left feeling a little bit worse about ourselves for having interacted with anyone at all, with luck.
        what
            I was saying npc questlines will probably still be sad. Which I like about these games. 

Downvotes gonna downvote though.
That entire game isn’t as good as Limgrave LMAO.
    I probably spent more hours in Stormveil Castle than in Starfield.
    When after the tutorial that dude was like


"Yeah man I'll just work your grueling manual labor job even though my robot is RIGHT HERE, you take my ship and fly around the galaxy in it ☺️"


I dipped
        You got further than me. I stopped when the game was so consistent and immersive with a story so well connected to the World, that after I woke up from character creation, I was told by the NPC that it makes no sense for me to be there. It was also never mentioned ever at any point after
 The game just accepted that it already broke its World building before the Tutorial came to an end and that is unexcusable.
        that isn’t what happens at all lol
    I liked it for a bit but when gameplay became running back to the 2 human cities to re-buy ammo for the only guns I had worth a fuck while the ammo most peons dropped were for guns that tickled enemies, I got bored fast
Phantom liberty map was so small compared to the city but damn was it packed
Tbh if the DLC is as big and polished as Limgrave, but at an endgame difficulty level, then it would be great. Limgrave was probably the most fun I had in Elden Ring since everything was new, exploration was really rewarding with tons of cool encounters you'd just run into and the quest design was more logical than the rest of the game.
    I didnt find Torrent for probably 3-4 hours, just wondering the countryside taking my time, ducking in and out of trouble, mapping the world, getting my ass kicked. I think I spent 20 hours at least picking apart Limgrave on my first playthrough, excited and terrified of what horrible surprise would come next (after discovering the caelid trap chest lol)... couldn't believe how massive the game ended up being. Hope to get that same feeling of awe and discovery in the DLC
I feel so vindicated seeing your comment list every name correctly. People out here really played the game for hundreds of hours but can't spell "Liurnia" or "Siofra", wtf
    People keep spelling Melania and Malekit as if they don't tell you their name after every time you die.
    Dys Lexia the Spellbane continues to be the hardest boss in souls history.
I don't think Weeping Peninsula has its own label on the world map, like the major areas have (Limgrave, Caelid, Liurnia, etc.). But that doesn't have to mean anything anyway.
Yes. Like the Dragonbarrow is still part of Caelid.
Yeah, can’t wait for dark souls II 2 part 2 this june
The scaling of stuff in AC6 is so hilarious to me, everytime I’m in an elevator with a 1000 ft ceiling I’m just like… who TF built this? Lmao

Don’t even get me started on the Coral funnel, literally larger than multiple planets lol
    Yeah the vascular plant is basically the size of Pluto, how tf did Rubicon even build something like that without mining a planet the size of Jupiter for all the raw materials.
        If it’s the size of Pluto, couldn’t they just disassemble a dwarf planet the size of Pluto? Doesn’t seem that crazy.
            They could, if the planet is composed of 100% metal.
                Well alright, disassemble a few. There’s more than one dwarf planet in our solar system.

Edit: really the crazy thing seems more how quickly they seemed to do it, rather than that they did it at all.
        I had the exact same thought, but hey, Rule of Cool
That thing honestly blew my mind.

Hmm i gotta climb some AT-AT / Tallneck thingy? No sweat! 

Then i come face to face with it struggling to boost up this thing. My En barely makes it in a lot of sections. Then you consider our ACs are actually giant robots akin to most buildings..

Strider is YUGE
Exactly and the size shouldn’t be the end all be ball thing anyway. I’ll take an old hunters/ringed city size dlc packed with great content over a huge empty and repetitive open world land mass like base er any day of the week
To be fair the base game was an insane value relative. I got 100 hours on my first playthrough and now up to 350 even if the base game was $120 it would be more than worth it for me. So $40 for even 10 hours of content is worth it in my book.
Yeah u don’t wanna say ‘it’s two times the size of the ER map’ and then it’s the size of Weeping Penninsula
    It doesn't even have to be a false promise… you may have every intention of fulfilling it when you say it, but then you hit development setbacks, cuts or deadlines – or you realize the original vision evolved and you no longer wish to aim for sheer scale, rather do something more interesting in a smaller area – and then you either have to break your promise, or ditch your vision.

So when you “promise” to *definitely* do something in a DLC, it's often already done.
I’d think most marketing divisions prefer to overpromise, because they can get amazed, surprised and excited fans *early*. That way they’re more likely to boost preorder sales - which management loves - and probably claim their bonuses & celebratory champagne ahead of time.

“You’re worries about the fans & dev team after the game launches? Eh, not *my* KPI”
cyberpunk 77
    Honestly, once they fixed a lot of the bugs and improved some of the optimization and crowd generation, it really did live up to a lot of its promise. It still lacked a few things, but it was largely held back by technical flaws, not lack of content.
    cyberpunk in its current state is right up there in quality with elden ring.
        Man I wish I could get into it. I've tried multiple times now. Maybe it's just too overwhelming for me?
            Ur talking about cyberpunk?
                I am.
                    It took me 4 or 5 attempts to finally get into it. If you enjoy the genre and games like it, id say just try to keep going and see if it eventually clicks. Easily atleast an 8/10 game for me. And if it never does click, sobeit, not all games are for everyone.
                        I will try again. I want to love it.
        To me Cyberpunk is no better than Far Cry 5 and nowhere near The Witcher 3 or Elden Ring
Pure Surface area.

What about underground area?
    Asking the right questions.
        Ok Danvers
    It's the size of the entire elden ring map excluding the existing underground areas. The underground map after dlc will be filled like the normal map.
Thx.

Funny thing is I found that article seconds after I posted this comment!
When it released I got stuck on character creation to this day
    Damn. I couldn't even get past the screen that says "Press any button".
        Where is the any button?
            Yeah I can't find that either. I really don't want to mess something up by hitting the wrong button, so I've been unable to play the game.
It’s so funny how our first time that place was like hell and so hard to escape. 

Then yesterday I started a new playthrough and went through it just for shits and giggles and left the cave unscathed and teleported back in probably 3 minutes
    It wasn't bad for me because I found the entrance pretty fast. If you go the wrong way and don't realize you can just leave than yeah it could be rough.
    It's my preferred area to play in now. Wish there was more content there.
I still remember fighting that star beast at launch after being sent there with the chest from limgrave... took me many hours to beat at like soul level 20 or so XD and I was using a flail, that was rough! Turns out a few patches later they even realised that the ''fully grown'' fallingstar beast was in there, rather than the younger variant. 

One of my proudest moments!
You only get 1 first playthrough and I wanted to take my time with it. I checked every corner of the map, killed every boss, then helped another player kill the boss at least once as a summon. Hunted invaders. All solo cuz summoning help isn't fun for me so naturally I would die more often from learning the bosses.
Do you know where this was said?
Well that's certainly true, but I guess what I mean to say is that the way Elden Ring is designed, having only like, say, 12 bosses in a region is incongruous with the rest of the game.

Take for example Runebears. There are like 40 in the game, but only one is a "boss", at the end of Earthbore Cave. In a previous Souls game they wouldn't bother making an enemy like a Runebear a full boss, but in Elden Ring they made it a dungeon boss one time. I suppose some people might call that a "mini-boss" but I consider anything with a boss health bar to be a boss.

So when Miyazaki says we're getting just over 10 bosses, I assume we're getting 10 "major" bosses, and that we're getting 20-30 "minor" bosses like field bosses or dungeon bosses. I'm willing to be wrong but I'm just basing my prediction on how the rest of the game is put together.
    Oh for sure I expect a bunch of "mini bosses" scattered around to fill the space.


10-15 main bosses would be pretty much on average for the past DLCs size, so we're eating good.
    I remember someone datamine during colosseum update that they found 30 boss tag or something like that. Could be the case. Or it could be they scrap 30 boss during development maybe.
    Based off of cutscenes alone, I'd say it's 10 bosses with cutscenes, for whatever that is worth. Bosses from the small dungeons and caves don't get cutscenes, so I'm guessing he's not counting those.

If we take everything at face value, this interview could be disappointing. 10 bosses when the main game has 120, 1/6th the size of the base game in area, all for $40. But I'm sure once it comes out we'll probably be more than satisfied. The map could be much less open and much more jam packed with stuff. Based on surface area alone, you could probably almost fit the entirety of dark souls 3 into limgrave.
    Fun fact, depending on if you kill a mini boss, a big boss, or a legacy dungeon demi god, there is different text for what you've slain, so there are not all viewed as ''bosses'' in the same way.
    > region is incongruous with the rest of the game

The DLC will (and should) be incongruous with the base game, all their DLC are usually minor evolution of the base game, they take all the lessons learned making the base game into the DLC, that's why they usually are the best content they produce.
    Watch it be 3 unique remembrances and 7 base game reskins
        I mean based on the trailer feel like that’s easily off
Plus a lot of the bosses in the base game are repeats of things you can fight elsewhere. If they're doing fewer bosses in Shadow of the Erdtree, then hopefully they're all unique and more meaningful.
Ds3 dlc has 6 bosses 🤓
    Technically 7 since Demon In Pain and Demon From Below have separate healthbars
        I mean, technically 9 then, Friede, Friede & Ariandel, Blackflame Friede
            Also wolf and the gladiator right?
I can't imagine that optional bosses akin to Melania aren't counted in this metric. But they are also probably not counting every encounter like the ones at the small dungeons.

Like, I can't imagine Miyazaki counting a Crucible Knight (which is a normal enemy that gets used as a boss early in the game) and something like Godrick or Maliketh as the same kind of boss.
    Yes I think what miyazakis point is that there are 10 "great enemy felled" moments 
Seems likely
Which is insane because there are only 15 Remembrance bosses in the main game. Not saying all 10 of these "Unique" main bosses will have remembrances but if they do we're gonna be spending a ton of time in this expansion.
    I mean, they better be worth the 40 bucks they are charging for it
        I have never been disappointed in a single dime I have spent on From Soft games and I have bought every game and DLC since Dark Souls 1 at full price.
I getchu. I mainly meant the other dudes in here speculating it'll be Limgrave and Liurnia sized conjoined
I seen people get stuck on Malenia for 20+ hours. The DLC will surely bring at least one or two bosses on her level. 

The play time will be huge.
Thats the main quest. Im clearly not just talking about the main quest
Me and all my friends clocked in near the 70-80 hour mark I can see the dlc being 30 hours if you have half a brain and a competent build
Well it's true.
Same, this is one of my main excitement points. The game is still drawing me back to it with new builds i havent tried yet, and now were getting so many new weapons and even new weapon types? And new enemies to test all of it on? Man, im hyped as well
    Going to do another playthrough after a year long break today, any wacky fun builds you'd recommend?
        depends on what you've already done

powerstanced Great Hammers on a pure str/end build was probably my favorite. but it means farming the duelists outside the lyendell colosseum for a second hammer. (the brick hammer in stormveil is good for the first)

it's probably not as "good" as a giant crusher or GUGS build, but it's fun

i also had a lot of fun powerstancing the DMGS and Helphen's Steeple, because you look pretty cool when you have both AOWs active. Plus you can still be a very good caster, you'll be pretty limited on armor choices though.

edit: if you can't tell i think powerstancing weapons is really fun and you should try it if you haven't on past playthroughs

edit 2: dual straight swords is actually really fun as well. square off is the most underrated skill in the game, because no one uses straight swords after the first hour unless it's a SONAF build.
            Great Mace is also a free pickup in a chest before the Grand Lift of Dectus, middle of that camp near the siege weapons.

You can also get two Great Stars now in Altus Plateau, free bleed and heal on hit. There's one in the caravan on the Road of Iniquity Side Path and one at the Writheblood Ruins when you progress Varré's quest to where he gives bloody fingers for invading. A sign for invading Magnus the Beast Claw is around and beating him rewards the second Great Stars.

The Battle Hammer great hammer is my favorite fashion hammer, just sucks you need to farm those Duelists for it but the drop rate isn't horrendous with some boosted item discovery.
                I was mostly recommending the battle hammer for fashion purposes.

Twin great stars is probably better just bc bleed is so strong.
                    Yeah but fashion is tops therefore Battle Hammer is best! But some might not wanna do that farm so I was giving backup options. Great Stars is one of my faves but it looks horrid with most armor sets lol
            The duelist greataxe is pretty awesome too, did a stark cosplay with it and the drake knight armor, looked pretty sick
                i do love obnoxiously heavy dex weapons. hopefully the Exile GS from DS3 makes a return
            Came here to say that dual straight swords and square off carried me through a RL1 playthrough.  It's fast, strong and fun.  Only downside is that I played for 500 hours before giving straight swords a chance.
                i thought square off  had to be bugged when i first went back to it. the stance damage is so strong for such a fast and light weapon.
            I’m using Blaidd’s set with the Raging Wolf helm and it looks pretty lit with the Ghostflame active.  Kind of have a spirit wolf theme going using Latenna’s ashes as well.
            what's DGMS
                Dark moon greatsword
                    ohh ok thank you
                        No worries, hopefully I've convinced you that two glowing magic swords are better than one
        Wacky is fun, but I'll chime in and say I consistently had best experience (pve and pvp) by going back to the roots. 

Shield and mace. Big bonk colossal. Straight sword and pyro incantations in offhand. These kinds of builds have repeatedly proven to have a very solid core gameplay, with enough room for weaponplay and expression to feel interesting. Ever beat malenia by simply blocking her waterfowl with 2h weapon, or killed an invader by sending them to the moon with Upward Cut, then pointed up? It feels sublime.
            I killed an invader with Niall's thunder kick, and used crucible horns to knock people over guard rails to fall to their death 🤣


Pvp is fun
                Yesssss someone else finally mentioned Niall's peg leg! I feel like nobody knows how fun it is.
                    You best believe im making a build all around this new jump kick weapon 
                        Bonefist 2 hallow boogaloo
        Faith Lightdiscuss from the Rotspears of Malenias Knights + Magic-Reflection Shield. You shoot your discus, when it returns you reflect it for INSANE dmg. It is hard to pull off, but absolutely fun and satisfying to me.

  
Sorry, i do not remember the actual names :D Think the Spear is the Cleanrot-Spear and has an abysmal dropchance :>
        Anything combo'd with ARC is good if you know where to look, INT probably is the worst stat to combo with right now as you just have bubble spells which are okay but definitely weird. ARC/FTH for dragon communion incantations. DEX/ARC for bleed weapons like Rivers of Blood, Eleonoras Poleblade, Godskin Peeler. STR/ARC for Mohg Spear and even the Marais Executioner Sword, plus any weapons with innate Bleed are amazing for ARC as you can put Occult affinity on them for good damage and better bleed both, it's a great pure ARC affinity.

FTH can do everything too, pairs well with all stats and lets you do a variety of builds.
        It's a long time to get going, but a Frenzy build is crazy. Not good, but crazy.
        my current playthrough is naked with the large club. nothing like running around killing gods in a loincloth with a big stick
        I recommend either going wacky heal focused faith build with the heal on hit weapons and blasphemous blade focused with great stars secondaries

- key focus is on the healing vs maxing damage with it.

Or 

Ultimate use everything build ready for DLC
Focus on getting all stats to 20-25 via both levels and items

Only level vigor, endurance etc for equip load, with a lil of fp leveling.

Go into DLC being able to test out anything you pickup
    Same lol said I was gonna replay it after beating it after about 2 months came back and beat it like 3 times lol
But club go bonk
    but maybe new DLC club so we can bonk twice at once
        *Unga Bunga intensifies*
            one bonk good, so two bonks better!
Yea man, experimenting different kinds of weapons are my go to, even fully upgrading all of em (60% progress of leveling all weapons)
Maybe its an ash of war you can put on anything
We can finally kick runebears in the nuts
Shut up loser
I wouldn't needlessly hype ourselves up like that.

10 unique bosses? Yes.

"Akshually there's more than 10 and they meant just 10 uniques?" No.

The only thing worth noting is that *world* bosses can be significant without necessarily being bosses. Golems for example are not actual bosses (ok once, as a beginner boss for one earlygame cave) but are still a significant fight. From the trailer alone, I could see the hippo, lion and wicker man all being world "bosses" or significant enemies and not adding to the boss count.
    Miyazaki said at least 10 bosses. That was the wording. And I can't imagine it would be anything but new bosses.

The quality of the bosses is still unknown. I'm hoping for Remembrance level bosses. BB and DS3's DLCs had lots of high quality bosses. Considering Shadow of the Erdtree is a way bigger DLC than any of those I'd expect nothing less than 5 Remembrance tier bosses.
    didnt miyazaki literally say more than 10 nee bosses? lmao
Twin blade knight feels like a Soldier of Godrick situation to me. His design is too basic to be a unique, 1 and done boss. I imagine after this fight he’ll appear more commonly as a regular mob. So I wouldn’t count him personally
    I agree he doesn't look like boss material. I wouldn't think he was a boss either if it wasn't for the very obvious boss room he's placed in. However, I also don't think it makes sense for him to be a Soldier of Godrick type boss. Soldier of Godrick is a tutorial boss. The DLC is tuned for endgame, and is locked behind Mohg and Radahn, that's rather far into the game for a single generic looking knight to be a boss. 


I think it's much more likely that he's *not* the boss, but is a part of a larger boss fight, like the soldiers Niall summons.
        Could also be a "enemy outside the boss room" situation. But yeah i hope future interviews give some clarification on that metric. Ideally, they're 10+ remembrance calibur bosses/bosses too unique to show up twice. It would fit the pricing at least. 2/3 the price of the game and 2/3 the number of remembrance bosses. 

&#x200B;

No way did they reveal about 8 of the at least 11 bosses in the first trailer unless the boss number is 15 or more i hope.
Always has been
    limgrave deez nuts
        Got em
It's all Limgrave except for the Haligtree, which is only not Limgrave because Limgrave doesn't know how to get there to annex it (they can't look out up because they don't have Internet access)
Other than the part that is Ohio
    And Australia
Under Limgrave, all things converge.
    yessir
        What kind of fool do you take me for? He's Limgrave, he's Limgrave, you're Limgrave... I'm Limgrave! Are there any other Limb-graves I should know about?!
            Floating limgrave ……
            Hi Limgrave,

Please meet my friend Limgrave,

Yours Limgravely,

Limgrave
            Would the real Limgrave please stand up
Of course of course and wet limgrave
I…uh…missed her in my first play through. 

I actually missed the entire Consecrated Snowfield (and albunaric village) and only went to it to get the Haligdrake Talisman to beat Radagon/Elden Beast
    I missed out on a few things because i literally start choppin at whatever I see, ended up killing a few NPCs like patches and boc.
Don't worry about it bro, and don't call yourself garbage. Just keep at it Tarnished! You got this! Don't think about how you fare against others, each of us has different experiences, reactions to things, and most importantly, take in information very differently.
    Haha yea…haven’t enjoyed gaming this much in 10+ years. Never tried this genre before Elden ring. I remember picking it up and giving up after a few hours, came back a month later and here I am now.  Picked up lies of P after I got tired of dying to Elden beast lol, also fun but didn’t hit the same way.
        Well welcome to the genre! Defo look for older souls titles as those were really good, especially for their time, but stuff like sekiro, dark souls 3 and even bloodborne still hold up to today's standards imo!

Glad to hear you are having a blast!
No. It is still smaller than the base game. But even more dense. So from what he said we can assume more content that the size of the map will make it seem. So more Game than limgrave
    My guess would maybe be… 1/4th or 1/3rd of the base game in terms of content?

Seeing as Elden Ring has 6 legacy dungeons and this dlc will have at least 2, it’s definitely going to be jam packed with content.
*runs away from problem straight into open mouth of other problem*
More dense? I can see how you can save on some longer roads, but besides that the game was already pretty close packed. Myazaki what you done this time
    Man, have you not heard the open-world bitchers roaming around whining about the open-world aspects of the game?
        No. Actually I havent
            Here's a thread:
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/t30r97/open_world_boring/

You'll find them roaming through the forums randomly stating how they would like elden ring so much more if it wasn't open world.
                I believe you that they exist. But for real I just didnt have them on my radar. I mean I also like Fromsofts linear Formular more, but I also want them to try stuff out and improve. You cant progress when you stagnate lol
I'm sure we'll still be left feeling a little bit worse about ourselves for having interacted with anyone at all, with luck.
    what
        I was saying npc questlines will probably still be sad. Which I like about these games. 

Downvotes gonna downvote though.
I probably spent more hours in Stormveil Castle than in Starfield.
When after the tutorial that dude was like


"Yeah man I'll just work your grueling manual labor job even though my robot is RIGHT HERE, you take my ship and fly around the galaxy in it ☺️"


I dipped
    You got further than me. I stopped when the game was so consistent and immersive with a story so well connected to the World, that after I woke up from character creation, I was told by the NPC that it makes no sense for me to be there. It was also never mentioned ever at any point after
 The game just accepted that it already broke its World building before the Tutorial came to an end and that is unexcusable.
    that isn’t what happens at all lol
I liked it for a bit but when gameplay became running back to the 2 human cities to re-buy ammo for the only guns I had worth a fuck while the ammo most peons dropped were for guns that tickled enemies, I got bored fast
I didnt find Torrent for probably 3-4 hours, just wondering the countryside taking my time, ducking in and out of trouble, mapping the world, getting my ass kicked. I think I spent 20 hours at least picking apart Limgrave on my first playthrough, excited and terrified of what horrible surprise would come next (after discovering the caelid trap chest lol)... couldn't believe how massive the game ended up being. Hope to get that same feeling of awe and discovery in the DLC
People keep spelling Melania and Malekit as if they don't tell you their name after every time you die.
Dys Lexia the Spellbane continues to be the hardest boss in souls history.
Yeah the vascular plant is basically the size of Pluto, how tf did Rubicon even build something like that without mining a planet the size of Jupiter for all the raw materials.
    If it’s the size of Pluto, couldn’t they just disassemble a dwarf planet the size of Pluto? Doesn’t seem that crazy.
        They could, if the planet is composed of 100% metal.
            Well alright, disassemble a few. There’s more than one dwarf planet in our solar system.

Edit: really the crazy thing seems more how quickly they seemed to do it, rather than that they did it at all.
    I had the exact same thought, but hey, Rule of Cool
It doesn't even have to be a false promise… you may have every intention of fulfilling it when you say it, but then you hit development setbacks, cuts or deadlines – or you realize the original vision evolved and you no longer wish to aim for sheer scale, rather do something more interesting in a smaller area – and then you either have to break your promise, or ditch your vision.

So when you “promise” to *definitely* do something in a DLC, it's often already done.
Honestly, once they fixed a lot of the bugs and improved some of the optimization and crowd generation, it really did live up to a lot of its promise. It still lacked a few things, but it was largely held back by technical flaws, not lack of content.
cyberpunk in its current state is right up there in quality with elden ring.
    Man I wish I could get into it. I've tried multiple times now. Maybe it's just too overwhelming for me?
        Ur talking about cyberpunk?
            I am.
                It took me 4 or 5 attempts to finally get into it. If you enjoy the genre and games like it, id say just try to keep going and see if it eventually clicks. Easily atleast an 8/10 game for me. And if it never does click, sobeit, not all games are for everyone.
                    I will try again. I want to love it.
    To me Cyberpunk is no better than Far Cry 5 and nowhere near The Witcher 3 or Elden Ring

        what's DGMS
            Dark moon greatsword
                ohh ok thank you

                You best believe im making a build all around this new jump kick weapon 
                    Bonefist 2 hallow boogaloo
    Faith Lightdiscuss from the Rotspears of Malenias Knights + Magic-Reflection Shield. You shoot your discus, when it returns you reflect it for INSANE dmg. It is hard to pull off, but absolutely fun and satisfying to me.

  
Sorry, i do not remember the actual names :D Think the Spear is the Cleanrot-Spear and has an abysmal dropchance :>
    Anything combo'd with ARC is good if you know where to look, INT probably is the worst stat to combo with right now as you just have bubble spells which are okay but definitely weird. ARC/FTH for dragon communion incantations. DEX/ARC for bleed weapons like Rivers of Blood, Eleonoras Poleblade, Godskin Peeler. STR/ARC for Mohg Spear and even the Marais Executioner Sword, plus any weapons with innate Bleed are amazing for ARC as you can put Occult affinity on them for good damage and better bleed both, it's a great pure ARC affinity.

FTH can do everything too, pairs well with all stats and lets you do a variety of builds.
    It's a long time to get going, but a Frenzy build is crazy. Not good, but crazy.
    my current playthrough is naked with the large club. nothing like running around killing gods in a loincloth with a big stick
    I recommend either going wacky heal focused faith build with the heal on hit weapons and blasphemous blade focused with great stars secondaries

- key focus is on the healing vs maxing damage with it.

Or 

Ultimate use everything build ready for DLC
Focus on getting all stats to 20-25 via both levels and items

Only level vigor, endurance etc for equip load, with a lil of fp leveling.

Go into DLC being able to test out anything you pickup
Same lol said I was gonna replay it after beating it after about 2 months came back and beat it like 3 times lol
but maybe new DLC club so we can bonk twice at once
    *Unga Bunga intensifies*
        one bonk good, so two bonks better!
Miyazaki said at least 10 bosses. That was the wording. And I can't imagine it would be anything but new bosses.

The quality of the bosses is still unknown. I'm hoping for Remembrance level bosses. BB and DS3's DLCs had lots of high quality bosses. Considering Shadow of the Erdtree is a way bigger DLC than any of those I'd expect nothing less than 5 Remembrance tier bosses.
didnt miyazaki literally say more than 10 nee bosses? lmao
I agree he doesn't look like boss material. I wouldn't think he was a boss either if it wasn't for the very obvious boss room he's placed in. However, I also don't think it makes sense for him to be a Soldier of Godrick type boss. Soldier of Godrick is a tutorial boss. The DLC is tuned for endgame, and is locked behind Mohg and Radahn, that's rather far into the game for a single generic looking knight to be a boss. 


I think it's much more likely that he's *not* the boss, but is a part of a larger boss fight, like the soldiers Niall summons.
    Could also be a "enemy outside the boss room" situation. But yeah i hope future interviews give some clarification on that metric. Ideally, they're 10+ remembrance calibur bosses/bosses too unique to show up twice. It would fit the pricing at least. 2/3 the price of the game and 2/3 the number of remembrance bosses. 

&#x200B;

No way did they reveal about 8 of the at least 11 bosses in the first trailer unless the boss number is 15 or more i hope.
limgrave deez nuts
    Got em
And Australia
yessir
    What kind of fool do you take me for? He's Limgrave, he's Limgrave, you're Limgrave... I'm Limgrave! Are there any other Limb-graves I should know about?!
        Floating limgrave ……
        Hi Limgrave,

Please meet my friend Limgrave,

Yours Limgravely,

Limgrave
        Would the real Limgrave please stand up
I missed out on a few things because i literally start choppin at whatever I see, ended up killing a few NPCs like patches and boc.
Haha yea…haven’t enjoyed gaming this much in 10+ years. Never tried this genre before Elden ring. I remember picking it up and giving up after a few hours, came back a month later and here I am now.  Picked up lies of P after I got tired of dying to Elden beast lol, also fun but didn’t hit the same way.
    Well welcome to the genre! Defo look for older souls titles as those were really good, especially for their time, but stuff like sekiro, dark souls 3 and even bloodborne still hold up to today's standards imo!

Glad to hear you are having a blast!
My guess would maybe be… 1/4th or 1/3rd of the base game in terms of content?

Seeing as Elden Ring has 6 legacy dungeons and this dlc will have at least 2, it’s definitely going to be jam packed with content.
Man, have you not heard the open-world bitchers roaming around whining about the open-world aspects of the game?
    No. Actually I havent
        Here's a thread:
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/t30r97/open_world_boring/

You'll find them roaming through the forums randomly stating how they would like elden ring so much more if it wasn't open world.
            I believe you that they exist. But for real I just didnt have them on my radar. I mean I also like Fromsofts linear Formular more, but I also want them to try stuff out and improve. You cant progress when you stagnate lol
what
    I was saying npc questlines will probably still be sad. Which I like about these games. 

Downvotes gonna downvote though.
You got further than me. I stopped when the game was so consistent and immersive with a story so well connected to the World, that after I woke up from character creation, I was told by the NPC that it makes no sense for me to be there. It was also never mentioned ever at any point after
 The game just accepted that it already broke its World building before the Tutorial came to an end and that is unexcusable.
that isn’t what happens at all lol
If it’s the size of Pluto, couldn’t they just disassemble a dwarf planet the size of Pluto? Doesn’t seem that crazy.
    They could, if the planet is composed of 100% metal.
        Well alright, disassemble a few. There’s more than one dwarf planet in our solar system.

Edit: really the crazy thing seems more how quickly they seemed to do it, rather than that they did it at all.
I had the exact same thought, but hey, Rule of Cool
Man I wish I could get into it. I've tried multiple times now. Maybe it's just too overwhelming for me?
    Ur talking about cyberpunk?
        I am.
            It took me 4 or 5 attempts to finally get into it. If you enjoy the genre and games like it, id say just try to keep going and see if it eventually clicks. Easily atleast an 8/10 game for me. And if it never does click, sobeit, not all games are for everyone.
                I will try again. I want to love it.
To me Cyberpunk is no better than Far Cry 5 and nowhere near The Witcher 3 or Elden Ring
Ok Danvers
Where is the any button?
    Yeah I can't find that either. I really don't want to mess something up by hitting the wrong button, so I've been unable to play the game.
I mean based on the trailer feel like that’s easily off
I mean, technically 9 then, Friede, Friede & Ariandel, Blackflame Friede
    Also wolf and the gladiator right?
I have never been disappointed in a single dime I have spent on From Soft games and I have bought every game and DLC since Dark Souls 1 at full price.
depends on what you've already done

powerstanced Great Hammers on a pure str/end build was probably my favorite. but it means farming the duelists outside the lyendell colosseum for a second hammer. (the brick hammer in stormveil is good for the first)

it's probably not as "good" as a giant crusher or GUGS build, but it's fun

i also had a lot of fun powerstancing the DMGS and Helphen's Steeple, because you look pretty cool when you have both AOWs active. Plus you can still be a very good caster, you'll be pretty limited on armor choices though.

edit: if you can't tell i think powerstancing weapons is really fun and you should try it if you haven't on past playthroughs

edit 2: dual straight swords is actually really fun as well. square off is the most underrated skill in the game, because no one uses straight swords after the first hour unless it's a SONAF build.
    Great Mace is also a free pickup in a chest before the Grand Lift of Dectus, middle of that camp near the siege weapons.

You can also get two Great Stars now in Altus Plateau, free bleed and heal on hit. There's one in the caravan on the Road of Iniquity Side Path and one at the Writheblood Ruins when you progress Varré's quest to where he gives bloody fingers for invading. A sign for invading Magnus the Beast Claw is around and beating him rewards the second Great Stars.

The Battle Hammer great hammer is my favorite fashion hammer, just sucks you need to farm those Duelists for it but the drop rate isn't horrendous with some boosted item discovery.
        I was mostly recommending the battle hammer for fashion purposes.

Twin great stars is probably better just bc bleed is so strong.
            Yeah but fashion is tops therefore Battle Hammer is best! But some might not wanna do that farm so I was giving backup options. Great Stars is one of my faves but it looks horrid with most armor sets lol
    The duelist greataxe is pretty awesome too, did a stark cosplay with it and the drake knight armor, looked pretty sick
        i do love obnoxiously heavy dex weapons. hopefully the Exile GS from DS3 makes a return
    Came here to say that dual straight swords and square off carried me through a RL1 playthrough.  It's fast, strong and fun.  Only downside is that I played for 500 hours before giving straight swords a chance.
        i thought square off  had to be bugged when i first went back to it. the stance damage is so strong for such a fast and light weapon.
    I’m using Blaidd’s set with the Raging Wolf helm and it looks pretty lit with the Ghostflame active.  Kind of have a spirit wolf theme going using Latenna’s ashes as well.
    what's DGMS
        Dark moon greatsword
            ohh ok thank you
                No worries, hopefully I've convinced you that two glowing magic swords are better than one
Wacky is fun, but I'll chime in and say I consistently had best experience (pve and pvp) by going back to the roots. 

Shield and mace. Big bonk colossal. Straight sword and pyro incantations in offhand. These kinds of builds have repeatedly proven to have a very solid core gameplay, with enough room for weaponplay and expression to feel interesting. Ever beat malenia by simply blocking her waterfowl with 2h weapon, or killed an invader by sending them to the moon with Upward Cut, then pointed up? It feels sublime.
    I killed an invader with Niall's thunder kick, and used crucible horns to knock people over guard rails to fall to their death 🤣


Pvp is fun
        Yesssss someone else finally mentioned Niall's peg leg! I feel like nobody knows how fun it is.
            You best believe im making a build all around this new jump kick weapon 
                Bonefist 2 hallow boogaloo
Faith Lightdiscuss from the Rotspears of Malenias Knights + Magic-Reflection Shield. You shoot your discus, when it returns you reflect it for INSANE dmg. It is hard to pull off, but absolutely fun and satisfying to me.

  
Sorry, i do not remember the actual names :D Think the Spear is the Cleanrot-Spear and has an abysmal dropchance :>
Anything combo'd with ARC is good if you know where to look, INT probably is the worst stat to combo with right now as you just have bubble spells which are okay but definitely weird. ARC/FTH for dragon communion incantations. DEX/ARC for bleed weapons like Rivers of Blood, Eleonoras Poleblade, Godskin Peeler. STR/ARC for Mohg Spear and even the Marais Executioner Sword, plus any weapons with innate Bleed are amazing for ARC as you can put Occult affinity on them for good damage and better bleed both, it's a great pure ARC affinity.
