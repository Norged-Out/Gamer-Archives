[[George RR Martin was on Colbert and talked about what he contributed to Elden Ring]]


[https://youtu.be/QgCxVdsQH\_k?t=361](https://youtu.be/QgCxVdsQH_k?t=361)

Nothing particularly new or ground breaking. Exactly what we had speculated; he created all of the lore pre-shattering and he said 'the present', which I assume means the shattering and afterward, was all FromSoft.

Unsurprisingly he said it was years ago that he gave them the lore and backstories and he seemed surprised how long it took to make a video game.

Edit: Guys, I think I phrased the last part poorly. His comment really seemed more about his surprise at video games in general taking longer than a year. I think he just had a poor grasp at how long video games take to make, it really didn’t sound like he was throwing shade.


I always thought that the Shattering was also George's idea, at least the concept of Marika shattering the Elden Ring and the conflict it would trigger.
    I think it's more likely that fromsoft had the broad outline of the story (there's a ring consisting of runes that defines the world's order, the Ring gets broken by the person who wields it, her children get the runes). George then came up with the backgrounds for the characters involved in this, their powers, their relationships to one another etc. Then fromsoft fleshed all of that out and worked it all into the game's narrative.
        Yeah, Miyazaki himself stated in the Edge magazine interview before the game's release:

> **Miyazaki:** We started off by giving him these very vague and broad themes and ideas for the mythos that I had swimming around in my head, along with what kind of games we typically make, and the sort of themes we'd like to explore in our games. 

> So it was all very loose and quite vague. Then he would come back to us with a lot of ideas: *how about this, this and this?* That back-and-forth started the exchange of ideas.

He also stated they provided vague ideas and themes because they wanted George to be able to flex his creative muscles, instead of having to adhere to strict set of requirements.

This does make me wonder if he's also responsible for Farum Azula and the Order of dragons? In my mind I credited that moreso to FromSoftware, but it's definitely one of the oldest parts of the lore.
            This might be an instance where both parties contributed. GRRM loves dragons and I'm sure he factored them into the lore he wrote, but I think fromsoft were probably responsible for aspects such as the stone scales, the weakness to lightning (in the case of the lesser dragons), and the idea of different factions trying to create their own dragons or become dragons themselves, since those are all ideas they've explored in the past.
                GRRM and Miyazaki certainly bonded over their mutual love of dragons and misery.
                    But mostly misery.
                        *OUR misery.
                The weakness to light- THE WEAKNESS TO LIGHTNING?  You're telling me I've been slapping these things down for 20 minutes sloggy style with my halo scythe with 4 lightning inc's just chilling in my offhand
                GRRM probably set up a lot of the dragon stuff and pulled themes from past representations of from dragons (them being the most ancient of races made of stone) then of course From comes on and creates the content so youre going to see their touches everywhere.
                Dragons having stone scales and being weak to lightning were in the souls games so would make sense that fromsoft were the ones to add it.
            GRRM definitely loves dragons. Their strong resemblance to DS1 dragons makes them seem very FromSoft, but that design might as well be an afterthought
            From probably said they wanted dragons to be the ones ruling before,and George created Farum Azula,and the story of how the dragons started becoming weaker and regressing to a animalistic state and at some point attacked Leyndell.

What its interesting to me is the 5 thousand years he talks,its 5 thousand years from Marika's rule,from the dragons or from when the Elden Beast landed in the lands between.
        Then they went fuck that we… there a shattering and we can do video-games stuff.
            Exactly
    The complicated family history and intertwined factions and conflicts for power have his fingerprints all over it. I never knew there were 5000 years since the shattering though? I thought it was more like 100 years
        I could be wrong because they worded it oddly, but I think they meant 5000 years from when elden beast landed/age of dragons up to when Marika entered the picture.
            Ah yea, that would make a lot of sense
    It was From's idea,Miyazaki said a interview that he rold George at some point the ring would be shattered.
Oh Ole George was surprised how long something took to make?

That's a fucking zinger if I've ever heard one.
    I was wondering why he thought a video game would only take a year to make but than he mentioned the games he had played and they are all from like the 90s.
        I miss the days where an entire series of games was pumped out in like a 4 year timeframe. Spyro, Jak and Daxter, Crash Bandicoot, the unofficial trilogy of the best Zelda games (Majora’s Mask, Ocorana of Time, Wind Waker), plenty more. 

The wait for ES6 and GTA6 is killing me. ~10 years in the waiting for both.
            Hard to believe the entire Mass Effect Trilogy came out in a five year time frame.
                And even that was considered rushed iirc. Mass Effect 3 is an example of rushed development, despite the game being pretty well-received overall ~~ignoring the endings~~.
                    I prefered the explanation for the Reapers that the original writer for Mass Effect 1 & 2 had before he left Bioware:

The mission in Mass Effect 2 where the Quarians are very concerned about a star going supernova millions of years earlier than it should have would have been foreshadowing for the reveal in Mass Effect 3.

You would have found out that mass effect technology is generating (or taking away I don't quite recall) dark matter that which is causing the stars to die out at an incredibly accelerated rate.

Hence the reason for the Reapers claiming that they are life's salvation. It is their job to allow life to flourish for a limited amount of time, 50,000 years, at which point continued use of Mass Effect technology would destroy the galaxy and the stars in it. Thus the Reapers must cull life to allow more life to flourish, everyone gets to enjoy life but not for ever.

The big choice would have been: Are we ultimately selfish for wanting to doom trillions of *potential* lives because we want more than what we are given and what is fairly allocated to everyone, or do we agree to sacrifice all current life to allow the galaxy to continue living and for more civilizations to have their chance?
                        This explanation would be fairly better, but it's explained half the way in ME3. Reapers basically take races compacts them into ships that serve as a collective consciousness of that race... which is cool because they all want to solve the problem of races killing themselves. To this point is everything okay, but the game is somewhat lackluster compared to the storytelling of ME1 and 2 but honestly, it shows that was made by a very good team that was arranged after 2 succesful launches really the game is the best combat in the series, andromeda feels meh but it's actually better combat wise.
                            Agreed. Even though the writing isn't as strong, it's by far the most fun to play.
                        I mean I enjoy both versions of the story honestly. I didn’t mind what it became but I wouldn’t mind what it could have been. It’s still one of the greatest Syfi stories ever
                            The thing about the ending we received that really got me (which I still have yet to accomplish in a playthrough) is the subversion of the color coding we were indoctrinated into throughout the whole series, that results in the secret ending (after killing the reapers, red option) implying that Shepard survives.

I already thought the storytelling was top notch, even after choosing the “green ending”. Finding out about that Easter egg was an “oh wow ok lmao” moment for me.
                                That kicked off the whole indoctrination thing.  Which narratively makes a whole lot of sense.  Shepard is constantly being indoctrinated through his contact with Reapers/Reaper tech (he was brought back to life with Reaper tech if I recall), and by the time 3 rolls around he's seeing a dead kid all the time who somehow turns out to be the exact manifestation the Reapers' central AI core takes later.

When presented with the 3 colored endings, they make Green and Blue seem to be the way to go because Red is just going to kill everything and that's super bad.  Yet, previous antagonists in the series have already attempted the Green and Blue endings and they don't work.  Saren attempted to work with the Reapers but was indoctrinated and synthesized with the Reapers (Green ending) losing himself totally by doing so.  The Illusive Man tried Blue, attempting to outsmart and take control of the Reapers, but he just ended up indoctrinated and losing too.

But Red, the only choice that hasn't been attempted so far, the only one that seems to immediately eliminate the threat, and the only one that the Reaper ghost kid is trying to dissuade you from taking by telling you the immediate and severe consequences, hasn't been tried yet.  When players take that choice, you get the hidden cutscene showing Shepard was alive.  And why?  Because he beat the indoctrination, made the right choice, and is getting back up from the laser blast that knocked him out ready to kick ass.
                                    That’s why I never took too much stock in the original ending as being “terribly bad and just different flavors of the same thing” like so many were saying at the time. I thought it was clever for what they had to work with, given the time they had to realize it.
                                I don't think it was a subversion at all.  Blue choices were the 'Shepard is looking out for all sentient races equally' and red choices were the 'Shepard only cares about him/herself and Earth'.

The Blue ending saves everybody while sacrificing Shep, the Red ending saves Shep but kills EDI and all the other inorganic life good or bad.
                                    Blue was pander to the reapers’ goals and red was kill the reapers. Whether or not blue saved everyone, red did as well because it stopped the reaper threat, which was always the primary goal. The inorganic vs organic life debate could then be allowed to potentially develop in a different way than history had shown, because of the knowledge gained and the existential threat stopped.

From a storytelling and gameplay perspective, it was subverting the taught expectations the series established and implied that Shepard (and us) was/were affected by indoctrination.
                        That's so much better.

I've beaten the Mass Effect trilogy twice now, once a year or two after it originally came out and once again when the Legendary Edition came out recently. And I couldn't exactly tell you what their purpose was. Which is a shame, because I still remember my playthrough of the first game when they were revealed as a powerful moment.

As I remember, Reapers were synthetic lifeforms who reasoned out that life would eventually become a never-ending cycle of organic life creating synthetic life and synthetic life destroying organic life. So they'd come through every 50,000 years to kill all organic life to prevent this.

Which, as I type it out, makes absolutely no sense at all.
                            Thats because you're misunderstanding two things, Reapers are NOT Synthetics, they are Technorganic Hybrids, an Organic Central Core created using the genetic information and material of an entire species wrapped in a highly advanced Reaper body.  
Secondly, as alluded to in the first point, they don't kill Organics. They harvest them. They take all the advanced races in the galaxy and turn them into a new Reaper.   


This is, as you said, to prevent the never ending cycle of Organic Create Synthetic, Synthetic Kill Organic.   


The Master AI of the Reaper's has a very skewed view of Synthetics and Organics thanks to its Creators God-like attitudes, so its not really a surprise that a Leviathan created AI's solution to this problem is put all Organics in time out before they can kill each other.
                            The difference would be, the synthetic life completely wiping out all organic matter like a virus & reapers wiping out all technologically advanced species and letting the next round of species develop.

In our universe the reapers act as a virus to wipe out humans as opposed to an asteroid to wipe out earth
                        Wow, I would have MUCH preferred that explanation.
                        Thats kind of the plot of The Eternals lol
                            Never saw it, was it any good?
                                People hated it but I liked it. Its different from other Marvel stuff. It has amazing visuals, using a good mix of real life filming locations and as well as tasteful cgi. The story is slow and long-winded, but its at least unique, and theres some good characters in there that get a little deeper than the usual superhero.
                    90% of ME3 was amazing. The ending was the major flop. 

I never heard a bad thing about any other part of the game
                        The ending wasn’t bad if your goal was always to destroy the reapers. I remember when that Star kid kept talking, and all I could think about was “why is he giving me options? I’ve been pretty explicitly working towards 1 goal this entire time”
                        I did have more problems with ME3 besides the ending, even if I did like the game a lot (nightmare scenes of only the kid feels off, Geth having rewritten characterization from ME2, dropping the dark matter plot, Kai Leng, etc).
                        To me the ending is moot. I still strongly believe no matter your choice the reapers still wiped the galaxy clean and it’s just your indoctrination that is what we experience. I do love that it is open ended enough that you truly don’t know.
                            Word of the Creator explicitly rejects that theory.
                        The moon vehicle exploration sucks
                            It sucks, but man was that one of my favorite things to do in the first game

                                Yeah, it's insanely restrictive about that. 

If I'm guessing, at least ME3 had a [REDACTED] that attempts to fix the ending and throw away the star child plotline.

There's also another [REDACTED] that fixes the Planet Earth invasion by making the levels actually interesting.
                                    Not even that, there are modz that add entirely new quests and missions into the game as well as a bunch of world building stuff
            Fuck man, this comment speaks to my soul
            [deleted]
                It was my understanding that they haven't even *started* production. It's all just pitch meetings and outlines right now.

Todd made it clear that ES6 will start production *after* Starfield is finished.
                    Then Fallout 5 starts AFTER that ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry) They said they have an idea, but that's about it lol.
                IIRC they announced cyberpunk 2077 and then didn’t start work til 3 years later. That extra three years might have stopped it from being such a bad launch, especially since they mighta figured out much earlier on that it was never going to work properly on last gen consoles…
                    Cyberpunk runs pretty good on PS4 and Xbox One nowadays.
                        Honestly it doesnt matter. Even if Cyberpunk ran perfectly at launch it's still dull and lifeless imo. Its honestly just one of those game you can mess around in for a few hours, but when you  put it down you don't feel the need to play again since it was nothing special
                Bethesda has absolutely lost it. And I say that as a person who counted them as my favorite developer for much of my life. Morrowind enthralled me as a kid, and I loved Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, etc. 

The people who view RPGs at art forms, or manners of storytelling, are no longer with Bethesda. They're a money making machine now. Mobile games. License out MMOs. Re-release Skyrim a dozen times. That's been what they've been doing outside of developing Starfield for the last 10 years.

In the meantime, Fromsoft has released the full suite of Souls games.
                    Yeah, Bethesda has lost the script, and is starting to feel a little like Meta: telling customers what they want and trying to control the whole process from end to end.  They're overthinking every aspect of game creation and making the wrong stuff complicated.  Like you say, they are trying to come up with formulas to make money hand over fist, not create actual art or the best customer experience.
                Duke Nukem Forever was the best game ever.

Edit: /s just in case this is necessary.
                They likely know that Skyrim is still profitable somehow and want to continue to milk the udder dry.
                What comes first, ES6 or WoW?
                If ES6 is so far away, at least give us  another good Skyrim DLC.
            Call me a hater but I don't think either GTA or ES are gonna live up to 10+ years of hype. Games nowadays are so mediocre and a lot of times unfinished on release. Corporations getting more and more involved with video games has only made them worse and the goal is hardly about making art or something fun anymore, it's about getting a quick buck
            I've been on the es6 cope for longer than i've had pubes, im still not sure it'll ever come out
            I would not lump Windwaker with the others
                You’re right, Wind Waker is leagues better than the other two
                    Said no one ever
                        It’s the best Zelda game hands down. Nothing else compares really.
                            Not even close
            I don’t like an assembly line of games, especially single player modern games. They could make them more often though and do not out of greed.
            How dare you put windwaker above minish cap.
            A Link to the Past > Wind Waker
            Hell yeah, I also love me some...

\*looks at faded writing in sweaty hand\*

Ocorana of Time!
        Homeworld was cool. Yes did the music for it.
    And he recently said that The Winds of Winter is 75% done, 11 years later 😪
        I bet you that he's rewritten more than he's written. Thats what the hold up is and he's basically admitted it. What worries me is that winds will be longer than dance, so are we going to see it split again?
            I mean sure I have worked in long projects and Game of Thrones started and ended and the first season of House of the dragon started and ended and scripts were done and dragons and several souls games started and finished in 11 years.  But no winds.

Yes, I’m bitter, yes I won’t be reading nor winds or last king killers chronicle. Those two lost my faith in them. I’ll stick with Brandon Sanderson.
                I've reached the acceptance stage lol. I have no interest in the series at large (meaning the books or the original GoT show) but i am liking hotd since right now its a return to form. It could all go to shit ofc, but like i'll drop it without a second thought if it happens. As for Winds, I'm no longer keeping track of it. Let it come out and it'll be a pleasant surprise if it does (because i don't truly ever expect it to come out)
            I have zero qualifications for any sort of body language analysis, but you go watch that interview and after he says 75% his body language screams he’s completely full of shit! Like a little kid tryna lie vibes! Don’t get me wrong I love the dude and have spent my time living in the wonderful fantasy world he has crafted and shared with us, but man watch the interview.
    Someone needs to gift him a mirror for his next birthday. Or perhaps a nice matching pot and kettle set.
        [removed]
            It’s all marketing gimmick
    LOL. Man, if I worked my balls off writing and then all of a sudden HBO grabbed some of my work and I had "fuck you" money, I'd do nothing but eat chimichangas and enjoy the New Mexico sunset too.
        As someone who lives in New Mexico the sunsets here are mesmerizing
    We’ll never get the books
        Correct
        He’s gonna Wheel of Time us. I’d bet money on it.
            Except we wont get a Sanderson to continue it
    in his defense, video games have only expanded on their turnaround time since the 70s and 80s, where they could be pumped out much more quickly

whereas books seem to take the same amount of time, all said, as they did hundreds of years ago. publishing a proper body of work is consistent
        Writing a book might take the sa.e amount of time as it did 500 years ago. But publishing?
Man the logistics might not even compare to 50 years ago
    Truly worthy of r/selfawarewolves

    Lmaoooo zinger of the century
    Glad I’m not the only one that spotted the irony there.
Dang it, right when he was getting into it about the Runes and the Shattering he was interrupted by Colbert. I wanted to hear him actually talk about the world he built
    Same here it’s the only reason I was interested to watch this but Colbert obviously has no frame of reference so doesn’t know what is or isn’t interesting to fans. He should’ve just let George talk.
        I don't think George would have said much else tbh, he was probably asked not to say too much about the "old world". It's interesting how he randomly said the number "5000 years ago" though, seems really specific, specially due to the fact that he kept repeating it. I wonder if that's the official number of years that passed by since the Shattering?
            I thought that was the timeframe between the beginning of the lands between and the shattering.

For the Scarlet Rot to STILL just be in Caelid after 5000 years would mean it’s not spreading very quickly.
                Rot doesn't seem to spread aggressively through the land.


It's easily stopped by flowing water and flame. Look at the entrance of the lake of rot from nokstella and the divide between limgrave and caelid.
                    This makes a lot of sense - flowing water washes away the stagnation and flame purifies
                        Flowing water is also directly associated to the legendary swordsman who locked away the god of rot using a flowing sword.
                            It plays a little into the idea that flowing water is clean where as still water is tainted.
                                That's like a big thing in Japanese society. Death and decomposition in general was and still is considered taboo.

They used to have trouble handling the deceased before Buddhism arrived in Japan.

On a side note, blood, especially menstrual flow is also considered cursed and forbidden to touch. But that topic is for another day or rather another game.
                                    Yeah that’s one of the central themes of Dark Souls (1,2 and 3). Gwyn metaphorically damned up the river by extending the Age of Fire and creating Hollows with the Curse Mark. Dark Souls 3 goes a little more into this (besides the Ringed City’s big exposition) with the Human Dregs. It’s Humanity settling into the water like sediment, building up and poisoning the water because the Age of Fire keeps repeating.
                >I thought that was the timeframe between the beginning of the lands between and the shattering.

That was my thought as well, seems more reasonable. At the very least, I’m not given the impression that the Shattering happened in the last 1000 years, *maybe* last 100 at the latest?

>For the Scarlet Rot to STILL just be in Caelid after 5000 years would mean it’s not spreading very quickly

Well, granted, there is the Lake of Rot…But regarding Caelid, there’s this odd little sentence in the Mushroom Crown description:

>Long ago, great lords served the scarlet rot. Perhaps such fungal bodies served as their crowns.

So, Caelid got rotted “long ago” enough to warrant some “great lords” to worship it, all after Malenia bloomed during the Shattering.

Still incredibly vague on any specific timeframe, sadly.
                    I believe the lake of rot predates the shattering and Malenia's bloom in Caelid by quite a bit. It seems like the Uld were already worshipping it long before Marika's reign.
                        We can see that the pests there are certainly worshipping it, but it’s tricky to gauge the sort of reverence the Uld held for that Rot God. Did they house the relic for worship, or as a warning and to keep it protected?

I’m not sure where I align. But I have to admit that I’m creeped out by how intact those ruins are, in spite of all the rot.

And now based on the post from u/jcheesus I’m thinking they definitely had some influential followers back then.
                    the mushroom crown is found in the lake of rot though. and lake of rot is obviously much older than the swamp of aeonia, the rot in the lake is a vivid, red hue, it looks like a much more advanced infection than the brownish aeonian rot

this is because malenia's mentor, the blind swordsman sealed the outer god of rot somewhere around the lake of rot. i suspect that this is because lots of water from the eternal cities flow down there, and the flowing water is antithetical to the rot, since it clears the stagnation that the rot prefers. its clearly inspired by the concept of "kegare" which was also very important in sekiro  


caelid only got rotted when malenia bloomed there in the battle with radahn. only the kindred of rot are explicitly said to have come out of the aeonian swamp. the aeonian butterflies must have also come into existence back then, since malenia has her wings in second phase made from them, but they are already around to collect before that
                        >the mushroom crown is found in the lake of rot though.

WHOOPS. That’s a *huge* detail I overlooked. I thought I picked it up with the rest of the mushroom set in Seethwater cave.
            I doubt it is, there's still siege equipment and banners everywhere from the Shattering so it can't be more than a few years before the game takes place, maybe a decade.
                It's worth mentioning that there are gravesites for battles from the shattering that were fought long before the fights we actually see the remains of, the world does look quite old in general, cities in lurania are sinking, the majority of villages are reduced to ruins.

I'd put my money on at least a few hundred years.
                    Topes says the Acadamy shut up shop in response to the Shattering War. There’s some question as to when during or after the war this happened, but whenever it was Topes has been just hanging around ever since.

We also have Enya suggesting that timescales for Tarnished are at most a single-digit multiple of timescales for humans—she suggests that “thousands or tens of thousands of days” is too long for us to wait for the Two Fingers to get off hold with the Greater Will, so somewhere not too far north of 2.75 years is a long time for us and for Topes.

I’m given to understand that the English goes with “moons”, though, which in a natural interpretation of “months” would smack a big multiplier on top. There may be a different interpretation of “moons”, otherwise I’m not sure what to make of that.
            I figured it was over a millenia given the context clues but 5k years is crazy high fantasy numbers
        Talk shows are not long winded interviews. They are maybe five questions with short zingers. Shouldn’t expect more than that.
        I dunno about that. Colbert is a notoriously huge nerd who’s super into Tolkien and stuff. It honestly wouldn’t surprise me if he’d played Elden Ring.
            Eh, he’s definitely a book nerd, but probably not a gaming nerd.
            Very numb of him then, to not want to let the creator gush about the things the fans don’t know.
                This interview was fantastic, and Colbert let him talk practically the entire time. It’s not an elden ring podcast, he’s got other things going on lol.
I would pay so much to see the original manuscript of whatever George first sent in
    I've been thinking this for years myself
    pretty much it was all written in napkins
> Unsurprisingly he said it was years ago that he gave them the lore and backstories and he seemed surprised how long it took to make a video game.

Ooohh throwing stones in a glass mansion...
    While your joke rings true, I think he was calling out his ignorance as to what goes in to making a video game rather than the speed at which game developers work.
        You're right. He played games in 90s, when it took few months to pump a game out. I think original Doom was done in several months (less that a year). Modern games are much bigger and harder to make, but George is just out of the loop
            Also, many people don’t understand the art that goes into a video game. Character design, set design, music, story, voice acting. People who don’t play definitely take that stuff for granted.
So a dlc about the past seems very plausible
    That’s been FromSoft’s MO towards most of their DLC.
        All fromsoft DLCs have involved at least some time-fuckery have they not? Artorias obviously, the crowns of the old kings in DS2, the ringed city being the end of time...maybe the fishing hamlet in Bloodborne doesnt fit in though
            >maybe the fishing hamlet in Bloodborne doesnt fit in though

That whole area is highlighting where Laurence and maybe Wilhelm with their Byrgenwerth fellows got their first major exposure to Great One goodness. The Hunter’s Nightmare in general seems to be a “snapshot” of what it was like at the time, similar to the Hunter’s Workshop in the Hunter’s Dream.

I like to use the lack of the Healing Church hunter workshop in the Hunter’s Nightmare as a reference for that. I’m not even sure of the Orphanage was built yet.
            All Crowns, Ashes of Ariandel, a majority of Ringed City and *I believe* the Old Hunters take place in the present. 

Artorias was by far the most overt "going back in time", so much that it's intrinsically part of the story of Ds1. Artorias was credited with defeating the Abyss, but the truth is that we defeated Manus. 

And with the power of time fuckery, we get one of the best alternate cutscenes with Sif. The DLC played *really* into the time aspect. 

The Old Hunters is the one I'm scratching my head a tiny bit about. I think it's just a different nightmare realm, moreso than being time travel. I get the impression it's kinda present day because of how fucked Ludwig, Laurence and Maria are when we fight them.  

Ringed City time fuckery feels kinda footnote to be honest. It's only a thing for the final boss pretty much.
                The Ringed City takes place in every moment in time as first you're in the dreg heap which is every point of existence converging, then you're in the ringed city which kinda exists outside of time as far as I know and then you get transported into the future after Gael has killed everything.
                The Old Hunters is basically a pocket dimension (a dead God’s nightmare) where Blood Addled Hunters are banished and imprisoned. My headcanon is is that the strongest hunters influence the nightmare when they are banished there. The beginning is the Church at the height of their power (Ludwig’s nightmare). Middle is the Lab where the Church was just beginning to understand the Blood (Maria’s nightmare). The end is where it all begin, the Fishing Hamlet where Kos was murdered and her child stolen (Gerhman’s/Orphan’s nightmare). A Nightmare seems to be able to exist even if it’s creator is dead (Mergo is technically dead but their Nightmare realm still exist).

At the end of the DLC, you get “Nightmare Slain” instead of “Prey Slaughtered”. It’s the same with Mergo’s Wet Nurse. Gerhman even has restful dreams after you complete the DLC too. It’s honestly just my interpretation so don’t take it as fact but to me you’re not going back in time, more like you’re experiencing very complex memories given form.
            And the sekiro dlc t… oh wait
            The sekiro dlc… wait
        yeah it happened in ds1 ds2 and bloodborne. U go back in Sekiro too but its not a DLC i think the only game you dont is ds3
            Well technically you do time travel in the Ringed City DLC, only instead of backwards you go forwards, twice. First you journey to the Dreg Heap where the whole world seems to be collapsing in on itself in the future, then you travel even further forward after reaching Filianore to where the world is now just one vast ashen desert with only the crumbling ruins of Lothric and Anor Londo remaining in the distance.
                Yup and my personal theory is that The Ringed City itself was frozen in time. And when Filianore woke up all the time that had passed caught up to it. Which would be just after the beginning of the Age of Fire. So the year it would’ve been basically would’ve doubled.
                    It’s interesting you say that because I always assumed you were flung forward in time after the egg breaks. The one Pygmy Lord that’s barely alive says that the “Red Hood has come to eat us” which implies that Gael has a reputation and that the Pygmies knew he was coming for at least a while.
                        It’s tough to explain but let’s say The Ringed City was sealed in year 1 and it’s currently year 1000. When the egg broke, it sent you forward 999 years but since the rest of the world was already at year 1000 it would instead send you forward 1999 years in order for the world and The Ringed City to align time wise. This gives Gael tons of time to get his reputation
                            That makes sense and yet in true Miyazaki storytelling only raises more questions.
        Yeah Gael and Maria were both created by GRRM as well
        Did they do it in DS2? If not then they did it exactly once.
            >Did they do it in DS2?

For Shulva? Maybe. Brume Tower? I’d imagine so, it’s no longer anywhere near the Iron Keep and the remaining tower doesn’t match it. Frozen Loyce? Well, it’s certainly not snowy anywhere anymore. Bloodborne’s DLC is similarly about exploring the past.
    the old tarnished
Per Colbert interview, he wrote who is who, what are their power, and ***who kill who***.

so more than until shattering, its until "present", or basically the current state of lands between, around when tarnished woke up.

that being said, possibly the little details will be done by fromsoft team, but its interesting to know he have involvement in designing Shattering War events.
I would love to read this ‘book’ that George wrote for Elden Ring, which describes the characters and back story etc. I hope from soft release it one day! Thought I doubt they will
    Wasn’t there some announcement or rumor that it was being released as a book? I thought I heard that.
Lol I love GRRM but the whole 'haven't played the game because I'm writing' made me laugh hysterically
    I do believe it is more his fear of addiction, but I bet he is writing though. Just not Winds of Winter. He is involved is a stupid number of projects.
        He's definitely writing, had a new book come out yesterday lmao.  He's probably just terrified to write asoiaf at this point
            Sorry and I don't mean to sound like one of those people that's mad at him because I appreciate everything hes done 

of course I want him to finish the books but I also understand hes kind of in a hole

 I really hope he finishes but I've also kind of resigned myself to the fact that he probably won't - I just can't see him pushing out 2 more books
                Lol nah you really didn't sound like them at all, people get crazy about it.  I just always think it's funny when people call him lazy and stuff like that.  The dude is still writing a good amount, it's just not in the series everyone wants.  I get both sides, asoiaf is by far my favorite fantasy series, of course I wanna see it end.  But he's in a tough spot, more so now than ever before after the amount of time and the HBO series.  He probably has panic attacks thinking about it.  At this point, I'd be so happy to see em come out, but I'm not gonna hold it against the guy if he doesn't get around to it
                    Same

 I know hes claimed he would never let anybody finish the series but I do wonder if things did take a turn for the worst or if he did run out of time - if he would allow someone to finish

But hopefully he pulls it off and is with us 20 more years
        Yep
George, darling, you last published a Song of Ice and Fire novel in 2011. Since then Fromsoft have released ~~four~~ SIX video games.
    5 actually. Ds2, BB, Ds3, Sekiro & Elden Ring 

6 if you count Deracine as well, but obviously much smaller in scope.
        If you want to get really technical, A Dance With Dragons came out a few months before the first Dark Souls. So really 7 games plus 7 or 8 DLCs?
         well, there we have it. didn't realise DS2 was only in 2014!
            When did you think it was?
                maybe 2011! god damn!
    yes, but George has written 3 and co-authored in like 12 books since 2011 as well. Winds is just not one of them
        yeah reference books and whatnot.
            Yes-ish, granted "World of Ice and Fire" is a pretty hefty reference book, but Fire and Blood is a rather conventional story though - just portrayed as a sort of in-world history book. And the Hedge Knight stories, as well as wildcards are just straightforward novels.
I want to see what he wrote!
    I do too, unfortunately I don't think we'll ever get it. Historically Miyazaki has wanted the 'truth' of these games to remain mysterious and vague enough that players can fill in the blanks themselves. Having the groundwork would give us some excellent detail but then the cat would be out of the proverbial bag, it's possible we get more hints in DLC though!
Surely he took 5 minutes in the meanwhile to make some progress to his book
    He says he’s 75% done with Winds… so it will be out in five more years
        35% of that is leftover from the previous book tho
        Be thankful you're still alive when he finally releases it
        Last 10% always takes 90% of the time.
    Oh, sweet summer child.
That's gotta be the most brilliant way to do it. Get a phenomenal writer to create the world, and then let Miyazaki go postal on it.
Nice summary, OP.
    Oh, thanks.

Unless that sarcasm and I didn’t pick it up.
        It was not sarcasm.
So GRRM is surprised how long it took to make a work of art.
The way people were making it out I thought Martin had waaaaay more involvement than he actually did. But still, laying the fundamental groundwork for Miyazaki to build on was pretty awesome
    Idk, he literally wrote the entire world up until the shattering, that's pretty substantial.

I would agree that the advertising was very purposefully trying to make it sound like he basically wrote the entire story in the game when obviously that's not the case.

They put his name *really* front and center for a reason.
        >They put his name really front and center for a reason.

Yeah, because his name alone was marketing. 

Nothing against George, but you could tell me the whole thing was Miyazaki and his team and it wouldn't surprise me in the least. The whole Elden Ring plot and lore is very similar to Dark Souls and Bloodborne.
            the whole shattering and night of black knives is very similar to Georges works as well though.
                The night of the black knives is very red wedding-esc
            I don’t think George is lying to us here, because the pre-shattering world and events feel very in-line with GRRMs writing. While it is true his name is selling the game, and From definitely wrote the actual games story, he isn’t some cheap name to just plaster on your box. It’s kinda silly to hire such an expensive author and have him not contribute and do what he was hired for. The dude wrote the backstory, fleshed out the Lands Between, and characterized the godly characters. From built their game and it’s story on that foundation. 

Also, as a fan of George’s work for a while now, It’s safe to say he had no problem jumping ship for some time away on Winds of Winter and pick up a check while fleshing out a new fun fantasy world. WoW is breaking this dudes spirit. He just admitted he did this very same thing to write Fire and Blood from 2016-2018.
    I sort of assumed before the game came out that it was mostly Martin doing the story.  After I started playing it though I got the feeling he had very little to do with it.  It's hard to explain but I've read his books and played every soulsborne game so I sort of get which "vibe" the story gives off and everything was overwhelming Miyazaki.  Even though the fact that it's a game probably skews that feeling but I really didn't get a GRRM influence on anything about the story or lore even though I'm sure he had a hand in it.
I can resemble his “addictive personality” comment. But with a white bathrobe.
Man what I would give to see what he came up with before FromSoft changed it up - not that I’m mad or anything, I love the world as it is so very much - but just for historical perspective and some insight into the game development world building process.
This guy talking about how long it took to make a game haha. My guy finish your shit.
Marika's tits!
Where's the fucking book Geoooooorge?
He seemed surprised how long it takes to make a video game? And what did he do during this time? He has written 5 pages of Winds of Winter, or maybe even 10?
    Tbf he has written several books.  I think one just came out a week or two ago.  Unfortunately it's not the book everyone wants lol
    I think he wrote like 1000 then threw it in the fire and laughed at our tears
WHAT ABOUT THE ROLLING GOATS!?
[deleted]
    George may have been aware of that principle but there’s no way he ever adhered to it, we’ve got at least four Jons in the books, book one has  Jeor, Jorah and Jory, and so on.
    G, R, and M

His initials…
        [deleted]
            Huh? I didn’t know I was just saying it because I only now noticed after seeing you put them out there like that
I still love that he called it dark souls 4 or something similar in an interview. Like bro said what were all thinking
    I believe he called it a sequel to the Dark Souls series. Pretty sure i've watched that interview around the time the game (or the network test) released.
So much salt in this thread 

Chill
They just wanted to keep tradition with his publishing schedule.
I love the elden ring part but honestly it was the least interesting part of that interview. Love that Colbert gave him the space to just talk. Really profound stuff here about science fiction, war, religion and the future of our species.
This is the one thing delaying Winds of Winter that I can get behind.
That’s absolutely historical he’s shocked it took so long to make a project
[deleted]
    [deleted]
    I interpreted that as the regular years before the shattering and then the war itself
“Seemed surprised at how long it took to make a video game” 

Laughs in ‘Winds of Winter’
Maybe I ran around doing too much stuff in between everything, but I didn’t even realize there was a plot.
Preshattering? Sounds like he wrote the shattering itself by mentioning all their powers and the significance of the runes
I know Ole George gets dumped on a lot online but I can't help but like the guy. He seems like he would be fun to talk to and just pick his brain.
wow the shattering was 5000 years ago!!?
    Yeah that caught me off guard
I wonder if we’ll ever get a document detailing what George wrote for this
Lol considering it takes him over a decade to write a book how is he surprised when it takes people years to make an incredibly polished game :p
He contributed a list of names for NPCs that began with the letters G or R and then recommended that they should add dragons. Other than that… maybe he advised a confusing/convoluted plot that was difficult to decipher yet was bearable enough for us to stick with because we thought it eventually would form a cohesive conclusion (it did not) 

Great game, thoroughly enjoyed it- but goddamn, take some fucking adderall or have less cooks in the kitchen because even the most experienced RPG/DnD fan was left with a lot of WTF moments upon completing the game. 

Side note: 9/10 after +400hrs into the game, but seriously attaching GRRM onto anything is going to leave a lot of people scratching their heads when it comes to a plot that has any legitimate cohesion. We’re not asking for a stereotypical “hero’s journey” but goddamn, at least put a fucking bow on the ending. This isn’t the Sopranos.
    This your first FromSoft game?
“I’m surprised it took so long to make that video game”

What a cunty thing to say, considering it’s been *11 years since the last fucking book was released*
Says the jerk off that's taken nigh on 12 years to write WoW...
I got downvoted for writing this before, but IMHO Cercei and Marika have lot‘s of similarities
    My opinion on Marika rides a lot on whether or not she actually knew that Ranni was going to murder her son Godwyn.

If she knew it was part of the plan then it doesn't get much more evil than that but if she didn't know then I can sympathize with her quest to destroy the Golden Order.
        The sacrifice of your own son in exchange for the possibility to fix the entire world sunk in stagnation and madness doesn't seem that evil
            "Whoa! Were you about to murder that kid?"

"No, I was not going to *murder* my son, I was going to *sacrifice* him, there's a difference"

"Not to him, there isn't!"
                Well if I was told my death would give the entire world a chance of improvement I'd gladly give my life for it.
        The thing is: she causes the downfall of her children. And in Godwyns case: Marika could release the rune of death to put an end to his suffering, but she doesn‘t. Go figure
The fucking nerve to criticize development taking years
    In all fairness, it's just ignorance, not necessarily him criticising them
        That's fair
    He didn’t criticize it. He just said he was surprised it takes so long, which makes sense given that the games he’s used to are much older and less complex. It is funny for him to say that, but he wasn’t criticizing them.
    george last played 2d video games. if he played elden ring the camera alone would cause him to get dizzy and throw up
He needs to be writing his Game of Thrones books.
Explains why all the main characters share Martin's initials
I am not an avid book reader but I would read an Elden Ring book.
THE ABSOLUTE AUDACITY OF THAT FOSSIL TO SAY THAT HE WAS SURPRISED BY HOW IT TOOK. THE **AUDACITY!!!**
So he had plenty of time to fix the mess or at least introduce some actual *story* in the story and he didn't. Ok...
This lazy prick doesn't get to talk about how long it took them when dance came out over a decade ago.
    He meant video games in general, not FromSoft in particular.

He said it turns out video games can take 'longer than motion pictures'.

So I guess he just thought he'd hand them a story and they'd be done in a year or so.
        Yeeeeah. 

Games are like books.

They get done when effort is involved.
    "lazy prick"... Have you tried writing before dawg? Imagine writing books upon books having writer's block, publishers at your back, and the worst of all


Fucking entitled fans asking for shit and it MUST BE PERFECT or all hell breaks loose...

Shit ain't easy
        Also dude has written almost 2 million words for the main ASoIaF series alone. That's insane considering he has more material in that world plus tons of other stories. The guy is by no means lazy.
            Damn right? I don't get these entitled folk who think everyone owes them everything... Calm down clown you're a nobody asking things from established creators
        Don't care. He's had time aplenty but is content with doing other projects instead. Keeps giving deadlines and misses them time and again.
            Lmao "He's had time aplenty but is content with doing other projects". You're saying dude is happy doing other things than his job, sound like burnout... And what are you? His boss? Grow up and go read other books.
                The other things he does are also his job. People like this guy are ridiculously entitled.
            Better than Rothfuss, at least GRRM *is* writing, even if he's not writing Winds.
            Cry more
            If you use the word “aplenty” anything you say after that will not be taken seriously.
    Just look at your downvotes and ask yourself if what you said makes any sense 🤦‍♂️
        Yeah cos reddit downvotes are any indication of anything lmao. Ask yourself why you think they do.
            You called him a lazy prick, like is he obliged to provide new books for you whenever you need it. Of course you are getting downvoted
                Yeah the lazy prick needs to finish his job before the heart attack gets him.
            My brother in christ…get a therapist
                I must be bonkers not to care about reddit downvotes. Lmao
                    No. You’re bonkers for a lot of reasons, buddy.
                        Lol k
                            I hope you get the help you need, friend
                                I'm all good thanks mate, reddit downvotes don't hurt my feelings.
                                    Again, not what I’m talking about. But if that’s what you need to tell yourself to cope, I understand and sympathize.
            You need help buddy. I feel kind of sorry for you
    Please elaborate on why he is a lazy prick.  Do you think he owes you something?
    If you want high quantity content just go buy every ubisoft game
I believe this was more of a PR move for FromSoftware.  Game of Thrones were huge at the time and announcing you'll be working with George RR Martin obviously helps your marketing team.
GRRM was basically a consultant in this process.  He created some of barebones concepts surrounding the plot but overall he was way less involved than 99% of people think.  Whatever this guy has to say is less valuable than anything Miyazaki has to say
    It's common to see GRRM get more credit for the story/lore/characters than not, but ironically you're doing the opposite by saying he's a consultant. 

He straight up didn't consult them. He was approached by FromSoft *many* years back to help create worldbuilding, and when he did that, he wasn't involved any further. 

He also said so himself in an interview before the game launched. [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHzJG1hHTdU)

> *"I created a fairly detailed background for them, and then they took it from there, so y'know, it's really, it's been several years since I've last seen them"*

The short is that he helped create worldbuilding and the setting for Elden Ring, but obviously FromSoft took that worldbuilding and gave it the ol' FromSoftware touch. It's not one or the other's lore, it was a collaborative effort.
Off topic a bit, anyone read Stephen King's new book Fairy Tale? I swear he pulled from GRRM and Elden Ring. There's a main villain named Elden. Can't find any info in my conspiracy anywhere. Thought I'd try here.
Lmao this from the guy who still hasnt finished his book.
He ought to just finish GoT
Dude thought it was a sequel to dark souls in one of his interviews about elden ring. The guy is clueless. He shouldn’t have even been a part of it at all.
I diddnt realized he wrote the whole damn thing. Thats pretty damn cool.
5000 YEARS AGO THE SHATTERING HAPPENED CONFIRMED!
    I think he meant 5000 years which includes the shattering at the tail end

I'm sure he wrote a ton of pre-war lore in Lands Between
This is how I felt it in the game. Most backlore story (Marika and her offspring) totally felt like GRRM style with his classic *War of the rose* history event inspiration while Miyazaki style goes with a more apocalyptic world and more *Lovecraftian* inspiration
>they made it clear that Elden Ring was going to take place in, let’s say- the present of their game universe

Everyone is missing the confirmation that Elden Ring is the modern state of the Fromsoft universe, meaning it really is Dark Souls 4
    So Gael is Alive still looking for the dark souls while we do this Game and when we do frenzy flame ending ranged city DLC kicks in?
        [deleted]
            Youre talking about jerren and radhan not radagon and Gael at the end there
Yet GOT is still not done.
It's nice to know it's what I expected. When I first played the game, I felt this game was very From Soft in the immediate plot but everything before was all George. I'd still love a live stream where someone like Vaati or Ashen Hollow goes through a play through with him asking him questions and his opinions on areas.
Really fantastic interview all around.
Never mind THAT,  Finish the damn GoT series already!
GRRM is not the person to be saying anything about anybody taking long to be making anything lol
>He seemed surprised how long it took to make it a video game

George R.R Martin is the last person I’d want telling me something took too long to come out
Bold of him to be surprised how long it takes to make something lmfao (Thats it thats all im gonna contribute carry on)
Takes alot more work to make a video game than write a book, so he should really be surprised they made it so fast since he's been writing Winds of Winter for 10 years at least
This dude has no right to complain about something taking too long to complete.
He’s roasting them on how long it took to make it? Does he not know he’s been working on the same book for like ten years?
The nerve of George R.R. Martin complaining about anyone taking a long time to complete something.
Reminder that you're never getting The Winds of Winter.
Considering how long he takes to write a book, I wonder why he was surprised how long a video game would take to make

Edit: I see everyone already said this but my comment was knee jerk 

BUT STILL
I’m actually glad he doesnt specify which lore he created - it makes it more fun to try to find his influence in elden ring. I think that the maliketh/blaidd “shadows” idea screams GRRM, as well as the malenia and miquella lore
GRRM being surprised at something taking so long lol.
Dude said he played homeworld too. Just getting more and more hyped for 3 coming out.
Honestly he shouldn't be surprised, hasn't his last book been wip for 11 years?
I took what he said about 5000 years as pre and during the shattering, the post being Miyazaki
Its full of GRR. Family fighting over thrones.  Dont understand people that think they just tacked his name on.
So he basically wrote the characters and some of their feats before the shattering

Cuz i dont know much more from before the shattering cuz the demigods war for runes and all that was after the shattering, and if we are technical about It its likely he didnt write the shattering either which is the biggest story  thing we get right?

So basically he did marika/radagon fucking themselves and birthing malenia and miquella, all the carian stuff and the marika x godfrey stuff and the dragons x godwyn stuff
It kinda sucks that George couldn’t play the game he helped create. I would’ve loved to see him play and get frustrated and then recompose Himself and try again
…so you’re telling me he didn’t write the line “Marika’s tits!”?
We didn't speculate this... Miyazaki and Martin both had been interviewed before this and said the same thing. The only thing new he said in this interview, was plugging his book and explaining he has an addictive personality. He mentioned playing those games before, but never that he would lose track of time in them lol
makes me wonder if Elden Ring gets a Game of Thrones adaptation, it would be Pre-Shattering, where Martin was heavily involved in.
GRRM talks about how long it takes to make things?!?  Throwing shade or not, the guy should be amazed at how quickly the games are made compared to his writing.
He was complimenting the game cause more effort went into making it than a movie
I think the fact that it is hard to tell what he wrote is a good thing. We know the guy can build a compelling world, and it likely laid a good foundation for FromSoft to run with. Kudos to George for building something that could be compelling and strong to build off of, and good on From for remaining consistent with quality
I think the entire joke here is that he has taken nearly 15 years to finish out the latest book of GoT, yet the master piece Elden Ring is took less time.
I think it's more likely that fromsoft had the broad outline of the story (there's a ring consisting of runes that defines the world's order, the Ring gets broken by the person who wields it, her children get the runes). George then came up with the backgrounds for the characters involved in this, their powers, their relationships to one another etc. Then fromsoft fleshed all of that out and worked it all into the game's narrative.
    Yeah, Miyazaki himself stated in the Edge magazine interview before the game's release:

> **Miyazaki:** We started off by giving him these very vague and broad themes and ideas for the mythos that I had swimming around in my head, along with what kind of games we typically make, and the sort of themes we'd like to explore in our games. 

> So it was all very loose and quite vague. Then he would come back to us with a lot of ideas: *how about this, this and this?* That back-and-forth started the exchange of ideas.

He also stated they provided vague ideas and themes because they wanted George to be able to flex his creative muscles, instead of having to adhere to strict set of requirements.

This does make me wonder if he's also responsible for Farum Azula and the Order of dragons? In my mind I credited that moreso to FromSoftware, but it's definitely one of the oldest parts of the lore.
        This might be an instance where both parties contributed. GRRM loves dragons and I'm sure he factored them into the lore he wrote, but I think fromsoft were probably responsible for aspects such as the stone scales, the weakness to lightning (in the case of the lesser dragons), and the idea of different factions trying to create their own dragons or become dragons themselves, since those are all ideas they've explored in the past.
            GRRM and Miyazaki certainly bonded over their mutual love of dragons and misery.
                But mostly misery.
                    *OUR misery.
            The weakness to light- THE WEAKNESS TO LIGHTNING?  You're telling me I've been slapping these things down for 20 minutes sloggy style with my halo scythe with 4 lightning inc's just chilling in my offhand
            GRRM probably set up a lot of the dragon stuff and pulled themes from past representations of from dragons (them being the most ancient of races made of stone) then of course From comes on and creates the content so youre going to see their touches everywhere.
            Dragons having stone scales and being weak to lightning were in the souls games so would make sense that fromsoft were the ones to add it.
        GRRM definitely loves dragons. Their strong resemblance to DS1 dragons makes them seem very FromSoft, but that design might as well be an afterthought
        From probably said they wanted dragons to be the ones ruling before,and George created Farum Azula,and the story of how the dragons started becoming weaker and regressing to a animalistic state and at some point attacked Leyndell.

What its interesting to me is the 5 thousand years he talks,its 5 thousand years from Marika's rule,from the dragons or from when the Elden Beast landed in the lands between.
    Then they went fuck that we… there a shattering and we can do video-games stuff.
        Exactly
The complicated family history and intertwined factions and conflicts for power have his fingerprints all over it. I never knew there were 5000 years since the shattering though? I thought it was more like 100 years
    I could be wrong because they worded it oddly, but I think they meant 5000 years from when elden beast landed/age of dragons up to when Marika entered the picture.
        Ah yea, that would make a lot of sense
It was From's idea,Miyazaki said a interview that he rold George at some point the ring would be shattered.
I was wondering why he thought a video game would only take a year to make but than he mentioned the games he had played and they are all from like the 90s.
    I miss the days where an entire series of games was pumped out in like a 4 year timeframe. Spyro, Jak and Daxter, Crash Bandicoot, the unofficial trilogy of the best Zelda games (Majora’s Mask, Ocorana of Time, Wind Waker), plenty more. 

The wait for ES6 and GTA6 is killing me. ~10 years in the waiting for both.
        Hard to believe the entire Mass Effect Trilogy came out in a five year time frame.
            And even that was considered rushed iirc. Mass Effect 3 is an example of rushed development, despite the game being pretty well-received overall ~~ignoring the endings~~.
                I prefered the explanation for the Reapers that the original writer for Mass Effect 1 & 2 had before he left Bioware:

The mission in Mass Effect 2 where the Quarians are very concerned about a star going supernova millions of years earlier than it should have would have been foreshadowing for the reveal in Mass Effect 3.

You would have found out that mass effect technology is generating (or taking away I don't quite recall) dark matter that which is causing the stars to die out at an incredibly accelerated rate.

Hence the reason for the Reapers claiming that they are life's salvation. It is their job to allow life to flourish for a limited amount of time, 50,000 years, at which point continued use of Mass Effect technology would destroy the galaxy and the stars in it. Thus the Reapers must cull life to allow more life to flourish, everyone gets to enjoy life but not for ever.

The big choice would have been: Are we ultimately selfish for wanting to doom trillions of *potential* lives because we want more than what we are given and what is fairly allocated to everyone, or do we agree to sacrifice all current life to allow the galaxy to continue living and for more civilizations to have their chance?
                    This explanation would be fairly better, but it's explained half the way in ME3. Reapers basically take races compacts them into ships that serve as a collective consciousness of that race... which is cool because they all want to solve the problem of races killing themselves. To this point is everything okay, but the game is somewhat lackluster compared to the storytelling of ME1 and 2 but honestly, it shows that was made by a very good team that was arranged after 2 succesful launches really the game is the best combat in the series, andromeda feels meh but it's actually better combat wise.
                        Agreed. Even though the writing isn't as strong, it's by far the most fun to play.
                    I mean I enjoy both versions of the story honestly. I didn’t mind what it became but I wouldn’t mind what it could have been. It’s still one of the greatest Syfi stories ever
                        The thing about the ending we received that really got me (which I still have yet to accomplish in a playthrough) is the subversion of the color coding we were indoctrinated into throughout the whole series, that results in the secret ending (after killing the reapers, red option) implying that Shepard survives.

I already thought the storytelling was top notch, even after choosing the “green ending”. Finding out about that Easter egg was an “oh wow ok lmao” moment for me.
                            That kicked off the whole indoctrination thing.  Which narratively makes a whole lot of sense.  Shepard is constantly being indoctrinated through his contact with Reapers/Reaper tech (he was brought back to life with Reaper tech if I recall), and by the time 3 rolls around he's seeing a dead kid all the time who somehow turns out to be the exact manifestation the Reapers' central AI core takes later.

When presented with the 3 colored endings, they make Green and Blue seem to be the way to go because Red is just going to kill everything and that's super bad.  Yet, previous antagonists in the series have already attempted the Green and Blue endings and they don't work.  Saren attempted to work with the Reapers but was indoctrinated and synthesized with the Reapers (Green ending) losing himself totally by doing so.  The Illusive Man tried Blue, attempting to outsmart and take control of the Reapers, but he just ended up indoctrinated and losing too.

But Red, the only choice that hasn't been attempted so far, the only one that seems to immediately eliminate the threat, and the only one that the Reaper ghost kid is trying to dissuade you from taking by telling you the immediate and severe consequences, hasn't been tried yet.  When players take that choice, you get the hidden cutscene showing Shepard was alive.  And why?  Because he beat the indoctrination, made the right choice, and is getting back up from the laser blast that knocked him out ready to kick ass.
                                That’s why I never took too much stock in the original ending as being “terribly bad and just different flavors of the same thing” like so many were saying at the time. I thought it was clever for what they had to work with, given the time they had to realize it.
                            I don't think it was a subversion at all.  Blue choices were the 'Shepard is looking out for all sentient races equally' and red choices were the 'Shepard only cares about him/herself and Earth'.

The Blue ending saves everybody while sacrificing Shep, the Red ending saves Shep but kills EDI and all the other inorganic life good or bad.
                                Blue was pander to the reapers’ goals and red was kill the reapers. Whether or not blue saved everyone, red did as well because it stopped the reaper threat, which was always the primary goal. The inorganic vs organic life debate could then be allowed to potentially develop in a different way than history had shown, because of the knowledge gained and the existential threat stopped.

From a storytelling and gameplay perspective, it was subverting the taught expectations the series established and implied that Shepard (and us) was/were affected by indoctrination.
                    That's so much better.

I've beaten the Mass Effect trilogy twice now, once a year or two after it originally came out and once again when the Legendary Edition came out recently. And I couldn't exactly tell you what their purpose was. Which is a shame, because I still remember my playthrough of the first game when they were revealed as a powerful moment.

As I remember, Reapers were synthetic lifeforms who reasoned out that life would eventually become a never-ending cycle of organic life creating synthetic life and synthetic life destroying organic life. So they'd come through every 50,000 years to kill all organic life to prevent this.

Which, as I type it out, makes absolutely no sense at all.
                        Thats because you're misunderstanding two things, Reapers are NOT Synthetics, they are Technorganic Hybrids, an Organic Central Core created using the genetic information and material of an entire species wrapped in a highly advanced Reaper body.  
Secondly, as alluded to in the first point, they don't kill Organics. They harvest them. They take all the advanced races in the galaxy and turn them into a new Reaper.   


This is, as you said, to prevent the never ending cycle of Organic Create Synthetic, Synthetic Kill Organic.   


The Master AI of the Reaper's has a very skewed view of Synthetics and Organics thanks to its Creators God-like attitudes, so its not really a surprise that a Leviathan created AI's solution to this problem is put all Organics in time out before they can kill each other.
                        The difference would be, the synthetic life completely wiping out all organic matter like a virus & reapers wiping out all technologically advanced species and letting the next round of species develop.

In our universe the reapers act as a virus to wipe out humans as opposed to an asteroid to wipe out earth
                    Wow, I would have MUCH preferred that explanation.
                    Thats kind of the plot of The Eternals lol
                        Never saw it, was it any good?
                            People hated it but I liked it. Its different from other Marvel stuff. It has amazing visuals, using a good mix of real life filming locations and as well as tasteful cgi. The story is slow and long-winded, but its at least unique, and theres some good characters in there that get a little deeper than the usual superhero.
                90% of ME3 was amazing. The ending was the major flop. 

I never heard a bad thing about any other part of the game
                    The ending wasn’t bad if your goal was always to destroy the reapers. I remember when that Star kid kept talking, and all I could think about was “why is he giving me options? I’ve been pretty explicitly working towards 1 goal this entire time”
                    I did have more problems with ME3 besides the ending, even if I did like the game a lot (nightmare scenes of only the kid feels off, Geth having rewritten characterization from ME2, dropping the dark matter plot, Kai Leng, etc).
                    To me the ending is moot. I still strongly believe no matter your choice the reapers still wiped the galaxy clean and it’s just your indoctrination that is what we experience. I do love that it is open ended enough that you truly don’t know.
                        Word of the Creator explicitly rejects that theory.
                    The moon vehicle exploration sucks
                        It sucks, but man was that one of my favorite things to do in the first game

                            Yeah, it's insanely restrictive about that. 

If I'm guessing, at least ME3 had a [REDACTED] that attempts to fix the ending and throw away the star child plotline.

There's also another [REDACTED] that fixes the Planet Earth invasion by making the levels actually interesting.
                                Not even that, there are modz that add entirely new quests and missions into the game as well as a bunch of world building stuff
        Fuck man, this comment speaks to my soul
        [deleted]
            It was my understanding that they haven't even *started* production. It's all just pitch meetings and outlines right now.

Todd made it clear that ES6 will start production *after* Starfield is finished.
                Then Fallout 5 starts AFTER that ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry) They said they have an idea, but that's about it lol.
            IIRC they announced cyberpunk 2077 and then didn’t start work til 3 years later. That extra three years might have stopped it from being such a bad launch, especially since they mighta figured out much earlier on that it was never going to work properly on last gen consoles…
                Cyberpunk runs pretty good on PS4 and Xbox One nowadays.
                    Honestly it doesnt matter. Even if Cyberpunk ran perfectly at launch it's still dull and lifeless imo. Its honestly just one of those game you can mess around in for a few hours, but when you  put it down you don't feel the need to play again since it was nothing special
            Bethesda has absolutely lost it. And I say that as a person who counted them as my favorite developer for much of my life. Morrowind enthralled me as a kid, and I loved Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, etc. 

The people who view RPGs at art forms, or manners of storytelling, are no longer with Bethesda. They're a money making machine now. Mobile games. License out MMOs. Re-release Skyrim a dozen times. That's been what they've been doing outside of developing Starfield for the last 10 years.

In the meantime, Fromsoft has released the full suite of Souls games.
                Yeah, Bethesda has lost the script, and is starting to feel a little like Meta: telling customers what they want and trying to control the whole process from end to end.  They're overthinking every aspect of game creation and making the wrong stuff complicated.  Like you say, they are trying to come up with formulas to make money hand over fist, not create actual art or the best customer experience.
            Duke Nukem Forever was the best game ever.

Edit: /s just in case this is necessary.
            They likely know that Skyrim is still profitable somehow and want to continue to milk the udder dry.
            What comes first, ES6 or WoW?
            If ES6 is so far away, at least give us  another good Skyrim DLC.
        Call me a hater but I don't think either GTA or ES are gonna live up to 10+ years of hype. Games nowadays are so mediocre and a lot of times unfinished on release. Corporations getting more and more involved with video games has only made them worse and the goal is hardly about making art or something fun anymore, it's about getting a quick buck
        I've been on the es6 cope for longer than i've had pubes, im still not sure it'll ever come out
        I would not lump Windwaker with the others
            You’re right, Wind Waker is leagues better than the other two
                Said no one ever
                    It’s the best Zelda game hands down. Nothing else compares really.
                        Not even close
        I don’t like an assembly line of games, especially single player modern games. They could make them more often though and do not out of greed.
        How dare you put windwaker above minish cap.
        A Link to the Past > Wind Waker
        Hell yeah, I also love me some...

\*looks at faded writing in sweaty hand\*

Ocorana of Time!
    Homeworld was cool. Yes did the music for it.
And he recently said that The Winds of Winter is 75% done, 11 years later 😪
    I bet you that he's rewritten more than he's written. Thats what the hold up is and he's basically admitted it. What worries me is that winds will be longer than dance, so are we going to see it split again?
        I mean sure I have worked in long projects and Game of Thrones started and ended and the first season of House of the dragon started and ended and scripts were done and dragons and several souls games started and finished in 11 years.  But no winds.

Yes, I’m bitter, yes I won’t be reading nor winds or last king killers chronicle. Those two lost my faith in them. I’ll stick with Brandon Sanderson.
            I've reached the acceptance stage lol. I have no interest in the series at large (meaning the books or the original GoT show) but i am liking hotd since right now its a return to form. It could all go to shit ofc, but like i'll drop it without a second thought if it happens. As for Winds, I'm no longer keeping track of it. Let it come out and it'll be a pleasant surprise if it does (because i don't truly ever expect it to come out)
        I have zero qualifications for any sort of body language analysis, but you go watch that interview and after he says 75% his body language screams he’s completely full of shit! Like a little kid tryna lie vibes! Don’t get me wrong I love the dude and have spent my time living in the wonderful fantasy world he has crafted and shared with us, but man watch the interview.
Someone needs to gift him a mirror for his next birthday. Or perhaps a nice matching pot and kettle set.

        It’s all marketing gimmick
LOL. Man, if I worked my balls off writing and then all of a sudden HBO grabbed some of my work and I had "fuck you" money, I'd do nothing but eat chimichangas and enjoy the New Mexico sunset too.
    As someone who lives in New Mexico the sunsets here are mesmerizing
We’ll never get the books
    Correct
    He’s gonna Wheel of Time us. I’d bet money on it.
        Except we wont get a Sanderson to continue it
in his defense, video games have only expanded on their turnaround time since the 70s and 80s, where they could be pumped out much more quickly

whereas books seem to take the same amount of time, all said, as they did hundreds of years ago. publishing a proper body of work is consistent
    Writing a book might take the sa.e amount of time as it did 500 years ago. But publishing?
Man the logistics might not even compare to 50 years ago
Truly worthy of r/selfawarewolves

Lmaoooo zinger of the century
Glad I’m not the only one that spotted the irony there.
Same here it’s the only reason I was interested to watch this but Colbert obviously has no frame of reference so doesn’t know what is or isn’t interesting to fans. He should’ve just let George talk.
    I don't think George would have said much else tbh, he was probably asked not to say too much about the "old world". It's interesting how he randomly said the number "5000 years ago" though, seems really specific, specially due to the fact that he kept repeating it. I wonder if that's the official number of years that passed by since the Shattering?
        I thought that was the timeframe between the beginning of the lands between and the shattering.

For the Scarlet Rot to STILL just be in Caelid after 5000 years would mean it’s not spreading very quickly.
            Rot doesn't seem to spread aggressively through the land.


It's easily stopped by flowing water and flame. Look at the entrance of the lake of rot from nokstella and the divide between limgrave and caelid.
                This makes a lot of sense - flowing water washes away the stagnation and flame purifies
                    Flowing water is also directly associated to the legendary swordsman who locked away the god of rot using a flowing sword.
                        It plays a little into the idea that flowing water is clean where as still water is tainted.
                            That's like a big thing in Japanese society. Death and decomposition in general was and still is considered taboo.

They used to have trouble handling the deceased before Buddhism arrived in Japan.

On a side note, blood, especially menstrual flow is also considered cursed and forbidden to touch. But that topic is for another day or rather another game.
                                Yeah that’s one of the central themes of Dark Souls (1,2 and 3). Gwyn metaphorically damned up the river by extending the Age of Fire and creating Hollows with the Curse Mark. Dark Souls 3 goes a little more into this (besides the Ringed City’s big exposition) with the Human Dregs. It’s Humanity settling into the water like sediment, building up and poisoning the water because the Age of Fire keeps repeating.
            >I thought that was the timeframe between the beginning of the lands between and the shattering.

That was my thought as well, seems more reasonable. At the very least, I’m not given the impression that the Shattering happened in the last 1000 years, *maybe* last 100 at the latest?

>For the Scarlet Rot to STILL just be in Caelid after 5000 years would mean it’s not spreading very quickly

Well, granted, there is the Lake of Rot…But regarding Caelid, there’s this odd little sentence in the Mushroom Crown description:

>Long ago, great lords served the scarlet rot. Perhaps such fungal bodies served as their crowns.

So, Caelid got rotted “long ago” enough to warrant some “great lords” to worship it, all after Malenia bloomed during the Shattering.

Still incredibly vague on any specific timeframe, sadly.
                I believe the lake of rot predates the shattering and Malenia's bloom in Caelid by quite a bit. It seems like the Uld were already worshipping it long before Marika's reign.
                    We can see that the pests there are certainly worshipping it, but it’s tricky to gauge the sort of reverence the Uld held for that Rot God. Did they house the relic for worship, or as a warning and to keep it protected?

I’m not sure where I align. But I have to admit that I’m creeped out by how intact those ruins are, in spite of all the rot.

And now based on the post from u/jcheesus I’m thinking they definitely had some influential followers back then.
                the mushroom crown is found in the lake of rot though. and lake of rot is obviously much older than the swamp of aeonia, the rot in the lake is a vivid, red hue, it looks like a much more advanced infection than the brownish aeonian rot

this is because malenia's mentor, the blind swordsman sealed the outer god of rot somewhere around the lake of rot. i suspect that this is because lots of water from the eternal cities flow down there, and the flowing water is antithetical to the rot, since it clears the stagnation that the rot prefers. its clearly inspired by the concept of "kegare" which was also very important in sekiro  


caelid only got rotted when malenia bloomed there in the battle with radahn. only the kindred of rot are explicitly said to have come out of the aeonian swamp. the aeonian butterflies must have also come into existence back then, since malenia has her wings in second phase made from them, but they are already around to collect before that
                    >the mushroom crown is found in the lake of rot though.

WHOOPS. That’s a *huge* detail I overlooked. I thought I picked it up with the rest of the mushroom set in Seethwater cave.
        I doubt it is, there's still siege equipment and banners everywhere from the Shattering so it can't be more than a few years before the game takes place, maybe a decade.
            It's worth mentioning that there are gravesites for battles from the shattering that were fought long before the fights we actually see the remains of, the world does look quite old in general, cities in lurania are sinking, the majority of villages are reduced to ruins.

I'd put my money on at least a few hundred years.
                Topes says the Acadamy shut up shop in response to the Shattering War. There’s some question as to when during or after the war this happened, but whenever it was Topes has been just hanging around ever since.

We also have Enya suggesting that timescales for Tarnished are at most a single-digit multiple of timescales for humans—she suggests that “thousands or tens of thousands of days” is too long for us to wait for the Two Fingers to get off hold with the Greater Will, so somewhere not too far north of 2.75 years is a long time for us and for Topes.

I’m given to understand that the English goes with “moons”, though, which in a natural interpretation of “months” would smack a big multiplier on top. There may be a different interpretation of “moons”, otherwise I’m not sure what to make of that.
        I figured it was over a millenia given the context clues but 5k years is crazy high fantasy numbers
    Talk shows are not long winded interviews. They are maybe five questions with short zingers. Shouldn’t expect more than that.
    I dunno about that. Colbert is a notoriously huge nerd who’s super into Tolkien and stuff. It honestly wouldn’t surprise me if he’d played Elden Ring.
        Eh, he’s definitely a book nerd, but probably not a gaming nerd.
        Very numb of him then, to not want to let the creator gush about the things the fans don’t know.
            This interview was fantastic, and Colbert let him talk practically the entire time. It’s not an elden ring podcast, he’s got other things going on lol.
I've been thinking this for years myself
pretty much it was all written in napkins
While your joke rings true, I think he was calling out his ignorance as to what goes in to making a video game rather than the speed at which game developers work.
    You're right. He played games in 90s, when it took few months to pump a game out. I think original Doom was done in several months (less that a year). Modern games are much bigger and harder to make, but George is just out of the loop
        Also, many people don’t understand the art that goes into a video game. Character design, set design, music, story, voice acting. People who don’t play definitely take that stuff for granted.
That’s been FromSoft’s MO towards most of their DLC.
    All fromsoft DLCs have involved at least some time-fuckery have they not? Artorias obviously, the crowns of the old kings in DS2, the ringed city being the end of time...maybe the fishing hamlet in Bloodborne doesnt fit in though
        >maybe the fishing hamlet in Bloodborne doesnt fit in though

That whole area is highlighting where Laurence and maybe Wilhelm with their Byrgenwerth fellows got their first major exposure to Great One goodness. The Hunter’s Nightmare in general seems to be a “snapshot” of what it was like at the time, similar to the Hunter’s Workshop in the Hunter’s Dream.

I like to use the lack of the Healing Church hunter workshop in the Hunter’s Nightmare as a reference for that. I’m not even sure of the Orphanage was built yet.
        All Crowns, Ashes of Ariandel, a majority of Ringed City and *I believe* the Old Hunters take place in the present. 

Artorias was by far the most overt "going back in time", so much that it's intrinsically part of the story of Ds1. Artorias was credited with defeating the Abyss, but the truth is that we defeated Manus. 

And with the power of time fuckery, we get one of the best alternate cutscenes with Sif. The DLC played *really* into the time aspect. 

The Old Hunters is the one I'm scratching my head a tiny bit about. I think it's just a different nightmare realm, moreso than being time travel. I get the impression it's kinda present day because of how fucked Ludwig, Laurence and Maria are when we fight them.  

Ringed City time fuckery feels kinda footnote to be honest. It's only a thing for the final boss pretty much.
            The Ringed City takes place in every moment in time as first you're in the dreg heap which is every point of existence converging, then you're in the ringed city which kinda exists outside of time as far as I know and then you get transported into the future after Gael has killed everything.
            The Old Hunters is basically a pocket dimension (a dead God’s nightmare) where Blood Addled Hunters are banished and imprisoned. My headcanon is is that the strongest hunters influence the nightmare when they are banished there. The beginning is the Church at the height of their power (Ludwig’s nightmare). Middle is the Lab where the Church was just beginning to understand the Blood (Maria’s nightmare). The end is where it all begin, the Fishing Hamlet where Kos was murdered and her child stolen (Gerhman’s/Orphan’s nightmare). A Nightmare seems to be able to exist even if it’s creator is dead (Mergo is technically dead but their Nightmare realm still exist).

At the end of the DLC, you get “Nightmare Slain” instead of “Prey Slaughtered”. It’s the same with Mergo’s Wet Nurse. Gerhman even has restful dreams after you complete the DLC too. It’s honestly just my interpretation so don’t take it as fact but to me you’re not going back in time, more like you’re experiencing very complex memories given form.
        And the sekiro dlc t… oh wait
        The sekiro dlc… wait
    yeah it happened in ds1 ds2 and bloodborne. U go back in Sekiro too but its not a DLC i think the only game you dont is ds3
        Well technically you do time travel in the Ringed City DLC, only instead of backwards you go forwards, twice. First you journey to the Dreg Heap where the whole world seems to be collapsing in on itself in the future, then you travel even further forward after reaching Filianore to where the world is now just one vast ashen desert with only the crumbling ruins of Lothric and Anor Londo remaining in the distance.
            Yup and my personal theory is that The Ringed City itself was frozen in time. And when Filianore woke up all the time that had passed caught up to it. Which would be just after the beginning of the Age of Fire. So the year it would’ve been basically would’ve doubled.
                It’s interesting you say that because I always assumed you were flung forward in time after the egg breaks. The one Pygmy Lord that’s barely alive says that the “Red Hood has come to eat us” which implies that Gael has a reputation and that the Pygmies knew he was coming for at least a while.
                    It’s tough to explain but let’s say The Ringed City was sealed in year 1 and it’s currently year 1000. When the egg broke, it sent you forward 999 years but since the rest of the world was already at year 1000 it would instead send you forward 1999 years in order for the world and The Ringed City to align time wise. This gives Gael tons of time to get his reputation
                        That makes sense and yet in true Miyazaki storytelling only raises more questions.
    Yeah Gael and Maria were both created by GRRM as well
    Did they do it in DS2? If not then they did it exactly once.
        >Did they do it in DS2?

For Shulva? Maybe. Brume Tower? I’d imagine so, it’s no longer anywhere near the Iron Keep and the remaining tower doesn’t match it. Frozen Loyce? Well, it’s certainly not snowy anywhere anymore. Bloodborne’s DLC is similarly about exploring the past.
the old tarnished
Wasn’t there some announcement or rumor that it was being released as a book? I thought I heard that.
I do believe it is more his fear of addiction, but I bet he is writing though. Just not Winds of Winter. He is involved is a stupid number of projects.
    He's definitely writing, had a new book come out yesterday lmao.  He's probably just terrified to write asoiaf at this point
        Sorry and I don't mean to sound like one of those people that's mad at him because I appreciate everything hes done 

of course I want him to finish the books but I also understand hes kind of in a hole

 I really hope he finishes but I've also kind of resigned myself to the fact that he probably won't - I just can't see him pushing out 2 more books
            Lol nah you really didn't sound like them at all, people get crazy about it.  I just always think it's funny when people call him lazy and stuff like that.  The dude is still writing a good amount, it's just not in the series everyone wants.  I get both sides, asoiaf is by far my favorite fantasy series, of course I wanna see it end.  But he's in a tough spot, more so now than ever before after the amount of time and the HBO series.  He probably has panic attacks thinking about it.  At this point, I'd be so happy to see em come out, but I'm not gonna hold it against the guy if he doesn't get around to it
                Same

 I know hes claimed he would never let anybody finish the series but I do wonder if things did take a turn for the worst or if he did run out of time - if he would allow someone to finish

But hopefully he pulls it off and is with us 20 more years
    Yep
5 actually. Ds2, BB, Ds3, Sekiro & Elden Ring 

6 if you count Deracine as well, but obviously much smaller in scope.
    If you want to get really technical, A Dance With Dragons came out a few months before the first Dark Souls. So really 7 games plus 7 or 8 DLCs?
     well, there we have it. didn't realise DS2 was only in 2014!
        When did you think it was?
            maybe 2011! god damn!
yes, but George has written 3 and co-authored in like 12 books since 2011 as well. Winds is just not one of them
    yeah reference books and whatnot.
        Yes-ish, granted "World of Ice and Fire" is a pretty hefty reference book, but Fire and Blood is a rather conventional story though - just portrayed as a sort of in-world history book. And the Hedge Knight stories, as well as wildcards are just straightforward novels.
I do too, unfortunately I don't think we'll ever get it. Historically Miyazaki has wanted the 'truth' of these games to remain mysterious and vague enough that players can fill in the blanks themselves. Having the groundwork would give us some excellent detail but then the cat would be out of the proverbial bag, it's possible we get more hints in DLC though!
He says he’s 75% done with Winds… so it will be out in five more years
    35% of that is leftover from the previous book tho
    Be thankful you're still alive when he finally releases it
    Last 10% always takes 90% of the time.
Oh, sweet summer child.
Oh, thanks.

Unless that sarcasm and I didn’t pick it up.
    It was not sarcasm.
Idk, he literally wrote the entire world up until the shattering, that's pretty substantial.

I would agree that the advertising was very purposefully trying to make it sound like he basically wrote the entire story in the game when obviously that's not the case.

They put his name *really* front and center for a reason.
    >They put his name really front and center for a reason.

Yeah, because his name alone was marketing. 

Nothing against George, but you could tell me the whole thing was Miyazaki and his team and it wouldn't surprise me in the least. The whole Elden Ring plot and lore is very similar to Dark Souls and Bloodborne.
        the whole shattering and night of black knives is very similar to Georges works as well though.
            The night of the black knives is very red wedding-esc
        I don’t think George is lying to us here, because the pre-shattering world and events feel very in-line with GRRMs writing. While it is true his name is selling the game, and From definitely wrote the actual games story, he isn’t some cheap name to just plaster on your box. It’s kinda silly to hire such an expensive author and have him not contribute and do what he was hired for. The dude wrote the backstory, fleshed out the Lands Between, and characterized the godly characters. From built their game and it’s story on that foundation. 

Also, as a fan of George’s work for a while now, It’s safe to say he had no problem jumping ship for some time away on Winds of Winter and pick up a check while fleshing out a new fun fantasy world. WoW is breaking this dudes spirit. He just admitted he did this very same thing to write Fire and Blood from 2016-2018.
I sort of assumed before the game came out that it was mostly Martin doing the story.  After I started playing it though I got the feeling he had very little to do with it.  It's hard to explain but I've read his books and played every soulsborne game so I sort of get which "vibe" the story gives off and everything was overwhelming Miyazaki.  Even though the fact that it's a game probably skews that feeling but I really didn't get a GRRM influence on anything about the story or lore even though I'm sure he had a hand in it.
Tbf he has written several books.  I think one just came out a week or two ago.  Unfortunately it's not the book everyone wants lol
I think he wrote like 1000 then threw it in the fire and laughed at our tears
George may have been aware of that principle but there’s no way he ever adhered to it, we’ve got at least four Jons in the books, book one has  Jeor, Jorah and Jory, and so on.
G, R, and M

His initials…
    [deleted]
        Huh? I didn’t know I was just saying it because I only now noticed after seeing you put them out there like that
I believe he called it a sequel to the Dark Souls series. Pretty sure i've watched that interview around the time the game (or the network test) released.
[deleted]
I interpreted that as the regular years before the shattering and then the war itself
Yeah that caught me off guard
This your first FromSoft game?
My opinion on Marika rides a lot on whether or not she actually knew that Ranni was going to murder her son Godwyn.

If she knew it was part of the plan then it doesn't get much more evil than that but if she didn't know then I can sympathize with her quest to destroy the Golden Order.
    The sacrifice of your own son in exchange for the possibility to fix the entire world sunk in stagnation and madness doesn't seem that evil
        "Whoa! Were you about to murder that kid?"

"No, I was not going to *murder* my son, I was going to *sacrifice* him, there's a difference"

"Not to him, there isn't!"
            Well if I was told my death would give the entire world a chance of improvement I'd gladly give my life for it.
    The thing is: she causes the downfall of her children. And in Godwyns case: Marika could release the rune of death to put an end to his suffering, but she doesn‘t. Go figure
In all fairness, it's just ignorance, not necessarily him criticising them
    That's fair
He didn’t criticize it. He just said he was surprised it takes so long, which makes sense given that the games he’s used to are much older and less complex. It is funny for him to say that, but he wasn’t criticizing them.
george last played 2d video games. if he played elden ring the camera alone would cause him to get dizzy and throw up
He meant video games in general, not FromSoft in particular.

He said it turns out video games can take 'longer than motion pictures'.

So I guess he just thought he'd hand them a story and they'd be done in a year or so.
    Yeeeeah. 

Games are like books.

They get done when effort is involved.
"lazy prick"... Have you tried writing before dawg? Imagine writing books upon books having writer's block, publishers at your back, and the worst of all


Fucking entitled fans asking for shit and it MUST BE PERFECT or all hell breaks loose...

Shit ain't easy
    Also dude has written almost 2 million words for the main ASoIaF series alone. That's insane considering he has more material in that world plus tons of other stories. The guy is by no means lazy.
        Damn right? I don't get these entitled folk who think everyone owes them everything... Calm down clown you're a nobody asking things from established creators
    Don't care. He's had time aplenty but is content with doing other projects instead. Keeps giving deadlines and misses them time and again.
        Lmao "He's had time aplenty but is content with doing other projects". You're saying dude is happy doing other things than his job, sound like burnout... And what are you? His boss? Grow up and go read other books.
            The other things he does are also his job. People like this guy are ridiculously entitled.
        Better than Rothfuss, at least GRRM *is* writing, even if he's not writing Winds.
        Cry more
        If you use the word “aplenty” anything you say after that will not be taken seriously.
Just look at your downvotes and ask yourself if what you said makes any sense 🤦‍♂️
    Yeah cos reddit downvotes are any indication of anything lmao. Ask yourself why you think they do.
        You called him a lazy prick, like is he obliged to provide new books for you whenever you need it. Of course you are getting downvoted
            Yeah the lazy prick needs to finish his job before the heart attack gets him.
        My brother in christ…get a therapist
            I must be bonkers not to care about reddit downvotes. Lmao
                No. You’re bonkers for a lot of reasons, buddy.
                    Lol k
                        I hope you get the help you need, friend
                            I'm all good thanks mate, reddit downvotes don't hurt my feelings.
                                Again, not what I’m talking about. But if that’s what you need to tell yourself to cope, I understand and sympathize.
        You need help buddy. I feel kind of sorry for you
Please elaborate on why he is a lazy prick.  Do you think he owes you something?
If you want high quantity content just go buy every ubisoft game
It's common to see GRRM get more credit for the story/lore/characters than not, but ironically you're doing the opposite by saying he's a consultant. 

He straight up didn't consult them. He was approached by FromSoft *many* years back to help create worldbuilding, and when he did that, he wasn't involved any further. 

He also said so himself in an interview before the game launched. [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHzJG1hHTdU)

> *"I created a fairly detailed background for them, and then they took it from there, so y'know, it's really, it's been several years since I've last seen them"*

The short is that he helped create worldbuilding and the setting for Elden Ring, but obviously FromSoft took that worldbuilding and gave it the ol' FromSoftware touch. It's not one or the other's lore, it was a collaborative effort.
I think he meant 5000 years which includes the shattering at the tail end

I'm sure he wrote a ton of pre-war lore in Lands Between
So Gael is Alive still looking for the dark souls while we do this Game and when we do frenzy flame ending ranged city DLC kicks in?
    [deleted]
        Youre talking about jerren and radhan not radagon and Gael at the end there
Yeah, Miyazaki himself stated in the Edge magazine interview before the game's release:

> **Miyazaki:** We started off by giving him these very vague and broad themes and ideas for the mythos that I had swimming around in my head, along with what kind of games we typically make, and the sort of themes we'd like to explore in our games. 

> So it was all very loose and quite vague. Then he would come back to us with a lot of ideas: *how about this, this and this?* That back-and-forth started the exchange of ideas.

He also stated they provided vague ideas and themes because they wanted George to be able to flex his creative muscles, instead of having to adhere to strict set of requirements.

____

This does make me wonder if he's also responsible for Farum Azula and the Order of dragons? In my mind I credited that moreso to FromSoftware, but it's definitely one of the oldest parts of the lore.
    This might be an instance where both parties contributed. GRRM loves dragons and I'm sure he factored them into the lore he wrote, but I think fromsoft were probably responsible for aspects such as the stone scales, the weakness to lightning (in the case of the lesser dragons), and the idea of different factions trying to create their own dragons or become dragons themselves, since those are all ideas they've explored in the past.
        GRRM and Miyazaki certainly bonded over their mutual love of dragons and misery.
            But mostly misery.
                *OUR misery.
        The weakness to light- THE WEAKNESS TO LIGHTNING?  You're telling me I've been slapping these things down for 20 minutes sloggy style with my halo scythe with 4 lightning inc's just chilling in my offhand
        GRRM probably set up a lot of the dragon stuff and pulled themes from past representations of from dragons (them being the most ancient of races made of stone) then of course From comes on and creates the content so youre going to see their touches everywhere.
        Dragons having stone scales and being weak to lightning were in the souls games so would make sense that fromsoft were the ones to add it.
    GRRM definitely loves dragons. Their strong resemblance to DS1 dragons makes them seem very FromSoft, but that design might as well be an afterthought
    From probably said they wanted dragons to be the ones ruling before,and George created Farum Azula,and the story of how the dragons started becoming weaker and regressing to a animalistic state and at some point attacked Leyndell.

What its interesting to me is the 5 thousand years he talks,its 5 thousand years from Marika's rule,from the dragons or from when the Elden Beast landed in the lands between.
Then they went fuck that we… there a shattering and we can do video-games stuff.
    Exactly
I could be wrong because they worded it oddly, but I think they meant 5000 years from when elden beast landed/age of dragons up to when Marika entered the picture.
    Ah yea, that would make a lot of sense
I miss the days where an entire series of games was pumped out in like a 4 year timeframe. Spyro, Jak and Daxter, Crash Bandicoot, the unofficial trilogy of the best Zelda games (Majora’s Mask, Ocorana of Time, Wind Waker), plenty more. 

The wait for ES6 and GTA6 is killing me. ~10 years in the waiting for both.
    Hard to believe the entire Mass Effect Trilogy came out in a five year time frame.
        And even that was considered rushed iirc. Mass Effect 3 is an example of rushed development, despite the game being pretty well-received overall ~~ignoring the endings~~.
            I prefered the explanation for the Reapers that the original writer for Mass Effect 1 & 2 had before he left Bioware:

The mission in Mass Effect 2 where the Quarians are very concerned about a star going supernova millions of years earlier than it should have would have been foreshadowing for the reveal in Mass Effect 3.

You would have found out that mass effect technology is generating (or taking away I don't quite recall) dark matter that which is causing the stars to die out at an incredibly accelerated rate.

Hence the reason for the Reapers claiming that they are life's salvation. It is their job to allow life to flourish for a limited amount of time, 50,000 years, at which point continued use of Mass Effect technology would destroy the galaxy and the stars in it. Thus the Reapers must cull life to allow more life to flourish, everyone gets to enjoy life but not for ever.

The big choice would have been: Are we ultimately selfish for wanting to doom trillions of *potential* lives because we want more than what we are given and what is fairly allocated to everyone, or do we agree to sacrifice all current life to allow the galaxy to continue living and for more civilizations to have their chance?
                This explanation would be fairly better, but it's explained half the way in ME3. Reapers basically take races compacts them into ships that serve as a collective consciousness of that race... which is cool because they all want to solve the problem of races killing themselves. To this point is everything okay, but the game is somewhat lackluster compared to the storytelling of ME1 and 2 but honestly, it shows that was made by a very good team that was arranged after 2 succesful launches really the game is the best combat in the series, andromeda feels meh but it's actually better combat wise.
                    Agreed. Even though the writing isn't as strong, it's by far the most fun to play.
                I mean I enjoy both versions of the story honestly. I didn’t mind what it became but I wouldn’t mind what it could have been. It’s still one of the greatest Syfi stories ever
                    The thing about the ending we received that really got me (which I still have yet to accomplish in a playthrough) is the subversion of the color coding we were indoctrinated into throughout the whole series, that results in the secret ending (after killing the reapers, red option) implying that Shepard survives.

I already thought the storytelling was top notch, even after choosing the “green ending”. Finding out about that Easter egg was an “oh wow ok lmao” moment for me.
                        That kicked off the whole indoctrination thing.  Which narratively makes a whole lot of sense.  Shepard is constantly being indoctrinated through his contact with Reapers/Reaper tech (he was brought back to life with Reaper tech if I recall), and by the time 3 rolls around he's seeing a dead kid all the time who somehow turns out to be the exact manifestation the Reapers' central AI core takes later.

When presented with the 3 colored endings, they make Green and Blue seem to be the way to go because Red is just going to kill everything and that's super bad.  Yet, previous antagonists in the series have already attempted the Green and Blue endings and they don't work.  Saren attempted to work with the Reapers but was indoctrinated and synthesized with the Reapers (Green ending) losing himself totally by doing so.  The Illusive Man tried Blue, attempting to outsmart and take control of the Reapers, but he just ended up indoctrinated and losing too.

But Red, the only choice that hasn't been attempted so far, the only one that seems to immediately eliminate the threat, and the only one that the Reaper ghost kid is trying to dissuade you from taking by telling you the immediate and severe consequences, hasn't been tried yet.  When players take that choice, you get the hidden cutscene showing Shepard was alive.  And why?  Because he beat the indoctrination, made the right choice, and is getting back up from the laser blast that knocked him out ready to kick ass.
                            That’s why I never took too much stock in the original ending as being “terribly bad and just different flavors of the same thing” like so many were saying at the time. I thought it was clever for what they had to work with, given the time they had to realize it.
                        I don't think it was a subversion at all.  Blue choices were the 'Shepard is looking out for all sentient races equally' and red choices were the 'Shepard only cares about him/herself and Earth'.

The Blue ending saves everybody while sacrificing Shep, the Red ending saves Shep but kills EDI and all the other inorganic life good or bad.
                            Blue was pander to the reapers’ goals and red was kill the reapers. Whether or not blue saved everyone, red did as well because it stopped the reaper threat, which was always the primary goal. The inorganic vs organic life debate could then be allowed to potentially develop in a different way than history had shown, because of the knowledge gained and the existential threat stopped.

From a storytelling and gameplay perspective, it was subverting the taught expectations the series established and implied that Shepard (and us) was/were affected by indoctrination.
                That's so much better.

I've beaten the Mass Effect trilogy twice now, once a year or two after it originally came out and once again when the Legendary Edition came out recently. And I couldn't exactly tell you what their purpose was. Which is a shame, because I still remember my playthrough of the first game when they were revealed as a powerful moment.

As I remember, Reapers were synthetic lifeforms who reasoned out that life would eventually become a never-ending cycle of organic life creating synthetic life and synthetic life destroying organic life. So they'd come through every 50,000 years to kill all organic life to prevent this.

Which, as I type it out, makes absolutely no sense at all.
                    Thats because you're misunderstanding two things, Reapers are NOT Synthetics, they are Technorganic Hybrids, an Organic Central Core created using the genetic information and material of an entire species wrapped in a highly advanced Reaper body.  
Secondly, as alluded to in the first point, they don't kill Organics. They harvest them. They take all the advanced races in the galaxy and turn them into a new Reaper.   


This is, as you said, to prevent the never ending cycle of Organic Create Synthetic, Synthetic Kill Organic.   


The Master AI of the Reaper's has a very skewed view of Synthetics and Organics thanks to its Creators God-like attitudes, so its not really a surprise that a Leviathan created AI's solution to this problem is put all Organics in time out before they can kill each other.
                    The difference would be, the synthetic life completely wiping out all organic matter like a virus & reapers wiping out all technologically advanced species and letting the next round of species develop.

In our universe the reapers act as a virus to wipe out humans as opposed to an asteroid to wipe out earth
                Wow, I would have MUCH preferred that explanation.
                Thats kind of the plot of The Eternals lol
                    Never saw it, was it any good?
                        People hated it but I liked it. Its different from other Marvel stuff. It has amazing visuals, using a good mix of real life filming locations and as well as tasteful cgi. The story is slow and long-winded, but its at least unique, and theres some good characters in there that get a little deeper than the usual superhero.
            90% of ME3 was amazing. The ending was the major flop. 

I never heard a bad thing about any other part of the game
                The ending wasn’t bad if your goal was always to destroy the reapers. I remember when that Star kid kept talking, and all I could think about was “why is he giving me options? I’ve been pretty explicitly working towards 1 goal this entire time”
                I did have more problems with ME3 besides the ending, even if I did like the game a lot (nightmare scenes of only the kid feels off, Geth having rewritten characterization from ME2, dropping the dark matter plot, Kai Leng, etc).
                To me the ending is moot. I still strongly believe no matter your choice the reapers still wiped the galaxy clean and it’s just your indoctrination that is what we experience. I do love that it is open ended enough that you truly don’t know.
                    Word of the Creator explicitly rejects that theory.
                The moon vehicle exploration sucks
                    It sucks, but man was that one of my favorite things to do in the first game

                        Yeah, it's insanely restrictive about that. 

If I'm guessing, at least ME3 had a [REDACTED] that attempts to fix the ending and throw away the star child plotline.

There's also another [REDACTED] that fixes the Planet Earth invasion by making the levels actually interesting.
                            Not even that, there are modz that add entirely new quests and missions into the game as well as a bunch of world building stuff
    Fuck man, this comment speaks to my soul
    [deleted]
        It was my understanding that they haven't even *started* production. It's all just pitch meetings and outlines right now.

Todd made it clear that ES6 will start production *after* Starfield is finished.
            Then Fallout 5 starts AFTER that ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry) They said they have an idea, but that's about it lol.
        IIRC they announced cyberpunk 2077 and then didn’t start work til 3 years later. That extra three years might have stopped it from being such a bad launch, especially since they mighta figured out much earlier on that it was never going to work properly on last gen consoles…
            Cyberpunk runs pretty good on PS4 and Xbox One nowadays.
                Honestly it doesnt matter. Even if Cyberpunk ran perfectly at launch it's still dull and lifeless imo. Its honestly just one of those game you can mess around in for a few hours, but when you  put it down you don't feel the need to play again since it was nothing special
        Bethesda has absolutely lost it. And I say that as a person who counted them as my favorite developer for much of my life. Morrowind enthralled me as a kid, and I loved Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, etc. 

The people who view RPGs at art forms, or manners of storytelling, are no longer with Bethesda. They're a money making machine now. Mobile games. License out MMOs. Re-release Skyrim a dozen times. That's been what they've been doing outside of developing Starfield for the last 10 years.

In the meantime, Fromsoft has released the full suite of Souls games.
            Yeah, Bethesda has lost the script, and is starting to feel a little like Meta: telling customers what they want and trying to control the whole process from end to end.  They're overthinking every aspect of game creation and making the wrong stuff complicated.  Like you say, they are trying to come up with formulas to make money hand over fist, not create actual art or the best customer experience.
        Duke Nukem Forever was the best game ever.

Edit: /s just in case this is necessary.
        They likely know that Skyrim is still profitable somehow and want to continue to milk the udder dry.
        What comes first, ES6 or WoW?
        If ES6 is so far away, at least give us  another good Skyrim DLC.
    Call me a hater but I don't think either GTA or ES are gonna live up to 10+ years of hype. Games nowadays are so mediocre and a lot of times unfinished on release. Corporations getting more and more involved with video games has only made them worse and the goal is hardly about making art or something fun anymore, it's about getting a quick buck
    I've been on the es6 cope for longer than i've had pubes, im still not sure it'll ever come out
    I would not lump Windwaker with the others
        You’re right, Wind Waker is leagues better than the other two
            Said no one ever
                It’s the best Zelda game hands down. Nothing else compares really.
                    Not even close
    I don’t like an assembly line of games, especially single player modern games. They could make them more often though and do not out of greed.
    How dare you put windwaker above minish cap.
    A Link to the Past > Wind Waker
    Hell yeah, I also love me some...

\*looks at faded writing in sweaty hand\*

Ocorana of Time!
Homeworld was cool. Yes did the music for it.
I bet you that he's rewritten more than he's written. Thats what the hold up is and he's basically admitted it. What worries me is that winds will be longer than dance, so are we going to see it split again?
    I mean sure I have worked in long projects and Game of Thrones started and ended and the first season of House of the dragon started and ended and scripts were done and dragons and several souls games started and finished in 11 years.  But no winds.

Yes, I’m bitter, yes I won’t be reading nor winds or last king killers chronicle. Those two lost my faith in them. I’ll stick with Brandon Sanderson.
        I've reached the acceptance stage lol. I have no interest in the series at large (meaning the books or the original GoT show) but i am liking hotd since right now its a return to form. It could all go to shit ofc, but like i'll drop it without a second thought if it happens. As for Winds, I'm no longer keeping track of it. Let it come out and it'll be a pleasant surprise if it does (because i don't truly ever expect it to come out)
    I have zero qualifications for any sort of body language analysis, but you go watch that interview and after he says 75% his body language screams he’s completely full of shit! Like a little kid tryna lie vibes! Don’t get me wrong I love the dude and have spent my time living in the wonderful fantasy world he has crafted and shared with us, but man watch the interview.

    It’s all marketing gimmick
As someone who lives in New Mexico the sunsets here are mesmerizing
Correct
He’s gonna Wheel of Time us. I’d bet money on it.
    Except we wont get a Sanderson to continue it
Writing a book might take the sa.e amount of time as it did 500 years ago. But publishing?
Man the logistics might not even compare to 50 years ago
I don't think George would have said much else tbh, he was probably asked not to say too much about the "old world". It's interesting how he randomly said the number "5000 years ago" though, seems really specific, specially due to the fact that he kept repeating it. I wonder if that's the official number of years that passed by since the Shattering?
    I thought that was the timeframe between the beginning of the lands between and the shattering.

For the Scarlet Rot to STILL just be in Caelid after 5000 years would mean it’s not spreading very quickly.
        Rot doesn't seem to spread aggressively through the land.


It's easily stopped by flowing water and flame. Look at the entrance of the lake of rot from nokstella and the divide between limgrave and caelid.
            This makes a lot of sense - flowing water washes away the stagnation and flame purifies
                Flowing water is also directly associated to the legendary swordsman who locked away the god of rot using a flowing sword.
                    It plays a little into the idea that flowing water is clean where as still water is tainted.
                        That's like a big thing in Japanese society. Death and decomposition in general was and still is considered taboo.

They used to have trouble handling the deceased before Buddhism arrived in Japan.

On a side note, blood, especially menstrual flow is also considered cursed and forbidden to touch. But that topic is for another day or rather another game.
                            Yeah that’s one of the central themes of Dark Souls (1,2 and 3). Gwyn metaphorically damned up the river by extending the Age of Fire and creating Hollows with the Curse Mark. Dark Souls 3 goes a little more into this (besides the Ringed City’s big exposition) with the Human Dregs. It’s Humanity settling into the water like sediment, building up and poisoning the water because the Age of Fire keeps repeating.
        >I thought that was the timeframe between the beginning of the lands between and the shattering.

That was my thought as well, seems more reasonable. At the very least, I’m not given the impression that the Shattering happened in the last 1000 years, *maybe* last 100 at the latest?

>For the Scarlet Rot to STILL just be in Caelid after 5000 years would mean it’s not spreading very quickly

Well, granted, there is the Lake of Rot…But regarding Caelid, there’s this odd little sentence in the Mushroom Crown description:

>Long ago, great lords served the scarlet rot. Perhaps such fungal bodies served as their crowns.

So, Caelid got rotted “long ago” enough to warrant some “great lords” to worship it, all after Malenia bloomed during the Shattering.

Still incredibly vague on any specific timeframe, sadly.
            I believe the lake of rot predates the shattering and Malenia's bloom in Caelid by quite a bit. It seems like the Uld were already worshipping it long before Marika's reign.
                We can see that the pests there are certainly worshipping it, but it’s tricky to gauge the sort of reverence the Uld held for that Rot God. Did they house the relic for worship, or as a warning and to keep it protected?

I’m not sure where I align. But I have to admit that I’m creeped out by how intact those ruins are, in spite of all the rot.

And now based on the post from u/jcheesus I’m thinking they definitely had some influential followers back then.
            the mushroom crown is found in the lake of rot though. and lake of rot is obviously much older than the swamp of aeonia, the rot in the lake is a vivid, red hue, it looks like a much more advanced infection than the brownish aeonian rot

this is because malenia's mentor, the blind swordsman sealed the outer god of rot somewhere around the lake of rot. i suspect that this is because lots of water from the eternal cities flow down there, and the flowing water is antithetical to the rot, since it clears the stagnation that the rot prefers. its clearly inspired by the concept of "kegare" which was also very important in sekiro  


caelid only got rotted when malenia bloomed there in the battle with radahn. only the kindred of rot are explicitly said to have come out of the aeonian swamp. the aeonian butterflies must have also come into existence back then, since malenia has her wings in second phase made from them, but they are already around to collect before that
                >the mushroom crown is found in the lake of rot though.

WHOOPS. That’s a *huge* detail I overlooked. I thought I picked it up with the rest of the mushroom set in Seethwater cave.
    I doubt it is, there's still siege equipment and banners everywhere from the Shattering so it can't be more than a few years before the game takes place, maybe a decade.
        It's worth mentioning that there are gravesites for battles from the shattering that were fought long before the fights we actually see the remains of, the world does look quite old in general, cities in lurania are sinking, the majority of villages are reduced to ruins.

I'd put my money on at least a few hundred years.
            Topes says the Acadamy shut up shop in response to the Shattering War. There’s some question as to when during or after the war this happened, but whenever it was Topes has been just hanging around ever since.

We also have Enya suggesting that timescales for Tarnished are at most a single-digit multiple of timescales for humans—she suggests that “thousands or tens of thousands of days” is too long for us to wait for the Two Fingers to get off hold with the Greater Will, so somewhere not too far north of 2.75 years is a long time for us and for Topes.

I’m given to understand that the English goes with “moons”, though, which in a natural interpretation of “months” would smack a big multiplier on top. There may be a different interpretation of “moons”, otherwise I’m not sure what to make of that.
    I figured it was over a millenia given the context clues but 5k years is crazy high fantasy numbers
Talk shows are not long winded interviews. They are maybe five questions with short zingers. Shouldn’t expect more than that.
I dunno about that. Colbert is a notoriously huge nerd who’s super into Tolkien and stuff. It honestly wouldn’t surprise me if he’d played Elden Ring.
    Eh, he’s definitely a book nerd, but probably not a gaming nerd.
    Very numb of him then, to not want to let the creator gush about the things the fans don’t know.
        This interview was fantastic, and Colbert let him talk practically the entire time. It’s not an elden ring podcast, he’s got other things going on lol.
You're right. He played games in 90s, when it took few months to pump a game out. I think original Doom was done in several months (less that a year). Modern games are much bigger and harder to make, but George is just out of the loop
    Also, many people don’t understand the art that goes into a video game. Character design, set design, music, story, voice acting. People who don’t play definitely take that stuff for granted.
All fromsoft DLCs have involved at least some time-fuckery have they not? Artorias obviously, the crowns of the old kings in DS2, the ringed city being the end of time...maybe the fishing hamlet in Bloodborne doesnt fit in though
    >maybe the fishing hamlet in Bloodborne doesnt fit in though

That whole area is highlighting where Laurence and maybe Wilhelm with their Byrgenwerth fellows got their first major exposure to Great One goodness. The Hunter’s Nightmare in general seems to be a “snapshot” of what it was like at the time, similar to the Hunter’s Workshop in the Hunter’s Dream.

I like to use the lack of the Healing Church hunter workshop in the Hunter’s Nightmare as a reference for that. I’m not even sure of the Orphanage was built yet.
    All Crowns, Ashes of Ariandel, a majority of Ringed City and *I believe* the Old Hunters take place in the present. 

Artorias was by far the most overt "going back in time", so much that it's intrinsically part of the story of Ds1. Artorias was credited with defeating the Abyss, but the truth is that we defeated Manus. 

And with the power of time fuckery, we get one of the best alternate cutscenes with Sif. The DLC played *really* into the time aspect. 

The Old Hunters is the one I'm scratching my head a tiny bit about. I think it's just a different nightmare realm, moreso than being time travel. I get the impression it's kinda present day because of how fucked Ludwig, Laurence and Maria are when we fight them.  

Ringed City time fuckery feels kinda footnote to be honest. It's only a thing for the final boss pretty much.
        The Ringed City takes place in every moment in time as first you're in the dreg heap which is every point of existence converging, then you're in the ringed city which kinda exists outside of time as far as I know and then you get transported into the future after Gael has killed everything.
        The Old Hunters is basically a pocket dimension (a dead God’s nightmare) where Blood Addled Hunters are banished and imprisoned. My headcanon is is that the strongest hunters influence the nightmare when they are banished there. The beginning is the Church at the height of their power (Ludwig’s nightmare). Middle is the Lab where the Church was just beginning to understand the Blood (Maria’s nightmare). The end is where it all begin, the Fishing Hamlet where Kos was murdered and her child stolen (Gerhman’s/Orphan’s nightmare). A Nightmare seems to be able to exist even if it’s creator is dead (Mergo is technically dead but their Nightmare realm still exist).

At the end of the DLC, you get “Nightmare Slain” instead of “Prey Slaughtered”. It’s the same with Mergo’s Wet Nurse. Gerhman even has restful dreams after you complete the DLC too. It’s honestly just my interpretation so don’t take it as fact but to me you’re not going back in time, more like you’re experiencing very complex memories given form.
    And the sekiro dlc t… oh wait
    The sekiro dlc… wait
yeah it happened in ds1 ds2 and bloodborne. U go back in Sekiro too but its not a DLC i think the only game you dont is ds3
    Well technically you do time travel in the Ringed City DLC, only instead of backwards you go forwards, twice. First you journey to the Dreg Heap where the whole world seems to be collapsing in on itself in the future, then you travel even further forward after reaching Filianore to where the world is now just one vast ashen desert with only the crumbling ruins of Lothric and Anor Londo remaining in the distance.
        Yup and my personal theory is that The Ringed City itself was frozen in time. And when Filianore woke up all the time that had passed caught up to it. Which would be just after the beginning of the Age of Fire. So the year it would’ve been basically would’ve doubled.
            It’s interesting you say that because I always assumed you were flung forward in time after the egg breaks. The one Pygmy Lord that’s barely alive says that the “Red Hood has come to eat us” which implies that Gael has a reputation and that the Pygmies knew he was coming for at least a while.
                It’s tough to explain but let’s say The Ringed City was sealed in year 1 and it’s currently year 1000. When the egg broke, it sent you forward 999 years but since the rest of the world was already at year 1000 it would instead send you forward 1999 years in order for the world and The Ringed City to align time wise. This gives Gael tons of time to get his reputation
                    That makes sense and yet in true Miyazaki storytelling only raises more questions.
Yeah Gael and Maria were both created by GRRM as well
Did they do it in DS2? If not then they did it exactly once.
    >Did they do it in DS2?

For Shulva? Maybe. Brume Tower? I’d imagine so, it’s no longer anywhere near the Iron Keep and the remaining tower doesn’t match it. Frozen Loyce? Well, it’s certainly not snowy anywhere anymore. Bloodborne’s DLC is similarly about exploring the past.
He's definitely writing, had a new book come out yesterday lmao.  He's probably just terrified to write asoiaf at this point
    Sorry and I don't mean to sound like one of those people that's mad at him because I appreciate everything hes done 

of course I want him to finish the books but I also understand hes kind of in a hole

 I really hope he finishes but I've also kind of resigned myself to the fact that he probably won't - I just can't see him pushing out 2 more books
        Lol nah you really didn't sound like them at all, people get crazy about it.  I just always think it's funny when people call him lazy and stuff like that.  The dude is still writing a good amount, it's just not in the series everyone wants.  I get both sides, asoiaf is by far my favorite fantasy series, of course I wanna see it end.  But he's in a tough spot, more so now than ever before after the amount of time and the HBO series.  He probably has panic attacks thinking about it.  At this point, I'd be so happy to see em come out, but I'm not gonna hold it against the guy if he doesn't get around to it
            Same

 I know hes claimed he would never let anybody finish the series but I do wonder if things did take a turn for the worst or if he did run out of time - if he would allow someone to finish

But hopefully he pulls it off and is with us 20 more years
Yep
If you want to get really technical, A Dance With Dragons came out a few months before the first Dark Souls. So really 7 games plus 7 or 8 DLCs?
 well, there we have it. didn't realise DS2 was only in 2014!
    When did you think it was?
        maybe 2011! god damn!
yeah reference books and whatnot.
    Yes-ish, granted "World of Ice and Fire" is a pretty hefty reference book, but Fire and Blood is a rather conventional story though - just portrayed as a sort of in-world history book. And the Hedge Knight stories, as well as wildcards are just straightforward novels.
35% of that is leftover from the previous book tho
Be thankful you're still alive when he finally releases it
Last 10% always takes 90% of the time.
It was not sarcasm.
>They put his name really front and center for a reason.

Yeah, because his name alone was marketing. 

Nothing against George, but you could tell me the whole thing was Miyazaki and his team and it wouldn't surprise me in the least. The whole Elden Ring plot and lore is very similar to Dark Souls and Bloodborne.
    the whole shattering and night of black knives is very similar to Georges works as well though.
        The night of the black knives is very red wedding-esc
    I don’t think George is lying to us here, because the pre-shattering world and events feel very in-line with GRRMs writing. While it is true his name is selling the game, and From definitely wrote the actual games story, he isn’t some cheap name to just plaster on your box. It’s kinda silly to hire such an expensive author and have him not contribute and do what he was hired for. The dude wrote the backstory, fleshed out the Lands Between, and characterized the godly characters. From built their game and it’s story on that foundation. 

Also, as a fan of George’s work for a while now, It’s safe to say he had no problem jumping ship for some time away on Winds of Winter and pick up a check while fleshing out a new fun fantasy world. WoW is breaking this dudes spirit. He just admitted he did this very same thing to write Fire and Blood from 2016-2018.

    Huh? I didn’t know I was just saying it because I only now noticed after seeing you put them out there like that
The sacrifice of your own son in exchange for the possibility to fix the entire world sunk in stagnation and madness doesn't seem that evil
    "Whoa! Were you about to murder that kid?"

"No, I was not going to *murder* my son, I was going to *sacrifice* him, there's a difference"

"Not to him, there isn't!"
        Well if I was told my death would give the entire world a chance of improvement I'd gladly give my life for it.
The thing is: she causes the downfall of her children. And in Godwyns case: Marika could release the rune of death to put an end to his suffering, but she doesn‘t. Go figure
That's fair
Yeeeeah. 

Games are like books.

They get done when effort is involved.
Also dude has written almost 2 million words for the main ASoIaF series alone. That's insane considering he has more material in that world plus tons of other stories. The guy is by no means lazy.
    Damn right? I don't get these entitled folk who think everyone owes them everything... Calm down clown you're a nobody asking things from established creators
Don't care. He's had time aplenty but is content with doing other projects instead. Keeps giving deadlines and misses them time and again.
    Lmao "He's had time aplenty but is content with doing other projects". You're saying dude is happy doing other things than his job, sound like burnout... And what are you? His boss? Grow up and go read other books.
        The other things he does are also his job. People like this guy are ridiculously entitled.
    Better than Rothfuss, at least GRRM *is* writing, even if he's not writing Winds.
    Cry more
    If you use the word “aplenty” anything you say after that will not be taken seriously.
Yeah cos reddit downvotes are any indication of anything lmao. Ask yourself why you think they do.
    You called him a lazy prick, like is he obliged to provide new books for you whenever you need it. Of course you are getting downvoted
        Yeah the lazy prick needs to finish his job before the heart attack gets him.
    My brother in christ…get a therapist
        I must be bonkers not to care about reddit downvotes. Lmao
            No. You’re bonkers for a lot of reasons, buddy.
                Lol k
                    I hope you get the help you need, friend
                        I'm all good thanks mate, reddit downvotes don't hurt my feelings.
                            Again, not what I’m talking about. But if that’s what you need to tell yourself to cope, I understand and sympathize.
    You need help buddy. I feel kind of sorry for you
[deleted]
    Youre talking about jerren and radhan not radagon and Gael at the end there
This might be an instance where both parties contributed. GRRM loves dragons and I'm sure he factored them into the lore he wrote, but I think fromsoft were probably responsible for aspects such as the stone scales, the weakness to lightning (in the case of the lesser dragons), and the idea of different factions trying to create their own dragons or become dragons themselves, since those are all ideas they've explored in the past.
    GRRM and Miyazaki certainly bonded over their mutual love of dragons and misery.
        But mostly misery.
            *OUR misery.
    The weakness to light- THE WEAKNESS TO LIGHTNING?  You're telling me I've been slapping these things down for 20 minutes sloggy style with my halo scythe with 4 lightning inc's just chilling in my offhand
    GRRM probably set up a lot of the dragon stuff and pulled themes from past representations of from dragons (them being the most ancient of races made of stone) then of course From comes on and creates the content so youre going to see their touches everywhere.
    Dragons having stone scales and being weak to lightning were in the souls games so would make sense that fromsoft were the ones to add it.
GRRM definitely loves dragons. Their strong resemblance to DS1 dragons makes them seem very FromSoft, but that design might as well be an afterthought
From probably said they wanted dragons to be the ones ruling before,and George created Farum Azula,and the story of how the dragons started becoming weaker and regressing to a animalistic state and at some point attacked Leyndell.

What its interesting to me is the 5 thousand years he talks,its 5 thousand years from Marika's rule,from the dragons or from when the Elden Beast landed in the lands between.
Exactly
Ah yea, that would make a lot of sense
Hard to believe the entire Mass Effect Trilogy came out in a five year time frame.
    And even that was considered rushed iirc. Mass Effect 3 is an example of rushed development, despite the game being pretty well-received overall ~~ignoring the endings~~.
        I prefered the explanation for the Reapers that the original writer for Mass Effect 1 & 2 had before he left Bioware:

The mission in Mass Effect 2 where the Quarians are very concerned about a star going supernova millions of years earlier than it should have would have been foreshadowing for the reveal in Mass Effect 3.

You would have found out that mass effect technology is generating (or taking away I don't quite recall) dark matter that which is causing the stars to die out at an incredibly accelerated rate.

Hence the reason for the Reapers claiming that they are life's salvation. It is their job to allow life to flourish for a limited amount of time, 50,000 years, at which point continued use of Mass Effect technology would destroy the galaxy and the stars in it. Thus the Reapers must cull life to allow more life to flourish, everyone gets to enjoy life but not for ever.

The big choice would have been: Are we ultimately selfish for wanting to doom trillions of *potential* lives because we want more than what we are given and what is fairly allocated to everyone, or do we agree to sacrifice all current life to allow the galaxy to continue living and for more civilizations to have their chance?
            This explanation would be fairly better, but it's explained half the way in ME3. Reapers basically take races compacts them into ships that serve as a collective consciousness of that race... which is cool because they all want to solve the problem of races killing themselves. To this point is everything okay, but the game is somewhat lackluster compared to the storytelling of ME1 and 2 but honestly, it shows that was made by a very good team that was arranged after 2 succesful launches really the game is the best combat in the series, andromeda feels meh but it's actually better combat wise.
                Agreed. Even though the writing isn't as strong, it's by far the most fun to play.
            I mean I enjoy both versions of the story honestly. I didn’t mind what it became but I wouldn’t mind what it could have been. It’s still one of the greatest Syfi stories ever
                The thing about the ending we received that really got me (which I still have yet to accomplish in a playthrough) is the subversion of the color coding we were indoctrinated into throughout the whole series, that results in the secret ending (after killing the reapers, red option) implying that Shepard survives.

I already thought the storytelling was top notch, even after choosing the “green ending”. Finding out about that Easter egg was an “oh wow ok lmao” moment for me.
                    That kicked off the whole indoctrination thing.  Which narratively makes a whole lot of sense.  Shepard is constantly being indoctrinated through his contact with Reapers/Reaper tech (he was brought back to life with Reaper tech if I recall), and by the time 3 rolls around he's seeing a dead kid all the time who somehow turns out to be the exact manifestation the Reapers' central AI core takes later.

When presented with the 3 colored endings, they make Green and Blue seem to be the way to go because Red is just going to kill everything and that's super bad.  Yet, previous antagonists in the series have already attempted the Green and Blue endings and they don't work.  Saren attempted to work with the Reapers but was indoctrinated and synthesized with the Reapers (Green ending) losing himself totally by doing so.  The Illusive Man tried Blue, attempting to outsmart and take control of the Reapers, but he just ended up indoctrinated and losing too.

But Red, the only choice that hasn't been attempted so far, the only one that seems to immediately eliminate the threat, and the only one that the Reaper ghost kid is trying to dissuade you from taking by telling you the immediate and severe consequences, hasn't been tried yet.  When players take that choice, you get the hidden cutscene showing Shepard was alive.  And why?  Because he beat the indoctrination, made the right choice, and is getting back up from the laser blast that knocked him out ready to kick ass.
                        That’s why I never took too much stock in the original ending as being “terribly bad and just different flavors of the same thing” like so many were saying at the time. I thought it was clever for what they had to work with, given the time they had to realize it.
                    I don't think it was a subversion at all.  Blue choices were the 'Shepard is looking out for all sentient races equally' and red choices were the 'Shepard only cares about him/herself and Earth'.

The Blue ending saves everybody while sacrificing Shep, the Red ending saves Shep but kills EDI and all the other inorganic life good or bad.
                        Blue was pander to the reapers’ goals and red was kill the reapers. Whether or not blue saved everyone, red did as well because it stopped the reaper threat, which was always the primary goal. The inorganic vs organic life debate could then be allowed to potentially develop in a different way than history had shown, because of the knowledge gained and the existential threat stopped.

From a storytelling and gameplay perspective, it was subverting the taught expectations the series established and implied that Shepard (and us) was/were affected by indoctrination.
            That's so much better.

I've beaten the Mass Effect trilogy twice now, once a year or two after it originally came out and once again when the Legendary Edition came out recently. And I couldn't exactly tell you what their purpose was. Which is a shame, because I still remember my playthrough of the first game when they were revealed as a powerful moment.

As I remember, Reapers were synthetic lifeforms who reasoned out that life would eventually become a never-ending cycle of organic life creating synthetic life and synthetic life destroying organic life. So they'd come through every 50,000 years to kill all organic life to prevent this.

Which, as I type it out, makes absolutely no sense at all.
                Thats because you're misunderstanding two things, Reapers are NOT Synthetics, they are Technorganic Hybrids, an Organic Central Core created using the genetic information and material of an entire species wrapped in a highly advanced Reaper body.  
Secondly, as alluded to in the first point, they don't kill Organics. They harvest them. They take all the advanced races in the galaxy and turn them into a new Reaper.   


This is, as you said, to prevent the never ending cycle of Organic Create Synthetic, Synthetic Kill Organic.   


The Master AI of the Reaper's has a very skewed view of Synthetics and Organics thanks to its Creators God-like attitudes, so its not really a surprise that a Leviathan created AI's solution to this problem is put all Organics in time out before they can kill each other.
                The difference would be, the synthetic life completely wiping out all organic matter like a virus & reapers wiping out all technologically advanced species and letting the next round of species develop.

In our universe the reapers act as a virus to wipe out humans as opposed to an asteroid to wipe out earth
            Wow, I would have MUCH preferred that explanation.
            Thats kind of the plot of The Eternals lol
                Never saw it, was it any good?
                    People hated it but I liked it. Its different from other Marvel stuff. It has amazing visuals, using a good mix of real life filming locations and as well as tasteful cgi. The story is slow and long-winded, but its at least unique, and theres some good characters in there that get a little deeper than the usual superhero.
        90% of ME3 was amazing. The ending was the major flop. 

I never heard a bad thing about any other part of the game
            The ending wasn’t bad if your goal was always to destroy the reapers. I remember when that Star kid kept talking, and all I could think about was “why is he giving me options? I’ve been pretty explicitly working towards 1 goal this entire time”
            I did have more problems with ME3 besides the ending, even if I did like the game a lot (nightmare scenes of only the kid feels off, Geth having rewritten characterization from ME2, dropping the dark matter plot, Kai Leng, etc).
            To me the ending is moot. I still strongly believe no matter your choice the reapers still wiped the galaxy clean and it’s just your indoctrination that is what we experience. I do love that it is open ended enough that you truly don’t know.
                Word of the Creator explicitly rejects that theory.
            The moon vehicle exploration sucks
                It sucks, but man was that one of my favorite things to do in the first game

            Hi there! It looks like you may be discussing modding the game Elden Ring, but unfortunately discussion on game mods is not allowed here! Please take this conversation over to /r/EldenRingMods, thanks! :)

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eldenring) if you have any questions or concerns.*
                😢
                    Yeah, it's insanely restrictive about that. 

If I'm guessing, at least ME3 had a [REDACTED] that attempts to fix the ending and throw away the star child plotline.

There's also another [REDACTED] that fixes the Planet Earth invasion by making the levels actually interesting.
                        Not even that, there are modz that add entirely new quests and missions into the game as well as a bunch of world building stuff
Fuck man, this comment speaks to my soul
[deleted]
    It was my understanding that they haven't even *started* production. It's all just pitch meetings and outlines right now.

Todd made it clear that ES6 will start production *after* Starfield is finished.
        Then Fallout 5 starts AFTER that ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry) They said they have an idea, but that's about it lol.
    IIRC they announced cyberpunk 2077 and then didn’t start work til 3 years later. That extra three years might have stopped it from being such a bad launch, especially since they mighta figured out much earlier on that it was never going to work properly on last gen consoles…
        Cyberpunk runs pretty good on PS4 and Xbox One nowadays.
            Honestly it doesnt matter. Even if Cyberpunk ran perfectly at launch it's still dull and lifeless imo. Its honestly just one of those game you can mess around in for a few hours, but when you  put it down you don't feel the need to play again since it was nothing special
    Bethesda has absolutely lost it. And I say that as a person who counted them as my favorite developer for much of my life. Morrowind enthralled me as a kid, and I loved Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, etc. 

The people who view RPGs at art forms, or manners of storytelling, are no longer with Bethesda. They're a money making machine now. Mobile games. License out MMOs. Re-release Skyrim a dozen times. That's been what they've been doing outside of developing Starfield for the last 10 years.

In the meantime, Fromsoft has released the full suite of Souls games.
        Yeah, Bethesda has lost the script, and is starting to feel a little like Meta: telling customers what they want and trying to control the whole process from end to end.  They're overthinking every aspect of game creation and making the wrong stuff complicated.  Like you say, they are trying to come up with formulas to make money hand over fist, not create actual art or the best customer experience.
    Duke Nukem Forever was the best game ever.

Edit: /s just in case this is necessary.
    They likely know that Skyrim is still profitable somehow and want to continue to milk the udder dry.
    What comes first, ES6 or WoW?
    If ES6 is so far away, at least give us  another good Skyrim DLC.
Call me a hater but I don't think either GTA or ES are gonna live up to 10+ years of hype. Games nowadays are so mediocre and a lot of times unfinished on release. Corporations getting more and more involved with video games has only made them worse and the goal is hardly about making art or something fun anymore, it's about getting a quick buck
I've been on the es6 cope for longer than i've had pubes, im still not sure it'll ever come out
I would not lump Windwaker with the others
    You’re right, Wind Waker is leagues better than the other two
        Said no one ever
            It’s the best Zelda game hands down. Nothing else compares really.
                Not even close
I don’t like an assembly line of games, especially single player modern games. They could make them more often though and do not out of greed.
How dare you put windwaker above minish cap.
A Link to the Past > Wind Waker
Hell yeah, I also love me some...

\*looks at faded writing in sweaty hand\*

Ocorana of Time!
I mean sure I have worked in long projects and Game of Thrones started and ended and the first season of House of the dragon started and ended and scripts were done and dragons and several souls games started and finished in 11 years.  But no winds.

Yes, I’m bitter, yes I won’t be reading nor winds or last king killers chronicle. Those two lost my faith in them. I’ll stick with Brandon Sanderson.
    I've reached the acceptance stage lol. I have no interest in the series at large (meaning the books or the original GoT show) but i am liking hotd since right now its a return to form. It could all go to shit ofc, but like i'll drop it without a second thought if it happens. As for Winds, I'm no longer keeping track of it. Let it come out and it'll be a pleasant surprise if it does (because i don't truly ever expect it to come out)
I have zero qualifications for any sort of body language analysis, but you go watch that interview and after he says 75% his body language screams he’s completely full of shit! Like a little kid tryna lie vibes! Don’t get me wrong I love the dude and have spent my time living in the wonderful fantasy world he has crafted and shared with us, but man watch the interview.
It’s all marketing gimmick
Except we wont get a Sanderson to continue it
I thought that was the timeframe between the beginning of the lands between and the shattering.

For the Scarlet Rot to STILL just be in Caelid after 5000 years would mean it’s not spreading very quickly.
    Rot doesn't seem to spread aggressively through the land.


It's easily stopped by flowing water and flame. Look at the entrance of the lake of rot from nokstella and the divide between limgrave and caelid.
        This makes a lot of sense - flowing water washes away the stagnation and flame purifies
            Flowing water is also directly associated to the legendary swordsman who locked away the god of rot using a flowing sword.
                It plays a little into the idea that flowing water is clean where as still water is tainted.
                    That's like a big thing in Japanese society. Death and decomposition in general was and still is considered taboo.

They used to have trouble handling the deceased before Buddhism arrived in Japan.

On a side note, blood, especially menstrual flow is also considered cursed and forbidden to touch. But that topic is for another day or rather another game.
                        Yeah that’s one of the central themes of Dark Souls (1,2 and 3). Gwyn metaphorically damned up the river by extending the Age of Fire and creating Hollows with the Curse Mark. Dark Souls 3 goes a little more into this (besides the Ringed City’s big exposition) with the Human Dregs. It’s Humanity settling into the water like sediment, building up and poisoning the water because the Age of Fire keeps repeating.
    >I thought that was the timeframe between the beginning of the lands between and the shattering.

That was my thought as well, seems more reasonable. At the very least, I’m not given the impression that the Shattering happened in the last 1000 years, *maybe* last 100 at the latest?

>For the Scarlet Rot to STILL just be in Caelid after 5000 years would mean it’s not spreading very quickly

Well, granted, there is the Lake of Rot…But regarding Caelid, there’s this odd little sentence in the Mushroom Crown description:

>Long ago, great lords served the scarlet rot. Perhaps such fungal bodies served as their crowns.

So, Caelid got rotted “long ago” enough to warrant some “great lords” to worship it, all after Malenia bloomed during the Shattering.

Still incredibly vague on any specific timeframe, sadly.
        I believe the lake of rot predates the shattering and Malenia's bloom in Caelid by quite a bit. It seems like the Uld were already worshipping it long before Marika's reign.
            We can see that the pests there are certainly worshipping it, but it’s tricky to gauge the sort of reverence the Uld held for that Rot God. Did they house the relic for worship, or as a warning and to keep it protected?

I’m not sure where I align. But I have to admit that I’m creeped out by how intact those ruins are, in spite of all the rot.

And now based on the post from u/jcheesus I’m thinking they definitely had some influential followers back then.
        the mushroom crown is found in the lake of rot though. and lake of rot is obviously much older than the swamp of aeonia, the rot in the lake is a vivid, red hue, it looks like a much more advanced infection than the brownish aeonian rot

this is because malenia's mentor, the blind swordsman sealed the outer god of rot somewhere around the lake of rot. i suspect that this is because lots of water from the eternal cities flow down there, and the flowing water is antithetical to the rot, since it clears the stagnation that the rot prefers. its clearly inspired by the concept of "kegare" which was also very important in sekiro  


caelid only got rotted when malenia bloomed there in the battle with radahn. only the kindred of rot are explicitly said to have come out of the aeonian swamp. the aeonian butterflies must have also come into existence back then, since malenia has her wings in second phase made from them, but they are already around to collect before that
            >the mushroom crown is found in the lake of rot though.

WHOOPS. That’s a *huge* detail I overlooked. I thought I picked it up with the rest of the mushroom set in Seethwater cave.
I doubt it is, there's still siege equipment and banners everywhere from the Shattering so it can't be more than a few years before the game takes place, maybe a decade.
    It's worth mentioning that there are gravesites for battles from the shattering that were fought long before the fights we actually see the remains of, the world does look quite old in general, cities in lurania are sinking, the majority of villages are reduced to ruins.

I'd put my money on at least a few hundred years.
        Topes says the Acadamy shut up shop in response to the Shattering War. There’s some question as to when during or after the war this happened, but whenever it was Topes has been just hanging around ever since.

We also have Enya suggesting that timescales for Tarnished are at most a single-digit multiple of timescales for humans—she suggests that “thousands or tens of thousands of days” is too long for us to wait for the Two Fingers to get off hold with the Greater Will, so somewhere not too far north of 2.75 years is a long time for us and for Topes.

I’m given to understand that the English goes with “moons”, though, which in a natural interpretation of “months” would smack a big multiplier on top. There may be a different interpretation of “moons”, otherwise I’m not sure what to make of that.
I figured it was over a millenia given the context clues but 5k years is crazy high fantasy numbers
Eh, he’s definitely a book nerd, but probably not a gaming nerd.
Very numb of him then, to not want to let the creator gush about the things the fans don’t know.
    This interview was fantastic, and Colbert let him talk practically the entire time. It’s not an elden ring podcast, he’s got other things going on lol.
Also, many people don’t understand the art that goes into a video game. Character design, set design, music, story, voice acting. People who don’t play definitely take that stuff for granted.
>maybe the fishing hamlet in Bloodborne doesnt fit in though

That whole area is highlighting where Laurence and maybe Wilhelm with their Byrgenwerth fellows got their first major exposure to Great One goodness. The Hunter’s Nightmare in general seems to be a “snapshot” of what it was like at the time, similar to the Hunter’s Workshop in the Hunter’s Dream.

I like to use the lack of the Healing Church hunter workshop in the Hunter’s Nightmare as a reference for that. I’m not even sure of the Orphanage was built yet.
All Crowns, Ashes of Ariandel, a majority of Ringed City and *I believe* the Old Hunters take place in the present. 

Artorias was by far the most overt "going back in time", so much that it's intrinsically part of the story of Ds1. Artorias was credited with defeating the Abyss, but the truth is that we defeated Manus. 

And with the power of time fuckery, we get one of the best alternate cutscenes with Sif. The DLC played *really* into the time aspect. 

The Old Hunters is the one I'm scratching my head a tiny bit about. I think it's just a different nightmare realm, moreso than being time travel. I get the impression it's kinda present day because of how fucked Ludwig, Laurence and Maria are when we fight them.  

Ringed City time fuckery feels kinda footnote to be honest. It's only a thing for the final boss pretty much.
    The Ringed City takes place in every moment in time as first you're in the dreg heap which is every point of existence converging, then you're in the ringed city which kinda exists outside of time as far as I know and then you get transported into the future after Gael has killed everything.
    The Old Hunters is basically a pocket dimension (a dead God’s nightmare) where Blood Addled Hunters are banished and imprisoned. My headcanon is is that the strongest hunters influence the nightmare when they are banished there. The beginning is the Church at the height of their power (Ludwig’s nightmare). Middle is the Lab where the Church was just beginning to understand the Blood (Maria’s nightmare). The end is where it all begin, the Fishing Hamlet where Kos was murdered and her child stolen (Gerhman’s/Orphan’s nightmare). A Nightmare seems to be able to exist even if it’s creator is dead (Mergo is technically dead but their Nightmare realm still exist).

At the end of the DLC, you get “Nightmare Slain” instead of “Prey Slaughtered”. It’s the same with Mergo’s Wet Nurse. Gerhman even has restful dreams after you complete the DLC too. It’s honestly just my interpretation so don’t take it as fact but to me you’re not going back in time, more like you’re experiencing very complex memories given form.
And the sekiro dlc t… oh wait
The sekiro dlc… wait
Well technically you do time travel in the Ringed City DLC, only instead of backwards you go forwards, twice. First you journey to the Dreg Heap where the whole world seems to be collapsing in on itself in the future, then you travel even further forward after reaching Filianore to where the world is now just one vast ashen desert with only the crumbling ruins of Lothric and Anor Londo remaining in the distance.
    Yup and my personal theory is that The Ringed City itself was frozen in time. And when Filianore woke up all the time that had passed caught up to it. Which would be just after the beginning of the Age of Fire. So the year it would’ve been basically would’ve doubled.
        It’s interesting you say that because I always assumed you were flung forward in time after the egg breaks. The one Pygmy Lord that’s barely alive says that the “Red Hood has come to eat us” which implies that Gael has a reputation and that the Pygmies knew he was coming for at least a while.
            It’s tough to explain but let’s say The Ringed City was sealed in year 1 and it’s currently year 1000. When the egg broke, it sent you forward 999 years but since the rest of the world was already at year 1000 it would instead send you forward 1999 years in order for the world and The Ringed City to align time wise. This gives Gael tons of time to get his reputation
                That makes sense and yet in true Miyazaki storytelling only raises more questions.
>Did they do it in DS2?

For Shulva? Maybe. Brume Tower? I’d imagine so, it’s no longer anywhere near the Iron Keep and the remaining tower doesn’t match it. Frozen Loyce? Well, it’s certainly not snowy anywhere anymore. Bloodborne’s DLC is similarly about exploring the past.
Sorry and I don't mean to sound like one of those people that's mad at him because I appreciate everything hes done 

of course I want him to finish the books but I also understand hes kind of in a hole

 I really hope he finishes but I've also kind of resigned myself to the fact that he probably won't - I just can't see him pushing out 2 more books
    Lol nah you really didn't sound like them at all, people get crazy about it.  I just always think it's funny when people call him lazy and stuff like that.  The dude is still writing a good amount, it's just not in the series everyone wants.  I get both sides, asoiaf is by far my favorite fantasy series, of course I wanna see it end.  But he's in a tough spot, more so now than ever before after the amount of time and the HBO series.  He probably has panic attacks thinking about it.  At this point, I'd be so happy to see em come out, but I'm not gonna hold it against the guy if he doesn't get around to it
        Same

 I know hes claimed he would never let anybody finish the series but I do wonder if things did take a turn for the worst or if he did run out of time - if he would allow someone to finish

But hopefully he pulls it off and is with us 20 more years
When did you think it was?
    maybe 2011! god damn!
Yes-ish, granted "World of Ice and Fire" is a pretty hefty reference book, but Fire and Blood is a rather conventional story though - just portrayed as a sort of in-world history book. And the Hedge Knight stories, as well as wildcards are just straightforward novels.
the whole shattering and night of black knives is very similar to Georges works as well though.
    The night of the black knives is very red wedding-esc
I don’t think George is lying to us here, because the pre-shattering world and events feel very in-line with GRRMs writing. While it is true his name is selling the game, and From definitely wrote the actual games story, he isn’t some cheap name to just plaster on your box. It’s kinda silly to hire such an expensive author and have him not contribute and do what he was hired for. The dude wrote the backstory, fleshed out the Lands Between, and characterized the godly characters. From built their game and it’s story on that foundation. 

Also, as a fan of George’s work for a while now, It’s safe to say he had no problem jumping ship for some time away on Winds of Winter and pick up a check while fleshing out a new fun fantasy world. WoW is breaking this dudes spirit. He just admitted he did this very same thing to write Fire and Blood from 2016-2018.
Huh? I didn’t know I was just saying it because I only now noticed after seeing you put them out there like that
"Whoa! Were you about to murder that kid?"

"No, I was not going to *murder* my son, I was going to *sacrifice* him, there's a difference"

"Not to him, there isn't!"
    Well if I was told my death would give the entire world a chance of improvement I'd gladly give my life for it.
Damn right? I don't get these entitled folk who think everyone owes them everything... Calm down clown you're a nobody asking things from established creators
Lmao "He's had time aplenty but is content with doing other projects". You're saying dude is happy doing other things than his job, sound like burnout... And what are you? His boss? Grow up and go read other books.
    The other things he does are also his job. People like this guy are ridiculously entitled.
Better than Rothfuss, at least GRRM *is* writing, even if he's not writing Winds.
Cry more
If you use the word “aplenty” anything you say after that will not be taken seriously.
You called him a lazy prick, like is he obliged to provide new books for you whenever you need it. Of course you are getting downvoted
    Yeah the lazy prick needs to finish his job before the heart attack gets him.
My brother in christ…get a therapist
    I must be bonkers not to care about reddit downvotes. Lmao
        No. You’re bonkers for a lot of reasons, buddy.
            Lol k
                I hope you get the help you need, friend
                    I'm all good thanks mate, reddit downvotes don't hurt my feelings.
                        Again, not what I’m talking about. But if that’s what you need to tell yourself to cope, I understand and sympathize.
You need help buddy. I feel kind of sorry for you
Youre talking about jerren and radhan not radagon and Gael at the end there
GRRM and Miyazaki certainly bonded over their mutual love of dragons and misery.
    But mostly misery.
        *OUR misery.
The weakness to light- THE WEAKNESS TO LIGHTNING?  You're telling me I've been slapping these things down for 20 minutes sloggy style with my halo scythe with 4 lightning inc's just chilling in my offhand
GRRM probably set up a lot of the dragon stuff and pulled themes from past representations of from dragons (them being the most ancient of races made of stone) then of course From comes on and creates the content so youre going to see their touches everywhere.
Dragons having stone scales and being weak to lightning were in the souls games so would make sense that fromsoft were the ones to add it.
And even that was considered rushed iirc. Mass Effect 3 is an example of rushed development, despite the game being pretty well-received overall ~~ignoring the endings~~.
    I prefered the explanation for the Reapers that the original writer for Mass Effect 1 & 2 had before he left Bioware:

The mission in Mass Effect 2 where the Quarians are very concerned about a star going supernova millions of years earlier than it should have would have been foreshadowing for the reveal in Mass Effect 3.

You would have found out that mass effect technology is generating (or taking away I don't quite recall) dark matter that which is causing the stars to die out at an incredibly accelerated rate.

Hence the reason for the Reapers claiming that they are life's salvation. It is their job to allow life to flourish for a limited amount of time, 50,000 years, at which point continued use of Mass Effect technology would destroy the galaxy and the stars in it. Thus the Reapers must cull life to allow more life to flourish, everyone gets to enjoy life but not for ever.

The big choice would have been: Are we ultimately selfish for wanting to doom trillions of *potential* lives because we want more than what we are given and what is fairly allocated to everyone, or do we agree to sacrifice all current life to allow the galaxy to continue living and for more civilizations to have their chance?
        This explanation would be fairly better, but it's explained half the way in ME3. Reapers basically take races compacts them into ships that serve as a collective consciousness of that race... which is cool because they all want to solve the problem of races killing themselves. To this point is everything okay, but the game is somewhat lackluster compared to the storytelling of ME1 and 2 but honestly, it shows that was made by a very good team that was arranged after 2 succesful launches really the game is the best combat in the series, andromeda feels meh but it's actually better combat wise.
            Agreed. Even though the writing isn't as strong, it's by far the most fun to play.
        I mean I enjoy both versions of the story honestly. I didn’t mind what it became but I wouldn’t mind what it could have been. It’s still one of the greatest Syfi stories ever
            The thing about the ending we received that really got me (which I still have yet to accomplish in a playthrough) is the subversion of the color coding we were indoctrinated into throughout the whole series, that results in the secret ending (after killing the reapers, red option) implying that Shepard survives.

I already thought the storytelling was top notch, even after choosing the “green ending”. Finding out about that Easter egg was an “oh wow ok lmao” moment for me.
                That kicked off the whole indoctrination thing.  Which narratively makes a whole lot of sense.  Shepard is constantly being indoctrinated through his contact with Reapers/Reaper tech (he was brought back to life with Reaper tech if I recall), and by the time 3 rolls around he's seeing a dead kid all the time who somehow turns out to be the exact manifestation the Reapers' central AI core takes later.

When presented with the 3 colored endings, they make Green and Blue seem to be the way to go because Red is just going to kill everything and that's super bad.  Yet, previous antagonists in the series have already attempted the Green and Blue endings and they don't work.  Saren attempted to work with the Reapers but was indoctrinated and synthesized with the Reapers (Green ending) losing himself totally by doing so.  The Illusive Man tried Blue, attempting to outsmart and take control of the Reapers, but he just ended up indoctrinated and losing too.

But Red, the only choice that hasn't been attempted so far, the only one that seems to immediately eliminate the threat, and the only one that the Reaper ghost kid is trying to dissuade you from taking by telling you the immediate and severe consequences, hasn't been tried yet.  When players take that choice, you get the hidden cutscene showing Shepard was alive.  And why?  Because he beat the indoctrination, made the right choice, and is getting back up from the laser blast that knocked him out ready to kick ass.
                    That’s why I never took too much stock in the original ending as being “terribly bad and just different flavors of the same thing” like so many were saying at the time. I thought it was clever for what they had to work with, given the time they had to realize it.
                I don't think it was a subversion at all.  Blue choices were the 'Shepard is looking out for all sentient races equally' and red choices were the 'Shepard only cares about him/herself and Earth'.

The Blue ending saves everybody while sacrificing Shep, the Red ending saves Shep but kills EDI and all the other inorganic life good or bad.
                    Blue was pander to the reapers’ goals and red was kill the reapers. Whether or not blue saved everyone, red did as well because it stopped the reaper threat, which was always the primary goal. The inorganic vs organic life debate could then be allowed to potentially develop in a different way than history had shown, because of the knowledge gained and the existential threat stopped.

From a storytelling and gameplay perspective, it was subverting the taught expectations the series established and implied that Shepard (and us) was/were affected by indoctrination.
        That's so much better.

I've beaten the Mass Effect trilogy twice now, once a year or two after it originally came out and once again when the Legendary Edition came out recently. And I couldn't exactly tell you what their purpose was. Which is a shame, because I still remember my playthrough of the first game when they were revealed as a powerful moment.

            Thats because you're misunderstanding two things, Reapers are NOT Synthetics, they are Technorganic Hybrids, an Organic Central Core created using the genetic information and material of an entire species wrapped in a highly advanced Reaper body.  
Secondly, as alluded to in the first point, they don't kill Organics. They harvest them. They take all the advanced races in the galaxy and turn them into a new Reaper.   


This is, as you said, to prevent the never ending cycle of Organic Create Synthetic, Synthetic Kill Organic.   


The Master AI of the Reaper's has a very skewed view of Synthetics and Organics thanks to its Creators God-like attitudes, so its not really a surprise that a Leviathan created AI's solution to this problem is put all Organics in time out before they can kill each other.
            The difference would be, the synthetic life completely wiping out all organic matter like a virus & reapers wiping out all technologically advanced species and letting the next round of species develop.

In our universe the reapers act as a virus to wipe out humans as opposed to an asteroid to wipe out earth
        Wow, I would have MUCH preferred that explanation.
        Thats kind of the plot of The Eternals lol
            Never saw it, was it any good?
                People hated it but I liked it. Its different from other Marvel stuff. It has amazing visuals, using a good mix of real life filming locations and as well as tasteful cgi. The story is slow and long-winded, but its at least unique, and theres some good characters in there that get a little deeper than the usual superhero.
    90% of ME3 was amazing. The ending was the major flop. 

I never heard a bad thing about any other part of the game
        The ending wasn’t bad if your goal was always to destroy the reapers. I remember when that Star kid kept talking, and all I could think about was “why is he giving me options? I’ve been pretty explicitly working towards 1 goal this entire time”
        I did have more problems with ME3 besides the ending, even if I did like the game a lot (nightmare scenes of only the kid feels off, Geth having rewritten characterization from ME2, dropping the dark matter plot, Kai Leng, etc).
        To me the ending is moot. I still strongly believe no matter your choice the reapers still wiped the galaxy clean and it’s just your indoctrination that is what we experience. I do love that it is open ended enough that you truly don’t know.
            Word of the Creator explicitly rejects that theory.
        The moon vehicle exploration sucks
            It sucks, but man was that one of my favorite things to do in the first game

        Hi there! It looks like you may be discussing modding the game Elden Ring, but unfortunately discussion on game mods is not allowed here! Please take this conversation over to /r/EldenRingMods, thanks! :)

            😢
                Yeah, it's insanely restrictive about that. 

If I'm guessing, at least ME3 had a [REDACTED] that attempts to fix the ending and throw away the star child plotline.

There's also another [REDACTED] that fixes the Planet Earth invasion by making the levels actually interesting.
                    Not even that, there are modz that add entirely new quests and missions into the game as well as a bunch of world building stuff
It was my understanding that they haven't even *started* production. It's all just pitch meetings and outlines right now.

Todd made it clear that ES6 will start production *after* Starfield is finished.
    Then Fallout 5 starts AFTER that ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry) They said they have an idea, but that's about it lol.
IIRC they announced cyberpunk 2077 and then didn’t start work til 3 years later. That extra three years might have stopped it from being such a bad launch, especially since they mighta figured out much earlier on that it was never going to work properly on last gen consoles…
    Cyberpunk runs pretty good on PS4 and Xbox One nowadays.
        Honestly it doesnt matter. Even if Cyberpunk ran perfectly at launch it's still dull and lifeless imo. Its honestly just one of those game you can mess around in for a few hours, but when you  put it down you don't feel the need to play again since it was nothing special
Bethesda has absolutely lost it. And I say that as a person who counted them as my favorite developer for much of my life. Morrowind enthralled me as a kid, and I loved Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, etc. 

The people who view RPGs at art forms, or manners of storytelling, are no longer with Bethesda. They're a money making machine now. Mobile games. License out MMOs. Re-release Skyrim a dozen times. That's been what they've been doing outside of developing Starfield for the last 10 years.

In the meantime, Fromsoft has released the full suite of Souls games.
    Yeah, Bethesda has lost the script, and is starting to feel a little like Meta: telling customers what they want and trying to control the whole process from end to end.  They're overthinking every aspect of game creation and making the wrong stuff complicated.  Like you say, they are trying to come up with formulas to make money hand over fist, not create actual art or the best customer experience.
Duke Nukem Forever was the best game ever.

Edit: /s just in case this is necessary.
They likely know that Skyrim is still profitable somehow and want to continue to milk the udder dry.
What comes first, ES6 or WoW?
If ES6 is so far away, at least give us  another good Skyrim DLC.
You’re right, Wind Waker is leagues better than the other two
    Said no one ever
        It’s the best Zelda game hands down. Nothing else compares really.
            Not even close
I've reached the acceptance stage lol. I have no interest in the series at large (meaning the books or the original GoT show) but i am liking hotd since right now its a return to form. It could all go to shit ofc, but like i'll drop it without a second thought if it happens. As for Winds, I'm no longer keeping track of it. Let it come out and it'll be a pleasant surprise if it does (because i don't truly ever expect it to come out)
Rot doesn't seem to spread aggressively through the land.


It's easily stopped by flowing water and flame. Look at the entrance of the lake of rot from nokstella and the divide between limgrave and caelid.
    This makes a lot of sense - flowing water washes away the stagnation and flame purifies
        Flowing water is also directly associated to the legendary swordsman who locked away the god of rot using a flowing sword.
            It plays a little into the idea that flowing water is clean where as still water is tainted.
                That's like a big thing in Japanese society. Death and decomposition in general was and still is considered taboo.

They used to have trouble handling the deceased before Buddhism arrived in Japan.

On a side note, blood, especially menstrual flow is also considered cursed and forbidden to touch. But that topic is for another day or rather another game.
                    Yeah that’s one of the central themes of Dark Souls (1,2 and 3). Gwyn metaphorically damned up the river by extending the Age of Fire and creating Hollows with the Curse Mark. Dark Souls 3 goes a little more into this (besides the Ringed City’s big exposition) with the Human Dregs. It’s Humanity settling into the water like sediment, building up and poisoning the water because the Age of Fire keeps repeating.
>I thought that was the timeframe between the beginning of the lands between and the shattering.

That was my thought as well, seems more reasonable. At the very least, I’m not given the impression that the Shattering happened in the last 1000 years, *maybe* last 100 at the latest?

>For the Scarlet Rot to STILL just be in Caelid after 5000 years would mean it’s not spreading very quickly

Well, granted, there is the Lake of Rot…But regarding Caelid, there’s this odd little sentence in the Mushroom Crown description:

>Long ago, great lords served the scarlet rot. Perhaps such fungal bodies served as their crowns.

So, Caelid got rotted “long ago” enough to warrant some “great lords” to worship it, all after Malenia bloomed during the Shattering.

Still incredibly vague on any specific timeframe, sadly.
    I believe the lake of rot predates the shattering and Malenia's bloom in Caelid by quite a bit. It seems like the Uld were already worshipping it long before Marika's reign.
        We can see that the pests there are certainly worshipping it, but it’s tricky to gauge the sort of reverence the Uld held for that Rot God. Did they house the relic for worship, or as a warning and to keep it protected?

I’m not sure where I align. But I have to admit that I’m creeped out by how intact those ruins are, in spite of all the rot.

And now based on the post from u/jcheesus I’m thinking they definitely had some influential followers back then.
    the mushroom crown is found in the lake of rot though. and lake of rot is obviously much older than the swamp of aeonia, the rot in the lake is a vivid, red hue, it looks like a much more advanced infection than the brownish aeonian rot

this is because malenia's mentor, the blind swordsman sealed the outer god of rot somewhere around the lake of rot. i suspect that this is because lots of water from the eternal cities flow down there, and the flowing water is antithetical to the rot, since it clears the stagnation that the rot prefers. its clearly inspired by the concept of "kegare" which was also very important in sekiro  


caelid only got rotted when malenia bloomed there in the battle with radahn. only the kindred of rot are explicitly said to have come out of the aeonian swamp. the aeonian butterflies must have also come into existence back then, since malenia has her wings in second phase made from them, but they are already around to collect before that
        >the mushroom crown is found in the lake of rot though.

WHOOPS. That’s a *huge* detail I overlooked. I thought I picked it up with the rest of the mushroom set in Seethwater cave.
It's worth mentioning that there are gravesites for battles from the shattering that were fought long before the fights we actually see the remains of, the world does look quite old in general, cities in lurania are sinking, the majority of villages are reduced to ruins.

I'd put my money on at least a few hundred years.
    Topes says the Acadamy shut up shop in response to the Shattering War. There’s some question as to when during or after the war this happened, but whenever it was Topes has been just hanging around ever since.

We also have Enya suggesting that timescales for Tarnished are at most a single-digit multiple of timescales for humans—she suggests that “thousands or tens of thousands of days” is too long for us to wait for the Two Fingers to get off hold with the Greater Will, so somewhere not too far north of 2.75 years is a long time for us and for Topes.

I’m given to understand that the English goes with “moons”, though, which in a natural interpretation of “months” would smack a big multiplier on top. There may be a different interpretation of “moons”, otherwise I’m not sure what to make of that.
This interview was fantastic, and Colbert let him talk practically the entire time. It’s not an elden ring podcast, he’s got other things going on lol.
The Ringed City takes place in every moment in time as first you're in the dreg heap which is every point of existence converging, then you're in the ringed city which kinda exists outside of time as far as I know and then you get transported into the future after Gael has killed everything.
The Old Hunters is basically a pocket dimension (a dead God’s nightmare) where Blood Addled Hunters are banished and imprisoned. My headcanon is is that the strongest hunters influence the nightmare when they are banished there. The beginning is the Church at the height of their power (Ludwig’s nightmare). Middle is the Lab where the Church was just beginning to understand the Blood (Maria’s nightmare). The end is where it all begin, the Fishing Hamlet where Kos was murdered and her child stolen (Gerhman’s/Orphan’s nightmare). A Nightmare seems to be able to exist even if it’s creator is dead (Mergo is technically dead but their Nightmare realm still exist).

At the end of the DLC, you get “Nightmare Slain” instead of “Prey Slaughtered”. It’s the same with Mergo’s Wet Nurse. Gerhman even has restful dreams after you complete the DLC too. It’s honestly just my interpretation so don’t take it as fact but to me you’re not going back in time, more like you’re experiencing very complex memories given form.
Yup and my personal theory is that The Ringed City itself was frozen in time. And when Filianore woke up all the time that had passed caught up to it. Which would be just after the beginning of the Age of Fire. So the year it would’ve been basically would’ve doubled.
    It’s interesting you say that because I always assumed you were flung forward in time after the egg breaks. The one Pygmy Lord that’s barely alive says that the “Red Hood has come to eat us” which implies that Gael has a reputation and that the Pygmies knew he was coming for at least a while.
        It’s tough to explain but let’s say The Ringed City was sealed in year 1 and it’s currently year 1000. When the egg broke, it sent you forward 999 years but since the rest of the world was already at year 1000 it would instead send you forward 1999 years in order for the world and The Ringed City to align time wise. This gives Gael tons of time to get his reputation
            That makes sense and yet in true Miyazaki storytelling only raises more questions.
Lol nah you really didn't sound like them at all, people get crazy about it.  I just always think it's funny when people call him lazy and stuff like that.  The dude is still writing a good amount, it's just not in the series everyone wants.  I get both sides, asoiaf is by far my favorite fantasy series, of course I wanna see it end.  But he's in a tough spot, more so now than ever before after the amount of time and the HBO series.  He probably has panic attacks thinking about it.  At this point, I'd be so happy to see em come out, but I'm not gonna hold it against the guy if he doesn't get around to it
    Same

 I know hes claimed he would never let anybody finish the series but I do wonder if things did take a turn for the worst or if he did run out of time - if he would allow someone to finish

But hopefully he pulls it off and is with us 20 more years
maybe 2011! god damn!
The night of the black knives is very red wedding-esc
Well if I was told my death would give the entire world a chance of improvement I'd gladly give my life for it.
The other things he does are also his job. People like this guy are ridiculously entitled.
Yeah the lazy prick needs to finish his job before the heart attack gets him.
I must be bonkers not to care about reddit downvotes. Lmao
    No. You’re bonkers for a lot of reasons, buddy.
        Lol k
            I hope you get the help you need, friend
                I'm all good thanks mate, reddit downvotes don't hurt my feelings.
                    Again, not what I’m talking about. But if that’s what you need to tell yourself to cope, I understand and sympathize.
But mostly misery.
    *OUR misery.
I prefered the explanation for the Reapers that the original writer for Mass Effect 1 & 2 had before he left Bioware:

The mission in Mass Effect 2 where the Quarians are very concerned about a star going supernova millions of years earlier than it should have would have been foreshadowing for the reveal in Mass Effect 3.

You would have found out that mass effect technology is generating (or taking away I don't quite recall) dark matter that which is causing the stars to die out at an incredibly accelerated rate.

Hence the reason for the Reapers claiming that they are life's salvation. It is their job to allow life to flourish for a limited amount of time, 50,000 years, at which point continued use of Mass Effect technology would destroy the galaxy and the stars in it. Thus the Reapers must cull life to allow more life to flourish, everyone gets to enjoy life but not for ever.

The big choice would have been: Are we ultimately selfish for wanting to doom trillions of *potential* lives because we want more than what we are given and what is fairly allocated to everyone, or do we agree to sacrifice all current life to allow the galaxy to continue living and for more civilizations to have their chance?
    This explanation would be fairly better, but it's explained half the way in ME3. Reapers basically take races compacts them into ships that serve as a collective consciousness of that race... which is cool because they all want to solve the problem of races killing themselves. To this point is everything okay, but the game is somewhat lackluster compared to the storytelling of ME1 and 2 but honestly, it shows that was made by a very good team that was arranged after 2 succesful launches really the game is the best combat in the series, andromeda feels meh but it's actually better combat wise.
        Agreed. Even though the writing isn't as strong, it's by far the most fun to play.
    I mean I enjoy both versions of the story honestly. I didn’t mind what it became but I wouldn’t mind what it could have been. It’s still one of the greatest Syfi stories ever
        The thing about the ending we received that really got me (which I still have yet to accomplish in a playthrough) is the subversion of the color coding we were indoctrinated into throughout the whole series, that results in the secret ending (after killing the reapers, red option) implying that Shepard survives.

I already thought the storytelling was top notch, even after choosing the “green ending”. Finding out about that Easter egg was an “oh wow ok lmao” moment for me.
            That kicked off the whole indoctrination thing.  Which narratively makes a whole lot of sense.  Shepard is constantly being indoctrinated through his contact with Reapers/Reaper tech (he was brought back to life with Reaper tech if I recall), and by the time 3 rolls around he's seeing a dead kid all the time who somehow turns out to be the exact manifestation the Reapers' central AI core takes later.

When presented with the 3 colored endings, they make Green and Blue seem to be the way to go because Red is just going to kill everything and that's super bad.  Yet, previous antagonists in the series have already attempted the Green and Blue endings and they don't work.  Saren attempted to work with the Reapers but was indoctrinated and synthesized with the Reapers (Green ending) losing himself totally by doing so.  The Illusive Man tried Blue, attempting to outsmart and take control of the Reapers, but he just ended up indoctrinated and losing too.

But Red, the only choice that hasn't been attempted so far, the only one that seems to immediately eliminate the threat, and the only one that the Reaper ghost kid is trying to dissuade you from taking by telling you the immediate and severe consequences, hasn't been tried yet.  When players take that choice, you get the hidden cutscene showing Shepard was alive.  And why?  Because he beat the indoctrination, made the right choice, and is getting back up from the laser blast that knocked him out ready to kick ass.
                That’s why I never took too much stock in the original ending as being “terribly bad and just different flavors of the same thing” like so many were saying at the time. I thought it was clever for what they had to work with, given the time they had to realize it.
            I don't think it was a subversion at all.  Blue choices were the 'Shepard is looking out for all sentient races equally' and red choices were the 'Shepard only cares about him/herself and Earth'.

The Blue ending saves everybody while sacrificing Shep, the Red ending saves Shep but kills EDI and all the other inorganic life good or bad.
                Blue was pander to the reapers’ goals and red was kill the reapers. Whether or not blue saved everyone, red did as well because it stopped the reaper threat, which was always the primary goal. The inorganic vs organic life debate could then be allowed to potentially develop in a different way than history had shown, because of the knowledge gained and the existential threat stopped.

From a storytelling and gameplay perspective, it was subverting the taught expectations the series established and implied that Shepard (and us) was/were affected by indoctrination.
    That's so much better.

I've beaten the Mass Effect trilogy twice now, once a year or two after it originally came out and once again when the Legendary Edition came out recently. And I couldn't exactly tell you what their purpose was. Which is a shame, because I still remember my playthrough of the first game when they were revealed as a powerful moment.

As I remember, Reapers were synthetic lifeforms who reasoned out that life would eventually become a never-ending cycle of organic life creating synthetic life and synthetic life destroying organic life. So they'd come through every 50,000 years to kill all organic life to prevent this.

Which, as I type it out, makes absolutely no sense at all.
        Thats because you're misunderstanding two things, Reapers are NOT Synthetics, they are Technorganic Hybrids, an Organic Central Core created using the genetic information and material of an entire species wrapped in a highly advanced Reaper body.  
Secondly, as alluded to in the first point, they don't kill Organics. They harvest them. They take all the advanced races in the galaxy and turn them into a new Reaper.   


This is, as you said, to prevent the never ending cycle of Organic Create Synthetic, Synthetic Kill Organic.   


The Master AI of the Reaper's has a very skewed view of Synthetics and Organics thanks to its Creators God-like attitudes, so its not really a surprise that a Leviathan created AI's solution to this problem is put all Organics in time out before they can kill each other.
        The difference would be, the synthetic life completely wiping out all organic matter like a virus & reapers wiping out all technologically advanced species and letting the next round of species develop.

Shepard is constantly being indoctrinated through his contact with Reapers/Reaper tech (he was brought back to life with Reaper tech if I recall), and by the time 3 rolls around he's seeing a dead kid all the time who somehow turns out to be the exact manifestation the Reapers' central AI core takes later.

When presented with the 3 colored endings, they make Green and Blue seem to be the way to go because Red is just going to kill everything and that's super bad.  Yet, previous antagonists in the series have already attempted the Green and Blue endings and they don't work.  Saren attempted to work with the Reapers but was indoctrinated and synthesized with the Reapers (Green ending) losing himself totally by doing so.  The Illusive Man tried Blue, attempting to outsmart and take control of the Reapers, but he just ended up indoctrinated and losing too.

But Red, the only choice that hasn't been attempted so far, the only one that seems to immediately eliminate the threat, and the only one that the Reaper ghost kid is trying to dissuade you from taking by telling you the immediate and severe consequences, hasn't been tried yet.  When players take that choice, you get the hidden cutscene showing Shepard was alive.  And why?  Because he beat the indoctrination, made the right choice, and is getting back up from the laser blast that knocked him out ready to kick ass.
            That’s why I never took too much stock in the original ending as being “terribly bad and just different flavors of the same thing” like so many were saying at the time. I thought it was clever for what they had to work with, given the time they had to realize it.
        I don't think it was a subversion at all.  Blue choices were the 'Shepard is looking out for all sentient races equally' and red choices were the 'Shepard only cares about him/herself and Earth'.

The Blue ending saves everybody while sacrificing Shep, the Red ending saves Shep but kills EDI and all the other inorganic life good or bad.
            Blue was pander to the reapers’ goals and red was kill the reapers. Whether or not blue saved everyone, red did as well because it stopped the reaper threat, which was always the primary goal. The inorganic vs organic life debate could then be allowed to potentially develop in a different way than history had shown, because of the knowledge gained and the existential threat stopped.

From a storytelling and gameplay perspective, it was subverting the taught expectations the series established and implied that Shepard (and us) was/were affected by indoctrination.
That's so much better.

I've beaten the Mass Effect trilogy twice now, once a year or two after it originally came out and once again when the Legendary Edition came out recently. And I couldn't exactly tell you what their purpose was. Which is a shame, because I still remember my playthrough of the first game when they were revealed as a powerful moment.

As I remember, Reapers were synthetic lifeforms who reasoned out that life would eventually become a never-ending cycle of organic life creating synthetic life and synthetic life destroying organic life. So they'd come through every 50,000 years to kill all organic life to prevent this.

Which, as I type it out, makes absolutely no sense at all.
    Thats because you're misunderstanding two things, Reapers are NOT Synthetics, they are Technorganic Hybrids, an Organic Central Core created using the genetic information and material of an entire species wrapped in a highly advanced Reaper body.  
Secondly, as alluded to in the first point, they don't kill Organics. They harvest them. They take all the advanced races in the galaxy and turn them into a new Reaper.   


This is, as you said, to prevent the never ending cycle of Organic Create Synthetic, Synthetic Kill Organic.   


The Master AI of the Reaper's has a very skewed view of Synthetics and Organics thanks to its Creators God-like attitudes, so its not really a surprise that a Leviathan created AI's solution to this problem is put all Organics in time out before they can kill each other.
    The difference would be, the synthetic life completely wiping out all organic matter like a virus & reapers wiping out all technologically advanced species and letting the next round of species develop.

In our universe the reapers act as a virus to wipe out humans as opposed to an asteroid to wipe out earth
Wow, I would have MUCH preferred that explanation.
Thats kind of the plot of The Eternals lol
    Never saw it, was it any good?
        People hated it but I liked it. Its different from other Marvel stuff. It has amazing visuals, using a good mix of real life filming locations and as well as tasteful cgi. The story is slow and long-winded, but its at least unique, and theres some good characters in there that get a little deeper than the usual superhero.
The ending wasn’t bad if your goal was always to destroy the reapers. I remember when that Star kid kept talking, and all I could think about was “why is he giving me options? I’ve been pretty explicitly working towards 1 goal this entire time”
I did have more problems with ME3 besides the ending, even if I did like the game a lot (nightmare scenes of only the kid feels off, Geth having rewritten characterization from ME2, dropping the dark matter plot, Kai Leng, etc).
To me the ending is moot. I still strongly believe no matter your choice the reapers still wiped the galaxy clean and it’s just your indoctrination that is what we experience. I do love that it is open ended enough that you truly don’t know.
    Word of the Creator explicitly rejects that theory.
The moon vehicle exploration sucks
    It sucks, but man was that one of my favorite things to do in the first game
Hi there! It looks like you may be discussing modding the game Elden Ring, but unfortunately discussion on game mods is not allowed here! Please take this conversation over to /r/EldenRingMods, thanks! :)

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eldenring) if you have any questions or concerns.*
    😢
        Yeah, it's insanely restrictive about that. 

If I'm guessing, at least ME3 had a [REDACTED] that attempts to fix the ending and throw away the star child plotline.

There's also another [REDACTED] that fixes the Planet Earth invasion by making the levels actually interesting.
            Not even that, there are modz that add entirely new quests and missions into the game as well as a bunch of world building stuff
Honestly it doesnt matter. Even if Cyberpunk ran perfectly at launch it's still dull and lifeless imo. Its honestly just one of those game you can mess around in for a few hours, but when you  put it down you don't feel the need to play again since it was nothing special
It’s the best Zelda game hands down. Nothing else compares really.
    Not even close
Flowing water is also directly associated to the legendary swordsman who locked away the god of rot using a flowing sword.
    It plays a little into the idea that flowing water is clean where as still water is tainted.
        That's like a big thing in Japanese society. Death and decomposition in general was and still is considered taboo.

They used to have trouble handling the deceased before Buddhism arrived in Japan.

On a side note, blood, especially menstrual flow is also considered cursed and forbidden to touch. But that topic is for another day or rather another game.
            Yeah that’s one of the central themes of Dark Souls (1,2 and 3). Gwyn metaphorically damned up the river by extending the Age of Fire and creating Hollows with the Curse Mark. Dark Souls 3 goes a little more into this (besides the Ringed City’s big exposition) with the Human Dregs. It’s Humanity settling into the water like sediment, building up and poisoning the water because the Age of Fire keeps repeating.
We can see that the pests there are certainly worshipping it, but it’s tricky to gauge the sort of reverence the Uld held for that Rot God. Did they house the relic for worship, or as a warning and to keep it protected?

I’m not sure where I align. But I have to admit that I’m creeped out by how intact those ruins are, in spite of all the rot.

And now based on the post from u/jcheesus I’m thinking they definitely had some influential followers back then.
>the mushroom crown is found in the lake of rot though.

WHOOPS. That’s a *huge* detail I overlooked. I thought I picked it up with the rest of the mushroom set in Seethwater cave.
It’s tough to explain but let’s say The Ringed City was sealed in year 1 and it’s currently year 1000. When the egg broke, it sent you forward 999 years but since the rest of the world was already at year 1000 it would instead send you forward 1999 years in order for the world and The Ringed City to align time wise. This gives Gael tons of time to get his reputation
    That makes sense and yet in true Miyazaki storytelling only raises more questions.
Lol k
    I hope you get the help you need, friend
        I'm all good thanks mate, reddit downvotes don't hurt my feelings.
            Again, not what I’m talking about. But if that’s what you need to tell yourself to cope, I understand and sympathize.
Agreed. Even though the writing isn't as strong, it's by far the most fun to play.
The thing about the ending we received that really got me (which I still have yet to accomplish in a playthrough) is the subversion of the color coding we were indoctrinated into throughout the whole series, that results in the secret ending (after killing the reapers, red option) implying that Shepard survives.

I already thought the storytelling was top notch, even after choosing the “green ending”. Finding out about that Easter egg was an “oh wow ok lmao” moment for me.
