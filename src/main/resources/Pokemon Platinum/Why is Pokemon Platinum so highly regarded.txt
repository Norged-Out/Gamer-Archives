[[Why is Pokemon Platinum so highly regarded]]


Hey everyone, the title says it all. Originally I skipped Pokemon Platinum because I hated Pokemon Diamond and it pretty much killed my interest in Pokemon for a while. Recently I got Pokemon Platinum from online. I just got around 6 badges and I'm not particularly finding anything interesting about this title, A LOT of the problems I had with Pokemon Diamond are still present in the game, it's still very slow, the pacing is still a mess, Sinnoh is still very tedious and annoying to travel through, the story is still nonsensical and the Pokedex is still poor (I get it's a step up from Diamond/Pearl, but it's still pretty bad compared to later Pokedexes, 210 is still smaller than even Johto of all things) a lot of the so called "major improvements" that everybody keeps bragging about are nearly absent, but I hear the post game is good, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to get that far, the game is just too boring, dull, and slow. Nothing interesting has happened yet and I'm really pushing myself to get through the rest of the game. I don't want to be negative, but I am curious about what you all have to say. I want to see everyone's thoughts on this, what do you guys think?


I thought it was pretty good. Certainly not the best game in the franchise, but it was still a great game.  
The story makes perfect sense to me if I remember correctly. What parts did you not understand?
    It was mostly the part where Team Galactic held someone hostage over honey, isn't their main goal to create a new universe? Why would that matter? The whole plot with stealing Pokemon was kinda odd too
        I haven't played Platinum in a *long* time, but I've always loved me some Gen 4, so here's what I remember:

Team Galactic is one of those teams where the Grunts are completely oblivious to their leader's goals. Kind of like Team Plasma, but less of an active deception by the main villain, and more of the grunts just being comically stupid. 

It's even kind of evident in the game's music: [the grunt encounter theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb9UKjQTwig) and the [hideout theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r2j54GCiEw) are all jazzy and fun, while [Cyrus's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE5dBmWml34) and the [hideout depths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ-9BvIdDxU) are *way* more ominous, conveying that a few high ranking TG members are the only really evil ones, and the grunts are just in it for... free honey? Jazzy tunes? Admittedly, I'm not entirely sure.

About your original question, I've always felt as if Platinum was my favorite game because of a lot of individual features. Unova and Alola probably both had better stories, but Platinum had a better level curve and grinding. The difficulty was pretty good too, and the VS Seeker was a feature they had no reason to remove.

Platinum also had what I consider to be the best postgame of a non-remake by far, with the Heatran plot, Gym Leader rematches, five Battle Frontier facilities, an abundance of legendaries that all had sufficient lore and sometimes even elaborate events, and a decent number of new areas. 

I also just really like the Gym Leaders and other characters in Sinnoh, as well as the music and region layout, but that's even more subjective than the other reasons here, so I won't really get into that.

tl;dr: galactic grunts are oblivious idiots and sinnoh's postgame and and other cool features outweigh the slow gameplay in the eyes of people like me
            I think you're a real life pokemon professor.
                If Pokemon were real, that would definitely be my first career choice.
        I can answer that!

They were researching energy at that moment (hence why they had the Valley PowerPoint hostage) to make the bombs.

They wanted to use the energy released by pokemon evolution originally when they try to jump Rowan in Jubilife. (If remakes happen, this will be retconed into the same stuff that powered the Ultimate Weapon).

So they wanted to use the Honey to bait and Trap mass amounts of pokemon and then harvest energy off of them
        Most of the evil teams in Pokemon steal other people's Pokemon simply to gather more power for themselves.  
I can't remember them holding someone hostage over honey. Where was that, exactly?
            In Floarama Town, it's in the early part of the game
                Ah. From what I can tell, that part was just some grunts being grunts. They aren't very smart, similar to how the other evil teams have some idiots as well.  
Their actual plan was to take over the Valley Windworks in order to gather the energy needed for their final plans.  
  
Not that anyone ever properly explains how they're stealing energy from a powerplant, though. It's a fairly common plot device, and (as far as I know) none of them really explain how that works.
                    They used the power stolen to fuel the Galactic Bomb, a grunt mentions it when you explore the Crater from the bomb at the lake.
                    Lots and lots of portable batteries.

(Though you'd think they'd just get a bunch of electric types if they really wanted power).
                They were actually holding people hostage over the energy being produced at the Windworks. The people of Floaroma Town were the ones obsessed with honey
Because it made D/P bearable.
>actual Fire types

>better Gym progression

>not as slow as molasses

>a lot of QoL changes

>dat winter clothing for Lucas, Dawn, and Barry

>Looker debuting
    Looker debuting instantly makes Platinum a great game. My favorite recurring character (possibly character in general).
    Isn't there like, 1-2 fire lines added? I wouldn't care that "fixed"... And I'd hardly count winter clothing and looker being added fixing the problems that diamond and pearl had. Also pretty sure platinum was just as slow as dp?...
        Chimchar is best starter anyway, the only fire type you need.

                ^This right here is not a suggestion. This is law. This is how you're supposed to approach Sinnoh.
                Is there a name for this meme? The Magikarp one is kinda lame, but the others are always fun to read.
    There's still barely any fire types...
1. Arguably the best starter trio of any Pokemon game
2. Arguably the best music track of all games
3. Fantastic legendnaries
4. New evolutions of prior Pokemon
5. Great gym leaders, gym designs.
6. Arguably best Pokemon league (champion can't be argued)
7. Best evil villain leader (arguable) 
8. Physical special split
9. GTS
10. fantastic post game.
11. Really nice map and design overall region. 
    i agree with everything exept best villan leader.
Maybe the hardest and longest game of the main series.
>I don't want to be negative.

Well you could've fooled me! I think this game has some of the best pokemon designs. Most of those are all the cool evolutions they gave to forgotten pokemon. Plus, the distortion world is awesome!
It fixed pretty much everything wrong with DP and added enough in game and post game material to warrant great replay value.
In my opinion the Sinnoh games are the perfect games of the formula established by Gen 3. Gens 1 and 2 have a lot of unique things about them, while Gens 3 and 4 feel a lot more standardized (same type of passing, focus on legendaries and evil team, basic gym formula, diverse regions that have everything Kanto had and a little more, builds on previous Pokemon with evolutions/pre-evos). After Gen IV, every gen had to do something different. BW had an interesting plot and few connections to older Pokemon. XY moved to 3D, added a ton of features, and started pandering to Gen 1. SM got rid of gyms and really tried to establish Alola as unique.

Out of all of these, Sinnoh just feels the most Pokemon. Each of the unique things about all the other games game them interesting, but even though I started with Gen 1, and my favorite is Gen 2, Sinnoh is simple perfection of a formulaic Pokemon game. It took everything the previous gens had, implemented them by the book, and fused them together to make the whole franchise feel cohesive, as well as adding a little here and there to make up for past flaws (trading up from previous gens, interesting post-game areas, an extremely wide variety of ways to catch almost every Pokemon just in the Sinnoh region).

The only problems I have with Sinnoh are the technical problems of DP, such as not including the awesome evolutions of past Pokemon in the main story, and the weird speed problems. Platinum fixes them, and so gains the title of the perfect by-the-book Pokemon game. It feels complete, it feels Pokemon.
    Yup. 3 and 4 had the formula down. They started changing things with 5 onwards but 3 and 4 are just perfect.
Gen 4 is superior to all other gens
    Gen 5 is pretty great though.
    My favorite is still Generation 3. It may be nostalgia speaking, but I really like that Gameboy Advance aesthetic.
    Solid argument
Thank you. This subreddit loves sucking up to sinnoh but those games were awful. They made some good improvements to the mechanics but that doesn't change how bad they were as games.
Platinum Handholds the player way too much. Okay you need to go here. Okay your next stop is there. Okay Barry is here THUD!!!! and Barry tells you whats next. Okay the hometown girl is here and she tells you whats next. It feels very linear and i get a feeling that im being choked and like im being told to what the f i should do.
Most of the improvements are in the postgame. The Battle Frontier, being able to rematch the gym leaders and Elite Four with improved teams, the expanded Stark Mountain scenario with Team Galactic, more legendaries to find, and the Distortion World is a fun and massive puzzle.
Honestly I'm not sure WHAT people find enjoyable about d/p/pt yeah the musics nice and all but like you said it's slow,dull,boring the paceing is terrible,shinno is pretty annoying to travel and most of the Pokemon in the dex are ether uninteresting used way too often in these games or too slow to be of any use I can't play past the 8th gym I think a part my distaste for gen 4 is that the color palette of the overworld and the pokemon and the game in general is a bit darker then the rest of the series.

However on the other end there are many things that gen 4 intoduced that where good like the phasacol/special split the touchscreen wifi and more
I started Pokemon with gen 4. Diamond and Pearl by all means were some of the weakest games in the series. And this is coming from a guy who's favorite gen is gen 4. However, Platinum knocked them out of the park by fixing nearly all the flaws Diamond and Pearl had. By a longshot. It's not the best game, but it is imo one of the best, simply by how different and lively it was compared to it's predecessors. It is an important staple in the series because it included so many new features like the vs. seeker, all the Pokemon introduced in gen 4 now in the pokedex, all gym leaders/e4 had Pokemon pertaining to their type, the battle frontier, and last but not least, an alternate dimension. Platinum redefined what it means to be a third version Pokemon game. And I'm hoping they carry out it's greatness in the remakes, if there are any in the future.
Here to say game is straight fire and just as good as soul silver
D/P/Pt were my first games, so I'm a little biased. Platinum improved on a lot of stuff people found irritating from D/P, such as surf speed, saving speed, gym order, pokedex, story, and endgame content (battle frontier and Looker!).

I love the jazzy vibe to the music, as well as the different remixes for night in every outdoor area! S/M had night remixes in the cities, so Sinnoh confirmed???

I like that the region is cold, and Platinum has the cool winter outfits for the protagonists. It was weird in D/P heading up to Snowpoint waist-deep in snow wearing a tank top. I do admit the first half of the game is a little tedious to get through. I like that you have fly back to earlier cities to go to the next badge sometimes.

About the story, it makes so much more sense that Cyrus is going after giratina since it is actually in control of another world. Using dialga/palkia to create another world is kind of vague.

Cynthia is the best champion, hands down. She has a team full of cool pokemon and will absolutely wreck your shit if you don't grind a little. All the new games since then have been pretty disappointing in that regard. (Ghetsis was one hell of a final boss in B/W though!)

Finally, it's been a little over 10 years since Diamond and Pearl released, so it's their turn bask in the nostalgia. It's cyclical like that.

Edit: Reading the other posts I'd like to second the Distortion World itself and rematches. Back in the day the Distortion World was mega cool. It still has a cool trippy vibe and the puzzle is neat. The sheer number of rematches available post E4 in Platinum is the best, and nothing since has been able to match it. The E4 and Champion are buffed, and you can have daily gym leader rematches. Your rival gets stronger and stronger each time you rematch him, until he maxes out at the highest-leveled npc team ever at the time.
    Just noticed that you said that Cyrus was going after Giratina, that's actually not the case.. Cyrus brought both dialga and palkia instead of just one of them, but giratina interrupted him by suddenly appearing from the shadows and dragged him into the distortion world. 
        Thanks. I knew something was off about my memory of the story, but couldn't pinpoint what. Still, it makes more sense using both of them than just one. When I played Diamond my 12-year-old mind was super confused as to how exactly he was going to create a new world​ with control over only time.
            Diamond was my first ever main series game and I played it when I was like 7-8 years old. I didn't question how Dialga couldve created a new world I was just hyped that I was bout to catch this monstrous blue dragon xD 
    > Using dialga/palkia to create another world is kind of vague.

In what way? To me it makes pefect sense to create a new universe utilising power over all of time and space.
I grew up with diamond and pearl, and grew up alongside many of the people that grew up with diamond and pearl. I'll be the first to tell you nostalgia is huge with this generation. Gen 4 is one my least favorite generations due to a number of reasons (slow progression, lore that I don't believe fits the rest of the Pokemon franchise/world), but there's huge bias in my age group towards gen 4, which explains a lot of the comments in this thread.
Since everyone else seems to disagree with op, I thought I'd give my opinion. I bought a copy of platinum not too long ago as well. I never played a gen 4 game in the past and I am not too impressed either. The gen 4 pokemon are my least favorite of them all and the slow progression makes it hard to get through. Really wish I could get myself a copy of hg/ss under $100 though.
This is pretty much what happened to me and my opinions word for word, except I just got Platinum and skipped Pearl/Diamond. Never understood the love for Gen IV, personally.
    The gen 2 remakes were nice
        I personally don't care about the remakes so eh.
I have never played Pokémon before... I know! It's terrible haha but my friend and I have used it for a Randomized Nuzlocke Soul Link challenge and it has been a great experience so far! But in terms of the rating I'll leave more experienced Pokémon fans to answer haha
They just simp for Cynthia and that is the whole reason, anything else you will hear is a facade. The whole DS era gens 4 and 5 are absolute garbage.
