[[How much better was Platinum than DP]]


I skipped Gen IV back in the day. But I played BD on Switch and wasn't impressed. I feel like it echoed just why I skipped Gen IV because it felt like nothing stood out at all. 

But I've also heard talk from others that Platinum was vastly better and should have been used as the base for BDSP. What makes it stand out?


Much better. More Pokemon variety, better story, better boss fights, battle frontier, the works. Can’t promise you’ll love it if you didn’t like BDSP but I can confidently say that it’s much better
    If your fave type is Fire, and you for some reason didn’t pick Chimchar, your only option was Rapidash.

They added Houndoom, Flareon, and Magmortar in Platinum. Flint no longer had to have a team that was only 40% Fire types.
        That was the biggest eyebrow-rising thing about the gen IV games for me. Do you know why they had such a small number of fire types available?
            Probably just oversight.
                It's still a weird oversight, because it means they specifically made a Fire type specialist with only had 2 Fire type lines and at no point someone was considering "wait, perhaps we should add more for this guy".
                    Maybe someone did, but then someone else said 'we only had one ghost type in gen 1 and that was fine'
                        Someone definitely did, but the deadline was likely so tight that it couldn't be fixed in time for release.

                            Technically he was the first weather user for the elite 4, as most of his team can set up Sunny Day and make use of it.
                    It all kinda fit a hot theme though, Steelix is tempered under pressure and heat, Drifbloom is a hot air balloon, and Lopunny is also on theme.
                        Because lopunny is hot?

It would be funny if that crossing over of word meaning existed in Japanese too
                    The wild thing was how magmortar was a thing, but by design of unlocking the national Dex, flint just couldn't have it
                The whole game was an oversight and rushed to get out on the new DS system. People hate BDSP but I think everyone just forgot how bad diamond and pearl were
                    I remember being so excited for them and loving them when they first came out but playing Platinum 2 years later really put their shortcomings into perspective
            The games were a problem for Gamefreak to the point they became the only ones to be delayed.
            Because there was nowhere to reasonably put them in the original layout

Sinnoh is a snowy region with a gigantic mountain in the center.

Additionally, DP was a game with many development difficulties since the DS was such a huge difference from the GBA. So while it had all the core game design essentials, it didn’t get some of the polish or attention in many areas, especially in optimization (awful load times)
                Platinum made Sinnoh even snowier.

Plus Fuego Ironworks was in base DP too and could have had them.
                Platinum didn’t really have trouble placing them. And Eevee is a fairly domesticated Pokémon at this point, it’s been native to almost every region.
                If it is a snowy and cold region, that is all the more reason to think it would have fire types.
            Such a strange thing to do.
        It's a bit s*it that you can only get Magmortar through trade on the games.
        And it wasn't juste Fire, if you wanted an Ice type your only options were Sneasel and Snover, while the only Electric lines available were Pikachu, Pachirisu and Shinx. 

And both types were also used by Gym Leaders who had to use unrelated mons, that always confused me as a kid but I guess that made the battles a bit more complicated.
            Don't forget galvantula. I was able to bread a galvantula with compundeye and though it thunder. For a 93.3% accuracy every time.
                Oops wrong game lol
                    That was black and white.
                        Oh that's pretty cool, I'll have to try that if a Black and White remake/sequel gets announced. I like Galvantula's design but I never actually used one in-game.
            Isn't Swinub available in DP too?
                You can find it in the wild in Platinum, but in Diamond and Pearl you can only find it in swarms once you have the National Dex.
    Also it's much faster (still slow though)
    Diamond and Pearl are saved from being Among the bottom 4 worst Pokémon games of all time by plat.   

All those stupid underground Pokémon are better spread out in the over world.  Different gyms rosters using the expanded Pokédex ectra.
General stuff : extended Pokedex, better teams for gym leaders, gym order changed to be more logical, there is an actual Battle Fronteer at the end

From my personal experience : the story is more engaging, as there is a lot more mystery with Giratina than with Dialga and Palkia in their respective games

Also more (and better) battles against Team Galaxy's leader (I don't know his English name)

I grew up with Diamond, but once I tried Platinum I instantly fell in love with it, it's such an upgrade
    It’s team galactic and his name is Cyrus in English :)
        Thanks

In French his name is Helio
            That’s a really good name for him
                I'm pretty sure his name is sun-themed in every language actually
                    Oh neat, didn’t know that
[deleted]
    The Spear Pillar section of the main story is also vastly improved.
        [deleted]
            Seriously. I was expecting both Dialga and Palkia to get summoned, since both Kyogre and Groudon get awakened in Emerald. I was *not*, however, expecting Giratina to punch through using shadow blotches, and *lunge* at the *camera*, taking Cyrus with it back to the Distortion World. It excited me as a kid, but actually unnerves me as an adult. Giratina is painted as something Lovecraftian in Platinum, a massive upgrade from its appearance as a minor legendary in DP. And the shadow blotches that appear when you give it the Griseous Orb do wonders with that concept, too.
Remember how Emerald was better than RS in every single way? That. 

Plus 60 new pokemon to turn the worst regional dex into a solid and fun lineup.
    Emerald missing out on Medicham and Zangoose is kind of a bummer. Steven was a much more interesting Champion. And the in-game trades are somehow worse than the already meh ones in RS. Still, Emerald did add way more content than RS had, so it is overall an improvement.

(Plus, I miss the Zigzagoon cheese from RS even though it did need to get fixed).
        [deleted]
            So Zigzagoon has the ability Pick Up that gives you a chance to get a range of items once per battle, right? Well, in Ruby/Sapphire, that range of items was really exploitable. Even a Lv 2 Zigzagoon could get Ultra Balls and Rare Candies, so if you had a team of them you could farm for cash or level up your mons pretty easily as soon as the beginning of the game.
            …well, you know how female Zigzagoon with babies produce milk?
        I don't mind losing access to a couple Pokemon but Steven not being the champion is the one thing I think is a straight downgrade from Ruby/Sapphire. He's way more interesting and involved in the story, opposed to Wallace who just shows up near the end. Wallace's team is also way easier to beat imo and having two Water-type specialists in the region is just lame.

The only reason I can think of that they would make Wallace the Champion was so they could have Steven be the post-game superboss like Red was in GSC, but it could've been one of the rivals (Brendan/May or Wally), or Ethan/Gold if they really wanted to continue that trend.
        No wonder I can never remember where Meditite lives.

Even now, I'm drawing a total blank.
            Mt. Pyre.
                Huh, interesting. I wouldn't have guessed.
    The biggest difference is that Emerald was an upgrade of an already good game, whereas Platinum was an upgrade of a mediocre game.
    It's an even steeper difference.

Emerald is like adding sweet toppings to a really good cake.

Whereas, Platinum is finishing a half-baked cake.
        And then Emerald poured some water onto that cake with the pointless Team Magma base filler, having to deal with more water routes what was already the worst part of Ruby/Sapphire, downgrading the champion and making the climactic end to the Team Aqua/Magma story a cutscene rather than a battle with the legendary...
    That's huge honestly. Red/Blue and Gold/Silver were plenty viable games even before Yellow and Crystal. I feel like Emerald and Platinum are the two most hyped Pokémon 3rd releases, neither of which I played. I had R/B/Y, Silver, and Ruby growing up.
    RS had a better champion fight, didn't lock the Pokémon Contests behind Lilycove and also didn't fully showcase Team Magma because you never get to fight Courtney. Emerald is still an overall upgrade but imo Platinum is a much bigger upgrade.
        I would agree with you, after having played emerald I still find RS enjoyable - but after having played Platinum I find DP to be a slog.
        Maybe it’s just me but I prefer having the contests in one area of the game instead of flying to different towns.
        I never played Emerald or Ruby but I do own Sapphire but the whole locking the Pokémon contests behind Lilycove in my honest opinion I never really care that much for Pokemon contests except for the Pokéblock to help evolve Pokemon
Not only is vanilla platinum way better for all reasons previously stated, if you’re into romhacks I cannot recommend Renegade Platinum enough—i’ve beaten it twice, and it’s my favorite way to play platinum now! (lots of QoL updates, fairy type, buffs to weaker pokemon, etc, but if you’re just looking for difficulty adjustments there’s a “mostly vanilla” patch as well!)
Let’s be fair for the first 5 gens the sister games were always an awesome extra improvement.
    Crystal didn't add that much content to the original games while Yellow was a kinda peculiar game since it tried to be faithful to the anime. Imo Emerald, Platinum and USUM were significantly bigger improvements.
        My hot take is that Yellow **isn’t** gen 1’s third version, it’s closer to a LGPE/PLA situation where it’s technically a mainline game but also significantly different from other mainline games. 

Gen 1’s third version is Blue. Red and Green were released in Japan first, with Blue being released later (it was *technically* released later that year, but didn’t reach store shelves until over a year after Red/Green) which like most third versions was extremely similar with QoL changes. 

The international release of Red and Blue were both based off of Japanese Blue, we in the west technically only got gen 1’s third version.
        A lot of people won't admit this, but Crystal is easily the worst third version. Its only major additions were the Eusine storyline and the battle tower. Otherwise, it was just the same flawed game as GS, and teambuilding was made worse by removing Mareep from an already lacking encounter table. Every other third version was either drastically different enough to be a whole new experience (Yellow, kinda USUM), or an overall massive improvement (Emerald, Platinum, kinda USUM)
            Why did it remove mareep? And doesn't it have more pokemon in its catchable dex?
                It removed Mareep to keep the gimmick of version exclusives so you would have to trade with gold/silver.
                Don't remember off the top of my head, but the catchable dex was probably about the same. As for why Mareep was removed, 🤷‍♂️
            I mainly like crystal because of the sprites/animated sprites, i also like the Eusine storyline even if it's simple because there wasn't really one for Ho-oh and Lugia, but yeah other than that it's really not that different.
            (I’m not downvoting) I disagree solely because nostalgia beats out any other factors for me here. The flaws dont matter because that’s what hooked me at 10. That’s the feeling I strive for.
                And that's fine! I enjoy all of the third versions to a certain degree too. That said, nostalgia is the furthest thing from objective
        The first Battle Tower was in Crystal but that’s kinda it.

USUS is an example of improving stuff and also sidelining other stuff. An example of the latter is the Ultra Beasts who were given less a focus in the story and post game outside of the box art legends if they count.
            [deleted]
                BW2 at least had that mediocre [key system](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Key_System) as the [confirmed or implied](https://web.archive.org/web/20150104194421/http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/ds/pokemon-black2-white2/0/0) reason but USUM being split was definitely a cash grab.

Also the only “improved” version to not get an improved post game outside of the sidestory.
    What happened when a gyrados finds out your diet?
Much better, it has better pacing, a better story, a better postgame and a much better Pokédex. I think a lot of people have mentioned some of the limitations of the DP Pokédex, but one of my personal issues with DP is that you couldn’t access a lot of the cool Sinnoh Pokémon like Gliscor and Magmortar until the postgame when there’s barely anything else left to do (Platinum fixes that).
    Not only post game but the whole mechanic of dual sloting to get Pokemon like Magby or Gligar was kind restrictive on its own.
Most has probably already been said, but I'll add in my two cents:

Expanded Pokédex: everyone has already mentioned this one, but I geel I need to illustrate how bad it was in DP. There were only two fully evolved fire types in the pokedex: Infernape and Rapidash. Meaning if you didn't pick Chimchar as a starter, but still wanted a fire type, you had to catch a Ponyta. Additionally, there were a lot of new evolutions to old (often mediocre) Pokémon introduced in DP, but just weren't in the regional dex. Meaning there were a lot of new Pokémon you just couldn't use. Instead the pokedex was filled with the tired old Magicarp, Geodude, Machop and other lines that were used in every previous Pokémon game up to that point. And the worst omission of all IMO is Rotom, a Pokémon that doesn't have particularly high stats, is found in a location accessible right after the second gym, but for whatever stupid reason could only be fought and caught in the post game. Platinum improved this by making Rotom available during the main story, including all the new evolutions and adding in some extra Pokémon for more variety

Now many of the missing Pokémon are available in the new underground of BDSP, but as they use the original Pokédex from DP, it means all the NPC's are stuck with their original teams, which often were lackluster and/or lacked variety. Which led to the infamous fire type Elite 4 member with 3/5 of his team consisting of non-fire types. 

Improved Poketch: in DP and BDSP, the poketch only has a single button to scroll through the apps. Meaning you have often have to scroll through all of them to get to the one you want. This is even worse in BDSP as you first have to press a button to open the poketch and then scroll through everything to get to what you want, and as HMs are now on the poketch, it becomes a mandatory feature which it wasn't in the original. Platinum added an extra button making scrolling a lot more convenient as you now have an up and a down button

Added scenes with Cyrus: In the original DP, Cyrus was criticized for having little screen time and lacking clear motivation. Platinum added more meetings with Cyrus showing more of what he's like, including one where he gives a speech to Team Galactic, but it clear he's just doing to keep them motivated as he only sees them as a means to an end

Updated area: some locations(notably Stark Mountain) got a visual overhaul in Platinum which made it actually look like a volcanic area. In DP and BDSP, it just looks some grassy hills

Updated Gym puzzles: the main offender is the Ghost Gym, who's puzzle in DP is just a bunch of rooms with multiple choice maths questions. In Platinum it was changed to a maze of sorts where you had to navigate through a dark room with a torch and look for a symbol which corresponded to the correct door while avoiding the torch light from gym trainers

None of these changes had anything to do with the story changes in Platinum, and were points of criticism towards DP long before the remakes where even rumoured. They could have easily been included in the remakes without deviating from the DP storyline (which is worse than Platinum's anyway, but that's besides the point). But instead they intentionally kept the original mistakes that were fixed over a decade before the remakes, for the same of being "faithful". 
This is basically why I and (probably) many others dislike the remakes
Platinum runs faster than DP, which is huge imo, but it's not *that* much better otherwise imo. It won't convince you to love gen IV. I like it, but I liked DP as well, so ymmv
Battles in DP were painfully slow, which bogged down the whole game. You couldn't press A to make the dialog box saying what's happening in the battle move on to the next line of dialogue, you had to wait for it to go away on its own which took roughly 10 million years. Platinum fixed that allowing you to just mash a to make text go by at the speed that you want.
Platinum is easily a top 3 mainline game for me and DP are below average.
The battle frontier alone adds so much value to Platinum. I have no idea why we didn’t get more Frontier content in future games. I guess it’s a lot of sets to program, but man, there’s so much to do there.
90% of why Gen 4 is arguably the best is because of Platinum
It is an improvement in every way possible.
People have made a lot of points already, but I also want to say there's a big difference between BDSP and gen 4 as a whole- BDSP is way easier (besides arguably the elite 4).  This is due to the exp and friendship mechanics making you over-level and get random free crits/dodges/etc.  You don't get that in gen 4, making the fights more interesting.  

Beating Fantina, Wake (I picked Chimchar), and Cynthia were formative moments for me as a young kid and made me love challenge in games while you can just brainlessly breeze through BDSP.

Building on that, in addition to the variety in pokemon *you* can catch, enemy trainers just have much better and more interesting teams in Platinum compared to D/P.  And BDSP just uses D/P's enemy teams, meaning fighting trainers with just a geodude and zubat over halfway through the game is fairly common.  That's not the case in Platinum.

Also the gym re-ordering in platinum is good- Fantina being the 5th gym made the gym 2/3 gap too long while gyms 3-5 were all rapid-fire.  Platinum did that pacing far better, and Mismagius is a serious challenge to a level 23-ish team while it's not really to a level 35-ish.
My first game was Blue when I was seven or eight a few weeks after its initial release, Platinum to this day is my favorite in the series.

I skipped Diamond and Pearl after playing for 5 minutes on my buddies DS, so slow and unremarkable and a pretty restricted pokedex. I didn't think about Pokemon for years. 

I worked at a movie rental place and every day I stared at a copy of Platinum bundled with a DS on sale in the display case. I bought it and never looked back. The run of Platinum, BW, B2W2, HGSS revitalized my love for the series. Gen 9 may be my last game, but it's been a hell of a ride
Platinum doesn't make you solve math problems, which is disappointing to math-obsessed people like me, but it's still an improvement overall.
A greatly improved Pokemon selection, particularly for Fire types. I didn't finish my original Diamond run because I hated Chimchar but Rapidash wasn't much better. 

Improved Surf speed. The surf speed in D/P was torturously slow. 

Much better story overall.
I did not like Diamond and Pearl when they came out, so I assumed I didn't like Sinnoh as a region. I played Platinum years later and it became one of my favorite Pokemon games.

It's got a better Pokédex, a better story, and plays significantly faster. The postgame is also one of the best and longest postgames of the franchise.
They fixed the save time issue, so, infinity better
Platinum is basically an overhaul of DP in terms of mechanics graphical, and content. DP ran pretty slow (which is saying something considering how slow gen 4 games are in general), hid a bunch of new Pokémon behind post game like the new Eeveelutions or a bunch of new cross gen evos for no real reason, the graphics were pretty washed out for the most part, the Pokémon distribution wasn't really... good? I guess is how I'd say it. Etc etc.

Platinum came along and upgraded or fixed some of that. Surfing for instance was now bike or running speed instead of a snail's pace, Pokémon distribution is balanced better and made so you can actually gen 4 Pokémon before post game like Electivire or Leafeon, the fire type elite 4 actually has fire type pokemon, graphics are enhanced to be more visually pleasing, story is touched up a little, progression is now more... intuitive, I'd say, etc.

Arguably a huge improvement is the addition of the Battle Frontier. It's been a while, so there might be modern players that never played it, but the Battle Frontier in both Emerald and Platinum were basically collections of fun Battle facilities that imposed different rules or challenges for single player or even multi player, with additional difficulty challenges, and it essentially served as dlc in modern times. Think of the Battle Tower but with more challenges besides that, all in one location. 

Hope this helps
Pokemon Diamond and Pearl's AI is completely random, stupidly. Platinum has actual decision making AI. I find DP pretty frustrating as a result hahaha
    Do you have a source for this? I didn't even know about it
        I don't have a source that you might consider "official" but what he said is true. Just play both games for a few minutes and you'll see that dp ai is true random move selection, but platinum has battle ai like most other games. Anyone who does nuzlockes seriously would corroborate this
I haven’t played them myself but I’ve heard enough about them. Basically it’s night and day, DP are usually ranked among the worst in terms of content, and plat is usually ranked among top 3
Diamond and Pearl were SLOW games. Platinum fixed a lot of the pacing issues.

It also enhanced the story, had a better balance of Pokémon available (such as more than two fire type options), enhanced the post-game, looked nicer…

Basically, it was an upgrade in almost every way.
I'm going to go against the grain here and say that if you don't enjoy Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, Platinum version isn't going to redeem that generation for you.

Platinum is the best version of Gen IV, but it doesn't revolutionize it. The story is better in the same way that a bowl of bland oatmeal is improved with a tiny pinch of brown sugar sugar. At the end of the day, it's still a bowl of plain oatmeal. People don't play Pokemon for the story, and even with Platinum's improvements, the story is still very *meh* as far as RPGs go. 

They added a few fire types, so you aren't restricted to just the Chimchar and Ponyta lines. Again, unless you are desperate to have a fire type (do people honestly always have to have one on every playthrough or something), it isn't exactly a massive game breaking change. Same with the slightly tougher gym leaders. It's a nice change, but  nothing drastic.

The Distortion World is neat, but at the end of the day, it's a 15-20 minute dungeon, hardly worth buying a whole new game for. 

The end game is substantially better due to the Battle Park being replaced with a full-fledged Battle Frontier. But if Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl didn't hold your interest enough to reach that point, Platinum probably won't either.

TLDR: If you dislike Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, Platinum isn't some sort of cure-all that will make you fall in love with Gen IV. The improvements are nice, but unless you play Pokemon for the endgame content and plan on spending a lot of time with the Battle Frontier, it's still essentially the same game. I wouldn't purchase a genuine copy (finding a genuine Platinum version isn't cheap) without trying an emulated version for a few hours to see if you think it will hold your attention.
Platinum is the only thing keeping gen 4 sinnoh from being complete shit.
Better visuals, better storytelling, more indepth story, more post-game, better teams, (vastly) better gym designs, better variety in pokemon.

Just, overall better.
Platinum is far superior. It is what D/P was supposed to be.

 Every game since has been a disappointment to some degree, even HGSS and gen 5. Gen 5 because it lacked super contests and the battle frontier facilities. HGSS because the level curve wasn't fixed at all and it's an absolute nightmare to level beyond 40 (FireRed and LeafGreen and D/P/Pt had Vs. Seeker to remedy this!), also no contests.
Platinum is leagues better then DP in every way possible
Platinum over Diamond/Pearl is the single biggest jump in quality from base game to director’s cut across the whole series IMO. The D/P Dex is sooooo ass. Tried Nuzlocking Diamond at one point and felt like I just stopped getting new encounters at some point. Platinum’s dex is expanded, a lot of tools are more accessible, bosses’ teams are upgraded (Flint isn’t a joke anymore), and that’s not even getting into the massive postgame. Diamond/Pearl honestly feel unfinished in many ways, and Platinum fills in all of the gaps and then some.
Platinum is so good. It was the game that got me back into Pokemon.
So before BD/SP released the only Gen IV game id played was Platinum and had assumed that theyd be as good as Plat. Sadly I was very wrong. Plat might be one of my fav pokemon games, and diamond/pearl and their remakes might be some of my least fav.
Platinum is why I miss same gen remakes. I can't believe they never made Pokemon Gray.
It integrates with heart hold soul silver like they were built for each other that threesome is the greatest rpg 3p of all time
a lot of small and big improvements that stack up and its definitely better especially in the legendary pokemon part of the game and in the post game and its overall a better experience but you will still get like 80% of the experience from dp imo. its slower to play through but its still fun and nice to play.
playing platinum after D/P will absolutely make you forget about D/P. D/P just leave you wanting more without actually scratching that pokemon story itch, at least imo. its okay, but the lack of fire types and weird writing for team galactic are fixed perfectly in platinum. i mean, the E4 fire man actually has more than 1 fire type!! crazy!!
I'll put it this way. I played Diamond first and didn't like it that much. It was definitely my least favorite generation at the time. Platinum might be my favorite Pokémon game. 

The game isn't a night a day difference, but it takes the potential of the original and makes it better in almost every way. I'm actually upset they remade diamond and pearl and not platinum because they basically just remade the same mistakes with just better graphics.
Looker
UNPOPULAR OPINION:

It makes playing Diamond worthless. And BDSP makes Platinum worthless due to an *even bigger pokemon variety* and more QOL resources

That won't change my opinion that BDSP is the worst mainline pokemon game ever made even if i enjoyed it quite a lot.
    BDSP didn't make Platinum worthless as Platinum still has way more content and overall more polish but yeah they're much smoother than normal DP
        Let's say is a middle ground
Platinum was way better than the original BD. I loved Diamond and skipped Platinum as a kid, but MAN do I feel like a fool now that I've been able to go back and play it. The increased Pokémon variety is not SUPER drastic, but it absolutely makes a difference. Getting Eevee early by itself might just be the difference-maker for some people. The Battle Frontier is also awesome, WAY better than just having the Tower in BD. Of course, many people don't care about that stuff at all. But I do!

I'm sorry you skipped Gen IV. I still think HGSS are the best Pokémon games to this day.
D/P was awful and Plat was good. That much of a difference.
I do not know what the incentive was when Gamefreak decided the regional pokedex should have exactly 2 fully evolved fire types, only to make one of the elite four members a fire type user. Nor why they decided to lock out a whole bunch of the new evolutions until the post game. But even that wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that no trainer in game uses them. 

Diamond and Pearl are woefully unfinished games when you really break them down. Platinum is leagues ahead purely for expanding the Pokedex. And then there are a while bunch of other QoL changes.
DP are a bottom 5 Pokemon game for me (counted as the same game) and Platinum is Top 5. It's kind of nuts how a few small but key changes makes the game so much better.
Night and day difference. I got Pearl as a kid and I only go back to Platinum now if I ever want to play though Sinnoh. Platinum streamlines the experience while still adding challenge and tons of new features. 

Platinum is way better than Brilliant Diamond, so play it lol.
there's a reason most people consider d/p the worst pokemon games and platinum one of the better ones
DP ran sooooooo slow. This isn't really relevant though, since BDSP aren't slow (although there is that really annoying screen pan at the beginning of every battle).

Platinum had a better story (not super great, but better) and improved Pokémon selection. BDSP has better Pokémon selection that DP, but I ultimately found BDSP underwhelming as well. I found them poorly balanced. Infinite Exp Share did NOT work for Sinnoh. BDSP were also ludicrously easy until the Elite Four, while the base game of DPPt was more challenging.

Long story short, balance. I find BDSP unbalanced.
I used to be in the same boat as you: skipped gen 4, played BDSP, was left wondering if Platinum was as good as everyone says.

So I decided to try it for myself and, after finishing it, I was honestly left unimpressed. Many of the issues that it fixed back in the day are actually absent from BDSP, so unless you really care about the Distortion World story sequence, contests, and the battle resort, there isn't much of a reason to play it.
Both d/p and play were derivative with no innovation. When you have two 0/10, does it really matter which zero is better?
Honestly I’ve hated every iteration of gen 4 other than luminescent platinum.
Much much better. My favourite Pokemon game behind White 2.
It was a big difference. Much better than diamond and pearl with extra content and more pokemon to capture. Pearl and diamond felt incomplete in comparison
I've been having a good time just playing it through for the first time. I wish it had more Pokémon to catch, it's weird that Murkrow isn't catchable but Honchkrow was released in Sinnoh.
Like >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Better Pokédex is one example.

Also much better post game
The remakes we're such a disappointment to me, loved Diamond as a kid and was excited for the remakes, but they just look awful
So much better.
Seeing the responses in this thread, I really need to give Platinum a shot. I’ve always considered Diamond/Pearl one of the weaker paired versions, but it sounds like I’m missing out on the superior version.
At the time of its release, it was criticized by some because it was seen as a bit of a cash grab.

Within a modern context, there is essentially no real reason to play DP. Well, other than Lucas having slightly nicer clothes IMO, the pokemon having different sprites (though most of the Platinum sprites of the new Pokemon are better, some of the Kanto, Johto and Hoenn Pokemon had better sprites in DP, and some like Buizel are very different and up to personal preference), and some Sinnoh Pokémon being unavailable in Platinum. Even if played for historical context, there isn't really anything that's more authentic or nostalgic about DP, which is an excuse that can be given for not playing Yellow. If you found DP for really cheap compared to Platinum being expensive, it's still worth considering cause like 85% of the experience is there.
Pokemon platinum is my 2nd favorite game after ultra sun
Platinum is so much better than D/P it’s not even funny. Platinum is significantly faster, has way better pokedex variety, more postgame content, harder gym leaders and a more concise story. 

For me the biggest upgrade is the speed improvement. Diamond & Pearl are a slog to play through nowadays
Ponyta lovers can’t even play Diamond
platinum was d/p++, just d/p but better because of added features
From 7/10 to 9/10.
It’s better, but honestly still really hard to play for me. It’s soooooooo slow. Probably my least favorite Gen of games.
    Wasn't even the text before platinum really slow? I haven't played since launch but I remember even 3rd Gen having snail crawl text scroll.
        It’s not just the text. The battles are slow, the story is slow, everything just never jived well with me. Platinum is an upgrade for sure, but I totally get why they went soft reboot with Gen 5.
            5th and 6th Gen are peak for me...
In every way tbh, there were more Pokémon, surfing speed was doubled or tripled or something as was the speed of HP being depleted as you take damage, Giratina makes the whole part where you catch the legendary Pokémon a lot more fun and best of all in my opinion, they removed two Strength boulders in the cave beneath the cycle road, this means you can catch a Gible as early as just after beating the second gym and I'm pretty sure the Earthquake TM is very close as well making for a stupidly overpowered Gible.

There's other changes like the Battle Frontier being added and instead of getting a Happiny egg in Hearthome you get a Togepi egg from Cynthia in Eterna City (I think you might need to beat the gym first) and the gym order is also different, you can't get to Solaceon Town or the route before it without beating Fantina's gym. They also either changed the dialogue of or totally removed a Galactic Grunt from Pastoria City, I remember he calls you a "bugger" which is a bad word in the UK so they must've wanted that gone.

Some of the Gym puzzles are also completely different, not a lot but Gardenia and Fantina's are changed as is Volkner's I think (not certain, I never made it that far on Diamond because I was like 7 but I think I remember my brother being thrown off by it when he played Platinum) the rest are the same but they can have some variation of their teams due to the better variety of wild Pokémon, same goes for the E4. As an example I know for a fact that Volkner has an Electivire which would be impossible to have in Diamond/Pearl.

 Also there's two gift Pokémon that I appreciated a lot when I was younger, Eevee and Porygon, I remember I just thought it was cool that they were free even though I never used Porygon. One of the biggest quality of life improvements though was to the Pokétch, they added a back button so you don't have to cycle through the whole list again. I know BDSP lets you walk with all Pokémon but in DPPt you could only do so in Amity Square in Hearthome City and they had a very specific list of "cute" Pokémon to walk with but Platinum added the Sinnoh starters and all their evolutions to that list which made it a lot less annoying to get the items from there compared to D/P where you needed get like a Pikachu or Happiny or something.

I'm super biased since Gen 4 was my first Pokémon games and Platinum is one of my favourites (tied with Gen V and ORAS) but I highly recommend giving it a go, it's a lot of fun.
Marginally
Crystal emerald and platinum are the definitive ways to play gens 2 3 and 4, but of the three platinum is probably the best. You should definitely play platinum over d/p
    I didn't play Emerald. But I also can't help but notice a lot more people hype it up than Ruby and Sapphire.
        Emerald is great because it combines the magma and aqua stories from r/S into one game, as well as extra bonus content involving rayquaza and the battle island
            Sounds like why people loved ORAS so much what with Delta Episode.
It has all the bells and whistles of an average mid series Pokemon definitive edition like more move tutors and off region Pokemon plus battle frontier and both legendaries, also origin giratina.
More legendarys = Better Game
Diamond and Pearl are the worst mainline Pokemon games, and Platinum fixes enough of the problems that it's at least a better experience.
If your fave type is Fire, and you for some reason didn’t pick Chimchar, your only option was Rapidash.

They added Houndoom, Flareon, and Magmortar in Platinum. Flint no longer had to have a team that was only 40% Fire types.
    That was the biggest eyebrow-rising thing about the gen IV games for me. Do you know why they had such a small number of fire types available?
        Probably just oversight.
            It's still a weird oversight, because it means they specifically made a Fire type specialist with only had 2 Fire type lines and at no point someone was considering "wait, perhaps we should add more for this guy".
                Maybe someone did, but then someone else said 'we only had one ghost type in gen 1 and that was fine'
                    Someone definitely did, but the deadline was likely so tight that it couldn't be fixed in time for release.
                    [deleted]
                        Technically he was the first weather user for the elite 4, as most of his team can set up Sunny Day and make use of it.
                It all kinda fit a hot theme though, Steelix is tempered under pressure and heat, Drifbloom is a hot air balloon, and Lopunny is also on theme.
                    Because lopunny is hot?

It would be funny if that crossing over of word meaning existed in Japanese too
                The wild thing was how magmortar was a thing, but by design of unlocking the national Dex, flint just couldn't have it
            The whole game was an oversight and rushed to get out on the new DS system. People hate BDSP but I think everyone just forgot how bad diamond and pearl were
                I remember being so excited for them and loving them when they first came out but playing Platinum 2 years later really put their shortcomings into perspective
        The games were a problem for Gamefreak to the point they became the only ones to be delayed.
        Because there was nowhere to reasonably put them in the original layout

Sinnoh is a snowy region with a gigantic mountain in the center.

Additionally, DP was a game with many development difficulties since the DS was such a huge difference from the GBA. So while it had all the core game design essentials, it didn’t get some of the polish or attention in many areas, especially in optimization (awful load times)
            Platinum made Sinnoh even snowier.

Plus Fuego Ironworks was in base DP too and could have had them.
            Platinum didn’t really have trouble placing them. And Eevee is a fairly domesticated Pokémon at this point, it’s been native to almost every region.
            If it is a snowy and cold region, that is all the more reason to think it would have fire types.
        Such a strange thing to do.
    It's a bit s*it that you can only get Magmortar through trade on the games.
    And it wasn't juste Fire, if you wanted an Ice type your only options were Sneasel and Snover, while the only Electric lines available were Pikachu, Pachirisu and Shinx. 

And both types were also used by Gym Leaders who had to use unrelated mons, that always confused me as a kid but I guess that made the battles a bit more complicated.
        Don't forget galvantula. I was able to bread a galvantula with compundeye and though it thunder. For a 93.3% accuracy every time.
            Oops wrong game lol
                That was black and white.
                    Oh that's pretty cool, I'll have to try that if a Black and White remake/sequel gets announced. I like Galvantula's design but I never actually used one in-game.
        Isn't Swinub available in DP too?
            You can find it in the wild in Platinum, but in Diamond and Pearl you can only find it in swarms once you have the National Dex.
Also it's much faster (still slow though)
Diamond and Pearl are saved from being Among the bottom 4 worst Pokémon games of all time by plat.   

All those stupid underground Pokémon are better spread out in the over world.  Different gyms rosters using the expanded Pokédex ectra.
It’s team galactic and his name is Cyrus in English :)
    Thanks

In French his name is Helio
        That’s a really good name for him
            I'm pretty sure his name is sun-themed in every language actually
                Oh neat, didn’t know that
The Spear Pillar section of the main story is also vastly improved.
    [deleted]
        Seriously. I was expecting both Dialga and Palkia to get summoned, since both Kyogre and Groudon get awakened in Emerald. I was *not*, however, expecting Giratina to punch through using shadow blotches, and *lunge* at the *camera*, taking Cyrus with it back to the Distortion World. It excited me as a kid, but actually unnerves me as an adult. Giratina is painted as something Lovecraftian in Platinum, a massive upgrade from its appearance as a minor legendary in DP. And the shadow blotches that appear when you give it the Griseous Orb do wonders with that concept, too.
Emerald missing out on Medicham and Zangoose is kind of a bummer. Steven was a much more interesting Champion. And the in-game trades are somehow worse than the already meh ones in RS. Still, Emerald did add way more content than RS had, so it is overall an improvement.

(Plus, I miss the Zigzagoon cheese from RS even though it did need to get fixed).
    [deleted]
        So Zigzagoon has the ability Pick Up that gives you a chance to get a range of items once per battle, right? Well, in Ruby/Sapphire, that range of items was really exploitable. Even a Lv 2 Zigzagoon could get Ultra Balls and Rare Candies, so if you had a team of them you could farm for cash or level up your mons pretty easily as soon as the beginning of the game.
        …well, you know how female Zigzagoon with babies produce milk?
    I don't mind losing access to a couple Pokemon but Steven not being the champion is the one thing I think is a straight downgrade from Ruby/Sapphire. He's way more interesting and involved in the story, opposed to Wallace who just shows up near the end. Wallace's team is also way easier to beat imo and having two Water-type specialists in the region is just lame.

The only reason I can think of that they would make Wallace the Champion was so they could have Steven be the post-game superboss like Red was in GSC, but it could've been one of the rivals (Brendan/May or Wally), or Ethan/Gold if they really wanted to continue that trend.
    No wonder I can never remember where Meditite lives.

Even now, I'm drawing a total blank.
        Mt. Pyre.
            Huh, interesting. I wouldn't have guessed.
The biggest difference is that Emerald was an upgrade of an already good game, whereas Platinum was an upgrade of a mediocre game.
It's an even steeper difference.

Emerald is like adding sweet toppings to a really good cake.

Whereas, Platinum is finishing a half-baked cake.
    And then Emerald poured some water onto that cake with the pointless Team Magma base filler, having to deal with more water routes what was already the worst part of Ruby/Sapphire, downgrading the champion and making the climactic end to the Team Aqua/Magma story a cutscene rather than a battle with the legendary...
That's huge honestly. Red/Blue and Gold/Silver were plenty viable games even before Yellow and Crystal. I feel like Emerald and Platinum are the two most hyped Pokémon 3rd releases, neither of which I played. I had R/B/Y, Silver, and Ruby growing up.
RS had a better champion fight, didn't lock the Pokémon Contests behind Lilycove and also didn't fully showcase Team Magma because you never get to fight Courtney. Emerald is still an overall upgrade but imo Platinum is a much bigger upgrade.
    I would agree with you, after having played emerald I still find RS enjoyable - but after having played Platinum I find DP to be a slog.
    Maybe it’s just me but I prefer having the contests in one area of the game instead of flying to different towns.
    I never played Emerald or Ruby but I do own Sapphire but the whole locking the Pokémon contests behind Lilycove in my honest opinion I never really care that much for Pokemon contests except for the Pokéblock to help evolve Pokemon
Crystal didn't add that much content to the original games while Yellow was a kinda peculiar game since it tried to be faithful to the anime. Imo Emerald, Platinum and USUM were significantly bigger improvements.
    My hot take is that Yellow **isn’t** gen 1’s third version, it’s closer to a LGPE/PLA situation where it’s technically a mainline game but also significantly different from other mainline games. 

Gen 1’s third version is Blue. Red and Green were released in Japan first, with Blue being released later (it was *technically* released later that year, but didn’t reach store shelves until over a year after Red/Green) which like most third versions was extremely similar with QoL changes. 

The international release of Red and Blue were both based off of Japanese Blue, we in the west technically only got gen 1’s third version.
    A lot of people won't admit this, but Crystal is easily the worst third version. Its only major additions were the Eusine storyline and the battle tower. Otherwise, it was just the same flawed game as GS, and teambuilding was made worse by removing Mareep from an already lacking encounter table. Every other third version was either drastically different enough to be a whole new experience (Yellow, kinda USUM), or an overall massive improvement (Emerald, Platinum, kinda USUM)
        Why did it remove mareep? And doesn't it have more pokemon in its catchable dex?
            It removed Mareep to keep the gimmick of version exclusives so you would have to trade with gold/silver.
            Don't remember off the top of my head, but the catchable dex was probably about the same. As for why Mareep was removed, 🤷‍♂️
        I mainly like crystal because of the sprites/animated sprites, i also like the Eusine storyline even if it's simple because there wasn't really one for Ho-oh and Lugia, but yeah other than that it's really not that different.
        (I’m not downvoting) I disagree solely because nostalgia beats out any other factors for me here. The flaws dont matter because that’s what hooked me at 10. That’s the feeling I strive for.
            And that's fine! I enjoy all of the third versions to a certain degree too. That said, nostalgia is the furthest thing from objective
    The first Battle Tower was in Crystal but that’s kinda it.

USUS is an example of improving stuff and also sidelining other stuff. An example of the latter is the Ultra Beasts who were given less a focus in the story and post game outside of the box art legends if they count.
        [deleted]
            BW2 at least had that mediocre [key system](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Key_System) as the [confirmed or implied](https://web.archive.org/web/20150104194421/http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/ds/pokemon-black2-white2/0/0) reason but USUM being split was definitely a cash grab.

Also the only “improved” version to not get an improved post game outside of the sidestory.
What happened when a gyrados finds out your diet?
Not only post game but the whole mechanic of dual sloting to get Pokemon like Magby or Gligar was kind restrictive on its own.
Do you have a source for this? I didn't even know about it
    I don't have a source that you might consider "official" but what he said is true. Just play both games for a few minutes and you'll see that dp ai is true random move selection, but platinum has battle ai like most other games. Anyone who does nuzlockes seriously would corroborate this
BDSP didn't make Platinum worthless as Platinum still has way more content and overall more polish but yeah they're much smoother than normal DP
    Let's say is a middle ground
Wasn't even the text before platinum really slow? I haven't played since launch but I remember even 3rd Gen having snail crawl text scroll.
    It’s not just the text. The battles are slow, the story is slow, everything just never jived well with me. Platinum is an upgrade for sure, but I totally get why they went soft reboot with Gen 5.

    You can find it in the wild in Platinum, but in Diamond and Pearl you can only find it in swarms once you have the National Dex.
That’s a really good name for him
    I'm pretty sure his name is sun-themed in every language actually
        Oh neat, didn’t know that
Seriously. I was expecting both Dialga and Palkia to get summoned, since both Kyogre and Groudon get awakened in Emerald. I was *not*, however, expecting Giratina to punch through using shadow blotches, and *lunge* at the *camera*, taking Cyrus with it back to the Distortion World. It excited me as a kid, but actually unnerves me as an adult. Giratina is painted as something Lovecraftian in Platinum, a massive upgrade from its appearance as a minor legendary in DP. And the shadow blotches that appear when you give it the Griseous Orb do wonders with that concept, too.
So Zigzagoon has the ability Pick Up that gives you a chance to get a range of items once per battle, right? Well, in Ruby/Sapphire, that range of items was really exploitable. Even a Lv 2 Zigzagoon could get Ultra Balls and Rare Candies, so if you had a team of them you could farm for cash or level up your mons pretty easily as soon as the beginning of the game.
…well, you know how female Zigzagoon with babies produce milk?
Mt. Pyre.
    Huh, interesting. I wouldn't have guessed.
Why did it remove mareep? And doesn't it have more pokemon in its catchable dex?
    It removed Mareep to keep the gimmick of version exclusives so you would have to trade with gold/silver.
    Don't remember off the top of my head, but the catchable dex was probably about the same. As for why Mareep was removed, 🤷‍♂️
I mainly like crystal because of the sprites/animated sprites, i also like the Eusine storyline even if it's simple because there wasn't really one for Ho-oh and Lugia, but yeah other than that it's really not that different.
(I’m not downvoting) I disagree solely because nostalgia beats out any other factors for me here. The flaws dont matter because that’s what hooked me at 10. That’s the feeling I strive for.
    And that's fine! I enjoy all of the third versions to a certain degree too. That said, nostalgia is the furthest thing from objective

    BW2 at least had that mediocre [key system](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Key_System) as the [confirmed or implied](https://web.archive.org/web/20150104194421/http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/ds/pokemon-black2-white2/0/0) reason but USUM being split was definitely a cash grab.

Also the only “improved” version to not get an improved post game outside of the sidestory.
5th and 6th Gen are peak for me...
Sounds like why people loved ORAS so much what with Delta Episode.
It's still a weird oversight, because it means they specifically made a Fire type specialist with only had 2 Fire type lines and at no point someone was considering "wait, perhaps we should add more for this guy".
    Maybe someone did, but then someone else said 'we only had one ghost type in gen 1 and that was fine'
        Someone definitely did, but the deadline was likely so tight that it couldn't be fixed in time for release.

            Technically he was the first weather user for the elite 4, as most of his team can set up Sunny Day and make use of it.
    It all kinda fit a hot theme though, Steelix is tempered under pressure and heat, Drifbloom is a hot air balloon, and Lopunny is also on theme.
        Because lopunny is hot?

It would be funny if that crossing over of word meaning existed in Japanese too
    The wild thing was how magmortar was a thing, but by design of unlocking the national Dex, flint just couldn't have it
The whole game was an oversight and rushed to get out on the new DS system. People hate BDSP but I think everyone just forgot how bad diamond and pearl were
    I remember being so excited for them and loving them when they first came out but playing Platinum 2 years later really put their shortcomings into perspective
Platinum made Sinnoh even snowier.

Plus Fuego Ironworks was in base DP too and could have had them.
Platinum didn’t really have trouble placing them. And Eevee is a fairly domesticated Pokémon at this point, it’s been native to almost every region.
If it is a snowy and cold region, that is all the more reason to think it would have fire types.
Oops wrong game lol
    That was black and white.
