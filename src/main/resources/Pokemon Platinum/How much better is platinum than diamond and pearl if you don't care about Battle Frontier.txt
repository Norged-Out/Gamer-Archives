[[How much better is platinum than diamond and pearl if you don't care about Battle Frontier]]


I'm trying to complete the pokedex in soul silver (my favorite game) and I'll obviously need to play through a sinnoh game to do that. I have pearl and diamond. I'm wondering how much better platinum is if I already have access to the same battle frontier is Soul Silver.

Edit: appreciate all the responses but I'm only really in this for the pokedex so a lot of the gym leader rematches and stuff don't really matter to me. That said I might look at game stop for it today.


Platinum is much better than DP.
It's got faster programming so the game moves at a much quicker pace (Trust me, DP moves wayyy slower than you remember). It's also got a really good story with Giratina and the Distortion World, and it's got some more Fire-Types added in there too.
    You are extremely correct in many ways. Plus Team Galactic is more explained. You'll see more of them. 
        More explained, but still illogical
            Oh look, it's Dragmire800, the authority on logic.
                What the actual fuck are you doing replying to a comment I made 5 years ago?
                    hello time police
                    Oh look, it's Dragmire800, the authority on time.
                        lol
                            Oh look it's HairySquidward the authority on laughing
                                bro ruined it
                        I just lost my shit on this. Proves you can never escape your Internet history 🤣🤣🤣
                            especially once you reply on some niche question that is guaranteed to get asked few more times
                        Hehehe
                        LMFAO
                    Time is a flat circle
                    he found it
                    Lol
                    And here we go again...
                    but like they ate you up

                    The salt here: it sustains me.
        More explained?
        besides the faster part. still goes as slow as ever on 30 fps ds game.
        nobody with actually functioning brain cares about pokemon lore. it's garbage.
    Also there's a back button on the Poketch!
        Priorities that we value.
        Really? How so? I don't remember anything about that?
            In Diamond and Pearl, you got one button on the Poketch that scrolled forwards through the different apps. In Platinum, they realized how stupid having one button was in DP. The top one moves forward while the bottom one moves backwards. 
                Oooh yeah I remember now. Thanks. 
    This guy sums it up nicely.

The post-game also massively improved the side quest related to Heatran, and the dex didn't just add Fire types, it expanded from 151 to 210. As an example, Magmortar, Electrivire, etc weren't even in the Sinnoh dex for DP, but now you can get them main game in Platinum.

        post game =/= game. post game is just filler to excuse the inflation in their prices in playtime which adds nothing.
    To add onto this, Cyrus feels like an actual threat, and turns into one scary MOFO.
        Yeah, after Cyrus, N and Lysandre were super disappointing. Lusamine came close, though. 
            To be fair, N wasn't the real villain, Ghetsis was. And he earned himself a good few villain points by straight up trying to murder you in the second game. 
                Those games had no plot.
        How did he not feel like a threat in Diamond and Pearl? The only thing different about Platinum is that you go to the Distortion World. That's not a huge change to the story, it's a cool gimmick to put in a trailer for the money shot. And they made the intro to the game worse, redesigned the gyms terribly, put snow everywhere, and gave the characters weird outfits. But the pacing is better. That's about it.


Edit: I do like that Cyrus is in the intro, but they made Barry a self-entitled little shit.
            Lol. Why are you replying to 6 year old comments? Nobody is going to respond anyways. Besides, Platinum is an improvement in virtually every way over D/P.
                You replied~
                    I responded in a mocking manner and am not expecting a reply. The commenter above me was arguing for a position they hold, expecting a discussion on the subject.
                        This page  pops up whenever someone googles “difference between Diamond and Platinum” we will bother you forever.
                            Fair enough. Regardless, if you're interested in differentiating the 2 games; I recommend Serebii's page on it: [https://www.serebii.net/platinum/changes.shtml](https://www.serebii.net/platinum/changes.shtml)
                        I replied. Maybe in a year the conversation continues. You don't decide when and where this conversation ends.
                            No I don’t, time and the commenters themselves usually do. Given that there has been a significant amount of time that’s passed, with no indication from the OPs that they’re interested in continuing the discussion or are even aware of it in the first place, I logically assumed that it was over.
            Yeah I'm playing Platinum now and I agree, aside from the pacing and certain quality of life changes, some of the changes were for the negative imo
    Damn, I never played Diamond or Pearl but I played a lot of Platinum and I thought it was show af. Tried Pearl once I thought I was going to smash the game in a wall. 
        Sounds about right. Lol (late reply dont care x)
    TBH I think the Distortion world's effect has been exaggerated a bit due to nostalgia. I remember it blowing my mind when I played it on a flashcard as a kid, but I recently bought a legit copy I could play on my n3dsxl and yeah, it's just a small alternate area with some navigational puzzles. some of which are fairly straightforward (illusions that block your path until you come close) others are a bit annoying (the final puzzle where the lake trio tells you to drop boulders down holes). 
        It's not that it's beautiful in terms of graphics or effect.. IT's just that it's one of Pokémon's coolest locations. The sideways wall walking, the upside down waterfall, the disappearing floors, the overall ominous feel.. It's bad ass, man.
        That waterfall still looks pretty sweet tho
    It doesn't have faster programming. That doesn't make any sense. And no, DP does not move slower than I remember. That also makes no sense.

The pacing is better, but that doesn't have anything to do with fast programming because that makes no sense.
        Have you seen the speed differences between the two? Also you’re replying to a comment from 5 years ago.
            So, what if the comment was posted 5 years ago? what's your point? People can still visit this thread like me.

He never said Platinum pacing (A.K.A speed) is the same as Diamond or Pearl, he only said that the term "faster programming" doesn't make sense, because it doesn't make sense.
                Reworded as "programmed to be faster", does that make fucking sense?
        Plat runs literally like a few to a couple of seconds quicker. It's negligible, but it's there ig lol
    > faster programming

As a programmer, I haven't a clue what you meant by this.
        They mean it doesn't take 10 seconds just for a turn to play, for one.
            I'm mostly being a pedant here.
    Everyone talks about diamond and pearl's lack of fire types, but no one really talks about the lack of electric types.
    it doesn't they're both at a garbage of 30 fps
Larger, more varied pokedex

Better pokemon distribution

Less items gated until the post-game

Improved story.

Higher difficulty

Runs faster

Looks less washed out and routes have more character to them.

Gym leaders and Elite 4 members actually use pokemon of their type specialisations.

Introduced ~~David Tennant~~ Looker.
    It looks less washed out and the routes have more character? What does that even mean?
        many areas of the game had their textures and colors updated. stark mountain for example was completely redesigned in platinum and actually looks like a volcano with lava and ash. u can prob find comparison videos but overall platinum looks so much better and has much more character then dp
            I don't even know what Stark Mountain is. I've played the game, how does it "have more character"? That doesn't mean or explain anything.
                It's prettier and more dynamic. Particles are moving around. Colors are more vibrant.
                Did you even play the game? Stark Mountain is the end game area with Heatran. It goes from generic cave to active volcano in platinum
    Is the difficulty actually higher? Haven't played in a long time, just remember cynthia being nerfed to hell and cyrus being pretty tough throughout.
Story is better. Pacing isn't slow af. There's more post game content besides the frontier. Wider dex selection.
    The story is better how? Because of the Distortion World?
        Brother, that guy is probably dead by now. 6 years old comment.
            Maybe you're dead now
                Maybe YOU'RE dead now
                    Dun dun duuunnnn
In addition to what everyone else has said, there are 2 big things I havent seen anyone mention.

Platinum brought back gym leader rematches, as well as the Vs. Seeker, which allow you to refight any trainer in the game.
    So it’s as Emerald was to Ruby and Sapphire. 

Some days I swear, the Pokémon game model led to the birth of the iPhone half upgrade thing.
    So?
        so there's more post game content
        Why are you so upset in this thread? Did you grow up playing diamond or pearl and feel insecure about not having experienced the better version of those games in platinum? People's favorite pokemon game is largely nostalgia based, so who cares if you played the inferior games. You'll still love them just as much as you would have if you played platinum growing up.

 Don't be salty over past fomo. You'll just make your current self miserable for no reason.
Platnium just feels more complete.
I like Platinum better because of the Distorted World. That's like my favorite moment in any Pokemon game. 
The surf speed alone is reason enough to play Platinum over Diamond/Pearl. You only need DP for the Glameow/Stunky lines.
Part of the problem with Diamond and Pearl was that they limited the early-game Pokedex too much so you can't really make a good team to take on the Elite Four later. They also locked a lot of the extended evolution pokemon away until the end-game, such as Eevee and its two new, at the time, evolutions. Both of these issues was fixed in Platinum by expanding the available roster of pre-Elite Four pokemon and making Eevee available right when you meet the Bill-analogue.
The battling system is slightly faster than the horrid D/P system. There are many legendaries to obtain in it as well.
Platinum has a faster frame rate and a wider Pokédex selection that includes the all evolutions to past-generation Pokémon.
I felt like Diamond and Pearl had some plots holes that were fixed with the Story of Platinum. The games seemed to drag quite a bit and honestly, I really didn't enjoy playing them, Platinum was a whole different story. I had a lot of friends who stopped playing Pokemon just because of how slow Diamond and Pearl was. Also Platinum had a much more in depth story after Elite Four, than Diamond and Pearl had. 
    The story is exactly the same but Giratina is there and you go to wacky world for a bit.
        Nah, they actually explain why Cyrus is the way he is. There’s more dialogue, and it paints a better picture of just WHO he is. Also his team has crazy good movesets. Distortion world Cyrus is the second hardest battle in game. And one of the hardest evil team bosses of all time to boot. In the game he debuted in he was seconded to only Ghetsis, that's impressive.
-Expanded pokedex that makes use of most if not all of the new evolutions added in Gen 4 (and gives you more fire types)

-More pokemon variety for teambuilding; my favorite, Gible is obtainable as soon as you get a Bike and the ability to use cut.

-Many areas were given a visual touch-up (Like the Eterna Forest, or Galactic HQ, or Stark Mountain)

-Faster surfing

-Distortion World and a new form of Giratina, which expands the main story

In other words, Platinum is the definitive version of Sinnoh so far. The only downside would be that Platinum doesn't have some of the exclusives of D/P, and you have to wait until the aftergame to catch Dialga/Palkia, but that's pretty much it.
    How does that expans the story?
        Where did they say it did expand the story? They just simply listed some points that they thought platinum improved upon.

It’s been a year since your tirade of miserable comments. Have you cheered up yet?
In Platinum, you're able to catch both Dialga and Palkia, so you don't need to play through Diamond and Pearl separately.
One word: Giratina is main.

Come on man, Diamond, you have the "God of Time", Pearl, you have the "God of Space". Platinum? There's no Gods there, only the Pokémon equivalent of Satan waiting for your ass.
    Both dialga and palkia are in platinum

And giratina is just as much of a god as dialga and palkia are, it represents antimatter
        *sigh* I know that both Palkia and Dialga are in Platinum but Giratina is the main 'Mon and Satan basically anti-God so, that's what I was getting at...
    It's not the equivalent of Satan. Stop thinking everything is your religion.
        Legends Arceus makes it PAINFULLY obvious Giratina is the closest thing there is to a pokemon satan. Any notion of it not being like that died with legends arceus. Denying it now is pretty silly.
            What the fuck are you talking about?
                maybe your username should be disagreeable breath...
                bruh...I don't know how much closer you can get to pokemon satan than Giratina. They definitely based at least some aspects of it off of the devil. Pokemon in general draws from many different religions and mythologies, for the concept of arceus and giratina they're clearly drawing from Christianity. 

All you need to do is look at Volo's dialogue and Giratina's actions in that game.
In addition to what other people are saying, the new Winter getup for characters looks really great. Dawn with her winter coat is so much more iconic than her summer clothing variant.

Platinum also optimizes and polishes the existing content. It was a very solid game.

It's best to say that Diamond and Pearl are the rushed anime broadcast made in crunch time, while Platinum is the heavily polished Bluray with extra content, as it was intended to be.

Aw crap, now I want to replay Platinum..
    More iconic? What?

You saying iconic doesn't mean it's iconic.
        You replying to every single six year old comment in this thread doesn’t mean you’re gonna be less misserable, because you seem pretty pressed for no reason my guy. Get a life lmao
Much, much better. First of all, the game moves faster. This doesn't fix pacing, but moves, surfing, etc. is sped up. You can get more legendaries, and the pokedex is larger.
Surfing is much faster in Platinum. God knows why Gamefreak thought slow surfing was a good idea in Diamond and Pearl.
    What are you talking about?
        [visual example](https://youtu.be/VKBlrRlZAzc?si=N11CWaZfUkDeuDtC&t=8m50s).
Its much better overall,  more or less like how Emerald, Crystal, and Yellow were handled (to a degree of course).
    Yellow is not like Crystal, Emerald, ans Platinum despite what millions of braindead Americans say.
Most crucial difference is the selection of Pokemon available. D/P get very old very quickly once you realize that the Pokemon you've been seeing for the past 4 routes aren't going to change all that much. Platinum spiced things up greatly and added more Pokemon in most of the routes. 
It's the better 3rd game of the generation. Lots of QoL improvements including one of my favorites: the ability to ride bikes inbetween routes (entering the route checkpoint houses took you off the bikes in D/P)
Even pokedex wise, Platinum is better. It decides what fossils you get based on Trainer ID, so you can get all the fossils with some resets, while Diamond and Pearl have version exclusive fossils. Platinum also has more Pokemon in general
*~3d distortion world~*
Quicker pace, better story.
Level 100 magikarp. Need I say more?
Apart from all the stuff people have mentioned, you can get the whole creation trio in Pt (only two in D/P), plus the minor Regis if you buy a used copy which happens to have an event Regigigas. the minor regis can also then be used to get another Regigigas IIRC.
My lack of Platinum always haunts me.
Platinum is mostly better in terms of Pokemon distribution, game speed and quality of life tweaks (diamond and pearl are slooow), and post-game content.

Since you have both and SoulSilver, Pokemon distribution isn't a problem. Post-game content isn't a problem. So really, your only question is: are you prepared to play a slow game? Platinum is certainly a better game, but it probably isn't worth $40 or whatever it is used.
If it's for pokedex stuff, get Platinum. Honestly all three games are great.
Two words: move tutors.
I recently replayed it, and not THAT much better. The story is slightly tweaked and during the climax with the legendary there is a new area full off interesting navigational puzzles.   
Other than that, the available pokemon are tweaked, most notably it includes more firetypes (diamond/pearl barely had any available).  
Finally there's some new forms for Giratina and Rotom (the latter can be caught as soon as you reach the haunted mansion, instead of in the postgame.
I personally don't think the difference is large enough to warrant you buying Platinum if you already have D/P
same shit different toilet.
Ive just bought platinum I’m looking forward to playing it for first time all the comments here are fun.
    How much did it cost you these days?
You are extremely correct in many ways. Plus Team Galactic is more explained. You'll see more of them. 
    More explained, but still illogical

    Legends Arceus makes it PAINFULLY obvious Giratina is the closest thing there is to a pokemon satan. Any notion of it not being like that died with legends arceus. Denying it now is pretty silly.
        What the fuck are you talking about?
            maybe your username should be disagreeable breath...
            bruh...I don't know how much closer you can get to pokemon satan than Giratina. They definitely based at least some aspects of it off of the devil. Pokemon in general draws from many different religions and mythologies, for the concept of arceus and giratina they're clearly drawing from Christianity. 

All you need to do is look at Volo's dialogue and Giratina's actions in that game.
More iconic? What?

You saying iconic doesn't mean it's iconic.
    You replying to every single six year old comment in this thread doesn’t mean you’re gonna be less misserable, because you seem pretty pressed for no reason my guy. Get a life lmao
What are you talking about?
    [visual example](https://youtu.be/VKBlrRlZAzc?si=N11CWaZfUkDeuDtC&t=8m50s).
Yellow is not like Crystal, Emerald, ans Platinum despite what millions of braindead Americans say.
How much did it cost you these days?
More explained, but still illogical
    Oh look, it's Dragmire800, the authority on logic.
        What the actual fuck are you doing replying to a comment I made 5 years ago?

besides the faster part. still goes as slow as ever on 30 fps ds game.
nobody with actually functioning brain cares about pokemon lore. it's garbage.
Priorities that we value.
Really? How so? I don't remember anything about that?
    In Diamond and Pearl, you got one button on the Poketch that scrolled forwards through the different apps. In Platinum, they realized how stupid having one button was in DP. The top one moves forward while the bottom one moves backwards. 
        Oooh yeah I remember now. Thanks.

post game =/= game. post game is just filler to excuse the inflation in their prices in playtime which adds nothing.
Yeah, after Cyrus, N and Lysandre were super disappointing. Lusamine came close, though. 
    To be fair, N wasn't the real villain, Ghetsis was. And he earned himself a good few villain points by straight up trying to murder you in the second game. 
        Those games had no plot.
How did he not feel like a threat in Diamond and Pearl? The only thing different about Platinum is that you go to the Distortion World. That's not a huge change to the story, it's a cool gimmick to put in a trailer for the money shot. And they made the intro to the game worse, redesigned the gyms terribly, put snow everywhere, and gave the characters weird outfits. But the pacing is better. That's about it.


Edit: I do like that Cyrus is in the intro, but they made Barry a self-entitled little shit.
    Lol. Why are you replying to 6 year old comments? Nobody is going to respond anyways. Besides, Platinum is an improvement in virtually every way over D/P.
        You replied~
            I responded in a mocking manner and am not expecting a reply. The commenter above me was arguing for a position they hold, expecting a discussion on the subject.
                This page  pops up whenever someone googles “difference between Diamond and Platinum” we will bother you forever.
                    Fair enough. Regardless, if you're interested in differentiating the 2 games; I recommend Serebii's page on it: [https://www.serebii.net/platinum/changes.shtml](https://www.serebii.net/platinum/changes.shtml)
                I replied. Maybe in a year the conversation continues. You don't decide when and where this conversation ends.
                    No I don’t, time and the commenters themselves usually do. Given that there has been a significant amount of time that’s passed, with no indication from the OPs that they’re interested in continuing the discussion or are even aware of it in the first place, I logically assumed that it was over.
    Yeah I'm playing Platinum now and I agree, aside from the pacing and certain quality of life changes, some of the changes were for the negative imo
Sounds about right. Lol (late reply dont care x)
It's not that it's beautiful in terms of graphics or effect.. IT's just that it's one of Pokémon's coolest locations. The sideways wall walking, the upside down waterfall, the disappearing floors, the overall ominous feel.. It's bad ass, man.
That waterfall still looks pretty sweet tho
Have you seen the speed differences between the two? Also you’re replying to a comment from 5 years ago.
    So, what if the comment was posted 5 years ago? what's your point? People can still visit this thread like me.

He never said Platinum pacing (A.K.A speed) is the same as Diamond or Pearl, he only said that the term "faster programming" doesn't make sense, because it doesn't make sense.
        Reworded as "programmed to be faster", does that make fucking sense?
Plat runs literally like a few to a couple of seconds quicker. It's negligible, but it's there ig lol
They mean it doesn't take 10 seconds just for a turn to play, for one.
    I'm mostly being a pedant here.
many areas of the game had their textures and colors updated. stark mountain for example was completely redesigned in platinum and actually looks like a volcano with lava and ash. u can prob find comparison videos but overall platinum looks so much better and has much more character then dp
    I don't even know what Stark Mountain is. I've played the game, how does it "have more character"? That doesn't mean or explain anything.
        It's prettier and more dynamic. Particles are moving around. Colors are more vibrant.
        Did you even play the game? Stark Mountain is the end game area with Heatran. It goes from generic cave to active volcano in platinum
Brother, that guy is probably dead by now. 6 years old comment.
    Maybe you're dead now
        Maybe YOU'RE dead now
            Dun dun duuunnnn
so there's more post game content
Why are you so upset in this thread? Did you grow up playing diamond or pearl and feel insecure about not having experienced the better version of those games in platinum? People's favorite pokemon game is largely nostalgia based, so who cares if you played the inferior games. You'll still love them just as much as you would have if you played platinum growing up.

 Don't be salty over past fomo. You'll just make your current self miserable for no reason.
Nah, they actually explain why Cyrus is the way he is. There’s more dialogue, and it paints a better picture of just WHO he is. Also his team has crazy good movesets. Distortion world Cyrus is the second hardest battle in game. And one of the hardest evil team bosses of all time to boot. In the game he debuted in he was seconded to only Ghetsis, that's impressive.
Where did they say it did expand the story? They just simply listed some points that they thought platinum improved upon.

It’s been a year since your tirade of miserable comments. Have you cheered up yet?
*sigh* I know that both Palkia and Dialga are in Platinum but Giratina is the main 'Mon and Satan basically anti-God so, that's what I was getting at...

        bruh...I don't know how much closer you can get to pokemon satan than Giratina. They definitely based at least some aspects of it off of the devil. Pokemon in general draws from many different religions and mythologies, for the concept of arceus and giratina they're clearly drawing from Christianity. 

All you need to do is look at Volo's dialogue and Giratina's actions in that game.
