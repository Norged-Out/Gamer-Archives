[[Engineer class]]





Still no idea how to post properly but pretty much look for this rock formation in the fog jump up to get the technician suit and drop down to get the alien device to unlock engineer
    can you please send a screenshot?
    So is the Suit and Alien device together?
        This is correct. If you stick to the right side (Right behind those 3 spikes) you can long jump across a gap and grab the Suit. Then if you fall just to the left of that the alien device will be on that lower floor.
            I got the set but device is missing somehow
                You have to fall off the platform in a direction for the device
                Same here
                Not sure if it's intended or a bug, but if you don't see the device then it's highly likely it's simply not there for your iteration of that world.  
My first try at Timeless Expanse I had the exact same thing happen: found the rock formation, got the suit, went down to the two corpses and the item was no where to be found. 

I spent a good 30 minutes doing death runs into that area just looking for the alien device and never found it.  
Then, I rerolled the world on adventure mode (this time it was Eons), found the rock formations again, and there it was. 

If it's spawned, from where you get the suit you can easily see it even through the fog (it will have a yellow indicator like scraps/materials). If you got the suit but can't find the material then it probably didn't spawn for you.
                    You found it in the Eon Vault? I've rerolled a couple times and haven't seen it in either configuration yet.
                        Can confirm its Spawn on eon vault for me, exact same rock formation as OP screenshot. Look for spikes AND the Big rock to the left.
        For me, only the suit was there. No device. This was in Eon Vault.
    so if go adventure mode in Nerud I have to progress to the 2nd map and it should be eon or horizon right? Its never the first open world area in Nerud?
        Correct, has to be second overworld
        same question is the first area always the same ? how do I know I got the right world roll?
Does that mean the warlock and invader class exist as well? For a total of 11 archetypes before DLC?
    Damn that be so fkn cool
    There are indeed 11 total Archetypes. Invader is one of them. Summoner is likely what you think Warlock is.
This a hidden archetype?
    Yes one of the 3 that are available
        Good to know!
        No it isn't.  The three that are available are Summoner, Alchemist, and Explorer.
            I just got it like 5 mins ago thanks to OP
                Well, look at me, being wrong!

It wasn't on the wiki, which has the other unlockable classes, so I assumed it was fake.  I watched a video of it being unlocked.

Interestingly, there are two other classes that were supposedly going to be in the game - one based on mods, and one on stealth.  I wonder if they're also hidden in there?
                    I think Archon has been found by the review copy folk but they're on NDA, all the engineer videos popped up at the same time. 

The guess is its in the Labrynth somewhere because all other areas have had a class found. 

The stealth one is anyone's guess though!
                [deleted]
                    [here](https://www.xbox.com/play/media/RWQSK7SMTP)
            There are more than three, friend. I heard 11 is the final amount but have no source to verify that. But engineer is here, summoner, alchemist, explorer, gunslinger and starting 4 make 9, so maybe 2 more to find. Maybe more. Who knows.
                Archon and "Invader" are the last two, but we don't know anything about them other that they exist in the files somewhere.

Presumably, one is for Mod usage and the last is for Melee Weapons
                    Archon is for mods.  Invader is actually a stealth build from what I've heard.
                I know, I was wrong.  I was using the wiki to get my info and I assumed that, beyond the Summoner, Alchemist, and Explorer, there were no more unlockable archetypes, and assumed people were just spreading a video game myth to get people to look for something that didn't exist (as they often do).

If this is in there, I hope the Archon and the Invader are too.
Thanks dude! 

For those doubting this, take a look!

            Unfortunately I was not the host so map data does not save for me.
                [deleted]
                    To be quite blunt, it was practically in the middle of nowhere. There was just some random segment of map he described to me as, "Felt like the right direction." He stumbled off the edge of the minimap, and found the device that gets you engineer where his corpse is in the video. I pick up the engineer armor because he fell down before he grabbed it.
                        So you need the armour and a device off the edge where you find the armour?
                            The armor isn't required, we just wanted it. All you need is the Alien Device.
                                I feel like I searched every inch of the area in the photos and I still couldnâ€™t find a formation thatâ€™s similarâ€¦ 

Does the armour do anything special or just fashion?
                                    Fashion and stats. They moved away from traits on armor.
        Is there anybody on Xbox that can help find this archetype ?
        Amazing! I was able to use this to find it for myself!
        Nice
        I know this been 4 months but i followed this video and led me straight to mine. Literally same map and same location.
    So did you just follow his map? Look for the formation and find it?
        My map was just to give some reference it just to show its normally in proximity to the ship I don't have enough data so say if it always near the ship but 5 people have all found it in the area close to the ship (Not the exact spot my pictures show)
            Found it! Near the rock formation. Thanks!
            If you get the Armor does that unlock ability to unlock the class?
                No, the armor is near the device. The armor will be on a small ledge you jump to, and below that ledge should be the device.
                    Armor was there for me, device on the ledge below wasn't

&#x200B;

edit: ok on my story playthrough only the armor set was there (eon vault zone) and no device.

On my adventure mode n'erud that I already had, timeless horizon zone, the device was there (and armor).
                        im getting this too,on vet i got the armor but no device for me.
                            Yeah my story was veteran, had no device

My adventure mode  was survivor, had the device. Not sure if  its coincidence
    Where is the heavy Leto armor from ???? I want it so hard xD
        You have to unlock the Biome Portal Key in the Labyrinth (get the 'Segments' quest), then there's a (very hidden) Labyrinth path from the Fractured Ingress that will take you to a hidden gate that you can open and go through. The gate takes you to the place on Earth where the Chicago Typewriter is; Leto's armor is also there. Really hard to describe the route so I recommend checking a video.
    Woah where did you get that mask from? It looks awesome with the leto set.
        its one of the 3 armour sets you get from ultimate edition it is the healing set from remnant 1
            Nah it's not that, I found it actually its the helmet from the Fae Royal Set.
                Ah I was looking at the wrong picture !
This sounds awesome, Iâ€™ve only found the alchemist archetype so far. Got dragged into a sewer by some beast on Losomn, killed it once I got out and got the archetype piece. The class buffs are really nice, starting equipment looks awesome(minus the hat), and it comes with the double barrel which has been my favorite handgun so far.

Side note: wouldnâ€™t the map location be different for everyone?
    The dragging thing was a nice touch. There was  a shiny near the sewer grate and i was not expecting it.

Sadly it was my first boss and was playing on hard with no gear so i died. Then couldnt get him to drag me in again. Think it might be a one time deal.

Moved down to survivor and reset for now until i gear up a bit.

First game taught me not to dwell too much on difficulty at first. ðŸ¤£
        You had an actual boss for that part? All I fought was an elite enemy and it gave me the piece for alchemist
            It was a boss version of the elite enemy.....
                Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m asking. Mine was literally an elite enemy. It died in a few sniper shots and had no name, big health bar or modifiers that bosses have.
                    Yeah mine was a boss. Dragged me into a sewer grate. When my character woke up i was in an arena with a pile of bones in the middle.

The boss had a big red health bar at the top of the screen with a name i never got chance to remember and kept summoning adds everytime his HP dropped to a certain point. He was doing big damage

I was L1 with no upgrades playing on the 2nd hardest difficulty so i died when he was on about 25%.
            Same here, wonder if it's a bug or intended.
        >Sadly it was my first boss and was playing on hard with no gear so i died. Then couldnt get him to drag me in again. Think it might be a one time deal.

You may have figured this out yourself by now, but while he won't drag you from the same grate again you can still re-trigger the boss with another random grate.

I went up to every single one after he merc'd me the first time and eventually got it to trigger again.
            Damn, i did try that but he never grabbed me again. There may have been a random grate i missed that was the one he was waiting at but i tried loads.

Least i know for next time! Thanks.

    It is on N'erud you either get the eon vault or Timeless Horizon for that zone I'm unsure if it can also spawn in the eon vault
        [deleted]
            It wont be the same spot but the rock formation will be the same you just need to head to the ship and search around near it the two times I've found it have been within the area of the ship
                [deleted]
                    I'm guessing the spawn can also be random on another world I joined it was to the right instead of left the actual formation spawn could also not be guaranteed I'm not playing atm but I would recommend maybe trying to join games in that zone and check there worlds the 3 times I found it now have all been in the general area of the ship either to the left or right the formation has been the same each time though
                        [deleted]
                            Each zone is generated differently every time its luck of the draw if you play on steam I'm happy to help you look when I get home
                                Do you know if this can still spawn in other zones, or if we get extraction hub instead?

                                    >I shouldn't have to do a full exploration of the map, in all four world-states, through Curse Fog for something that might be there.

I have news for you bro.

This is literally the Remnant gameplay loop. 

So if you are getting angry already then maybe you need to reflect on the first game looking for ace's coin or the tommy gun event.

Game just came out. Chill and play. The beauty is if you miss something you can get it on another playthrough.
                                    Or you could just be unlucky. That doesn't mean that the TC is lying and you sound bratty for implying that just because you haven't been able to find it.

                        What area do you mean by ship? I might be unlucky and not spawning it but is it a specific area?
            https://imgur.com/a/zffjSxP
Thanks, was able to find it because of this post
How do you traverse the fog? I've tried multiple blight items and rings, but I'm being dumb.
[deleted]
    Can you link the guide I can find it in the thread
        [deleted]
            Are you on console or pc?
So after looking at this I tried it myself and started at titans reach  wandered relatively close and found the exact same pillars and it was there for me. Mine is close to two little mountains in the map roughly diagonal from the checkpoint
    Did the area look similar to OPâ€™s overworks photo? Or do I specifically have to look for the stalagmites in the fog?
        Exact same stalagmites and cliff but it definitely varies depending on map structure bc my map design is different than his if you need help finding it Iâ€™m
On ps5 itzNovaa1
            Iâ€™m not on atm but I will be later tonight and could deff use the help lol when i searched I was more focused on the overworld map than I was looking for the stalagmites
                Alright sounds good Iâ€™ll be on
                    Thanks for the advice! I found it on my own! I appreciate your offer to help too
Cleared the whole map, cant find it anywhere
Nicee took me a few tries because I kept dying to the fog but u got it both the suit and the archtype

Thanks for sharing
I just found it and to maybe help people, the 2 rocks below him on the map WERE NOT THERE FOR ME. Neither was the part in the map where it actually is. It is literally just run around the edge of the map looking outwards until you see what it looks like in OP's first picture
    Did you find your during story or adventure mode?
        It was in adventure mode
Wish there was a class where I can dual 2 handguns.
    Could happen in dlc seeing how archetypes are unlockable now I would be surprised if there were no dlc ones
        I doubt theyâ€™ll add such a class seeing as the first game there was no dual wielding in that either. But hey, hereâ€™s hoping.
            Better chance of a gun that's just dual wield pistols
                That would be cool too
Got it! Eon vault and endless horizon will have this type of rock formation everyone!
Thank you! Ran around the edges of timeless, lost hope, saw this is the fog, got the item!!
Get the salves that give you curse resistance and it makes things so much easier as well.
My guy, is that the mofo

C H I C A G O T Y P E W R I T E R
    It is it pretty much carried me to completion its crazy good
        My guy ðŸ˜Ž
Does anyone know how to get the starting weapons for the engineer, once you've unlocked it?
    Been wondering this myself, anyone?
    did you have any luck finding this out?
    Plasma laser and shotgun pistol
Took me a while but here's where I found mine on Timeless Horizion. Incase it helps anyone!  


https://youtu.be/mfyJwlQg3fU
    THis short clip provided me with 95% more information in helping to find this than all the screenshots and descriptions on the internet.
    Wait, so the rock formation won't appear until you actually get inside? I've been running around hoping the god damn formation will appear before I know it actually spawned!?
        Nah, the rock formation is visible from the outside/just before the poison fog.
            I realize that now, but I wasn't looking physically I was looking for it to appear on the map. @_@
    Your video's a real lifesaver after 5 adventure rerolls (and 5 hours) fully exploring the edges and STILL not finding the ledge. Turns out you have to run into the fog for the ledge outline to appear on map.
    Just found this exact formation in roughly the same area on The Eon Vault. Thanks mate.
So I jumped across and got the armor but when I dropped down the Archetype Item wasn't down there?
    Same :(
Found eon vault on other guy campaign and no sign of this place... just "square" areas
So I found the area but when I got the armor I dropped down to grab the device but it wasnâ€™t there I have tried multiple times has this happened to anyone else
    Same
anyone had the problem that the armor spawned but the alien device did not?
    because i seem to have that problem and i dont know what to do, ive probable walked up there about 20 times now, restarting wont help and i dont seem to have corrupt savefiles. im reinstalling right now and will write if that helped
        Yeah, this happened to me as well. Your save isn't corrupted or anything, it's just unlucky. What I ended up doing after getting the armor and not the class item, I finished the area to unlock adventure mode of Nerud, then rerolled it and walked around until I found it again, it was there the 2nd time. It can be either Eon Vault OR Titans Reach, if you don't find it in one, try another. I'd look up a video from Arekkz Gaming to find a reference picture of what it looks like on the edge of the map.
            you are right, i got it with the same build in adventure mode thanks a lot
    Same thing happened to me, got the armor but no Alien Device
Looked everywhere even re rolled and itâ€™s not there , is this class really in game or is it a joke? Iâ€™m slowly being put off this game looking for this, in fact Iâ€™m doing what my friends have done Iâ€™m out of here ,uninstalled
Got it. This looks like a ridiculously fun archetype. This probably means that the Archon and Invader exist in game too. My question now is why did the wiki remove them?
    they are meant to be secret as of now
        Seems weird to only keep some of the archetypes you find secret but not others, especially when the game has gone (somewhat) public
            Fextralife once again making stupid decisions, nothing new there.
                Hey, not looking to argue him, I'm just curious. Could you mention some other examples? Only asking because I've really liked his wiki's since DS2 and I've used them for a lot of games and never noticed anything off.
Thanks for the half attempt at not spoiling... marking in spoiler and blurry the pic but writing  the spoiler as the headline, great!
    If it matters that much to you then you should be avoiding this subreddit entirely. Youtube also.

Its not like spoilers in post titles is a new phenomenon. This reddit is for sharing info, if you don't want to accidently see info you don't know, then you shouldn't be browsing casually. In the future, just google the exact thing you are looking for and you'll avoid spoilers.

&#x200B;

P.S. - You even clicked on the headline and came see the post! How can you accuse anyone of spoiling things for you if you can't keep from spoiling it for yourself?
        Hold on , now you are assuming stuff!  

You are right , i should have unsubbed remnent post launch( I have now). I did however not klick the post and got spoiled . The info got spoiled since the headline showed up in my feed. I just pointed out that OP went through the effort of not spoiling with the flare and stuff but that didn't matter since the headline spoiled it anyhow. Its like I want to surprise you with a gift. I wrap it in nice paper so I don't spoil the surprise, but then write on the gift what it is.
Spoiler in the title. Nice...
    Yet you clicked on the headline and came see the post! How can you accuse anyone of spoiling things for you if you can't keep from spoiling it for yourself
        Didn't read the body. Just the title. The title was enough to spoil me.
I mean the topic title is a spoiler.

I certainly didn't want a class spoiled....
My god, are you the first documented person to have discovered this archetype? What is your name, we must write you into the remnant history books
    I Highley doubt I'm the first to find it but if I am maybe Veil shall be next to engineer and invader (still looking for this one but I think it at least know the spawn map location)
        What are the engineer archetypeâ€™s armor and weapons?
            They start with a three round burst pulse rifle, a shotgun pistol, and a rocket hammer.
            The Armor is Technians set and weapons not a clue  (I've not looked on a new character)
        Does difficulty matter? What diff are you playing on?
This is completely fake, you haven't proven that you can equip it nor shown images of the skills. It's one thing to show where it would be, it's another to claim it even exists. Sorry if I sound skeptical but can you please show proof of the archetype's skills in image format please?
    Lmao get shit on
        Hahaha, rekt

            Literally. These salty clowns, wtf do they think they are? Raging because they dont instantly find every single thing on first playthrough.
        Get shit on
    Err.. Huh?

There were video out there already though, even before this post
What can you do as an engineer ?
    You get 3 heavy weapons you can deploy as turret or use as weapons instead
        What are the weapon choices?
            Vulcan (Minigun) 

Flamethrower 

Impact cannon
                I can only hope the impact cannon is as chunky as I'm imagining.
        Thatâ€™s actually awesome !!
Donâ€™t remember if the first game had turrets tho
            There was a weapon mod that drops a turret, you get the control rod from hound master on rhom then use it on the sentinel next to wasteland merchant.
        OMG i NEED this now. Just sad i'm on my first world and it's not this one haha
        Are you actually joking?

This sounds sick.
    You solve problems.

Not problems like "what is beauty?", because that would fall under the purview of your conundrums of Philosophy
        I solve practical problems! Like, how do I stop some mean mother-Hubbard from tearing me a structurally-superfluous new behind. The answer?

Is a gun.

And if that don't work?

COWABUNGA BOYS.
        Ahahah got it ! Sounds about right !
            He donâ€™t get it
GOT IT! Thanks, your awesome!
Just found it that's awesome! It's really cool looking class.
Saving this post for later, thanks for sharing this info
Anyone got the full list of perks and abilities to share?
This was more helpful than any video I've watched
Where do I go from The Eon Vault to Timeless Horizon? I'm confused and zero guides have been helpful whatsoever.
Thanks OP. Once I knew to look for the two platforms I found it without a lot of trouble.
YOU BEAUTIFUL CREATURE I FOUND IT
Bro thanks so much I figured since it was random maps it was different for everyone but this landmark is perfect just got armor, died before relic but Iâ€™ll have it soon enough!
[deleted]
    Which ship?
This helped ðŸ¥°
Can confirm I got this last night by random chance. The engineer class is fucking sick with its deployable turrets
I am honestly quite sick of looking for this class, I've lost half a day wasting time because of RNGesus not favoring me enough. Actually quite sick of the world now I've seen and battled it so many times it's just tedious.

If anyone happens to come across it in their playthrough, would you consider letting me join your game to collect it before you do?
    Nevermind....... someone with an actual HELPFUL video (CB279) provided more info than anyone ever did and I just found it.
Got it thanks!
[Video: Here's where it dropped for me in Timeless Horizon, hope it helps!](https://youtu.be/r2l5uUlQ9z8?si=RXG43qX-_78p3tJ3)
I just posted a YouTube video walkthrough of how to get the Engineer.  
Just search my Reddit username on YouTube.
Ooh I'm gonna try and find this.  Love turret classes!
Where did you get chigaco typewriter ?
Always amazed how somebody finds this. They choose a random rock formation to explore and stumble upon an entire class? 

Is there some sort of hint or book that led them here?
    there is special class for finding secrets - Explorer - it shows chests and secrets like this
Did some digging and the key thing is to look for that particular stalagmite formation with the platform on the left. The hole shape and whatever else on the map is inconsequential.  


Found the engineer class item & armour, so thank you for this regardless.
What do people mean by "ship"? I'm on the eon vault map.
I found it on The Eon Vault map without the Titan's Reach world 
spawn in the following location

https://imgur.com/a/XU0nmDd
Anyone able to grab the armor but the alien device was not there?
do you need to be in adventure mode to find this?
I wanna get this on my Hardcore Character but seems like you can't get it without dying. Might have to just start as it.
Can you unlock it via Adventure Mode?  Cuz, I've passed the location you need to unlock and not ONE of the exits connects to world in question.
can you please send a screenshot?
So is the Suit and Alien device together?
    This is correct. If you stick to the right side (Right behind those 3 spikes) you can long jump across a gap and grab the Suit. Then if you fall just to the left of that the alien device will be on that lower floor.
        I got the set but device is missing somehow
            You have to fall off the platform in a direction for the device
            Same here
            Not sure if it's intended or a bug, but if you don't see the device then it's highly likely it's simply not there for your iteration of that world.  
My first try at Timeless Expanse I had the exact same thing happen: found the rock formation, got the suit, went down to the two corpses and the item was no where to be found. 

I spent a good 30 minutes doing death runs into that area just looking for the alien device and never found it.  
Then, I rerolled the world on adventure mode (this time it was Eons), found the rock formations again, and there it was. 

If it's spawned, from where you get the suit you can easily see it even through the fog (it will have a yellow indicator like scraps/materials). If you got the suit but can't find the material then it probably didn't spawn for you.
                You found it in the Eon Vault? I've rerolled a couple times and haven't seen it in either configuration yet.
                    Can confirm its Spawn on eon vault for me, exact same rock formation as OP screenshot. Look for spikes AND the Big rock to the left.
    For me, only the suit was there. No device. This was in Eon Vault.
so if go adventure mode in Nerud I have to progress to the 2nd map and it should be eon or horizon right? Its never the first open world area in Nerud?
    Correct, has to be second overworld
    same question is the first area always the same ? how do I know I got the right world roll?
Damn that be so fkn cool
There are indeed 11 total Archetypes. Invader is one of them. Summoner is likely what you think Warlock is.
Yes one of the 3 that are available
    Good to know!
    No it isn't.  The three that are available are Summoner, Alchemist, and Explorer.
        I just got it like 5 mins ago thanks to OP
            Well, look at me, being wrong!

It wasn't on the wiki, which has the other unlockable classes, so I assumed it was fake.  I watched a video of it being unlocked.

Interestingly, there are two other classes that were supposedly going to be in the game - one based on mods, and one on stealth.  I wonder if they're also hidden in there?
                I think Archon has been found by the review copy folk but they're on NDA, all the engineer videos popped up at the same time. 

The guess is its in the Labrynth somewhere because all other areas have had a class found. 

The stealth one is anyone's guess though!

                [here](https://www.xbox.com/play/media/RWQSK7SMTP)
        There are more than three, friend. I heard 11 is the final amount but have no source to verify that. But engineer is here, summoner, alchemist, explorer, gunslinger and starting 4 make 9, so maybe 2 more to find. Maybe more. Who knows.
            Archon and "Invader" are the last two, but we don't know anything about them other that they exist in the files somewhere.

Presumably, one is for Mod usage and the last is for Melee Weapons
                Archon is for mods.  Invader is actually a stealth build from what I've heard.
            I know, I was wrong.  I was using the wiki to get my info and I assumed that, beyond the Summoner, Alchemist, and Explorer, there were no more unlockable archetypes, and assumed people were just spreading a video game myth to get people to look for something that didn't exist (as they often do).

If this is in there, I hope the Archon and the Invader are too.
Ya, it's real, did this with him!

        Unfortunately I was not the host so map data does not save for me.
            [deleted]
                To be quite blunt, it was practically in the middle of nowhere. There was just some random segment of map he described to me as, "Felt like the right direction." He stumbled off the edge of the minimap, and found the device that gets you engineer where his corpse is in the video. I pick up the engineer armor because he fell down before he grabbed it.
                    So you need the armour and a device off the edge where you find the armour?
                        The armor isn't required, we just wanted it. All you need is the Alien Device.
                            I feel like I searched every inch of the area in the photos and I still couldnâ€™t find a formation thatâ€™s similarâ€¦ 

Does the armour do anything special or just fashion?
                                Fashion and stats. They moved away from traits on armor.
    Is there anybody on Xbox that can help find this archetype ?
    Amazing! I was able to use this to find it for myself!
    Nice
    I know this been 4 months but i followed this video and led me straight to mine. Literally same map and same location.
So did you just follow his map? Look for the formation and find it?
    My map was just to give some reference it just to show its normally in proximity to the ship I don't have enough data so say if it always near the ship but 5 people have all found it in the area close to the ship (Not the exact spot my pictures show)
        Found it! Near the rock formation. Thanks!
        If you get the Armor does that unlock ability to unlock the class?
            No, the armor is near the device. The armor will be on a small ledge you jump to, and below that ledge should be the device.
                Armor was there for me, device on the ledge below wasn't

&#x200B;

edit: ok on my story playthrough only the armor set was there (eon vault zone) and no device.

On my adventure mode n'erud that I already had, timeless horizon zone, the device was there (and armor).
                    im getting this too,on vet i got the armor but no device for me.
                        Yeah my story was veteran, had no device

My adventure mode  was survivor, had the device. Not sure if  its coincidence
Where is the heavy Leto armor from ???? I want it so hard xD
    You have to unlock the Biome Portal Key in the Labyrinth (get the 'Segments' quest), then there's a (very hidden) Labyrinth path from the Fractured Ingress that will take you to a hidden gate that you can open and go through. The gate takes you to the place on Earth where the Chicago Typewriter is; Leto's armor is also there. Really hard to describe the route so I recommend checking a video.
Woah where did you get that mask from? It looks awesome with the leto set.
    its one of the 3 armour sets you get from ultimate edition it is the healing set from remnant 1
        Nah it's not that, I found it actually its the helmet from the Fae Royal Set.
            Ah I was looking at the wrong picture !
The dragging thing was a nice touch. There was  a shiny near the sewer grate and i was not expecting it.

Sadly it was my first boss and was playing on hard with no gear so i died. Then couldnt get him to drag me in again. Think it might be a one time deal.

Moved down to survivor and reset for now until i gear up a bit.

First game taught me not to dwell too much on difficulty at first. ðŸ¤£
    You had an actual boss for that part? All I fought was an elite enemy and it gave me the piece for alchemist
        It was a boss version of the elite enemy.....
            Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m asking. Mine was literally an elite enemy. It died in a few sniper shots and had no name, big health bar or modifiers that bosses have.
                Yeah mine was a boss. Dragged me into a sewer grate. When my character woke up i was in an arena with a pile of bones in the middle.

The boss had a big red health bar at the top of the screen with a name i never got chance to remember and kept summoning adds everytime his HP dropped to a certain point. He was doing big damage

I was L1 with no upgrades playing on the 2nd hardest difficulty so i died when he was on about 25%.
        Same here, wonder if it's a bug or intended.
    >Sadly it was my first boss and was playing on hard with no gear so i died. Then couldnt get him to drag me in again. Think it might be a one time deal.

You may have figured this out yourself by now, but while he won't drag you from the same grate again you can still re-trigger the boss with another random grate.

I went up to every single one after he merc'd me the first time and eventually got it to trigger again.
        Damn, i did try that but he never grabbed me again. There may have been a random grate i missed that was the one he was waiting at but i tried loads.

Least i know for next time! Thanks.
It is on N'erud you either get the eon vault or Timeless Horizon for that zone I'm unsure if it can also spawn in the eon vault
    [deleted]
        It wont be the same spot but the rock formation will be the same you just need to head to the ship and search around near it the two times I've found it have been within the area of the ship
            [deleted]
                I'm guessing the spawn can also be random on another world I joined it was to the right instead of left the actual formation spawn could also not be guaranteed I'm not playing atm but I would recommend maybe trying to join games in that zone and check there worlds the 3 times I found it now have all been in the general area of the ship either to the left or right the formation has been the same each time though
                    [deleted]
                        Each zone is generated differently every time its luck of the draw if you play on steam I'm happy to help you look when I get home
                            Do you know if this can still spawn in other zones, or if we get extraction hub instead?

I have news for you bro.

This is literally the Remnant gameplay loop. 

So if you are getting angry already then maybe you need to reflect on the first game looking for ace's coin or the tommy gun event.

Game just came out. Chill and play. The beauty is if you miss something you can get it on another playthrough.
                                Or you could just be unlucky. That doesn't mean that the TC is lying and you sound bratty for implying that just because you haven't been able to find it.

Can you link the guide I can find it in the thread
    [deleted]
        Are you on console or pc?
Did the area look similar to OPâ€™s overworks photo? Or do I specifically have to look for the stalagmites in the fog?
    Exact same stalagmites and cliff but it definitely varies depending on map structure bc my map design is different than his if you need help finding it Iâ€™m
On ps5 itzNovaa1
        Iâ€™m not on atm but I will be later tonight and could deff use the help lol when i searched I was more focused on the overworld map than I was looking for the stalagmites
            Alright sounds good Iâ€™ll be on
                Thanks for the advice! I found it on my own! I appreciate your offer to help too
Did you find your during story or adventure mode?
    It was in adventure mode
Could happen in dlc seeing how archetypes are unlockable now I would be surprised if there were no dlc ones
    I doubt theyâ€™ll add such a class seeing as the first game there was no dual wielding in that either. But hey, hereâ€™s hoping.
        Better chance of a gun that's just dual wield pistols
            That would be cool too
It is it pretty much carried me to completion its crazy good
    My guy ðŸ˜Ž
Been wondering this myself, anyone?
did you have any luck finding this out?
Plasma laser and shotgun pistol
THis short clip provided me with 95% more information in helping to find this than all the screenshots and descriptions on the internet.
Wait, so the rock formation won't appear until you actually get inside? I've been running around hoping the god damn formation will appear before I know it actually spawned!?
    Nah, the rock formation is visible from the outside/just before the poison fog.
        I realize that now, but I wasn't looking physically I was looking for it to appear on the map. @_@
Your video's a real lifesaver after 5 adventure rerolls (and 5 hours) fully exploring the edges and STILL not finding the ledge. Turns out you have to run into the fog for the ledge outline to appear on map.
Just found this exact formation in roughly the same area on The Eon Vault. Thanks mate.
Same :(
Same
because i seem to have that problem and i dont know what to do, ive probable walked up there about 20 times now, restarting wont help and i dont seem to have corrupt savefiles. im reinstalling right now and will write if that helped
    Yeah, this happened to me as well. Your save isn't corrupted or anything, it's just unlucky. What I ended up doing after getting the armor and not the class item, I finished the area to unlock adventure mode of Nerud, then rerolled it and walked around until I found it again, it was there the 2nd time. It can be either Eon Vault OR Titans Reach, if you don't find it in one, try another. I'd look up a video from Arekkz Gaming to find a reference picture of what it looks like on the edge of the map.
        you are right, i got it with the same build in adventure mode thanks a lot
Same thing happened to me, got the armor but no Alien Device
they are meant to be secret as of now
    Seems weird to only keep some of the archetypes you find secret but not others, especially when the game has gone (somewhat) public
        Fextralife once again making stupid decisions, nothing new there.
            Hey, not looking to argue him, I'm just curious. Could you mention some other examples? Only asking because I've really liked his wiki's since DS2 and I've used them for a lot of games and never noticed anything off.
If it matters that much to you then you should be avoiding this subreddit entirely. Youtube also.

Its not like spoilers in post titles is a new phenomenon. This reddit is for sharing info, if you don't want to accidently see info you don't know, then you shouldn't be browsing casually. In the future, just google the exact thing you are looking for and you'll avoid spoilers.

&#x200B;

P.S. - You even clicked on the headline and came see the post! How can you accuse anyone of spoiling things for you if you can't keep from spoiling it for yourself?
    Hold on , now you are assuming stuff!  

You are right , i should have unsubbed remnent post launch( I have now). I did however not klick the post and got spoiled . The info got spoiled since the headline showed up in my feed. I just pointed out that OP went through the effort of not spoiling with the flare and stuff but that didn't matter since the headline spoiled it anyhow. Its like I want to surprise you with a gift. I wrap it in nice paper so I don't spoil the surprise, but then write on the gift what it is.
Yet you clicked on the headline and came see the post! How can you accuse anyone of spoiling things for you if you can't keep from spoiling it for yourself
    Didn't read the body. Just the title. The title was enough to spoil me.
I Highley doubt I'm the first to find it but if I am maybe Veil shall be next to engineer and invader (still looking for this one but I think it at least know the spawn map location)
    What are the engineer archetypeâ€™s armor and weapons?
        They start with a three round burst pulse rifle, a shotgun pistol, and a rocket hammer.
        The Armor is Technians set and weapons not a clue  (I've not looked on a new character)
    Does difficulty matter? What diff are you playing on?
Lmao get shit on

        Literally. These salty clowns, wtf do they think they are? Raging because they dont instantly find every single thing on first playthrough.
    Get shit on
Err.. Huh?

There were video out there already though, even before this post
You get 3 heavy weapons you can deploy as turret or use as weapons instead
    What are the weapon choices?
        Vulcan (Minigun) 

Flamethrower 

Impact cannon
            I can only hope the impact cannon is as chunky as I'm imagining.
    Thatâ€™s actually awesome !!
Donâ€™t remember if the first game had turrets tho
        There was a weapon mod that drops a turret, you get the control rod from hound master on rhom then use it on the sentinel next to wasteland merchant.
    OMG i NEED this now. Just sad i'm on my first world and it's not this one haha
    Are you actually joking?

This sounds sick.
You solve problems.

Not problems like "what is beauty?", because that would fall under the purview of your conundrums of Philosophy
    I solve practical problems! Like, how do I stop some mean mother-Hubbard from tearing me a structurally-superfluous new behind. The answer?

Is a gun.

And if that don't work?

COWABUNGA BOYS.
    Ahahah got it ! Sounds about right !
        He donâ€™t get it
Which ship?
Nevermind....... someone with an actual HELPFUL video (CB279) provided more info than anyone ever did and I just found it.
there is special class for finding secrets - Explorer - it shows chests and secrets like this
This is correct. If you stick to the right side (Right behind those 3 spikes) you can long jump across a gap and grab the Suit. Then if you fall just to the left of that the alien device will be on that lower floor.
    I got the set but device is missing somehow
        You have to fall off the platform in a direction for the device
        Same here
        Not sure if it's intended or a bug, but if you don't see the device then it's highly likely it's simply not there for your iteration of that world.  
My first try at Timeless Expanse I had the exact same thing happen: found the rock formation, got the suit, went down to the two corpses and the item was no where to be found. 

I spent a good 30 minutes doing death runs into that area just looking for the alien device and never found it.  
Then, I rerolled the world on adventure mode (this time it was Eons), found the rock formations again, and there it was. 

If it's spawned, from where you get the suit you can easily see it even through the fog (it will have a yellow indicator like scraps/materials). If you got the suit but can't find the material then it probably didn't spawn for you.
            You found it in the Eon Vault? I've rerolled a couple times and haven't seen it in either configuration yet.
                Can confirm its Spawn on eon vault for me, exact same rock formation as OP screenshot. Look for spikes AND the Big rock to the left.
For me, only the suit was there. No device. This was in Eon Vault.
Correct, has to be second overworld
same question is the first area always the same ? how do I know I got the right world roll?
Good to know!
No it isn't.  The three that are available are Summoner, Alchemist, and Explorer.

        Hey, not looking to argue him, I'm just curious. Could you mention some other examples? Only asking because I've really liked his wiki's since DS2 and I've used them for a lot of games and never noticed anything off.
Hold on , now you are assuming stuff!  

You are right , i should have unsubbed remnent post launch( I have now). I did however not klick the post and got spoiled . The info got spoiled since the headline showed up in my feed. I just pointed out that OP went through the effort of not spoiling with the flare and stuff but that didn't matter since the headline spoiled it anyhow. Its like I want to surprise you with a gift. I wrap it in nice paper so I don't spoil the surprise, but then write on the gift what it is.
Didn't read the body. Just the title. The title was enough to spoil me.
What are the engineer archetypeâ€™s armor and weapons?
    They start with a three round burst pulse rifle, a shotgun pistol, and a rocket hammer.
    The Armor is Technians set and weapons not a clue  (I've not looked on a new character)
Does difficulty matter? What diff are you playing on?
Hahaha, rekt
    Love it
        "tHiS iS ComPLeteLY FaKE"
Get shit on
    Literally. These salty clowns, wtf do they think they are? Raging because they dont instantly find every single thing on first playthrough.
Get shit on
What are the weapon choices?
    Vulcan (Minigun) 

Flamethrower 

Impact cannon
        I can only hope the impact cannon is as chunky as I'm imagining.
Thatâ€™s actually awesome !!
Donâ€™t remember if the first game had turrets tho
    There was a weapon mod that drops a turret, you get the control rod from hound master on rhom then use it on the sentinel next to wasteland merchant.
OMG i NEED this now. Just sad i'm on my first world and it's not this one haha
Are you actually joking?

This sounds sick.
I solve practical problems! Like, how do I stop some mean mother-Hubbard from tearing me a structurally-superfluous new behind. The answer?

Is a gun.

And if that don't work?

COWABUNGA BOYS.
Ahahah got it ! Sounds about right !
    He donâ€™t get it
I got the set but device is missing somehow
    You have to fall off the platform in a direction for the device
    Same here
    Not sure if it's intended or a bug, but if you don't see the device then it's highly likely it's simply not there for your iteration of that world.  
My first try at Timeless Expanse I had the exact same thing happen: found the rock formation, got the suit, went down to the two corpses and the item was no where to be found. 

I spent a good 30 minutes doing death runs into that area just looking for the alien device and never found it.  
Then, I rerolled the world on adventure mode (this time it was Eons), found the rock formations again, and there it was. 

If it's spawned, from where you get the suit you can easily see it even through the fog (it will have a yellow indicator like scraps/materials). If you got the suit but can't find the material then it probably didn't spawn for you.
        You found it in the Eon Vault? I've rerolled a couple times and haven't seen it in either configuration yet.
            Can confirm its Spawn on eon vault for me, exact same rock formation as OP screenshot. Look for spikes AND the Big rock to the left.
I just got it like 5 mins ago thanks to OP
    Well, look at me, being wrong!

It wasn't on the wiki, which has the other unlockable classes, so I assumed it was fake.  I watched a video of it being unlocked.

Interestingly, there are two other classes that were supposedly going to be in the game - one based on mods, and one on stealth.  I wonder if they're also hidden in there?
        I think Archon has been found by the review copy folk but they're on NDA, all the engineer videos popped up at the same time. 

The guess is its in the Labrynth somewhere because all other areas have had a class found. 

The stealth one is anyone's guess though!

There are more than three, friend. I heard 11 is the final amount but have no source to verify that. But engineer is here, summoner, alchemist, explorer, gunslinger and starting 4 make 9, so maybe 2 more to find. Maybe more. Who knows.
    Archon and "Invader" are the last two, but we don't know anything about them other that they exist in the files somewhere.

Presumably, one is for Mod usage and the last is for Melee Weapons
        Archon is for mods.  Invader is actually a stealth build from what I've heard.
    I know, I was wrong.  I was using the wiki to get my info and I assumed that, beyond the Summoner, Alchemist, and Explorer, there were no more unlockable archetypes, and assumed people were just spreading a video game myth to get people to look for something that didn't exist (as they often do).

If this is in there, I hope the Archon and the Invader are too.
Unfortunately I was not the host so map data does not save for me.

        To be quite blunt, it was practically in the middle of nowhere. There was just some random segment of map he described to me as, "Felt like the right direction." He stumbled off the edge of the minimap, and found the device that gets you engineer where his corpse is in the video. I pick up the engineer armor because he fell down before he grabbed it.
            So you need the armour and a device off the edge where you find the armour?
                The armor isn't required, we just wanted it. All you need is the Alien Device.
                    I feel like I searched every inch of the area in the photos and I still couldnâ€™t find a formation thatâ€™s similarâ€¦ 

Does the armour do anything special or just fashion?
                        Fashion and stats. They moved away from traits on armor.
Found it! Near the rock formation. Thanks!
If you get the Armor does that unlock ability to unlock the class?
    No, the armor is near the device. The armor will be on a small ledge you jump to, and below that ledge should be the device.
        Armor was there for me, device on the ledge below wasn't

&#x200B;

edit: ok on my story playthrough only the armor set was there (eon vault zone) and no device.

On my adventure mode n'erud that I already had, timeless horizon zone, the device was there (and armor).
            im getting this too,on vet i got the armor but no device for me.
                Yeah my story was veteran, had no device

My adventure mode  was survivor, had the device. Not sure if  its coincidence
Nah it's not that, I found it actually its the helmet from the Fae Royal Set.
    Ah I was looking at the wrong picture !
It was a boss version of the elite enemy.....
    Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m asking. Mine was literally an elite enemy. It died in a few sniper shots and had no name, big health bar or modifiers that bosses have.
        Yeah mine was a boss. Dragged me into a sewer grate. When my character woke up i was in an arena with a pile of bones in the middle.

The boss had a big red health bar at the top of the screen with a name i never got chance to remember and kept summoning adds everytime his HP dropped to a certain point. He was doing big damage

I was L1 with no upgrades playing on the 2nd hardest difficulty so i died when he was on about 25%.
Same here, wonder if it's a bug or intended.
Damn, i did try that but he never grabbed me again. There may have been a random grate i missed that was the one he was waiting at but i tried loads.

Least i know for next time! Thanks.
It wont be the same spot but the rock formation will be the same you just need to head to the ship and search around near it the two times I've found it have been within the area of the ship
    [deleted]
        I'm guessing the spawn can also be random on another world I joined it was to the right instead of left the actual formation spawn could also not be guaranteed I'm not playing atm but I would recommend maybe trying to join games in that zone and check there worlds the 3 times I found it now have all been in the general area of the ship either to the left or right the formation has been the same each time though
            [deleted]
                Each zone is generated differently every time its luck of the draw if you play on steam I'm happy to help you look when I get home
                    Do you know if this can still spawn in other zones, or if we get extraction hub instead?

                        >I shouldn't have to do a full exploration of the map, in all four world-states, through Curse Fog for something that might be there.

I have news for you bro.

This is literally the Remnant gameplay loop. 

So if you are getting angry already then maybe you need to reflect on the first game looking for ace's coin or the tommy gun event.

Game just came out. Chill and play. The beauty is if you miss something you can get it on another playthrough.
                        Or you could just be unlucky. That doesn't mean that the TC is lying and you sound bratty for implying that just because you haven't been able to find it.

            What area do you mean by ship? I might be unlucky and not spawning it but is it a specific area?

Are you on console or pc?
Iâ€™m not on atm but I will be later tonight and could deff use the help lol when i searched I was more focused on the overworld map than I was looking for the stalagmites
    Alright sounds good Iâ€™ll be on
        Thanks for the advice! I found it on my own! I appreciate your offer to help too
Better chance of a gun that's just dual wield pistols
    That would be cool too
I realize that now, but I wasn't looking physically I was looking for it to appear on the map. @_@
you are right, i got it with the same build in adventure mode thanks a lot
