[[Aberration Domination Event Corrupted Weapons - Which one are you going for]]





Some clarity: you need new Corrupted Shards for these, which are dropped from new Aberrations. The event only has an increased chance to spawn these new aberrations, so don't think you will be missing out if you don't get them all during the event time frame.

EDIT: I do not know much else about these new aberrations. So far what's been confirmed is that they can spawn anywhere in any difficulty. I've been trying to get some to spawn in a few adventure mode runs but no luck so far.
    So...outside event will be possible get those weapons, right?


To buy those weapons need something else or just those shards?
        Need the regular version.
            ouch...rune pistol will be a pain to get another....

&#x200B;

hoping that works find the quest line/spawn and before talk with npc...get corrupted version and them buy again.
                You can trade them to Dwell to get the original and vice versa so long as you have a simulacrum
        Yes, but much harder due to the lowered span rate
    Old aberrations also will drop those corrupted shards?
        doesn't seem to be the case. I killed a ton of them today and none of them dropped them.

I got one from a new one, which just decided to spawn during a boss battle with the sewers blob LOL
            during boss battle with king whatever slime????

&#x200B;

interesting...
                yeah. That battle was weird in all possible ways. First the boss health frame was invisible, I couldn't see my damage numbers, then a horde of enemies spawned inside the boss room, followed by the new corrupted enemy.
            Do they only drop on nightmare?
    Do the aberration spawns and/or drops increase with difficulty?
        Same question!
    I thought the event started tomorrow
        That's what I thought, but I already got a corrupted shard today. Maybe the increased spawn rate doesn't start until tomorrow.
    thank you i was so worried about that i would have been so pissed if they only gave us 3 days to get this
    They can also spawn in pre-patch campaigns and adventures so you don't have to reset, only need to explore unexplored parts if there are such. Got 2 to spawn in 2 hours by just playing in an old adventure mode.
holy shit, Deceit without the melee requirement?? SO DOWN

edit: Merciless also looks interesting, didn't realize they changed it into a ~~rail~~ rivetgun. does it still proc bleed?
    mmh but only 3 sec, 1 charge,  and need to reactivate on the right spot?
        Reactivating it will just cause it to stop traveling and stay in place hitting an enemy multiple times if you stop it on the boss, extending the weakpoint timer for up to the 3 seconds it stays there from the looks of things. Plus it fires as soon as you hit the power button, so no more activating it, then meleeing, then shooting. Seems like it'll be less awkward to use.
Bruh after 170 hours of playing I still don't even have regular Rune Pistol, (last thing I have left to unlock), so it would be funny if I could get the corrupted version before it. 

If you need the gun before hand, then probably Merciless or Aphelion.
    > so it would be funny if I could get the corrupted version before it.

Don't worry, you won't.

For the fact that corrupted version costs 10 new shards PLUS original weapon itself. Yep, that's the price.

Hope weapon upgrades transfer to corrupted wepon.
        Ok that's kind of an issue, can you even get a second version of the weapon if you have the original one?
            Someone tested already and answered all questions here: https://www.reddit.com/r/remnantgame/comments/17hal7i/new_corrupted_weapons_a_guide/

TLDR: currently you can't recraft original weapon after trading it in (can only revert corrupted to normal) but devs confirmed it's a bug and you will be able to recraft original as usual.
                I can't even fathom how they gathered 10 fragments, i was playing last night and a whole losomn run gave a huge sum of one corrupted enemy, that was mandatory in the asylum and droped no fragments, so yeah.
                    you can dupe them.
                        How?
                            at cass from another player. you can find it on youtube.
            Yes, and no

There's one you have to give up to get another weapon (can't recall off the top of my head) and once you give it up you can get it again 

If you mean "can I have 2" however, the answer is no
        What? You have to sacrifice the original weapon?
            Yes. But you will be able to recraft it again if you wish (after killing that boss again).
        have heard they do transfer the upgrade.
Can we only get one?

Cause in terms of ease of use. Corrupted Deceit seems like quite the upgrade over the original.

But Meridian will definitely be my first target. I love my Pocket Bombs.
    You can grind for all of them. The event only has an increased chance for the new material needed. 

C.Meridian will def me my first pick too!
        Do you know if the material is capped? Also the abberatiosn drop from every difficulty?
            I just killed one on Apocalypse, only one shard dropped.
                I just completed a normal adventure mode and didn't see one.  
How does it spawn in, do you just randomly come across some dude you've never seen before?
                    Spawned in Terminus Horizon in N'Erud. Just while I was moving from one dungeon to the next.
                    I had spent a bit of time running around. Stopped off to grab the Override Pin, got lost looking for the hook around to the next dungeon. 

It was a waller and it spawned while I was fighting some trash adds. Nothing else special.
            Patch notes say they spawn in all modes and all difficulties and are not limited.
            cap seems to be 10. need to buy a weapon before you can get more.
They made an event? Yo was not expecting that! Holy shit gunfire is knocking it out the park
Am I going crazy or is the corrupted merciless a destiny reference to whisper of the worm? It has three rounds and auto refills on crits, plus the description states it fires nails and the perk in destiny on whisper is called white nail. Maybe I’m just going crazy though 😹
    Ahem... I can officially say...  
  
  
Maybe.
        Eyes up guard….erm traveler?
            The traveler has eyes now?? Hope they're googly.
        Oh flip he responded! I haven’t actually played the second game yet, I’m still on the first and survival mode is kicking my butt but it’s so fun!! Thank you guys for making a great game, I can’t wait to get into the second! Also I gotta ask could you guys add a cat ear head piece no particular reason 😹
    Yes it is definitely based off the destiny snipers like the black hammer
    It feels like a WotW reference. I wouldn't discount it, as there's also the "ghost shell" mutator, which definitely feels like a destiny reference
    And merciless is also a destiny2 exotic fusion rifle
    Whisper of the Worm was like... the best thing I did in Destiny 2. Murder some bosses in the open world to open a secret portal, then descend down a staggeringly massive dungeon with lots of maze-like passages and red herring dead ends. Such a cool experience.
        Going to be way more viable for sustain DPS with the sniper buff coming up
            I don't really mean the gun itself so much as the process to unlock it. It was such a cool adventure. Gun is pretty cool too though...
                Oh for sure. Hopefully now that they've got exotic mission weekly rotators they bring back whisper and outbreak's quests
                    I wouldn't know. I basically lost all interest in destiny when they discontinued three of the expansions I bought.
Meridian

Need more Boom.
Really disappointed Savior and Starkiller didn't get this treatment, they desperately need it.
    All special weapons will get their shine. I'm also going to be looking into base models to increase effectiveness on weapons that may have fallen behind!
        I like the *IDEA* of savior, but having a Time-sensitive mod for a weapon you need to manually hold down and release at the optimal time for efficient damage seems counterintuitive and builds up unnecessary stress.
            Saviour is just a bow with a mag and looks like a gun :)
Event? Huh? What?

I gotta jump back in, it seems.
May I know where are you seeing this are the only weapons, pls.
    Check with your old pal Dwell, after patching your game that is.
        Mine’s patched and they still aren’t up yet? I know the event is tomorrow
            If your on ps5 its bugged right now
                That explains why I couldn't find them, hope it gets patched soon
                Claaaaasssic
        Ty
... I need all of them.

But I'll definitely be looking for corrupted Deceit and Meridian.
I just found a new abberation in Losomn.  Randomly appeared in Brocwithe Quarter.  He had a "clone" modifier that summoned a helper.  Dropped the Mutator "Bottom-Heavy".

"Increases Fire Rate by 7.5% and an additional 1% for every 10% of Magazine missing

Level 10: Reload Speed is increased by 20% when magazine is empty"
"It's not a live service," they said. "I won't be playing the game again without DLC,"they said."The game is great, but once you have all the secrets It's on to something else," they said. 
Then, these incredible developers saw what they had made and felt it was good. So when  in real life players and developers looked around them and saw the people gathered around to wear costumes and solicit there neighbors for stale candies, the developers told the masses, "Here, hold my drink" and they sprinkled new toys and new enemies all over the realms, with quality of life features that players believed where still months away. 

I have convinced 23 people to buy this game so we could play co-op. 19 of those 23 agree this is the best game they've ever played. It's time to start a group text with the 4 holdouts.

These developers should be role models to their peers. Remnant 2 has destroyed my patience with studios releasing buggy, not really ready games. There is no excuse for putting out trash when we see what a quality studio can accomplish.


Thank you!
The real question is, where do we find these aberrations
    I just rerolled a new N'erud (best world!) to see if I find anything.
        The event starts tomorrow...
            I just found the first random Aberration. In the first world of N'erud. It was amazing haha.
                Apparently the Aberrations are a permanent addition, the event is just an increased spawn rate for a few days.
                Ah, so they are random spawns?
                    Yes. I fought a copy of myself. Didn't expect that!
                        Whoa, and this was out in the overworld and not in a dungeon?
                            Overworld indeed. Abyssal Rift. Didn't encounter any in a dungeon so far.
    they just spawn in completely random.
I’m confused are these the same weapons but a diff skin or are they actually different?
    The mods are different
        and at least for deceit the stats are a bit different too. lower dmg but higher RPS, 5% less critchance, more max ammo.. (tbh, its the only one i compared)
            Merciless is also different.

3 round mag vs 50;
90 damage vs 13;
1.3 rps vs 8.6.

The mod is very different too.
Do they do anything different? And will it be an account unlock or just temporary?
    The mods are different, I'm pretty sure it's character based since you trade the base weapon for them, and they're permanently in the game. The event is just the abberations that drop the shards you need have a higher chance of appearing.
Since the corrupted versions require the original versions as material, are these strictly upgrades? Or would I need to get a second gun after the upgrade?
    Original guns are a crafting material to make the new gun. You can convert back with a simulacrum, or you can get both over time.
        Update to this. There MAY be a bug preventing you from crafting the original if you converted over. That's not intentional. You should be able to obtain both at once. Looking into it.
        If I convert one to the corrupted version, can i just re-roll adventure to get the original?
            Yes. You can obtain both.
                But is the aberrations limited per world? Like, only 1 in an aventure?
        I have 3/5 of these original version weapons fully upgraded at +10. Will the corrupted weapons be fully maxed as well if I trade the originals or will I lose the Simulacrums I invested in the originals?
            They should remain upgraded when converted to corrupted. You can convert back and maintain the level with simulacrum as well.
                That's awesome! Tysm for the quick reply :)
Just met one of the new aberrations!

>!In the Great Sewer, one of the pyromaniac guys called Tortured Flame. Gave me a mutator called Ingenuity which mitigates 25% of heat accumulation and at level 10 increases reload speed based on accumulated heat.!<

Edit: Found another

>!In the great hall. It was a one armed knight called Maleficent Glimmer. The mutator is called Stormbringer. It increases status effect damage from melee weapons by 25%, and at level 10 makes charged melee attacks reduce enemy resistance to all status effect damage by 10% for 10 seconds!<

Edit: Playing on Veteran. Only gave one corrupted shard. Might be best to just grind for them on survivor?
    Dev comment somewhere in this thread said that outside of the event, they should spawn more frequently on higher difficulties.
For me: the only way to is to get all of them. Remnant is a pretty short game, even when including hardcore and apocalypse runs, build swaps etc. I welcome anything new to do.
    You’re insane
        Maybe. I do like that game and made a lot of friends playing it :) one day it'll have crossplay. My favorite build was a melee lifesteal (which seems to be improved now  w the buffs to rings and amulets for health) for a full apocalypse run. Super satisfying to have full confidence in builds in hardcore too
            I’ve never felt that from this game. Everything feels like a struggle. I played 2 minutes on apocalypse and said nope. I mean even the update didn’t load all the way so idk what everyone is even talking about.
                Yeah I felt that way a little when I first started. I never played from the ashes, or a Dark Souls or similar game before. 

What I learned was that you have to plan for enemies and hazards and traps. And that neutral dodge, and dodge in general is an attack. That all enemies can be countered. And that this was the actual game: wait for their attack and then punish the attacker or just move past them.

Remnant (and all the other titles mentioned) punishes players who charge ahead and try to mow and slaughter their way through by force.

Eventually a build will carry you through a lot, but - you can always find your self overwhelmed and stun locked no matter how strong you get. Meaning you need to be adaptable in your build as much as your approach too.

In some ways the game can be "annoying" vs "challenging". And Gunfire is the type of gaming company I'd love to work with to help improve user experience and interfaces, inventory, "QoL", etc. AKA "why is N'eruds poison gas so poorly indicating its volume and boundaries?" But also help them improve how they communicate in game and in public about how and why the game works like it does, without literally holding your hand too much.

I will say that Remnant 2, and Dark Souls, Elden Ring and I'm currently lurking in Lords of the Fallen - all take me back to 1980s early arcade game stakes: that "Game Over" was your teacher.

Something that I used to look forward to as a challenge: the "impossible" to beat games. But you just knew there was a secret, that it was and is possible. You'd see some random person just crushing a game and say "I get it now" or in my case "you can jump through them here at this moment?!?" And it would open up your mind to a new concept. Waiting for the boss to slam their giant hands on you and then dodging into it, instead of panic rolling and never escaping, if you will.

It's like Tron, the movie - that the game designers are using penalty as boundary, and visual and audio as cue. That they want you to persevere. But they know if they just tell you all the secrets it is "game over". But there is magic in the machine if you realize that you can move between the pixels.
                Are you on playstation ?
Because that update didn't go out.

For whatever reason Gunfire and Gearbox have major struggles with their console publishing. They've made a ton of excuses and in some ways I kind of feel like it makes a great case as to why consoles shouldn't exist, but affordable PCs in console price ranges specifically to game on - should.

But yes, if you're on playstation we are once again not getting an update, even though it was promoted as ready. They certainly had no issues taking money from console and pc player alike at the same time, but the updates and fixes are priority to pc and the console gets what it gets, if and when it gets it.

As much as I've enjoyed the game - it seems all games are now "pay to play our buggy beta!" and they will eventually in 1 - 10 years make some of the fixes they should have made before the game was ever released. Lulz
                    Yea this shit is getting ridiculous. I literally had an update for remnant 2, came on here to see what was up, got hyped, was confused why it didn’t appear for me in the game, then I read one of the devs on the game said they had issues with PlayStation and it should be fixed. This shit is absolutely dumb as fuck and is the exact reason why I stopped buying video games.

Idk how companies reasoned it in their heads that they can charge $30 more for a game that’s only 60% finished. Every fucking major release has been complete trash. Meanwhile all the smaller companies are actually making fully capable games with minimal issues. It’s an embarrassment.
                        Yeah I think as humans go, we've gotten continually more selfish and manipulative. And it creates a very strong subconscious that it is "ok" to be bad to people because "it's business". 

It is really sad that these enormous trillion dollar brands like Apple, Adobe or Unreal, and let's not forget Unity (no irony in their name) all raising their prices in spite of their record profits. There is so much money and none of it is shared. It's just taken. And what is given is the minimum viable product.
                            And then these companies have the audacity to talk about how they’re working the issue out in the game. Bro if you released a buggy game 15 years ago, nobody would’ve bought it and if they fixed it, they would fix EVERYTHING IN ONE UPDATE. 

This whole idiocy of paying $70 for a half assed game that the company is going to spend 20 updates fixing is insane to me. And you have people that sympathise with these companies like they don’t have the money to get shit done.
    I feel the same; the only vanilla content I'm missing are:

- HC Survivor/Veteran clear rewards
- Window Hollow Circlet
- Band Band
- Resonance Trait

This update does unfortunately mean I'll need to grind out more upgrade materials...but I guess that's not the worst thing.  Unfortunate the original-weapons are not currently recraftable; but that'll get fixed eventually.
        If you're on psn I'd gladly run through hc vet w you.
            Sadly I'm on PC.
                Hit up the remnant discord. Lots of super nice people there who'd love to do runs.
                    I've got a couple of friends that I've been running HC with, along with solo attempts, but I appreciate the suggestion.
        MrSeanG on psn if so. Cheers!
Any idea of wich biome will be better for aberration farm?


Lossom asylum with chainsaw guy on courtyard?
    They are new abberations and a new item drop.  It's not the same as the upgrade materials we already have.
        we already have a list with possible locations/names?
            atm it looks like they are totally random spawns on any map.
                So far...no corrupted aberrations...

Hoping find one before nightweaver to start jump other people sessions to farm more, get corrupted nightfall, beat her and craft nightfall again


Will be pain get corrupted rune pistol


Edit: nvm... its deceipt and not nightfall who get corrupted version lol, i can finish this adventure and rerun :)
Oh nice!! What's the new meridian mod?
Meridian and Aphelion are def best imo
[deleted]
    Yes. Once event is over, higher difficulties are more likely to spawn the world-aberrations.
        Does this mean during the event, all difficulties have the same chance of spawning?
            During event, 100% chance for a world aberration to spawn on high-intensity tiles.
                When is the event though? and how do you we start it? Just roll an adventure? Also I keep seeing “corrupted shards” as being a resource needed, these wouldn’t happen to be the same ones that we’ve been collecting this whole time?
                    > When is the event though?

The event is 2023-10-27 to 2023-10-3, which will see increase spawn rates of the new abberations, as per Tragic's response above.  You can find more info about the event in [the patch notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/remnantgame/comments/17gzz3a/remnant_ii_patch_notes_393347/).

> and how do you we start it? Just roll an adventure?

Basically yes; though it should also work in campaign.  That said, the event is active during the above dates; you don't need to explicitly "start" the event.

> Also I keep seeing “corrupted shards” as being a resource needed, these wouldn’t happen to be the same ones that we’ve been collecting this whole time?

No, its a new crafting material obtained from the new aberration spawns.  Corrupted Luminite is for mutators; Corrupted Shards are for the corrupted weapons.
                I apologize, but I don't quite understand what you mean by high intensity tiles
                    Basically, tiles where elites would have spawned. They will have a chance to spawn elites (non-event). During event, they will spawn 100% of the time (YIKES!).
                        Ive had multiple elite spawns today, no abberations yet. On veteran adventure. From your wording I understand it as either elites always spawn on high intensity tiles, and a % of thos should be abberations. So far it seems fairly low spawnrate
Brad already got them all.
Merciless is sooo disappointing.

I run it because it bleeds, I like DoT's, and have a whole setup for doing DoT damage. Bleed getting removed from it might up the flat DPS of the weapon, but completely destroys the flavor of it.

Don't get me wrong, I have every item in the game, and I will collect the crystals for these and get the weapons once you can replace the original, but I am not particularly excited about them, mostly because Merciless is just so... bland now.
Are these identical to the original versions, just with a new skin?
    Check the descriptions and mods. Corrupted Meridian, for example, straight up base fires rockets now instead of the grenades.
        Oh didn't notice those. Sweet!
        I thought it was describing the mod... WOO HOO MORE RED NECK EXPLOSION TIME. 

really, would any red neck turn down the chance for explosions? I know I wouldn't I'm only half xD

But what does the mod do? 

Also can you explain the event? I don't use Twitter
        Is that what Deadpoint is? Or does it simply exist to prevent you from having a weapon mod slot lol which is quite reasonable considering the weapon. Also, does this mean that you no longer have Meridian if you corrupted it or can you get another copy from another run to have both?
        The mod already fired rockets? Huh?
            The mod is now a cluster grenade. It fires rockets for its **base fire** now, and you can charge it up to fire up to three at once.
                Oh, you mean they Swapped the fire modes basically.
    They differ significantly. Completely different mods from original and even shooting mode is different. For example, Merciless from full-auto changes to some kind of burst rifle with 3 bullet mag.
Question if anyone knows. It looks like to buy the new variant weapons it costs 10 corrupted shards and the original weapon itself... does that mean if you buy the new corrupted weapon you will have to re-get the original version or can you hot swap between the types?
So this is why I have an update waiting. How do I get these?
I haven’t got on today yet, what are these, how do I get them?
Can you only get one?

If not, why not all of them?
So let me get this straight. The event ends on the 31st and for some reason us idiots that have a PS 5 don’t have this yet? I don’t understand because my PS5 did an entire update and my man Dwell just has the same 5 items. Well I guess I’m gunna have to play the game on the harder difficulties since I won’t be able to do this event. I’m so happy that this game has all the good weapons behind the difficulties that are basically impossible for people that just want to enjoy the game. I really liked this game but like bro, this is why I go back to Remnant 1 all the time because it’s just too much to deal with.

I was already pissed about this being a limited time event for the guaranteed drops on any difficulty but now on the Ps 5 there’s even less time to do it. Like ok Gunfire I get it, you don’t want any casual gamers to play this game. It’s cool.
    The PS5 patch came out before the event went live for all consoles and PC.
should i start new adventure to participate in this event?
Can someone explain what these weapons are how you get them? Haven't played the game in a while
Meh,I'll still try to get them(these are the only corrupted weapons?)
Is this real? If so then rune gun.
Apologies if this is a dumbass question, someone what of the loop. Are all these currently earnable on ps5 or are we still a few weeks behind pc?
I haven’t heard of any event? What is it?
    Check out the patch notes
For sure, Meridian. Then the rest.
I just got my first corrupted shard in Yaesha. I thought it won't be until tomorrow.
Meridian? 👀
that meridian and merciless look good
How unique are these to the event? Are these limited specifically to this event? I don't know If its even feasible for me to get back into remnant 2 this weekend but the traits look very fun. Honestly kind of sick of limited time stuff.
    They are permanent additions to the game. The new aberrations have a chance to replace an elite mob that scales with the difficulty of the world. The event makes it so that a new aberration will always replace an elite. At least that's my understanding of how they spawn.
Wait I'm out of the loop here admittedly, what's this event going on in the video game and how does one obtain these?
Is this event permanent or only for Halloween?
    Only for halloween
The corrupted aphelion actually looks useful with the three shots.
Deceit and Rune Pistol were up on my clippy clop when I was in the game just a bit ago.
What event rewards are there? I can't find any information about them anywhere. 🤔
I already love the Aphelion, and this sounds like an even cooler version, so definitely starting with that one
What’s in the new update ? And event? Can we get these guns outside of the event timeframe? When does it end?
what event whats going on :Cry
corrupted merciless looks god tier for the bleed build, the old mod is kinda useless for that thing, i never use it, so i'm super hype for that corrupted version
    The corrupted version doesn't apply any bleeds
        Nvm, i see the ammo count now, well im a bit annoyed but havent seen a corrupted one at all
            There are at least 2 vids demoing all 5 weapons. The dummies do not appear to bleed but there is a graphical effect when the bleed kicks in. There is no such effect and one of the YTers even says so. You can find his post with a link to his vid here. Not here here but a thread from a few hours ago. Last but not least the description doesn't mention any bleeding at all.
                the dummies dont bleed with normal merciless is the thing, so unless he shot a normal enemy. its impossible to tell, i'm 7/10 shards atm, i'll update this when i have it
                    Here's yet another [video](https://youtu.be/EaoZ4WOofLk?si=7_INWMGTah5m5tuG&t=383) stating that the Corrupted Merciless doesn't bleed.
                        Yeah i think your wasting your time now dude, i've got it in game myself, its crap overall unless weakpoint is available 100%. i've got most of the corrupted weapons at this stage. just missing aphelion
Sooo what is special about the new Meridian mod, then??
Aphelion. That's going to be the nicest way for an easy fire DoT affliction on a long gun slot imma get for awhile. And, bonus, I like physical shal'hala fight so I'll get my replacement pretty soon lol
huh
is this event a time limited thing, or is it here to stay?
    The event runs from Oct 27th to Oct 31st
How do I get the corrupted shards
So to be clear! The update is NOT FUNCTIONAL ON CONSOLES???? I HAVE NOT GOTTEN A Spawn YET.
All of um!
Hey i got a request for all you apocalypse player........ Can one of you guys help me get world edge, i barley bet him on vet difficulty. If not its cool thanks anyway.
I haven't played since launch when I beat game 3 times in a row, what's all this about?
Only one per world?
All of them.

I just don't have all of them yet...
Will I be able to collect the shards after the event to make the corrupted weapons
So...outside event will be possible get those weapons, right?


To buy those weapons need something else or just those shards?
    Need the regular version.
        ouch...rune pistol will be a pain to get another....

&#x200B;

hoping that works find the quest line/spawn and before talk with npc...get corrupted version and them buy again.
            You can trade them to Dwell to get the original and vice versa so long as you have a simulacrum
    Yes, but much harder due to the lowered span rate
Old aberrations also will drop those corrupted shards?
    doesn't seem to be the case. I killed a ton of them today and none of them dropped them.

I got one from a new one, which just decided to spawn during a boss battle with the sewers blob LOL
        during boss battle with king whatever slime????

&#x200B;

interesting...
            yeah. That battle was weird in all possible ways. First the boss health frame was invisible, I couldn't see my damage numbers, then a horde of enemies spawned inside the boss room, followed by the new corrupted enemy.
        Do they only drop on nightmare?
Do the aberration spawns and/or drops increase with difficulty?
    Same question!
I thought the event started tomorrow
    That's what I thought, but I already got a corrupted shard today. Maybe the increased spawn rate doesn't start until tomorrow.
thank you i was so worried about that i would have been so pissed if they only gave us 3 days to get this
They can also spawn in pre-patch campaigns and adventures so you don't have to reset, only need to explore unexplored parts if there are such. Got 2 to spawn in 2 hours by just playing in an old adventure mode.
mmh but only 3 sec, 1 charge,  and need to reactivate on the right spot?
    Reactivating it will just cause it to stop traveling and stay in place hitting an enemy multiple times if you stop it on the boss, extending the weakpoint timer for up to the 3 seconds it stays there from the looks of things. Plus it fires as soon as you hit the power button, so no more activating it, then meleeing, then shooting. Seems like it'll be less awkward to use.
> so it would be funny if I could get the corrupted version before it.

Don't worry, you won't.

For the fact that corrupted version costs 10 new shards PLUS original weapon itself. Yep, that's the price.

Hope weapon upgrades transfer to corrupted wepon.
    Ok that's kind of an issue, can you even get a second version of the weapon if you have the original one?
        Someone tested already and answered all questions here: https://www.reddit.com/r/remnantgame/comments/17hal7i/new_corrupted_weapons_a_guide/

TLDR: currently you can't recraft original weapon after trading it in (can only revert corrupted to normal) but devs confirmed it's a bug and you will be able to recraft original as usual.
            I can't even fathom how they gathered 10 fragments, i was playing last night and a whole losomn run gave a huge sum of one corrupted enemy, that was mandatory in the asylum and droped no fragments, so yeah.
                you can dupe them.
                    How?
                        at cass from another player. you can find it on youtube.
        Yes, and no

There's one you have to give up to get another weapon (can't recall off the top of my head) and once you give it up you can get it again 

If you mean "can I have 2" however, the answer is no
    What? You have to sacrifice the original weapon?
        Yes. But you will be able to recraft it again if you wish (after killing that boss again).
    have heard they do transfer the upgrade.
You can grind for all of them. The event only has an increased chance for the new material needed. 

C.Meridian will def me my first pick too!
    Do you know if the material is capped? Also the abberatiosn drop from every difficulty?
        I just killed one on Apocalypse, only one shard dropped.
            I just completed a normal adventure mode and didn't see one.  
How does it spawn in, do you just randomly come across some dude you've never seen before?
                Spawned in Terminus Horizon in N'Erud. Just while I was moving from one dungeon to the next.
                I had spent a bit of time running around. Stopped off to grab the Override Pin, got lost looking for the hook around to the next dungeon. 

It was a waller and it spawned while I was fighting some trash adds. Nothing else special.
        Patch notes say they spawn in all modes and all difficulties and are not limited.
        cap seems to be 10. need to buy a weapon before you can get more.
Ahem... I can officially say...  
  
  
Maybe.
    Eyes up guard….erm traveler?
        The traveler has eyes now?? Hope they're googly.
    Oh flip he responded! I haven’t actually played the second game yet, I’m still on the first and survival mode is kicking my butt but it’s so fun!! Thank you guys for making a great game, I can’t wait to get into the second! Also I gotta ask could you guys add a cat ear head piece no particular reason 😹
Yes it is definitely based off the destiny snipers like the black hammer
It feels like a WotW reference. I wouldn't discount it, as there's also the "ghost shell" mutator, which definitely feels like a destiny reference
And merciless is also a destiny2 exotic fusion rifle
Whisper of the Worm was like... the best thing I did in Destiny 2. Murder some bosses in the open world to open a secret portal, then descend down a staggeringly massive dungeon with lots of maze-like passages and red herring dead ends. Such a cool experience.
    Going to be way more viable for sustain DPS with the sniper buff coming up
        I don't really mean the gun itself so much as the process to unlock it. It was such a cool adventure. Gun is pretty cool too though...
            Oh for sure. Hopefully now that they've got exotic mission weekly rotators they bring back whisper and outbreak's quests
                I wouldn't know. I basically lost all interest in destiny when they discontinued three of the expansions I bought.
All special weapons will get their shine. I'm also going to be looking into base models to increase effectiveness on weapons that may have fallen behind!
    I like the *IDEA* of savior, but having a Time-sensitive mod for a weapon you need to manually hold down and release at the optimal time for efficient damage seems counterintuitive and builds up unnecessary stress.
        Saviour is just a bow with a mag and looks like a gun :)
Check with your old pal Dwell, after patching your game that is.
    Mine’s patched and they still aren’t up yet? I know the event is tomorrow
        If your on ps5 its bugged right now
            That explains why I couldn't find them, hope it gets patched soon
            Claaaaasssic
    Ty
I just rerolled a new N'erud (best world!) to see if I find anything.
    The event starts tomorrow...
        I just found the first random Aberration. In the first world of N'erud. It was amazing haha.
            Apparently the Aberrations are a permanent addition, the event is just an increased spawn rate for a few days.
            Ah, so they are random spawns?
                Yes. I fought a copy of myself. Didn't expect that!
                    Whoa, and this was out in the overworld and not in a dungeon?
                        Overworld indeed. Abyssal Rift. Didn't encounter any in a dungeon so far.
they just spawn in completely random.
The mods are different
    and at least for deceit the stats are a bit different too. lower dmg but higher RPS, 5% less critchance, more max ammo.. (tbh, its the only one i compared)
        Merciless is also different.

3 round mag vs 50;
90 damage vs 13;
1.3 rps vs 8.6.

The mod is very different too.
The mods are different, I'm pretty sure it's character based since you trade the base weapon for them, and they're permanently in the game. The event is just the abberations that drop the shards you need have a higher chance of appearing.
Original guns are a crafting material to make the new gun. You can convert back with a simulacrum, or you can get both over time.
    Update to this. There MAY be a bug preventing you from crafting the original if you converted over. That's not intentional. You should be able to obtain both at once. Looking into it.
    If I convert one to the corrupted version, can i just re-roll adventure to get the original?
        Yes. You can obtain both.
            But is the aberrations limited per world? Like, only 1 in an aventure?
    I have 3/5 of these original version weapons fully upgraded at +10. Will the corrupted weapons be fully maxed as well if I trade the originals or will I lose the Simulacrums I invested in the originals?
        They should remain upgraded when converted to corrupted. You can convert back and maintain the level with simulacrum as well.
            That's awesome! Tysm for the quick reply :)
Dev comment somewhere in this thread said that outside of the event, they should spawn more frequently on higher difficulties.
You’re insane
    Maybe. I do like that game and made a lot of friends playing it :) one day it'll have crossplay. My favorite build was a melee lifesteal (which seems to be improved now  w the buffs to rings and amulets for health) for a full apocalypse run. Super satisfying to have full confidence in builds in hardcore too
        I’ve never felt that from this game. Everything feels like a struggle. I played 2 minutes on apocalypse and said nope. I mean even the update didn’t load all the way so idk what everyone is even talking about.
            Yeah I felt that way a little when I first started. I never played from the ashes, or a Dark Souls or similar game before. 

What I learned was that you have to plan for enemies and hazards and traps. And that neutral dodge, and dodge in general is an attack. That all enemies can be countered. And that this was the actual game: wait for their attack and then punish the attacker or just move past them.

Remnant (and all the other titles mentioned) punishes players who charge ahead and try to mow and slaughter their way through by force.

Eventually a build will carry you through a lot, but - you can always find your self overwhelmed and stun locked no matter how strong you get. Meaning you need to be adaptable in your build as much as your approach too.

In some ways the game can be "annoying" vs "challenging". And Gunfire is the type of gaming company I'd love to work with to help improve user experience and interfaces, inventory, "QoL", etc. AKA "why is N'eruds poison gas so poorly indicating its volume and boundaries?" But also help them improve how they communicate in game and in public about how and why the game works like it does, without literally holding your hand too much.

I will say that Remnant 2, and Dark Souls, Elden Ring and I'm currently lurking in Lords of the Fallen - all take me back to 1980s early arcade game stakes: that "Game Over" was your teacher.

Something that I used to look forward to as a challenge: the "impossible" to beat games. But you just knew there was a secret, that it was and is possible. You'd see some random person just crushing a game and say "I get it now" or in my case "you can jump through them here at this moment?!?" And it would open up your mind to a new concept. Waiting for the boss to slam their giant hands on you and then dodging into it, instead of panic rolling and never escaping, if you will.

It's like Tron, the movie - that the game designers are using penalty as boundary, and visual and audio as cue. That they want you to persevere. But they know if they just tell you all the secrets it is "game over". But there is magic in the machine if you realize that you can move between the pixels.
            Are you on playstation ?
Because that update didn't go out.

For whatever reason Gunfire and Gearbox have major struggles with their console publishing. They've made a ton of excuses and in some ways I kind of feel like it makes a great case as to why consoles shouldn't exist, but affordable PCs in console price ranges specifically to game on - should.

But yes, if you're on playstation we are once again not getting an update, even though it was promoted as ready. They certainly had no issues taking money from console and pc player alike at the same time, but the updates and fixes are priority to pc and the console gets what it gets, if and when it gets it.

As much as I've enjoyed the game - it seems all games are now "pay to play our buggy beta!" and they will eventually in 1 - 10 years make some of the fixes they should have made before the game was ever released. Lulz
                Yea this shit is getting ridiculous. I literally had an update for remnant 2, came on here to see what was up, got hyped, was confused why it didn’t appear for me in the game, then I read one of the devs on the game said they had issues with PlayStation and it should be fixed. This shit is absolutely dumb as fuck and is the exact reason why I stopped buying video games.

Idk how companies reasoned it in their heads that they can charge $30 more for a game that’s only 60% finished. Every fucking major release has been complete trash. Meanwhile all the smaller companies are actually making fully capable games with minimal issues. It’s an embarrassment.
                    Yeah I think as humans go, we've gotten continually more selfish and manipulative. And it creates a very strong subconscious that it is "ok" to be bad to people because "it's business". 

It is really sad that these enormous trillion dollar brands like Apple, Adobe or Unreal, and let's not forget Unity (no irony in their name) all raising their prices in spite of their record profits. There is so much money and none of it is shared. It's just taken. And what is given is the minimum viable product.
                        And then these companies have the audacity to talk about how they’re working the issue out in the game. Bro if you released a buggy game 15 years ago, nobody would’ve bought it and if they fixed it, they would fix EVERYTHING IN ONE UPDATE. 

This whole idiocy of paying $70 for a half assed game that the company is going to spend 20 updates fixing is insane to me. And you have people that sympathise with these companies like they don’t have the money to get shit done.
I feel the same; the only vanilla content I'm missing are:

- HC Survivor/Veteran clear rewards
- Window Hollow Circlet
- Band Band
- Resonance Trait

This update does unfortunately mean I'll need to grind out more upgrade materials...but I guess that's not the worst thing.  Unfortunate the original-weapons are not currently recraftable; but that'll get fixed eventually.
    If you're on psn I'd gladly run through hc vet w you.
        Sadly I'm on PC.
            Hit up the remnant discord. Lots of super nice people there who'd love to do runs.
                I've got a couple of friends that I've been running HC with, along with solo attempts, but I appreciate the suggestion.
    MrSeanG on psn if so. Cheers!
They are new abberations and a new item drop.  It's not the same as the upgrade materials we already have.
    we already have a list with possible locations/names?
        atm it looks like they are totally random spawns on any map.
            So far...no corrupted aberrations...

Hoping find one before nightweaver to start jump other people sessions to farm more, get corrupted nightfall, beat her and craft nightfall again


Will be pain get corrupted rune pistol


Edit: nvm... its deceipt and not nightfall who get corrupted version lol, i can finish this adventure and rerun :)
Yes. Once event is over, higher difficulties are more likely to spawn the world-aberrations.
    Does this mean during the event, all difficulties have the same chance of spawning?
        During event, 100% chance for a world aberration to spawn on high-intensity tiles.
            When is the event though? and how do you we start it? Just roll an adventure? Also I keep seeing “corrupted shards” as being a resource needed, these wouldn’t happen to be the same ones that we’ve been collecting this whole time?
                > When is the event though?

The event is 2023-10-27 to 2023-10-3, which will see increase spawn rates of the new abberations, as per Tragic's response above.  You can find more info about the event in [the patch notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/remnantgame/comments/17gzz3a/remnant_ii_patch_notes_393347/).

> and how do you we start it? Just roll an adventure?

Basically yes; though it should also work in campaign.  That said, the event is active during the above dates; you don't need to explicitly "start" the event.

> Also I keep seeing “corrupted shards” as being a resource needed, these wouldn’t happen to be the same ones that we’ve been collecting this whole time?

No, its a new crafting material obtained from the new aberration spawns.  Corrupted Luminite is for mutators; Corrupted Shards are for the corrupted weapons.
            I apologize, but I don't quite understand what you mean by high intensity tiles
                Basically, tiles where elites would have spawned. They will have a chance to spawn elites (non-event). During event, they will spawn 100% of the time (YIKES!).
                    Ive had multiple elite spawns today, no abberations yet. On veteran adventure. From your wording I understand it as either elites always spawn on high intensity tiles, and a % of thos should be abberations. So far it seems fairly low spawnrate
Check the descriptions and mods. Corrupted Meridian, for example, straight up base fires rockets now instead of the grenades.
    Oh didn't notice those. Sweet!
    I thought it was describing the mod... WOO HOO MORE RED NECK EXPLOSION TIME. 

really, would any red neck turn down the chance for explosions? I know I wouldn't I'm only half xD

But what does the mod do? 

Also can you explain the event? I don't use Twitter
    Is that what Deadpoint is? Or does it simply exist to prevent you from having a weapon mod slot lol which is quite reasonable considering the weapon. Also, does this mean that you no longer have Meridian if you corrupted it or can you get another copy from another run to have both?
    The mod already fired rockets? Huh?
        The mod is now a cluster grenade. It fires rockets for its **base fire** now, and you can charge it up to fire up to three at once.
            Oh, you mean they Swapped the fire modes basically.
They differ significantly. Completely different mods from original and even shooting mode is different. For example, Merciless from full-auto changes to some kind of burst rifle with 3 bullet mag.
The PS5 patch came out before the event went live for all consoles and PC.
Check out the patch notes
They are permanent additions to the game. The new aberrations have a chance to replace an elite mob that scales with the difficulty of the world. The event makes it so that a new aberration will always replace an elite. At least that's my understanding of how they spawn.
Only for halloween
The corrupted version doesn't apply any bleeds
    Nvm, i see the ammo count now, well im a bit annoyed but havent seen a corrupted one at all
        There are at least 2 vids demoing all 5 weapons. The dummies do not appear to bleed but there is a graphical effect when the bleed kicks in. There is no such effect and one of the YTers even says so. You can find his post with a link to his vid here. Not here here but a thread from a few hours ago. Last but not least the description doesn't mention any bleeding at all.
            the dummies dont bleed with normal merciless is the thing, so unless he shot a normal enemy. its impossible to tell, i'm 7/10 shards atm, i'll update this when i have it
                Here's yet another [video](https://youtu.be/EaoZ4WOofLk?si=7_INWMGTah5m5tuG&t=383) stating that the Corrupted Merciless doesn't bleed.
                    Yeah i think your wasting your time now dude, i've got it in game myself, its crap overall unless weakpoint is available 100%. i've got most of the corrupted weapons at this stage. just missing aphelion
The event runs from Oct 27th to Oct 31st
Need the regular version.
    ouch...rune pistol will be a pain to get another....

&#x200B;

hoping that works find the quest line/spawn and before talk with npc...get corrupted version and them buy again.
        You can trade them to Dwell to get the original and vice versa so long as you have a simulacrum
Yes, but much harder due to the lowered span rate
doesn't seem to be the case. I killed a ton of them today and none of them dropped them.

I got one from a new one, which just decided to spawn during a boss battle with the sewers blob LOL
    during boss battle with king whatever slime????

        yeah. That battle was weird in all possible ways. First the boss health frame was invisible, I couldn't see my damage numbers, then a horde of enemies spawned inside the boss room, followed by the new corrupted enemy.

And Gunfire is the type of gaming company I'd love to work with to help improve user experience and interfaces, inventory, "QoL", etc. AKA "why is N'eruds poison gas so poorly indicating its volume and boundaries?" But also help them improve how they communicate in game and in public about how and why the game works like it does, without literally holding your hand too much.

I will say that Remnant 2, and Dark Souls, Elden Ring and I'm currently lurking in Lords of the Fallen - all take me back to 1980s early arcade game stakes: that "Game Over" was your teacher.

Something that I used to look forward to as a challenge: the "impossible" to beat games. But you just knew there was a secret, that it was and is possible. You'd see some random person just crushing a game and say "I get it now" or in my case "you can jump through them here at this moment?!?" And it would open up your mind to a new concept. Waiting for the boss to slam their giant hands on you and then dodging into it, instead of panic rolling and never escaping, if you will.

It's like Tron, the movie - that the game designers are using penalty as boundary, and visual and audio as cue. That they want you to persevere. But they know if they just tell you all the secrets it is "game over". But there is magic in the machine if you realize that you can move between the pixels.
        Are you on playstation ?
Because that update didn't go out.

For whatever reason Gunfire and Gearbox have major struggles with their console publishing. They've made a ton of excuses and in some ways I kind of feel like it makes a great case as to why consoles shouldn't exist, but affordable PCs in console price ranges specifically to game on - should.

But yes, if you're on playstation we are once again not getting an update, even though it was promoted as ready. They certainly had no issues taking money from console and pc player alike at the same time, but the updates and fixes are priority to pc and the console gets what it gets, if and when it gets it.

As much as I've enjoyed the game - it seems all games are now "pay to play our buggy beta!" and they will eventually in 1 - 10 years make some of the fixes they should have made before the game was ever released. Lulz
            Yea this shit is getting ridiculous. I literally had an update for remnant 2, came on here to see what was up, got hyped, was confused why it didn’t appear for me in the game, then I read one of the devs on the game said they had issues with PlayStation and it should be fixed. This shit is absolutely dumb as fuck and is the exact reason why I stopped buying video games.

Idk how companies reasoned it in their heads that they can charge $30 more for a game that’s only 60% finished. Every fucking major release has been complete trash. Meanwhile all the smaller companies are actually making fully capable games with minimal issues. It’s an embarrassment.
                Yeah I think as humans go, we've gotten continually more selfish and manipulative. And it creates a very strong subconscious that it is "ok" to be bad to people because "it's business". 

It is really sad that these enormous trillion dollar brands like Apple, Adobe or Unreal, and let's not forget Unity (no irony in their name) all raising their prices in spite of their record profits. There is so much money and none of it is shared. It's just taken. And what is given is the minimum viable product.
                    And then these companies have the audacity to talk about how they’re working the issue out in the game. Bro if you released a buggy game 15 years ago, nobody would’ve bought it and if they fixed it, they would fix EVERYTHING IN ONE UPDATE. 

This whole idiocy of paying $70 for a half assed game that the company is going to spend 20 updates fixing is insane to me. And you have people that sympathise with these companies like they don’t have the money to get shit done.
If you're on psn I'd gladly run through hc vet w you.
    Sadly I'm on PC.
        Hit up the remnant discord. Lots of super nice people there who'd love to do runs.
            I've got a couple of friends that I've been running HC with, along with solo attempts, but I appreciate the suggestion.
MrSeanG on psn if so. Cheers!
we already have a list with possible locations/names?
    atm it looks like they are totally random spawns on any map.
        So far...no corrupted aberrations...

Hoping find one before nightweaver to start jump other people sessions to farm more, get corrupted nightfall, beat her and craft nightfall again


Will be pain get corrupted rune pistol


Edit: nvm... its deceipt and not nightfall who get corrupted version lol, i can finish this adventure and rerun :)
Does this mean during the event, all difficulties have the same chance of spawning?
    During event, 100% chance for a world aberration to spawn on high-intensity tiles.
        When is the event though? and how do you we start it? Just roll an adventure? Also I keep seeing “corrupted shards” as being a resource needed, these wouldn’t happen to be the same ones that we’ve been collecting this whole time?
            > When is the event though?

The event is 2023-10-27 to 2023-10-3, which will see increase spawn rates of the new abberations, as per Tragic's response above.  You can find more info about the event in [the patch notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/remnantgame/comments/17gzz3a/remnant_ii_patch_notes_393347/).

> and how do you we start it? Just roll an adventure?

Basically yes; though it should also work in campaign.  That said, the event is active during the above dates; you don't need to explicitly "start" the event.

> Also I keep seeing “corrupted shards” as being a resource needed, these wouldn’t happen to be the same ones that we’ve been collecting this whole time?

No, its a new crafting material obtained from the new aberration spawns.  Corrupted Luminite is for mutators; Corrupted Shards are for the corrupted weapons.
        I apologize, but I don't quite understand what you mean by high intensity tiles
            Basically, tiles where elites would have spawned. They will have a chance to spawn elites (non-event). During event, they will spawn 100% of the time (YIKES!).
                Ive had multiple elite spawns today, no abberations yet. On veteran adventure. From your wording I understand it as either elites always spawn on high intensity tiles, and a % of thos should be abberations. So far it seems fairly low spawnrate
Oh didn't notice those. Sweet!
I thought it was describing the mod... WOO HOO MORE RED NECK EXPLOSION TIME. 

really, would any red neck turn down the chance for explosions? I know I wouldn't I'm only half xD

But what does the mod do? 

Also can you explain the event? I don't use Twitter
Is that what Deadpoint is? Or does it simply exist to prevent you from having a weapon mod slot lol which is quite reasonable considering the weapon. Also, does this mean that you no longer have Meridian if you corrupted it or can you get another copy from another run to have both?
The mod already fired rockets? Huh?
    The mod is now a cluster grenade. It fires rockets for its **base fire** now, and you can charge it up to fire up to three at once.
        Oh, you mean they Swapped the fire modes basically.
Nvm, i see the ammo count now, well im a bit annoyed but havent seen a corrupted one at all
    There are at least 2 vids demoing all 5 weapons. The dummies do not appear to bleed but there is a graphical effect when the bleed kicks in. There is no such effect and one of the YTers even says so. You can find his post with a link to his vid here. Not here here but a thread from a few hours ago. Last but not least the description doesn't mention any bleeding at all.
        the dummies dont bleed with normal merciless is the thing, so unless he shot a normal enemy. its impossible to tell, i'm 7/10 shards atm, i'll update this when i have it
            Here's yet another [video](https://youtu.be/EaoZ4WOofLk?si=7_INWMGTah5m5tuG&t=383) stating that the Corrupted Merciless doesn't bleed.
                Yeah i think your wasting your time now dude, i've got it in game myself, its crap overall unless weakpoint is available 100%. i've got most of the corrupted weapons at this stage. just missing aphelion
ouch...rune pistol will be a pain to get another....

&#x200B;

hoping that works find the quest line/spawn and before talk with npc...get corrupted version and them buy again.
    You can trade them to Dwell to get the original and vice versa so long as you have a simulacrum
during boss battle with king whatever slime????

&#x200B;

interesting...
    yeah. That battle was weird in all possible ways. First the boss health frame was invisible, I couldn't see my damage numbers, then a horde of enemies spawned inside the boss room, followed by the new corrupted enemy.
Do they only drop on nightmare?
Someone tested already and answered all questions here: https://www.reddit.com/r/remnantgame/comments/17hal7i/new_corrupted_weapons_a_guide/

TLDR: currently you can't recraft original weapon after trading it in (can only revert corrupted to normal) but devs confirmed it's a bug and you will be able to recraft original as usual.
    I can't even fathom how they gathered 10 fragments, i was playing last night and a whole losomn run gave a huge sum of one corrupted enemy, that was mandatory in the asylum and droped no fragments, so yeah.
        you can dupe them.
            How?
                at cass from another player. you can find it on youtube.
Yes, and no

There's one you have to give up to get another weapon (can't recall off the top of my head) and once you give it up you can get it again 

If you mean "can I have 2" however, the answer is no
Yes. But you will be able to recraft it again if you wish (after killing that boss again).
I just killed one on Apocalypse, only one shard dropped.
    I just completed a normal adventure mode and didn't see one.  
How does it spawn in, do you just randomly come across some dude you've never seen before?
        Spawned in Terminus Horizon in N'Erud. Just while I was moving from one dungeon to the next.
        I had spent a bit of time running around. Stopped off to grab the Override Pin, got lost looking for the hook around to the next dungeon. 

It was a waller and it spawned while I was fighting some trash adds. Nothing else special.
Patch notes say they spawn in all modes and all difficulties and are not limited.
cap seems to be 10. need to buy a weapon before you can get more.
The traveler has eyes now?? Hope they're googly.
I don't really mean the gun itself so much as the process to unlock it. It was such a cool adventure. Gun is pretty cool too though...
    Oh for sure. Hopefully now that they've got exotic mission weekly rotators they bring back whisper and outbreak's quests
        I wouldn't know. I basically lost all interest in destiny when they discontinued three of the expansions I bought.
Saviour is just a bow with a mag and looks like a gun :)
If your on ps5 its bugged right now
    That explains why I couldn't find them, hope it gets patched soon
    Claaaaasssic
I just found the first random Aberration. In the first world of N'erud. It was amazing haha.
    Apparently the Aberrations are a permanent addition, the event is just an increased spawn rate for a few days.
    Ah, so they are random spawns?
        Yes. I fought a copy of myself. Didn't expect that!
            Whoa, and this was out in the overworld and not in a dungeon?
                Overworld indeed. Abyssal Rift. Didn't encounter any in a dungeon so far.
Merciless is also different.

3 round mag vs 50;
90 damage vs 13;
1.3 rps vs 8.6.

The mod is very different too.
Yes. You can obtain both.
    But is the aberrations limited per world? Like, only 1 in an aventure?
They should remain upgraded when converted to corrupted. You can convert back and maintain the level with simulacrum as well.
    That's awesome! Tysm for the quick reply :)
I’ve never felt that from this game. Everything feels like a struggle. I played 2 minutes on apocalypse and said nope. I mean even the update didn’t load all the way so idk what everyone is even talking about.
    Yeah I felt that way a little when I first started. I never played from the ashes, or a Dark Souls or similar game before. 

What I learned was that you have to plan for enemies and hazards and traps. And that neutral dodge, and dodge in general is an attack. That all enemies can be countered. And that this was the actual game: wait for their attack and then punish the attacker or just move past them.

Remnant (and all the other titles mentioned) punishes players who charge ahead and try to mow and slaughter their way through by force.

Eventually a build will carry you through a lot, but - you can always find your self overwhelmed and stun locked no matter how strong you get. Meaning you need to be adaptable in your build as much as your approach too.

During event, 100% chance for a world aberration to spawn on high-intensity tiles.
    When is the event though? and how do you we start it? Just roll an adventure? Also I keep seeing “corrupted shards” as being a resource needed, these wouldn’t happen to be the same ones that we’ve been collecting this whole time?

I literally had an update for remnant 2, came on here to see what was up, got hyped, was confused why it didn’t appear for me in the game, then I read one of the devs on the game said they had issues with PlayStation and it should be fixed. This shit is absolutely dumb as fuck and is the exact reason why I stopped buying video games.

Idk how companies reasoned it in their heads that they can charge $30 more for a game that’s only 60% finished. Every fucking major release has been complete trash. Meanwhile all the smaller companies are actually making fully capable games with minimal issues. It’s an embarrassment.
    Yeah I think as humans go, we've gotten continually more selfish and manipulative. And it creates a very strong subconscious that it is "ok" to be bad to people because "it's business". 

It is really sad that these enormous trillion dollar brands like Apple, Adobe or Unreal, and let's not forget Unity (no irony in their name) all raising their prices in spite of their record profits. There is so much money and none of it is shared. It's just taken. And what is given is the minimum viable product.
        And then these companies have the audacity to talk about how they’re working the issue out in the game. Bro if you released a buggy game 15 years ago, nobody would’ve bought it and if they fixed it, they would fix EVERYTHING IN ONE UPDATE. 

This whole idiocy of paying $70 for a half assed game that the company is going to spend 20 updates fixing is insane to me. And you have people that sympathise with these companies like they don’t have the money to get shit done.
I've got a couple of friends that I've been running HC with, along with solo attempts, but I appreciate the suggestion.
> When is the event though?

The event is 2023-10-27 to 2023-10-3, which will see increase spawn rates of the new abberations, as per Tragic's response above.  You can find more info about the event in [the patch notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/remnantgame/comments/17gzz3a/remnant_ii_patch_notes_393347/).

> and how do you we start it? Just roll an adventure?

Basically yes; though it should also work in campaign.  That said, the event is active during the above dates; you don't need to explicitly "start" the event.

> Also I keep seeing “corrupted shards” as being a resource needed, these wouldn’t happen to be the same ones that we’ve been collecting this whole time?

No, its a new crafting material obtained from the new aberration spawns.  Corrupted Luminite is for mutators; Corrupted Shards are for the corrupted weapons.
Basically, tiles where elites would have spawned. They will have a chance to spawn elites (non-event). During event, they will spawn 100% of the time (YIKES!).
    Ive had multiple elite spawns today, no abberations yet. On veteran adventure. From your wording I understand it as either elites always spawn on high intensity tiles, and a % of thos should be abberations. So far it seems fairly low spawnrate
Here's yet another [video](https://youtu.be/EaoZ4WOofLk?si=7_INWMGTah5m5tuG&t=383) stating that the Corrupted Merciless doesn't bleed.
    Yeah i think your wasting your time now dude, i've got it in game myself, its crap overall unless weakpoint is available 100%. i've got most of the corrupted weapons at this stage. just missing aphelion
How?
    at cass from another player. you can find it on youtube.
Whoa, and this was out in the overworld and not in a dungeon?
