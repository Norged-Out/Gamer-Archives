[[To find base game trinkets in the one-shot DLC is frustrating]]


Just saying. I own like 97% of the trinkets prior to DLC 2 so far bc I grinded the biomes countless times (PS5 so no save analyzer). The reasoning behind the one-shot adventures is that players can get all the new dungeons and injectable events. Why is this different for random world drops?

A randomized trinket pool without duplicate protection is a questionable design choice in my opinion considering the huge amount of (world drop) trinkets this game has now. At this point I feel that it doesnt make me want to play the game more but rather to just stop after finishing the DLC bc the odds to find the random drops Im missing are quite low.


Me and my friend grinded em together but separate. Ran move speed builds/ leveling unleveled archetypes. Each time we got a purple item we’d call out the name and both check if we had it/ would join the other if we didn’t. We got a ton of new items pretty fast, and some we didn’t have from prior. (I was missing a few, he was missing decent amount but we had most) I agree dupe protection would be nice but then again, rerolling for shit feels like part of the game to me at this point
    This is a very good idea. 
A couple for friends and I ping each other on discord before we pick up some things to confirm we all have it.
I hate random world drops, I still miss some from the first DLC.

Agree with your idea, making them guaranteed in the one-shot would be great
Duplicate protection would be a great idea!

I second implementing this in future to make random drops less frustrating to farm.
    If duplicate protection is too straightforward for Gunfire (or too “easy”) duplicate trinkets could give you a new type of ressource which you then could turn in at Dwell for a random missing (world drop) trinket…

tbh i’m more pissed that i am locked out of searing wounds and the trinity crossbow due to glitches i haven’t even seen addressed by the devs so..
    If you happen to be on xbox, i can invite you to snag the crossbow.
        i’m on ps5 but it’s cross play now! i’m around rn if you are i appreciate it fs
            I totally forgot about crossplay since i usually play solo ngl. How do you invite crossplay players or is it more of a random chance thing?
                i think for ps5 and xbox you need to link an epic account if you have one
                    Just made one, whats your username on there so i can search for ya?

To be honest, they say it is “random” but I don’t think that is accurate. I did a fresh campaign to get the new traits and I got some new trinkets from some of the first drops I saw. Prior to DLC 2 launch, I had every single item in the game. Statistically it doesn’t make sense that I would get the new trinkets so easily. 

In my opinion there’s some kind of code that makes unlooted trinkets more likely to drop even if there’s still some chance that duplicates spawn in game. 

I would just spawn adventures in each world on easy mode, equip a movement speed build and just blitz through everything looking for corpse drops. I guarantee you’ll get everything within a few runs of each zone.
    I’ve been running Marrow Parish adventure to get the Leaking Gemstone, 3 days and multiple hours of runs later and I STILL haven’t seen it.
    I cannot say, I did the same thing after last DLC and also went for Tranquil Heart and Anguish but I didnt think I have the desire to do it again.
Concerning the skewed drop rate: at first I had also the feeling that the game priorizes missing trinkets but after a longer tine none of them dropped anymore. Must be a thing of small sample size and RNG.
Yea……I’m on day 4 of trying to get the Leaking Gemstone (a dlc ring) from Morrow Parish, the thing just won’t spawn for me, and its genuinely starting to get annoying, because it is literally the only ring I need before I have every dlc item in the game, and we’re talking multiple runs and this thing, a SINGULAR ring never popping up, it’s ridiculous.


Because there are so many other rings/amulets that can possibly spawn, it makes it almost impossible to find the thing you’re looking for.
This is a very good idea.
