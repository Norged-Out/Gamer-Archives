[[What’s the deal with designing bosses who can’t be melee’d]]


It’s my only real complaint about the game. Seems completely silly to design bosses that can’t be melee’d when there is the possibility of players focusing their entire build into it. And yeh, I get it, ranged is better, but if you make numerous items, classes, ways to focus into a melee build, you should design every boss so that even if it’s way harder, they can be damaged by melee weapons. Entire boss fights where melee dmg is basically impossible is such a bad design and it’s pretty baffling. It sends the message of, yeh we designed all this support for melee but we consider it a meme, please don’t actually build toward it.

    As a Engineer and Handler main who has played MH, I need the option to mount my railgun on my dog.

        Fire the dog off your wrist like the lady from Final Fantasy 8.

            reminds me of spoony's let's play of FF8 

&#x200B;

ANAL CANNON
                Ah man, Spoony's glory days. Good memories!
                    I'm just glad people remember him, one of the classic greats.
See him stream still on occasion.
                        Sad that he stopped doing reviews. I still go back to things like Pumpkinhead, all the Ultima's, and his let's plays of SWAT.
                            Aye it is what it is, he saw the best and the worst of those early days of influencers, a real pioneer.
        Honestly I'm surprised the dog can't do something like that given the tactical pupper vest
            Def a missed opportunity to build silly unique synergies
                Hanz get ze Flammenhund
                    Hear me out... 

Archon, gets to put an useable mod on the dog or choose an elemental attunement that is reflected in the dogs appearance and attacks. Unique dog howl can speed up mod cooldowns

Engi, gets to mount heavy weapons on the dog (dog also can now look like darpa mule) or, dog howl acts as partial reload to give HW more charges.

Challenger gets slightly enhanced effects on dog skills, dog wears armor and can wield a melee weapon. Unique bark/skill lets out a stagger effect similar to earthquake. 

Summoner, Dog can take on root appearance and skills. Can root snare enemies.  Unique bark summons a root wisp that deals light damage and counts as an additional summon.

Gunslinger, Dog now looks like a large cattle dog, will retrieve ammo to bring to party members, unique skills can have the dog yeet dynamite over designated enemies for an aoe explosion. DYNA-MUTT

Explorer, Pointer/Bloodhound/Husky.  Doggo now 'points' at nearby chests and secrets.  Can rifle through enemy corpses for additional loot.  Somewhere in each world another simulacrum is buried, follow doggos nose to find it. 

Hunter, Labrador/Catahoula leopard dog,  will also retrieve ammo to bring to the players. Can jump and latch onto designated targets to pin them briefly in the hunters directions, can also rip a new temporary weakpoint onto an enemy limb. 

Medic,  St. bernard, Bouvier. dog carries two additional dragon heart charges and dog cast rez channels are reduced by 20 percent.
                        Yes to all of this. I myself would use hunter, explorer, and engi, maybe even archon
                        This is a really neat idea not even gonna lie
                        This is probably my favorite remnant theory post I've ever seen. I want literally every single one of these, yesterday.
                Dog plus summons, let the rolly Bois ride the doggo
                    Would prefer the big one riding dogo and throwing explosive axes :)
                        Sounds like radhan
                        I feel like that hurt the dogs back

How about doggo rides big one and they both toss axes
                            Nah, the big summon can just master gravity magic if he wants to ride the dog.
                    I'm down for Boggan riders.
                    Where’s the amulet that lets my dog bark out bees, or lasers, or bees that shoot lasers?
                        It's in the backer rooms gotta learn C++ to get it XD
        Really wish I hadn't started as Handler personally. Dog AI is kinda buggy and as mentioned, they can't help with flying bosses, which is kind of pain.
            Ngl. Handler is probably the best starting class other then bruiser. Every class blows at level 1 and those self res heals are clutch.
            I started on nightmare and play solo so the dog has helped out quiet a bit and usually after mastering the boss mechaniks i can get them even if the dog cant help out and the heal and res is always nice. 
I got throught the first 3 worlds and honestly felt like certain mob groups like the floating bots on Nerud are worse than most bosses
        Or just a flying attack dog. We can just watch the dog play for us. Pretty sure that is why we have different builds.  Understand which one works for each boss or level and adjust accordingly. But then I like my build.
            Which would work if classes didn't take ages to grind and scrap was actually available
                Honestly, it doesn't take as long as you'd think if you focus on one at a time, max the trait, and pop a stew. 

Not ideal still, but not horrible
        This becomes a much different sentence if you remove "my railgun"
            Many sentences become entirely different if you change them.
                Blowing my FUCKIN' mind over here.
                    This becomes a very different sentence if you replace "mind" with load.
                        Oh my god I'm flabbergasted, you are a wizard of words!!!
        Jet Force Gemini?
        This would be savage as hell. MAKE IT SO!
        This is much better than the actual post
    Sometimes no even summons dare to agro the boss and remain still at place making player fully speced on summons and pets totally useless.
        I love that reaver has a ranged attack, yet won't do it against flying bosses and instead just stands there the whole time.
            Yep. Love the Reaver, but the AI can be downright brain damaged on boss fights. In the Root Nexus fight, pets will just completely ignore the boss itself. On the Annihilation fight, pets you bring into the fight through the fog gate will spawn in the floor and just sit there until they die.
                Engie sentry also ignores the Root Nexus.
                    I’m okay with sparky saving ammo for the enemies that actually do damage.
                Better yet, during phase 2 of annihilation, the flying summons will bum rush the boss and fall off the edge and die instantly.  Yes, the flying ranged summon... suddenly decides it wants to melee and runs off the edge to die instantly....
            My favorite part in general about the reavers is that they like to fly in point blank to the enemies to use their *ranged* attacks. That's honestly the reason I switched off having summoner as one of my classes, because they kept getting in my way too often. For a ranged summon, they act like they're a melee summon half the time.
            Weird mine was sniping with throwing axes against flying enemies and bosses. Like i was impressed with the tracking as it seems to make shots that I don't think I would be able to make considering, if I was the one aiming the throwing axes.

            You need to have handler as your primary archetype for that to work
                [deleted]
                    The only other thing I can think about is if you gave your dog a command, like attacking an enemy or moving to a particular position. Ive noticed that if you aren't near that enemy/position and get knocked down, the dog doesn't try to rez you until that command wears off. I've accidentally commanded the dog several times while trying to use the skill, so it's an easy mistake to make
                My experience with this is wildly inconsistent. 

I have 23 hours in the game, maybe half that with Handler as my primary. My dog has revived me once and my boyfriend once. In the latter case, the dog was just sitting by me while I was downed and then ran off to revive my boyfriend after he got downed as well.
                    It worked perfectly every time for me, but it has a long-ish cooldown and requires you to have at least one relic charge left.
                    You probably had no relic charge left while your bf had some
                        But I never actually use my Relic for anything but reviving my bf outside of boss fights, and he doesn't get downed enough to eat all my Relics.

I know that would be the cause *sometimes*, and it may have even been the cause in that specific example where my dog revived him instead of me, but in 10+ hours not more than two revives from the dog doesn't check out.
                            If you switched your handler to secondary, it won't work. Also, the dog won't heal for 90 seconds after reviving you or someone else once.
                                I know. My bf doesn't really get downed outside of bosses though, so it shouldn't be on cooldown that often. The only thing I can think of that could be causing a weird interaction is that it might be going on cooldown from the Dog *trying* to revive me, only for it to not get a chance to even start the animation because my bf is running as a Medic and uses the third(?) skill that revives instantly pretty much the second I get downed. Otherwise, I really don't know what's up with the behavior.

I didn't swap Handler to secondary until several hours of play without any more than two instances of it reviving us.
                                    Its working as intended for me tbh so hard to say why it dont work in your case
                            My buddy was having this issue yesterday too. I tried to troubleshoot it with him, but it does seem like there’s a bug.

He had relic charges, dog wasn’t on cool down because he never revived anyone. The Handler was the primary class too. At some point he just started reviving people, but yeah he wasn’t being the best boy there for a good chunk of our playtime
                    Well thats the classic case of the dog having a favorite.
                    It can only be done once every 60 seconds or so. It says this in the ability.

And you need a relic charge
                        Yes, I know.
                    Yea looks like they have to make better priority for reviving teammates with doggy. I have never encountered problems with the dog reviving me or teammates probably because i never use the ping commands on the dog and only ever used the double tap command and hold, i’m guessing when you try and revive a teammate they have too many mobs on top of them?
        Exactly my experience with the last boss. So incredibly frustrating.
    Summoner and handler just feel bad. They don't scale well at all. One day a game is going to have a great minion build that scales to endgame and harder difficulties.
        yeah... summoner flyers and reavers can do well enough in veteran but you have to invest into it a LOT(you're gonna wanna get a good few ranks into rugged and siphoner traits at least + the ring that shares half of your healing to allies) and basically babysit their health

ended up running medic(primary)/summoner for most of my 1st run just to keep them alive reliably and even then i struggled to keep them from dying constantly until finding the good gear, which took some adventure rolling, least it also made me very tanky too(was basically face tanking the final boss cause of the way my relic's healing worked, constant healing and constant free relic uses)

&#x200B;

also sucks that summons dont have a command function like the dog, would be nice to be able to make them focus an enemy or force them to move back to you... and then the dog is just sad tbh, least as a minion, the best thing it offers is the self revive if primary archetype but ideally one should not be dying at all and i dont think it works if the dog is downed and that dog loves being downed, baffles me that one of its skills is an aggro drawing one, that dog has glass bones and paper skin
            popped open from the ashes again and man the skulls from the Beckon mod are so much more aggressive than the summoner Flyers, and their projectiles are at least twice as fast if not faster

&#x200B;

and that dog, annoying as the constant barking was, hits hard as hell, it hits as hard if not harder than the reaver and i dont even have evocation
    Dog is also useless on high difficulties.
        Been fine for me on nightmare
            Im on hard and my dog only does 80 damage a hit. Very Good boy could easily do 300 a bite so he's definitely not as as good
    Yeah the dog us useless against 90%of the enemies
    I find it crazy that people actually want a dog to attack flying enemies... like he's a dog, a 4 legged grounded creature...

While you have a gun

            free revive and ranged revive on your friends is pretty dang good, just beat the game with handler main 100% of the time, during longer boss fights like the last one you can pretty much get an assured 3-4 rezzes off during the phases where you don't have enough time otherwise. the damage skill ain't that shabby either
            There's secondary class for a reason. You don't always need to have handler as primary if you are worried about DPS. The only mayor factor in having handler as primary is the dog reviving you. If you want DPS, use another archetype as primary

Your dog also has increase dmg support buff as well, use that too

I am hunter main and do just fine with my DPS soloing veteran
                [deleted]
                    I'd go unlock the engineer class - really easy to get. Alongside gunslinger, engineer does the almost the same DPS and has the ability to summon turrets
        I agree with this. The dog is 90% support. No way homie is helping with aerial stuff.
        so? he could jump into the air to do a bite attack or something
            ahh yes, let a dog jump 10feet in the air. Definitely a valid response...
                Yes, very strange to think that the dog that magically appears when we equip a whistle and can somehow heal you or make your guns hurt things more by howling could potentially jump high.
                Considering all the magic shit in this game, sure, why not. German shepards can jump about 5-6 feet high in real life. Give them magic dog shoes or some shit
                    Doggie jet boots lmao
                Compared to everything else the dog can do, jumping is not that far fetched.
                I watched my dog fall off a thousand foot tower but then he just appeared behind me
        The dog should shoot lasers from its eyes or mouth
    wish they'd give the dog silly ranged attack at least to use against out of range or flying enemies/bosses

&#x200B;

game is over the top enough to have it fit imo, give it smth like pulling out a knife out of its little doggy vest with its mouth to throw at enemies
    My dog trying to fight the cubes in the labyrinth was pretty entertaining though.
    Yeh. Having the dog and rolly polly summons and getting shit on by flyers made me sadge
    Yeah, the dog gets replaced by the root flyers pretty immediately after unlocking them on summoner
    Even the RANGED Summoner minions don't do anything against some world bosses. They just float forward off the platform
This was my biggest disappointment when playing. I was excited to do a challenger build with a shotgun and beating things up. Very first boss was the grenade bitch, no way to get angles that shotgun could work. Basically defended my friends while they beat her up. Queue almost every other boss we got not being melee/close friendly (bad rng on our part). The final boss, however, really pissed me off. I had no way of even contributing unless the boss was on me.
    I got a nifty invader/challenger setup going I even managed to hit upwards of 7.8k with my knuckledusters once running it, but then I got to the final boss and all I could think was "Who ever designed this boss just said fuck everyone who wanted to use a shotgun or melee".
        one of the annihilation no damage annihilation kills floating around on here I think is a coachgun and double barrel set up. Shotguns have more effective range than you think, I don't recall there being a boss ive encountered where my shotgun couldn't perform.
            Coach Gun in general is just really strong because it actually has range due to firing slugs.
                I play shotgun and with the right rings, traits, they basically all do.
        The shotgun works great on endgame bosses, but you need to use Hunter as your secondary (or level the trait accordingly). That extra "ideal range" is pretty grody on shotties and turns Sporebloom into an elephant gun; just be sure to take the -spread trait as well.
        Melee on final boss? Sure. Shotguns? No you absolutely can
        And many summons. (Also applies to like, 50% of the bosses)
    the only way to 'melee' the final boss is to use atom splitter or the electric axe as far as i know which is what i did with atom splitter, its kinda lame how often it turns into "this is my boss weapon" because most of the major bosses cant be melee'd. Heck so many flying enemies too
        There is also a throwing spear. Good for proccing melee mutators and not much else.
            There's another two once you clear the game on harder modes.

I feel like there's a really strong build with the >!Hero's Blade or World's Edge!< and pairing it with the Butcher's Fetish; 15% crit rate and 25% crit dam are pretty great for just mixing in a charge attack occasionally. Those two weapons also don't have extra stamina costs on the attacks so it's less damning using them.

Shoutout to Spectral Blade for also enabling this easily on *most* bosses; can hit them around corners or through walls. Lots of ways to enable the stronger trinkets!
                I like the shock axe myself! None of them are meta damage output though, I don’t think.
                    It's not meta damage (only high-damage melee weapon I've found is Stonebreaker, but it only works on ground bosses), but tbh Butcher's Idol is one of the highest DPS upgrades amongst amulets you can reasonably get, but mostly because crit-damage is so insanely rare (and it gives more value to other mods, i.e. the Corrosive weapon mod is pretty awful compared to the Fire one until you've got enough crit damage to spruce it up).

It really just depends on the build you rock though and the weapon you enjoy; not all builds have room for that many amulets/trinkets, sadly.
        if you shoot all the orbs on the boss’ 2nd phase she drops down into melee range for quick dps window. difficult to pull off without enigma tho
        Yeah but electric axe + melee bleeds + dmg against bleed targets is my precious baby
            make it do more damage from buffs >:D
    fyi its "cue" in this case, not "queue" -- not trying to gotcha, just letting you know
        I was just imagining all the bosses standing in a queue
        Lol, thank you.
    Regarding the grenade lady. You can shoot her bomb when she takes it out snd it blows up doing a bunch of damage and she'll keep doing it over and over so its pretty consistent. Also if you hug the wall you can get some good damage on her with the shotgun.
    Lmao same, I'm doing challenger/engineer with an emphasis on melee dmg after I use the challenger ability. Having to change my strategy because the boss is impossible with my (I would call it intended) build feels bad

But I'm also too stubborn so I'll just get better or find a new trait card that will help
    Remnant in my experience has always been a game where one build rarely works for everything. When you fight bosses many of them require different approaches and for me that's a huge part of the fun. Lot of adds? AoE mods. Tight corridors? Melee build. Flying bosses? Single target ranged attacks. It's not perfect. Gunslinger Hunter can handle just about anything while melee certainly feels much more limited but I think that's mainly because gunslinger Hunter is just too strong. 

Remnant is meant to be hard and bosses are often vastly different for a reason. I wouldn't personally want any one build to be able to handle even half the fights in the game. Remnant gives you hundreds of items and mods. Why use one setup all the time?
        this would be fine if it wasnt expensive to not only respect, but also level up other equipment for different builds
            That's a fair point but they've said they are looking into the costs of those things. Granted it's an issue right now so I can see how people would be frustrated. All of my traits are pretty generic so I don't really respec for anything and I have plenty of material at this point so I haven't really had much issue personally.
            Levelling up equipment isn't that bad, you just might want to reroll a few areas, or help a few people, or just rest and grind a bit if you prefer, rather than a streamlined "almost fully upgraded all the time" because you dump everything into your favourite few weapons.
    i know on the fiurst half of the fight, you can roll through a lot of attacks and get a hit in, but that's really it since the fucker pulls and flys away so frequently.
I ran Handler/Summoner build. Had loads of fun with the game and they were helpful quite a bit. Except for bosses. Entirely useless against most bosses. So yeah, melee, dog, summons, all fun toys to play with, but it’s like the game designers didn’t want you to actually focus on those. lol
    Have you used the flying summon against bosses and watched them spend the whole fight *not* using their ranged attack and constantly *falling to their death!?* instead? Fun.
        I can't fully express how disappointed I was in the flying summons. Their ranged attack is great, but they don't seem to know how to use it. Plus the fact they can fall off a map and die is just baffling.

The Ravager, on the other hand, is pretty amazing, if not also somewhat mentally challenged.
            On Losomn being a summoner is hard work. There's these non hostile pig looking things walking around and if your summons see them they just stop and stare at them. You can be halfway across the map and they'll still be staring at the pig

They won't go back to following you unless you kill the pig, and if they spot a pig before they spot an enemy they'll just stare at it even if they're surrounded by enemies.

Gotta kill these pigs on sight if you don't want your summons to go goofing off which is kinda annoying but also kinda hilarious

My guess it's locked on to it as if it's an enemy, but it's still somewhere registered as "not an enemy", so it's just stuck in this lock on limbo because it can't get a new lock on without killing the current locked on target
                The dog does it too! I had to shoot them all or the dog would follow them around like "IT'S BACON!!!"
                Is it the same in the fae areas with the faes hiding as statues that come to life when you walk past them? As an engineer my turret just seems to shoot random things in the sky until I realised they're statues that I can't get close enough to trigger them spawning.
                    Yep that too. Was really confused why my summons were shooting at stuff that wasn't (to me) there
                    I actually found that handy when i was playing, i could located the fea and shoot them before they ganked me for 30% of my health
            Bonus, the flyers get stuck in the floor of phase 2 of final boss. Rendering them even more useless.
                They also have issues following you if you use an elevator. Had to blow em up multiple times.
                Yeah, most pets seem to get stuck in the floor on the final boss. Not that they're much help anyway due to the boss' erratic movement patterns.
                That exact reason is why I swapped from Summoner/Engineer for the last fight to Engineer/Summoner.

Overclocked Gatling laser cannot be stuck on the door, and then I just sacrificed the flyers over and over
                The summons dont deal well with character transportation of any kind. 

So a fight where you are repeatedly teliported from locations is going to cause problems.
        lol… yep! I tried swapping summons before fights to see if that would “fix” them just sitting there and nope. Good times! lol… i really do love the dog and summons, and at times it really is a fun combo build. But there are also times where I felt like I completely wasted my build doing it that way.
        I was pretty sad that there were a few bosses that my flying summons just refused to hit, despite being ranged but honestly. Not enough to get over summoners value in regen having some autonomous damage. (My guess is since summons can move freely they are programmed to only hit enemies in bounds and certain bosses are out of bounds technically)
    I mean level 5 and 10 summons work fine, the lvl 5 ones primarily shoot it seems and if something is out of reach for the lvl 10 then it throws its arms at them, or if they are on the ground but it just doesn’t feel like running over it’ll also throw its arms lol
Does throwing my Krell Axe count as melee?
    The huntress spear isn't a **good** ranged weapon. But that little spin when you heft it makes me use it a lot more than I should.
        Wait. Theres more than one melee weapon you can throw? Right now im just using that krell axe because it helps me with my ammo economy.

And the little debuff is nice too.
            The huntress spear from the lady in Bloodborne-ville is thrown too. And it looks so fuckin cool
            The throwing spear feels so damn good, AND you can pretend your spear fishing cross dimensions!
                the fact that you can impale your friends and NPCs in the ward with spears and they just..... stick out of their bodies is the best.

feels a little weird they let it happen with the children though....
                    I forgot about this and it’s a top tier fact
                It's also quite fast for it's basic attack. Pretty good melee weapon so far imo.
            Huntress' Spear, Hero's Sword, that flame GS, Krell Axe
            These aren't the exact names, but:

Krell Axe, Huntress Spear, World's Edge, Atom Splitter, and Hero's Blade all can work on any boss (I think) to proc on-melee effects.

Spectral Blade works on almost every boss, except the big "stand far away and constantly DPS the weakpoint" ones. It's better against those that chase you around since you can still hit them from behind cover.

Stonebreaker works on ground-based bosses from a safe range, but tbh Stonebreaker's also the only "good" melee weapon for DPS I've found; the charge attack hits like a nuke up close and doesn't demand you constantly keep attacking or leaving yourself exposed to get in damage. Feels like a great weapon for dodging an attack, then punching the boss in the mouth.
        Hell yeah it's good. 💪🏻
    Use the huntress spear with the ring that gives you max Hp shield for every 25 stamina used. It conveniently uses exactly 25 stamina haha. Combine with the ring that heals max hp while you have a shield and you’re cooking with a melee build that makes you tanky and has range
        Or the amulet that gives 35% more melee damage AND 10 stam back on hit

That mutation with the stacking damage and speed per hit.

I’m really trying to make this think work 😂
            Use both! Sounds fun haha. You’d spend the 25 stam on the throw, then when it connects you’d get 10 back heh
                There's a mutator that gives you a shield on every melee hit which further synergizes with the generating band ring that recovers hp while shielded
                    Yeah, but once fully levelled up that mutator consumes shields on charge attack for a damage bonus. Good if you;'re actually close quarters, bad if you're using the spear to haha funny enemies *and* build shield.
        I’m big on the Huntress spear + vengeful strike mutation + vengeance idol amulet. Gotta have the ring of restriction so you’ll be stuck with half hp too. 

I’m throwing ballistic missiles with all of these damage bonuses.
    As far as the game is concerned it does.
    Yes
    Technically yes, thematically no.
    I just got this axe yesterday, is it worth pumping levels into? Still using Challenger default weapon at +8.
        Not really. It deals shock damage and inflicts overload, which can be kind of neat, but the damage is rather low. Honestly the Iron Greatsword is just so good that it's hard to replace. I'd look for the Atom Splitter as a viable replacement. It's not difficult to get, but it is an RNG find since it can spawn in multiple dungeons and you need to find the correct room it spawns in.
            Great to know, thanks. Will look up the Atom Splitter. Iron Greatsword has been pretty damn good so far!
                If you ever manage to beat the game on Apocalypse, there's also the World's Edge which is almost a direct upgrade to the Iron Greatsword. Same attack animation, almost the same damage values, but it also shoots a wide beam on charge attacks, like the Hero's Sword.
                Atom Splitter is good for charge attacks, but has really low melee damage otherwise when compared to other greats swords, just something to keep in mind.
This is why I use the giant sword with wave beams and spam those everywhere, atom smasher. High damage, long range, goes through enemies and environments.

It's such a crazy good weapon when you get the timing down on those heavy neutral attacks.
    Ooh, where does one acquire this weapon? It sounds awesome.
        Assuming that OP is talking about the Atom Splitter and not the Atom Smasher. Atom Splitter is a relatively hard to find sword as it's in one of the side dungeons of N'erud randomly based on their generation. You need to jump on one of the metal pieces that the big fingers are lifting up, and have it carry you to a higher platform where the sword is hidden. Best to look up a guide/wiki page.
            Got it, thank you!
                I've seen the room it spawns in in three different dungeons so far. Vault of the formless, void vessel facility, and the story dungeon where you fight the big rolling blob.

Large room, foggy ceiling, large pillars full of stasis pods and spindly fingers that are grabbing and lifting different section of the pillars.
        You have to roll a certain tile set with moving machine in nerud. Can spawn in any dungeon. 

The sword is so satisfying because you can just launch one wave beam and decimate a whole group.

I've had one wave attack do like 1500 damage.
            Does it spawn in any dungeon? I've only seen it spawn in three locations so far, all dryzyr zombie dungeons. I could see the space crab dungeons also working as the use a slightly modified tileset, but I don't see how the tile will fit into the spire type dungeons.
                I found it in hatchery but the tile set should have multiple spawn areas
        The atom smasher is in Nerud. While in any dungeon with the pod towers, there is a section that just seems to lead to a broken edge. You have to wait for the mechanical arms to grab a pod section at your level then jump on it. It will pull you up and you need to jump off onto a ledge that's about 1 story above the initial jump point. The atom smasher is in there. 

It looks like a Xenoblade sword
    How does that work? I'm on PC and I can't get it to shoot anything.
        Standing still, you hit spacebar to evade back and then hold down the right mouse button. Quite a few melee weapons have this combo for a special attack
            right mouse button for melee?
                Neutral backdash + hold LMB, not right
        I'm on PS5 and I just use a back button to dodge then hold melee. You have to be standing still too.
        They are referring to the Atom SPLITTER, not the Atom Smasher. Just to be clear in case you didn't catch that. The Smasher cannot shoot waves.
            It was clear, thanks.
    >It's such a crazy good weapon

Have you used like... any other weapon in this game? The Atom Splitter is one of the slowest melee weapons in the game tied with weapons like Iron Greatsword whilst doing half their damage without the beam and only about tied damage with the beam. If you want a ranged melee, Huntress or Krell will just far outperform it, and if you want a melee weapon that performs better in melee but has some ranged utility, Stonebreaker is basically the same weapon except it has actual damage.

Atom Splitter is cool, but not only is it not a "crazy good weapon", it is arguably one of the worst in the game. Enjoy the weapon if you want but to say it makes it so that melee weapons are super good against anything is just wrong especially as not only is it not good compared to ranged weapons, it isn't even good compared to other melee weapons which as OP has stated is clearly problematic.
        Don't care, I've used the weapon a ton and had tons of success with it. Fun > meta
            Cool. Then say that instead of saying it is good.

Or better yet, don't say it at all because that isn't that this post is about in the first place. Obviously people can play to have fun, this post isn't that: It is about how hard people are punished for that. Like you tried to make a counterargument by bringing that up and instead just proved OP's point.
                Lol wut? 

I've been destroying bosses and elites with the weapon, tested by combat to be awesome for me. I've used it for like 20 some hours of my playtime and it's just destroyed everything I've fought.
                    >I've been destroying bosses and elites with the weapon

Sure, because you can destroy any boss with almost any weapon. This game is not that hard.

But this weapon is objectively one of the worst at doing it.
                        It one shots most enemies lol

Why would I need something that one shots better

Why try to even gatekeep me for enjoying a really fun weapon and having success with it
                            >It one shots most enemies lol

So do many weapons.

>Why would I need something that one shots better

Because this is a game primarily about boss fights and you don't one shot bosses.

>Why try to even gatekeep me

It isn't gatekeeping. You said it was one of the best weapons and factually it isn't. You can use it all you want, I'm not telling you that you can't.

But sure, be the crybaby attention seeker who gets all defensive as soon as anyone says anything that goes against your viewpoint after you bring an irrelevant statement to someone else's post. You are free to do that.
                                You care way too much about this. Just go have fun with your meta bullshit.
                                    "You care way too much about this"

Says the guy who is constantly replying to make himself feel better about not being able to read and having the education of someone who didn't pass high school.

Edit: the classic try to get the last word and then quickly block the other guy. Obviously the move of someone who isn't insecure.
    Can you aim atom Splitter? The one I know you can aim you have to beat the game on apocalypse to unlock...so therefore do all the content of the game.
        You can! The range is actually farther than my plasma cutter too. It's crazy. I've been running around yaesha sniping the floating triangles with it.
            Even better, if ya decide to pair it with the Hunter's scan, you can even snipe enemies through walls since the beam kinda ignores them!
                That's genius. I will be trying that. The sword going through environments and the range definitely makes up for its lesser damage.
    There's a better wave attack melee weapon in the World's Edge using charged attacks instead of evade neutral but you have to beat Apocalypse for it to be obtainable.  There's also the Hero Sword (also charge attack wave beam) which is the starting weapon for the Explorer, but no confirmed way to get this yet outside of starting a new Explorer.
        Yeahhh I'm good with what I have. Not sure if I'll attempt apocalypse. Maybe someday
-get Krell axe

-throw it at stuff

-profit
    Don’t forget the Bloodstone ring so you can apply both bleed and overload at the same time.
        I forgot about that ring! It was one of my faves in FTA
Huntress spear fixes that conundrum
    Sort of but even then: It is just a straight downgrade from ranged weapons.
    [deleted]
        uh.. what? my huntress spear does like 2400 dmg on headshots/weakspots. The dmg does definitely vary but is generally in the high 3 digits low 1000s. Are you sure you're actually fully specced into melee when you were using the spear???  


The only issue I have with it is running out of stamina and things dodging it. It also isn't supposed to be better than guns when you have to resort to using it; it's likely meant to just give you a suboptimal option when you don't want to use guns or run out of ammo, unless you have a  lot of skill, in which case it can be on par with a lot of guns (obviously not optimized hunter/gunner nightfall builds, but nothing else is on par with that level of power) -- at again the benefit of infinite uses since it requires no ammo management or reloading.
            Matriarchs amulet gives you 35% melee damage and 10 stamina on melee hits, a must for melee builds
                Oooh, throwing the spear uses 25 stamina, you can combine the ring that gives max shield when you use 25 stam. With that amulet it works like throw > spend 25 and get shield > hit > get 10 stam back
                The butchers amulet is also good for the melee builds that focus on charge attacks.
                    I will go look this up rn…!
            You lose stamina throwing it??I have never seen mine drop when my character does it???
                Stamina is not used outside of combat
If you start fight with it it will be for free ;)
            Would you say the huntresses spear is better than krells axe?

It seemed much harder to get, but damage didn’t seem any better when factoring in the multiple shock explosions krells gets
        I find value int he throwing of melee weapons because you can slot the ammo generator mutator into it
Sounds like you need >!the javelin from the Huntress in Losomn!< It helps but yeah. I agree with you, they did this shit in the first one too. I don't know if there is but there should be a melee weapon that acts like the >!Twisted Arbalest!< It would really help. At the end of remnant 1 I'm pretty sure I switched from the shotty to the laser.
    There’s a throwing axe in Yaesha as well, that autoinflicts the electric status
Ya, it's bizarre design how useless melee is in a pretty large % of encounters. Even if you take the general CQB angle with shotguns, a lot of boss enemies get so high above the player, that the close range benefits lose their efficacy.

&#x200B;

I think part of what makes it more confusing is how Challenger and Handler are 2 of your 4 starter classes, yet a huge part of their play sets is pretty incappable against flying enemies.

&#x200B;

At this point I figure they called it the Challenger because it makes the game more challenging lol. I think it would have made more sense if it was an unlockable class since it's effectiveness is often niche.
    I just challenged everything with my shotgun. The buffs you get for the archetype help in close range so I just wade in there and start blasting and dodging.
        My only gripe with the auto shotgun is that it's so good it took me a while to upgrade something else worthwhile.
    I use it for the 3 free stacks of bulwark on my tank build.  I haven't found another use for the class yet.
I'm thankful this is being brought up now. I love Remnant 2, but it feels so weird how they kept citing melee as improved when it's so much harder to play melee builds.

A single phase of the Dreamer was the only required boss that wasn't attackable with melee in the first game. The moth twins could be skipped, which is the other one I'm thinking of.

I get we have a throwable axe and spear, but that also requires an entirely different item to be upgraded over our regular melee equipment in order to use.
Omg yes the bloat king..... Handler and summoner...
So fun...
    Well its pretty hard to kill with regen absorbs and reductions that can be taken,
beside that you may be right tho ;)
Usually summons are a bit slower just hitting something on the side giving bulwark charges and lifestealing for you 

Hard to say how anoing they are for party tho meet couple ppls with simillar build and never had problems with it really personally 
With 80% reduced ff i just zap enigma through everything anyway :)
    I just beat it on nightmare as handler/engineer. Dog does alright healing and tanking for the turret, and the turret kicks ass.
Yeah as challenger, there are a number of bosses where I don't use my Q at all because they are just flying around in the air. I think the third tier challenger tier will resolve this once I unlock it, but that's a long road to finally maybe use my abilities on bosses.
    Second tier is still good to use because of damage and stagger reduction
        That makes a lot of sense. Will keep it in mind!
    Challenger does improve as you level. I did have some difficulty at first but now I have no issues at all. 

I just leveled hard into vigor and siphoning, got some rings/aspects for barrier gen. and health regen while barrier is active. I can tank most anything now
It's a bummer but yeah, even when you're specced for melee, it's more 'I now have a viable alternative to my guns for mobbing' instead of a full replacement.
I don't see a problem with switching to a gun. To me, it's no different to how I swap out rings, amulets and skills to better tackle a boss or enemy type.
I think the boss design would suffer if every boss was melee-able.
    Yeah, wouldn’t the game just turn into darksouls/eldenring? Why are people so hung up about doing melee it this game 😄？
Completely agree with you here, seemed really dumb to me that they made lots of bosses completely just unable to be melee'd especially when the devs were bigging up how overhauled the melee is in this game compared to the first. 

And then dedicated classes to it and tons of items.

Like why?.
In the first game there was a ‘moonlight greatsword’ type weapon for ranged fights. That’s how I got past stuff like Queen phase 1 or Dreamer/Nightmare with pure melee.

Idk if it’s in the sequel but HOPEFULLY it is!
    ;)

I ran a (mostly) pure melee build in Remnant 1 and had great success. There were several bosses that made melee impossible in that game also, but it really seems worse in Remnant 2.

Good news is that we have more melee weapons with a charged attack projectile, but imo that should a be a last resort to have to use that just to make a melee build functional. There are so many amazing rings and amulets that boost melee, but even still it feels like an very uphill battle to make a melee build that competes with ranged.

I'm going to do a new character soon and focus entirely on melee and see how it goes, hoping I am pleasantly surprised.
    Thinking through it all the only bosses I'm at a complete loss for are bloat king and mother mind, and maybe the giant servitor eye, everything else can be done with predominately melee but some will be painful. The parasite boss on nerud is a decent example, you need to shoot down the host with ranged but then the bug itself is extremely vulnerable to melee. Corruptor will be an absolute pain, but it takes damage when it revives the golem so it's still doable. The guardian of nerud has melee-able giant hands spawn in the off-phase, you might even be able to cleave 2 of them at once with some aoe melee skills. Overall I think it's doable, but there's definitely a few encounters you'll be doing extra work for and a handful that just feel bad.
There's a handful of melee only builds floating around that take advantage of projectile melee weapons to great effect but most of them need things from endgame or even post game to function well on higher difficulties. Worlds Edge with the infinite stamina ring is extremely fun even on apocalypse.
Just gonna put this out there for all these people who don't think this stuff works.

Summons- Aside from the engi's flame (currently broken) and thumper turrets. They count as summons and are ranged. Also, engi is basically a requirement for melee builds bc of the spicy armor buff, just level it and you'll have a ranged alternative for summon builds and melee builds alike. 

As for the Reaver, most likely a pathfinding issue. Technically speaking, something like the Mother, isn't actually in the map. With it not being there the Reaver probably can't figure out how to shoot at it.

The dog is a dog...
It having a ranged attack is like the medic being the highest damage class in the game. It's labelled support for a reason. 

And finally,
If they built every boss to be melee and ranged focused, this game wouldn't be this hard or this fun. These bosses exist in every type of these games and challenging your build is something all of them do.
You can literally multiclass to fix this issue
people are already doing apocalypse melee only runs, it's doable.
They're *gun*fire games, not *sword*fire games, you goombus

Also there is only a single trait that even applies specifically to melee. Most melee benefits are from items that are easily swapped out to adapt to the fight at hand. I played mostly melee, and sure, the flying fights were annoying and starting on N'Erud made me want to die, but ultimately this is a Third-Person *Shooter*.
I can definitely understand the frustration as I did take the handler as my secondary and the dog often isn't very useful on boss fights. Still, designing every boss so that they can be easily killed with melee severely limits boss design. 

I think we got some very creative boss designs and most of the more interesting ones wouldn't be possible if they had to design them with "the player has to be able to walk right up to the boss and smack it till it dies" in mind. Most of the bosses would boild down to the typical big guy with a weapon type of fight. 

We do always have our ranged wepaons with us and a lot of build defining aspects can be changed on the fly. This is still a 3rd person shooter first, so yeah, we have to accept that melee is often not the way go.
Even with your entire build focused on melee, the game forces you to have 1 long gun and 1 side arm, which are directly tied to your power level as well. You'll always have a reliable way to fight at any distance, even if it's suboptimal for the way you're geared. Honestly there will be a lot of times that a gun is much more practical anyways, especially when outnumbered by a variety of enemies all at once
    I think one of the few amulets that didn't return from Remnant 1 was the White Rose, which gave you a 25% damage boost for each empty gun slot. I think the main reason is because we can do a lot more damage with skills/mods/summons/heavy weapons than we could before, but also because a pure melee build is completely unviable.
    This is true, but there are a lot of bosses and even regular enemies that can't be hit at all with melee, and that's really silly. Your point of swapping to guns is fair for regular enemies, because those don't have massive health pools, but bosses? 

Having melee be harder (you're in danger more often, you need to stick to the boss) or having brief periods in a fight where the boss is inaccessible is totally fine. I'm on my third world and at least six of the bosses I've rolled have been completely impossible as melee. Part of that could be bad luck with the RNG, but also consider that the Dog and Summons can't or at best barely do anything to anything that requires range. Even though the second and third summon all have ranged attacks, their AI seems to break when enemies aren't grounded leading to them often just standing around doing nothing. 

Side note grief: The second summon literally states it's a flier yet it isn't actually flying, body blocks just as bad as any ground summon, and falls to its death (very willfully, in fact) as often as possible. Madge. :(
    The problem is the gun is almost always more practical. I haven't seen any boss that punishes you for using a gun, but many punish you for going melee. Even in standard co-op situations, it's usually easier for everyone to use a gun rather than have anyone in melee who risks getting hit by friendly fire and complicates the use of AoE attacks. And I've noticed a lot of bosses that teleport around to different people in co-op, making it difficult for a melee to catch up and land anything, so they spend most of the fight with their gun out and at that point why are you even bothering to build melee?
        That big dog in the sewer event wasn't even able to attack me when I just kept smacking its hind legs with tal rathas face hammer, it's only has a charge and a kick, both need a charge first
        > I haven't seen any boss that punishes you for using a gun, but many punish you for going melee. 

Venom is far easier in melee than at range imo
            When you can hit him, as many angles will cause you to hit his protective cloak or go under his floating body. I would say he's still better to fight up close, just **with** a gun.
        The robot boss that sucks you into melee range is pretty tough to just shoot
            Any of the red bosses with the vortex modifier can go fuck right off. Got one that you have to fight in some small corridors and it was absolute hell trying to see what was going on.
    There are melee weapons that have ranged attacks like the Krell Axe, Huntress Spear, The Hero's Sword, and World's Edge. They aren't ideal of course but there are options for it. The first two just take some luck on a first go.
        (Don’t forget the beauty of Atom Splitter)
            Does it also have one? Only one I don't have.
                Yes sir/ma’am/????
    You can always unequip your guns lol
        I wonder if that ring that gives you bonuses for each unequipped weapons made it into Remnant 2...
            I know there's the Daredevil ring for unequipped armour, but I haven't heard of one for unequipped weapons.
                I thought daredevil ring was any unequipped item in this game
                    Only unequipped armor slots. It also gives you negative damage resist for each slot, so it turns you into a pure glass cannon, which would be terrible for melee.
                https://remnantfromtheashes.wiki.fextralife.com/White+Rose

My bad, it was a Necklace.
This is one of my main issues with Remnant 2 and it stems from something that you wouldn't really expect at first glance:

**Ammo Boxes**

For whatever reason Ammo Boxes are extremely rare to just *find* in the game. Yes, you can just purchase ammo boxes, but when compared to the first game where ammo boxes were dotted around all over the place this makes it feel a lot worse.

Why do ammo boxes effect melee builds? Because you are *fully* specialized into melee which means you likely don't have any ranged damage boosts in your build. This means that you can *completely* run out of ammo before whatever your fighting dies (*especially on higher difficulties*) which requires you to either completely swap builds (*sometimes even trait points)* or constantly use ammo boxes.

I have had fights where I **was** completely specialized into ranged damage and **still** ran out of ammo because I just wasn't using the best guns available to me at the time, so you can only imagine how much worse melee is.
Man that final boss just felt like the game was insulting me for choosing to play short range melee focused challenger.

Died twice falling of the stage for trying to melee its phases, was running dual shotguns so i couldnt even deal decent ranged damage since he hovers out of range most of the time.  Had to swap out my entire kit to do range increases, swap out my mods to since the crabs were useless and chains dont seem to have enough range. 

Still took like 10 runs because my melee weapon was the only thing i had upgraded to 19 and both my guns were still at 15 (and i died during my initial clear 8th run as i had put the controller down after the 2nd phase and went to the bathroom)
buffing the melee rings/mutations would help, but also having something to make the ranged melee attacks do a lot more damage would be nice since lot of wind up for them
    Melee rings/mutations are fine. Especially if you're doing a Bleed/Leech or 50% HP build.

Once the Shieldbreaker mutator is fixed, faster melee weapons will also be able to get super tanky by utilizing it along with the Damage/Lifesteal Shield amulet and the 3% hp regen while shielded ring.

Ultimately, the issue isn't even melee as a mechanic. Having some bosses you need to shoot is nice and forces you to learn that style of play. It's that bosses have a weird amount of one-shot moves at melee range. granted, I am in Void armor, not Leto's, but that's still heavy, so I was a bit shocked when Tal'Ratha's belly bump move, which has barely any windup, murdered me.
        there are some pretty weak outlier melee mods, extremely situational and even in that situation are weaker than the others. Essentially if we compare it to the 50% hp mod or the lifesteal mod how much less desireable they are to them

like say "disengage" it caps at +10% per stack (50% damage) for backdash attacks but it only seems to apply to the base kinda like adding +50% melee damage for 1 attack if you got the 5 stacks and otherwise not doing anything. I would expect it should see a much bigger number since its so situational compared to a universally at all times good mod

i super agree though i mostly run into the issue where its really unsatisfying where im at 80%+ total DR at 155 hp and still die in one shot or take like 90%+ hp damage from just a regular swipe
            Something is currently wrong with the DR mechanic, I swear.

Others have noticed it too, it seems like Armor and flat are multiplicative, which is punishing for anyone not running Leto's armor, and honestly kind of irritating. Heavier armor should mean you have to invest less to reach cap and can thus get other stats. The way it's working just means everyone is going to end up running around in Leto's armor with 80% flat dr or risk getting oneshot.

Like if you have 40% armor DR and 40% flat currently, if it's multiplicative, that's only 64% DR. Compared to 80%, that's **80% more** damage taken.

Personally I want a strict cap at 80%, or an "overflow" mechanic where excess DR% over 80% becomes multiplicative and thus is subject to large diminishing returns. Could still have Havel/Leto's Monsters running around and having huge DR while not punishing everyone else that way. Alternatively could have Bulwark exceed the DR cap, but only give 2% DR if it's past cap, to make Bulwark feel more like the GIGA TANK mechanic.
                oh my god i didnt know it was multiplicative, that explains a lot

is it always armor is base and DR is multiplied to it or whichever is higher then multiplicative from whichever of the two is lower? that definitely means i need a more DR to actually hit the invisible cap well fuck me lol
                    It's not confirmed, just an observation shared by players. The way the stat screen presents it is that it should be additive. However, there was a good post about a guy clearing Apocalypse where he discusses that Flat DR that exceeded cap was definitely doing something.

Also it wouldn't matter what the "base" is, since it would just be multiplying the remainder of damage. (1-DRa)x(1-DRf)
*SPOILER* 



Yeah I hate the final boss for that. I use stone breaker with as a chllanger/engineer and a lifesteal charge attack build and it works pretty damn well most of the time. Then there is annihilation and my dps comes to a halt. Sure I just switched my build to focus on sustained fire while using engineer overclock but it still sucked that I couldn’t wack the dead wood god with my glorified nail cutter. Oh well. Time for a Hardcore apocalypse character so I can unlock worlds edge.
    If I recall, hard-core rewards stop at veteran, and world's edge is just an apocalypse reward
        Then fextra has lied to me. Thank you for the information

Edit: it’s been updated so the wiki is correct now :)
heros sword will fix ya right up pal, or worlds edge
    Would have to beat the game on harder difficulties for those, huntress' spear, krell axe, and atom splitter also work
There are several throwing melee weapons and 2 beam weapons. If you find them then you'll be completely fine
I dont think I ever had a problem using Melee with any boddfight yet, my first run through the game was as the challenger, only weapon I changed was the handgun by using the enigma. Later I got medic as the second archetype and by this point I was dead set on being a crusader with the greatsword, blasting sabaton every boss fight.
But what if the game was designed to make switching from one build to another be easy and encourage the player to switch often to succeed in situations they were struggling at before, giving meaning to "adapt and overcome"? Your character is not a one-trick pony, why do you think archetypes can be swapped around with the click of a button instead of being Dark Souls' process of "so, we see you found a dex weapon while having a strength build... yeah, sorry".
    In that case, traits should be refundable on the fly.
        That they should; it's another thing to file under design conflict.
The game is clearly a shooter first and foremost. Melee is supposed to allow the player to mix it up a little bit but it's obviously not meant to be a primary weapon. 

People really complain about everything
    This.
I mean I think their whole goal was that everything requires a different approach. They don’t want there to be like one method that just slaughters. Like some bosses stay up close and personal whole time so hitting shots can be a pain but melee works nicely, and some  bosses stay far away the whole time and guns are perfect for. I do agree this is lame but I can get why they do it since if everything could just be melee fought why even include guns. It would just become another dark souls clone.
    I have yet to see a boss who's easier to melee than shoot, it's not like your gun stops working when they're in your face.

Meanwhile the opposite definitely exists, have fun meleeing the cube boss or anybody who flies lol.
        Red prince is a joke with a melee build
        Okay, the Cube Boss is a horrible example because it’s more of a puzzle than a real boss.
        The Root Tree boss lol, only one I can think of (random side boss in Yaesha) maybe Kaeula or whatever the name.

Honestly, most of Yaesha in general is very melee friendly compared to the rest of the game.
            The Root Nexus? It's an immobile target, prime for shooting. And it even gets a special attack if you're meleeing it to mildly punish melee (it can grab you).
                Can’t remember what it is called but the big tree that doesn’t move.

It doesn’t do anything other than summoning adds.

Literally doesn’t do a single attack.
                    No, that's the boss I'm talking about, it does have a single attack: it can grab you with roots while you're in melee. Unless that's something one of the adds does.
                        I believe that’s one of the elite adds.
                        It's literally what one of the adds does. Roots you and gives you Root Rot status effect. The tree tank elite. Annoying monster.
                            Gotcha. Never encountered it while actually fighting the enemy, is it attached to the big shockwave attack?
            That’s what I’m saying is that there’s tons of places melee is usable but because it’s not like dark souls where almost everything is just a punch out they feel melee is unusable 😂
                There's also a lot of places where melee is completely unusable. But I haven't run into any situation where a gun is unusable...and very few situations where a gun is not more practical and easier in every way.
                    Nerud any of the building and places with the zombies and crickets. Laesha most of the enemies besides flying one. I could go on an on the whole thing is sure melee is unusable if you can’t dodge or can’t learn timing. Acting as if melee is unusable is just goofy since it’s surely able to be used but there’s a reason why the game gives a primary, secondary, and melee. Primary = damage secondary = capacity and minimum damage melee  = aoe and crowd control
                        The unusable part refers to flying enemies and bosses, when you literally cannot reach enemies. Outside of that, melee merely finds itself at a disadvantage in a lot of situations. Having to chase after bosses teleporting to teammates, increasing the risk of friendly fire, making it harder for allies to use AoE attacks...guns just have a lot less nonsense to put up with, at least until you start using ranged melee weapons.  

It just makes melee build options feel really out of place.
            Root Nexus didn't seem possible to hit the weak spot with melee weapons, leading to all melee damage being grey. If I'm wrong and it's possible, then I think it's very unreliable at least. *Technically* killable as melee, but holy hell will it take awhile.
                I did that only hitting the nexus with melee since I was running out of ammo and it was the first encounter I found in my campaign. You can hit the weakspot with melee on a specific side of it.
                [deleted]
                    Maybe? I tried Edge of the Forest and Scrap Greatsword.
                        you have to basically pretend that your melee is an aimable veryveryvery short range gun and depending on the weapon, where your reticle is when the 'shot' goes off determines if you get a weakspot/hit/whiff. 

Trick is to aim at the larger glowing red parts of the trunk as aiming for the smaller red parts surrounded by 'regular root trunk' has a much higher chance of getting resisted, especially when you get shoved around by all the adds.

Also recommend trying the engineer's turret melee as even with a crappy build i was hitting something like 3-4k on the juicy red parts of the tree. I've no clue how quickly you could destroy it if you went with an actual melee build, but I'm assuming much, much faster.
        Well the cube Boss doesn't require dpa anyway.
        There are definitely some bosses that I think I could easily take with a melee weapon but at the end of the day I really just used my melee for little mobs that crowd me. Which I honestly feel may have been the only reason melee exists to be completely honest with you. Like In Nerud you have the crickets and blobs that rush you and melee cleans them up nicely. You also have the rolly dudes on laesha that melee helps a lot with. But to say that melee is pointless I do get it but you once again have to just figure it out. Also dark souls had flying bosses and enemies that you had to wait until they got close to you or you had to wait til they landed. So it’s not an uncommon thing but since there are guns it’s rare these flying enemies land.
        the benefit of melee isn't necessarily that it's easier to take down a boss with than not. It's that it does not require (relatively speaking) aiming, ammo, or reloading. Melee light attack spam doesn't even use stamina, and there's a ring that will help if for whatever reason you need to heavy spam. Melee also has such incredibly high bonuses compared to range, it allows you to scale more efficiently while also having very high DR. Like the fact that there's an amulet that gives ***THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT*** melee dmg with not only NO downsides or conditions AND gives an ADDITIONAL benefit of 10 stamina replenished ON MELEE HIT (not even kill), is ***insane***  


Ranged amulets are like you get a significantly lower dmg bonus (usually around 20% compared to, again ***35%***) ***IF*** you meet a condition, like on kill, or at a certain health threshold etc. Like it's comically easy to reach 80% DR while maintaining dmg on melee, esp since you can use "when hit by enemy" procs since that's almost \_bound\_ to happen, whereas most ranged builds play on the premise they shouldn't get hit much, if at all.   


As for cube boss, that is wholly irrelevant since the cube nodes die to a single shot and you always have guns equipped even if you don't normally use them. Even with zero investment in range on your jewelry/traits/archetype, you will one shot the nodes on the cube boss. Your build is irrelevant in that fight for 90% of builds out there, and that 10% is basically if you have something like increased movement speed, or invader movement shenanigans. It's basically all one shots in both directions.  


Fliers are absolutely a pain for melee though; that is 100% true, but I like that using different builds for different bosses is a thing in this game. I do wish fliers at least had a landing sequence in their rotation for my melee users out there.  


(meanwhile I'm doing a mod monkey build and praying i dont' one shot myself with starshot because "big numbers go brr", so maybe i shouldn't talk about build efficiency after all aha)
            This is all very cool (genuinely, I plan to do a melee build at some point so knowing a few of the options is neat) but I think people are reading something into my post which I never said ("melee is useless") rather than what I did ("ranged attacks are usable in all circumstances, melee is more situational").
            &#x200B;

>THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT melee dmg

With is only 5% more damage than what ranged can get. Except ranged has higher than 5% dps base most of the time. SO they actually get more bonus from the 30% than melee gets from 35% because percentage works better the higher the base DPS is.

So not only is it *not* insane, it isn't even that good
        I had a much easier time meleeing one of the root bosses. Some old treet hat that likes generating big death zones if you arent in its face.
        I mean a nice melee focused build can pretty much face tank and shred but part of the problem is a lot of bosses being impossible to actually get in melee range of or having happy feet and no downtime to actually melee
    Exactly this. There are literally tips in the load screens that say melee is intended for mobs and conserving ammo. It’s completely reasonable design- they want your character to be multifaceted because they need to be against their environment
        Exactly like I’m sick of everyone pitching a fit about melee when it’s literally explained. Like did everyone forget it’s dark souls with GUNS why would it be melee focused. It would just be another dark souls clone and people would than whine about that
            Did you *play* Remnant 1?

You realise they talked about giving more of a niche to melee centric playstyles in this game, right? When it overall is a bit worse than 1 due to enemy design?

It's just a slightly less rough start, but otherwise not as good.

Don't give people a wide range of melee loot, a large number of melee trinkets, and a class which has an entire skill based exclusively around improving melee if you don't want people to try and focus on melee.

Given they *did* all that, and what they've said in the past, I'd hazard a guess they absolutely *do* want the option of melee to be an entirely valid method of play.

Much like you probably swing your melee here and there, people who want to play melee understand they'll need to shoot. It's the ratio that's the issue.

**EDIT:** Like, to be clear, melee *would* be better in this game. They have made a HUGE number of changes to improve it. But then they made half the enemies fly, most of the bosses hell to melee, and gave them frankly gross close range damage.

So close, GFG. So close.
there are melee weapons with ranged attacks like the lightning axe but i think melee is more of a support than meant to be full dps. sure you can stack amulets and rings but that was probably not the devs intentions, they probably expected the user to weear 1 or so of the items
Honestly I’m glad this is getting talked about, I initially ran a Handler and summoner build. Many bosses felt like just anti my build. That’s not to say they were poorly designed just don’t think that had the right mindset for these classes. Not to mention on “main bosses” your tanky dog being unable to Afro because that boss has the hots for you. So in my second roll I decided to try alchemist/challenger. So far having an amazing time, running around slowing time with the dream staff weapon, then I reach a boss who says “Screw your melee.” And I’m just like “Welp there goes my fun, guess time to shoot.” *realizes I’m rocking double barrel and AS-10.*
this is a ranged combat game with melee as backups.  


2) The challenger (the melee class) has abilities that are designed for ranged, so if you go into a boss or encounter that's ranged only, you can swap your ability and not get left behind.  


3) Some melee weapons have ranged abilities or can be thrown.
    My only complaint with challenger is that their starter ability feels awful if you roll N'Erud first world. They need to give it more range, both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to stun/knockdown bosses for a few seconds. Also some better way to scale damage since most ability damage is just for mods, not skills...

Aside from that, I think Challenger/Melee are fine. Challenger even gets one of the most absurd ranged skills in the entire game. Rampage crazy
Game supports changing your build on the fly.  If you pick 1 and refuse to use other situational loadouts that's on you.  

'Why would you give us shock damage weapons if some bosses have resistance to shock?  I want to play my shock build to the end!!!'
whats the deal with expecting to be able to melee everything in a gun game?
    I think a few bosses could change a bit to allow for more melee fights, but I do think a lot of bosses shouldn't be melee capable. Part of what makes remnant great is that you often need to adapt to a fight. I don't think there should be a build that can handle any fight without an issue. Modifying your load out to adapt to bosses is one of the best parts of the game. 

I mean, granted gunslinger/hunter exists and that can handle everything but I try to use other builds to have fun and change things up.
    I don't get it as well. This is a shooter that has a melee option, but it's a shooter. You can play however you want, but you'll have limitations. The devs specifically said they wanted to make melee good and interesting, but the main focus of the game is to shoot things.
Focusing your build on melee doesn't stop you from shooting with your 2 equiped guns. Same goes for ranged focus builds. And you can go hybrid with all DMG stat.
    The difference is that ranged focus builds are *never* forced to use melee.
        The game is a shooter first and foremost. Why do you people act like melee options need to be on the same level as guns? Melee is clearly there to allow the player to mix it up/have fun against regular enemies and some mini bosses but the main options are definitely the guns.

This is like complaining that guns are not as effective as melee  to kill shit in Devil May Cry. They are not supposed to.
            >The game is a shooter first and foremost

Dark Souls is a melee combat game first and foremost. You can still make a pure Sorcerer build work very *very* well if you spec completely into it.

>hy do you people act like melee options need to be on the same level as guns

It doesn't, but unlike Remnant 1 they clearly designed many *many* pieces of gear and skills around that so it *should* be.
                I know it takes a lot of inspiration from it but it's not Dark Souls, it's Remnant and the developers obviously see their game as a shooter with melee acting only as a secondary option. Having gear and skills for your secondary doesn't mean it should be usable as a primary.

How about you guys just play the game that's in front of you instead of trying to turn it into something else? Dark Souls don't have difficulties levels or procedurally generated worlds, should they get rid of that as well so it's closer to it?
                    >I know it takes a lot of inspiration from it but it's not Dark Souls

Read your comment, then read my comment again. Because either you know are wrong and are deliberately trying to avoid addressing it, or you simply didn't read it.
                        No
                            Okay so you are just admitting you know you are wrong then. Guess that is one way to do it.
                                I'm saying there's nothing in your comment that would make me change my mind by reading it a second time

Just because something is possible in Dark Souls, it doesn't mean it should be in this game. They made their game as a shooter with melee acting as a secondary only and evidence of that are the bosses you cant kill only with melee. You call it a design flaw, i call it a deliberate choice.

Play the game that's in front of you not the one you made in your head
                                    >I'm saying there's nothing in your comment that would make me change my mind by reading it a second time

Well allow me to walk your middle-school-level-intelligence ass through it then.

This is a quote from you, as justification for melee being bad:

>The game is a shooter first and foremost

This was my reply:

>Dark Souls is a melee combat game first and foremost. You can still make a pure Sorcerer build work very very well if you spec completely into it.

Clearly this isn't saying the game is dark souls, this is using your own logic to show how you are wrong for saying that just because the game is gun based that you *can't* inherently do something different. That fact it was dark souls is irrelevant, that was used just because they make for easier comparisons. But what it does show is that your logic is objectively incorrect and thus you have no actual argument for your point.

At first I thought you did see that and just chose to make a fallacy out of it and make it seem like you misunderstood, but no, clearly you are just that thick.
        Sure they are. It's called ammo.

&#x200B;

This is incidentally also the reason melee is both rather bad and not viable for everything. It's designed to be used when out of ammo, or if you think ahead, on enemies it is viable against so you don't run out of ammo.
            >Sure they are. It's called ammo.

You know gunslinger exists, right? But if you don't, let me tell you:

No, ammo is not a relevant thing in this game.
                Oh, so without a class that isn't immediately unlocked, nor always desired (including the trait) . Imagine sounding that stupid.
                    >Oh, so without a class that isn't immediately unlocked, 

I mean it is.

>nor always desired

No, for ranged builds it kind of is. It not only has great ammo stuff but is also one of the best for damage. 

And even when you ignore that, no most weapons don't have ammo problems and even then, at worst you are going to be using a secondary not a melee which still benefits from your build completely.
Making a game where both range and melee are both equally viable, balanced, and independent of one another in a satisfying and meaningful way is nearly impossible. Many games have tried.

**Mordhau and Chivalry** are first person medieval combat games with a heavy emphasis on swing angles, timing, and feints. Nothing pisses off the playerbase quite as much as archers, who can comfortably sit in the back and split skulls open from across the map. In 1v1 private dueling servers where it's mandatory to bow or flourish your weapon to agree to duel another player, trolls and griefers will bring bows and other ranged weapons just to annoy people having duels because it's such a safe, easy option for getting kills.

**Overwatch** is a hero action shooter game with a very wide variety of playstyles. There's three characters that lean towards a more melee type style (being Reinhardt, Doomfist, Briggite) but *all* of them have a ranged option they're expected to make use of. Genji has a sword only form that acts as his ultimate, but he's the character with the most mobility in the game, and the maps are specifically designed with invisible walls on rooftops and such with him in mind to make sure he doesn't get into sneaky unfair spots.

**Phantasy Star Online** is an action RPG from back in the day (That I would argue is probably a big inspiration for many of the concepts in Remnant) that features both melee and ranged weapons. Playing as a Hunter (Melee focused class) is absolutely infuriating because many of the enemies move around faster than you, or can safely fly above you. It's basically required that Hunters use slicer (boomerang) type weapons, or pistols as a backup weapon.

**Elden Ring** has plenty of options for both ranged and melee builds, but one of the mandatory magic spells is Carian Slicer, a spell that effectively turns your magical staff into a big glowing sword. Even builds that use bows will typically have some kind of backup weapon for tight, enclosed areas or when enemies swarm too close to you. Some enemies fly, but none of them stay far from the ground for long, and even dragons spend most of their time on the ground.

**Monster Hunter** is very much a melee focused game that has ranged options, making it a bit of a mirror parallel to Remnant. Even winged enemies spend most of their time on the ground, and the ranged weapons are designed to deal with ground-based threats rather than being anti-air tools.

To make Remnant have a dedicated, no guns melee build be viable, they'd need to remove so much of the verticality of the combat. You'd never need to shoot up or down. Imagine if the Dran couldn't attack you from rooftops, or imagine if Yaesha had no flying enemies at all. It'd remove a huge portion of what makes the combat in Remnant so interesting. If everything was just at ground level all the time it'd be a very boring shooter.

The alternative would be to make melee have absurd speed, the ability to jump high or climb walls, and leap across the battlefield. Would it be fun? Sure! But it would also invalidate the rank and file melee enemies who's primary combat strategy is to surround and overwhelm you.

There's really just no way to do it that wouldn't have major consequences.
    Im not asking them to be balanced, just don’t make bosses that can’t be reached at all via melee strikes. I don’t think that’s asking anything crazy.
        I think it's asking for more than you think.

Flying bosses would have to have long periods where they'd be on the ground, which kills the verticality of what's normally a fight that requires you to be looking up and down.

Game design is rarely as simple as it seems on the surface and what seems like an easy change can have large consequences.
            But it was already solved in the first game by making most bosses just not fucking fly. It's not something that would be easily fixed at this phase of course, it would have needed to nipped in the bud at the design and concept phase. At this point I'll just enjoy the game for what it is of course, as this is a very tiny spill in a great lake of enjoyment.

The only reason I'm a little salty, is that for some reason: Remnant 1 had a much more viable melee-only experience despite being told at release that the game wasn't made to be played as a melee build.

Remnant 2 has a much worse melee-only experience, despite being told that melee had a lot more work done to it in order to allow it to be played as your primary strategy.
                I think that's a bit of a bad faith argument. Remnant 1 had plenty of bosses that were unkillable using melee. Raze, the Iskal Queen, Clavager, Ixilis, Barbed Terror, and both campaign final bosses to name a few. Several others had phases where they'd jump or fly out of melee range as well like Dream Eater, Tian, and Erfor. Then there's Obryk and The Thrall which both have deadly AOE mist nonsense that makes getting close to them nigh impossible. It's not like Remnant 2's boss design philosophy suddenly veered off into a new direction to fuck over melee players.
                    You can hit Clavager's arms from the edge of the arena, I killed the Dreamer's first phase (But not the second, obviously) and Harsgaard completely with melee only, the Iskal Queen's knees are melee'able. Bosses with temporarily immune phases are also completely nonsensical as an argument as well, since I'm specifically talking about bosses you **CANNOT** deal with in melee in a realistic sense. Not sub-optimal, but enemies who cannot be stricken up close.

As well, elements like Obryk's and Thrall's AoEs are completely fine as well. I'm not asking to stand afk against bosses and ignore danger. I will state though, i completely forgot about Raze, and it's true that doing Barbed Terror in melee only is a slow methodical headache so I would count it as non-viable for melee.

And I'm not sure where the bad faith is. I never said that they intentionally made things worse for melee, I'm not trying to write an agenda that they have something against melee players. I literally said that the game is great, I just find it weird how I find it harder to play melee-only in the game when it was told to us that melee had more forethought put into it.

I understand you want to defend the game, and I don't think it needs defending as it stands on it's own merit. But you can't look at the percent of enemies that never touch the ground and say that there isn't a skewer towards the sequel.

And of course I could and should probably talk about the upsides to melee. The mutator system is great for melee, the many different ways to modify encumbrance and build tanky is another boon. The removal of nearly all hit-scan enemies is another thing that helps melee only. The change to lifesteal means that melee players actually need to play the game as well, no longer being able to sustain most bosses' beatings pre-apocalypse. Of course there's a ton of benefits that Remnant 2 has given a melee playstyle, I just wish I could actually use my up-close melee options against half of Nerud's base creature pool.
                        All fair points.

I'm curious now. Can you use the Invader second ability to teleport up to the molotov lady? That'd be funny as hell.
                Remnant 1 was more melee-friendly, but still had problematic fights like the moth boss. IIRC it flew just off the side of the platform, so if you tried to melee it, you would just fall off and die. Also the final boss I think had a phase where you couldn't reach it with melee.
            The problem is you’re talking about the current roster of bosses. You eliminate the problem of it being complicated by simply not designing bosses who can’t be approached from the get go. I get the game is shooting oriented, but melee has the exact same systems in place for building around it that ranged does, the only difference is melee has fights where it simply can’t do damage. It just seems like bad, lazy design to me.
                I can appreciate that, but I also think that it's a huge design limitation that would exist to the detriment of of the shooter experience.
                    Yeh, but then why offer so much build chose for melee? If you’re going to make encounters that invalidate the entire gear and class choses a player has made simply so you can have a easier time making fights, then they should drop melee and make it more of a utility thing. Replace all the relics, classes, and items and throw that into more builds for ranged, mods, and skills and make melee simply a kick button because as is you’re baiting new players into a play style that is going to hit a hard wall. Joey spends all his resources on melee weapons, goes a melee class, has all melee relics, full melee ring equips, only to find he has gotten to a boss that hangs from a wall. Now Joey feels like he just wasted all of his resources and time. I just don’t think there is a good excuse developer wise for having that kind of design and I get they aren’t a big company, but I feel this is something that should have been shaped up for this sequel and where does the game broadcast, this is shooter rpg, melee is a second rate choice. Most players aren’t going to go into the game assuming there is such lack of design for melee because it has all the options available to play into it.
                        I think the "well melee isn't ment to be a main weapon" argument is so dumb. The build verity is insane for melee with sheer options alone. Then throw on the various weapons and two classes built around it and it's kinda silly to say the devs didn't intend for a full melee build. Throw in the fact that there is only a few shotguns in the game and the argument doesn't really hold much water. I think it's just poor design one way or another. I love the game, but I agree I'd rather have it not have options then having all these option and none of them able to do damage against most bosses. 

Like, ALOT of stuff in this game is melee oriented in terms of items, but then having tons of stuff jot being able to be hit by it is silly.
    In monster hunter there are some stupid annoying monsters that will spend the majority of their time in the air. Rathalos is one such case.

But it also gives you tools to bring them down and keep them there. From flash pods to using the hook thing to get blows in on the wings and tear em up.
Making bosses designed so that they HAVE to be meleeable gives less freedom to designers for good/fun bosses.
    Name one boss that was made more fun for ranged builds by its inability to be meleed.
        The final boss, alternate boss to N'Erud, abomination jellyfish in Yaesha, Cube Boss in Labyrinth, firebomb girl in Losomn.
            Just wanted to mention, the Alternate boss in N'Erud is actually meleeable. The upright fist attack can be melee attacked, which feels very much like a conscious decision to allow melee players to kill him. If more bosses had even just singular attack patterns like that in their entire kit, the game would be better.

And the firebomb girl is not fun to anyone I've talked to, lmao. Basically just waiting for her to pull out 15 bombs over the duration of the fight so you can kill her.
            SO you couldn't name a single one then? Because not a single one of those bosses' mechanics rely on you not being able to get in to melee them. Nothing would change in any of those fights for ranged builds if you could melee those bosses. They would play exactly the same. 

Also I love how you mention the cube boss, a boss that is arguably the most hated boss in the game right now. Like not only are you proving my point, but you are actively making the argument that making it so bosses can't be melee not only doesn't make ranged more fun, but actively makes ranged *less fun*.
                Cube boss is the easiest and most fun boss in the game but it’s the most hated. Uh huh sure bud. 

Final boss mechanic is literally him flying around looking cool and being a stationary target while you dodge his mechanics in phase 2.

Alternate N’Erud boss would be weird meleeable when he’s a floating space fetus. 

Flying jellyfish literally has his mechanic around downing his guardian so ok take that away by making him meleeable and you stand there tanking hits from both while you kill him, real fun.

Firebomb girl is fun fight with her being up top and you dodging. Why put her on the ground and make her useless?
                    >Cube boss is the easiest and most fun boss in the game but it’s the most hated. Uh huh sure bud.

Yes, it is sure.

>Final boss mechanic is literally him flying around looking cool and being a stationary target while you dodge his mechanics in phase 2.

Keyword "looking". Look has nothing to do with gameplay. You can still make that same look while allowing them to be hit in melee. Literally almost every single dragon fight in any video game ever has the same look and style in the fight and can still be hit by melee builds. This is possibly one of the most stupid takes that anyone could ever have in a video game bud.

Phase 2, as I said, pretty clearly has no reason why it needs to be unhittable in melee. You can still dodge things from afar even if you can get closer to him.

>Firebomb girl is fun fight with her being up top and you dodging. Why put her on the ground and make her useless?

She doesn't have to be on the ground, she can still be up top but you simply can get there too. Being able to get next to her wouldn't make the fight easier for ranged builds: You would still want to be below her so that you can avoid her while you reload. 

&#x200B;

Truly you are an incredibly thick person if you can't figure out this basic shit lol. It isn't complicated.

        Nah, thinking ALL bosses HAVE to be meleeable is pretty dumb
I don’t see a problem with it. It’s a shooter game. Melee is there for when enemies get close or as a last resort, or to clear out some mobs if you really want.  If every enemy was running around on the ground for you melee, we would lose out on so many great boss fights, and enemy variety. It would be a horrible idea. Also the dog does much more than attack enemies. He can revive you and you can use the howl to get 20% damage buff or healing over time. I can’t believe so many people are agreeing with this.
    >Melee is there for when enemies get close or as a last resor

then design the items around that instead of making it clear that you attempted to make pure melee builds a thing and then just chose to make the enemy design not work for that.
Some of the bosses are cool, but I definitely feel like boss design is a weakpoint of the game in general. I definitely don't feel like I can bring a melee build or weapons with limited range against bosses. The game is stronger in terms of exploration and secrets hunting.
    This game has way better bosses than Remnant 1. It's not even close.

Weapons with limited range are fine, even if melee can't do some fights. I cleared everything on Vet with a shotgun and I'm moving into Apoc now and still doing decently.
was kinda bummed how lackluster melee was in general :/ tried to make a lightweight backstab assassin build and stacked as much backstab and melee dmg possible and i still barely one shot most mobs and did very little dmg to elites. bosses are pretty much a nogo due to the simple fact that you can't cancel your attack animation with dodge. some melee weapons even lock you to 2 hits with just 1 click. just super clunky
I don’t know , this game is about experimentation so it’s okay to change builds sometime and take the time to use something else and adapt
Let’s gather Shrewd, Bloat king, Mother mind, Tal Rasha, Corruptor, Legion, Mantagora, Annihilation and Venom and the DEV who designed these bosses in the same room. We give the dev one steel greatsword and ask him to try kill those precious babies he made. Hopefully afterwards when he designs another boss he would have melee builds in his fking mind
    Cross Venom off this list. My sword took like 75% of his hp, only used gun during flying bits.
        I know. I was justangry and lost the ability to think when I found out this list was this long
Imagine.

    Yes because reduced dmg on a build you’ve put all your items and traits into is totally the same as literally not being able to attack a target at all with the weapon choice that you’ve put all your choices into. I swear some of you guys aren’t even trying with your logic.
        Same solution.  Go to your inventory.  Switch out your items.  

I know, it’s insane, but sometimes your 1 build isn’t going to be viable against every single thing in the game.  Wild concept.
            Right?  Like why are these nerds so scared of the gear select screen?
Y’all, it’s understandable the disappointment you are expressing when you encounter bosses that just can’t be melee’d…but bear in mind that the game’s very roots lie in it being a shooter. Melee will always be a secondary option and range the primary. You can run a balanced range/melee build or even gear towards melee while suffering via suboptimal range effectiveness. However, you’ll never get away from range because that’s the original intent and design. “Souls-like shooter”—even the first Remnant was described like that.
    >You can run a balanced range/melee build

I mean true but when it feel like you are just giving yourself an handicap with some bosses compare to just playing and focusing on a purely range build... it doesn't sounds like a fun time to me. 

At least you can freely swap your build around (except for the traits) so it's not the biggest problem but I just wish they gave you a way to swap quickly between builds (at the very least, something like loadout that you could save and change at the stone)
This is why no souls like clones will ever be better than a fromsoftware game. They get close but don’t have that magic sauce. FS are just experts at it & Miyazaki is a genius. The little things make the difference.
Yeah, needing melee special non-melee sttacks to actually be able to use melee its disapointing, you want to play "melee", use huntress spear chatged attack, atom splitter neutral dodge attack, krell axe charged, complete de game on max dif and use wold edge/hero sword charged, they are cool, but i want to beat bosses with my punch, there is 2 rings related to unnarmed attacks and a melee weapin that buffs that, almost useless
Bad design/Oversight I'd argue, despite devs painfully stating that they wanted builds for Remnant 2(around trait cap discussion), certain builds aren't playable until either reached the level or the weapon for them. While there's charged Melee that has ranged attacks, until you get them, full melee build isn't achievable. Same goes for Full Summon build, you need to reach lvl 5 to unlock second skill to deal range attacks.
    Having builds being locked around certain gear... is literally the purpose of a build.

Builds also don't matter until you get into higher difficulties where survivor and into veteran are all about testing out what playstyle you like & farming the gear you want to make a full build. 

Then you go into nightmare and apocalypse to really test the build
It's just simply bad design really. There's a difference between a boss being easier/harder for range or melee and a situation where it's completely unviable, which Remnant 2 does have sadly. 

A good example could be From Soft's games, you have bosses which can become trivial with magic builds but then magic users suffer against bosses that are far easier with a more melee focused class or a faith build etc BUT it doesn't feel like it's near impossible or badly done, just more difficult. In Remnant 1 and 2, some bosses are fully un-doable with certain set ups and you have to use different classes and builds, ie time to re-do your build with some XP grinding for different arch types and different weaponry and then also the grind for resources to upgrade new weaponry and yeah it sucks. My buddy went for a melee build and it basically made the messy final boss fight about ten fold worse for him.

As much as i enjoyed Remnant 1 and 2, both games are full of pretty questionable to bad design decisions and it's a shame devs didn't learn that super much compared to the 1st game. Some stuff they did, such as the removal of armor set buffs and turning them into arch types but then they failed again with making bosses that are not doable with certain set ups and also the fact they yet again had a thing of putting adds into some boss fights a fair bit much too often, though at least less than remnant 1 i suppose.
    Oof…
You get one long gun, one side arm and one melee weapon. Use em all! 

The game would be incredibly boring if you could just hack and slash your way to victory.
    [Gestures broadly at every other soulslike game]
        All other souls like games I've played don't force you to equip two guns, so they are actually better for and designed for pure melee.

Remnent is soulslike, but not a souls game. Ya gotta use guns here.
There are melee weapons with ranged attacks for those builds. Huntress Spear is the best in mind. They still count as melee damage attacks. It just puts a bigger challenge on them.
    But even the Huntress spear is just a worse version of ranged weapons. At the very least it should be on par at that point.
Throw 'em
This feels like one of those things they won't be able to change, too. Like they won't redesign all these bosses specifically to be able to be meleed unfortunately. I wish they would because I was hoping to be a beat em up challenger which is a bummer but luckily my gunplay is pretty good so I can get by. Probably will end up having my main be Gunslinger with a side dish of Engineer since melee and minions are kind of pointless for bosses (unless I get an Atom Splitter)
Melee builds in FO76 where you essentially just wait for the scorch queen to come down so you can do something
Everyone complaining about handler and summoner, they'll probably be buffed in an update with more anti-air tech too. If I had to guess. Pretty confident about that.
This is why I’ve been trying to play around with that throwing spear so much. Maybe it’s not the most optimal build or what ever but you can get it fairly easy and throwing it still triggers all the melee synergies as far as I can tell
They could just add a few guns that do “melee” tagged damage like Borderlands does. That way you still have a few ranged options. They may have already done this idk, there’s still so many items and weapons I have yet to unlock
That’s lame , you can but only using those Moonlight  type of Greatsword that throw waves
There are multiple melee weapons that can be throws so technically a melee only run is possible
Some bosses are easiest to melee.
You can always grab one of the throwing weapons and get a melee build working at range!
Honestly I was looking forward to doing a melee only run on my second playthrough but realized very quickly that isn’t gonna be possible without major effort that simply isn’t worth spamming bosses with “ranged” melee weapons which defeats the whole purpose of the build
There are ranged melees you could use for the flying bosses

I used the huntress's spear for my melee build because of those bosses. First playthrough ran an unga bunga challenger medic build with that spear and didn't have many issues. Yeah those bosses were tougher but it was still very doable.
Agreed. I got so excited when I saw all the positive melee changes for this game, but soon realized that there's still many bosses that can't be traditionally meleed.

C'mon, Gunfire. Quit teasing me!
How in the world do you beat final boss?  My dog does nothing and boss is so much harder then all the rest.
Why do people think they’re supposed to be gearing one slot and nothing else? That’s not how this game is designed. If you choose to spec *everything* into melee then that’s a shit build. The intent is to be multi faceted

I remember people saying the same thing about Wonderlands and while that game was even worse off in regards to melee, it’s missing the point. You have guns and they want you to spec so they’re equally viable because against the environment *they are necessary*
    And even when fully specced into melee, *nothing* lowers your ranged damage, unlike the other way around.

And you still have Mutators beyond that, so it's even more forgiving to have all your rings/amulets dedicated to melee. You can run a full melee loadout and still have decent ranged damage.
Imo, from playing a melee character, it’s to keep players from trivializing bosses with melee. Idk about others, but when my melee build gets going, I do so much damage I feel like I skip boss phases. Sometimes it’s fun, but sometimes I feel like I messed up by killing it so quickly. Having bosses where only elements can be melee’d makes me feel more panicky and involved in the fight
    mfw I had friends who struggled with certain bosses while I just made war cries with my lifesteal perk/ring and slapped them to death
I've started messing with melee build now I have a bunch of the items
Its fun as hell, I use stone breaker for ground stuff and krells for flying, it's not super ideal but it's the only way 

Now I just got to get good and do nightmare and then apoc so I can get worlds edge
I thought melee builds were not viable, was I miss informed?
    You were
Honestly in games like this, "melee" means "shotguns with a capable melee attack".
Melee is a supplementary tool. The most important perk (damage) of a challenger is not coded for melee damage but all damage at close range. There is no melee class. Merely a close range one. That still includes PEW PEW.  
Melee has grown in importance, there are items that support it, but building a whole build around that and expecting to clear everythign is simply not part of the design goal of this game and I am thankful for that. Otherwise it would limit the design of many bosses.
Don't know what you're talking about mate. Of all the bosses I fought so far, there have only been maybe 3 that couldn't be melee. Other wise between my giant sword and my buddies bow and arrow, I was doing way more damage than him.
Gotta say this was an issue in the 1st game also but not as bad as it is in 2 for some reason  its always the final boss and soem other fucker  you cant melee its a huge pain in the ass that they nevwr remydied and some how made worse in the 2nd game like why not make a gun that counts a melee atleast like some other games have done so atleast  you have a reason to wear melee rings but then in this game it would  probably  be the best gun in the game cuz melee accessories  are cracked  af
Melee is a running joke in my friend group, largely due to us running into a giant flying moth zone enemy. The thing basically flew around the entire map and would drop bombs. We wondered how someone who built for much closer combat was expected to fight this thing and win in under a half hour. 

As with Remnant 1, the game gives you a melee weapon and then does everything it's power to make sure you never use it.
Got to love that to get a really good versatile melee weapon with a range slash you need to clear the hardest difficulty and I am literally retarded so that's not going to happen for me lol.
Would bei cool to have a Range weapon that scales with melee damage to compensate that.
“We have a Trait cap because we want our players to focus on build diversity” lol. The nice thing about no trait cap is you could keep grinding traits to the point you would actually stand a chance using melee in most conflicts.
That damned Jellyfish..
It would be a dream if the flying bosses got tweaked. To take more damage from melee and either have a phase where they land briefly or have some symbiotic entity that is grounded that melee builds can focus on to damage boss health.

It would make the bosses doable and quite a different experience too, when approaching them with melee builds! 😲
There are ranged melee weapons though, so although taking an already painful thing and making it 100x worse it is possible.
Melee is a supporting actor for Remnant. It shines during horde events and vs mobs as the lack of resource use makes it perfect for that. However the star of the show is guns. Hence the game being designed around them.
I could be wrong, but so far anything I can't melee at all had minions that drop ammo, so the worst case scenario is having to rely on my secondary but it's fine.

Also, no reason you have to be stick with shotgun is there? I've considered going long range primary just to be more useful because shotgun and melee often compete for use atm.
As a Engineer and Handler main who has played MH, I need the option to mount my railgun on my dog.

        reminds me of spoony's let's play of FF8 

&#x200B;

ANAL CANNON
            Ah man, Spoony's glory days. Good memories!
                I'm just glad people remember him, one of the classic greats.
See him stream still on occasion.
                    Sad that he stopped doing reviews. I still go back to things like Pumpkinhead, all the Ultima's, and his let's plays of SWAT.
                        Aye it is what it is, he saw the best and the worst of those early days of influencers, a real pioneer.
    Honestly I'm surprised the dog can't do something like that given the tactical pupper vest
        Def a missed opportunity to build silly unique synergies
            Hanz get ze Flammenhund
                Hear me out... 

Archon, gets to put an useable mod on the dog or choose an elemental attunement that is reflected in the dogs appearance and attacks. Unique dog howl can speed up mod cooldowns

Engi, gets to mount heavy weapons on the dog (dog also can now look like darpa mule) or, dog howl acts as partial reload to give HW more charges.

Challenger gets slightly enhanced effects on dog skills, dog wears armor and can wield a melee weapon. Unique bark/skill lets out a stagger effect similar to earthquake. 

Summoner, Dog can take on root appearance and skills. Can root snare enemies.  Unique bark summons a root wisp that deals light damage and counts as an additional summon.

Gunslinger, Dog now looks like a large cattle dog, will retrieve ammo to bring to party members, unique skills can have the dog yeet dynamite over designated enemies for an aoe explosion. DYNA-MUTT

Explorer, Pointer/Bloodhound/Husky.  Doggo now 'points' at nearby chests and secrets.  Can rifle through enemy corpses for additional loot.  Somewhere in each world another simulacrum is buried, follow doggos nose to find it. 

Hunter, Labrador/Catahoula leopard dog,  will also retrieve ammo to bring to the players. Can jump and latch onto designated targets to pin them briefly in the hunters directions, can also rip a new temporary weakpoint onto an enemy limb. 

Medic,  St. bernard, Bouvier. dog carries two additional dragon heart charges and dog cast rez channels are reduced by 20 percent.
                    Yes to all of this. I myself would use hunter, explorer, and engi, maybe even archon
                    This is a really neat idea not even gonna lie
                    This is probably my favorite remnant theory post I've ever seen. I want literally every single one of these, yesterday.
            Dog plus summons, let the rolly Bois ride the doggo
                Would prefer the big one riding dogo and throwing explosive axes :)
                    Sounds like radhan
                    I feel like that hurt the dogs back

How about doggo rides big one and they both toss axes
                        Nah, the big summon can just master gravity magic if he wants to ride the dog.
                I'm down for Boggan riders.
                Where’s the amulet that lets my dog bark out bees, or lasers, or bees that shoot lasers?
                    It's in the backer rooms gotta learn C++ to get it XD
    Really wish I hadn't started as Handler personally. Dog AI is kinda buggy and as mentioned, they can't help with flying bosses, which is kind of pain.
        Ngl. Handler is probably the best starting class other then bruiser. Every class blows at level 1 and those self res heals are clutch.
        I started on nightmare and play solo so the dog has helped out quiet a bit and usually after mastering the boss mechaniks i can get them even if the dog cant help out and the heal and res is always nice. 
I got throught the first 3 worlds and honestly felt like certain mob groups like the floating bots on Nerud are worse than most bosses
    Or just a flying attack dog. We can just watch the dog play for us. Pretty sure that is why we have different builds.  Understand which one works for each boss or level and adjust accordingly. But then I like my build.
        Which would work if classes didn't take ages to grind and scrap was actually available
            Honestly, it doesn't take as long as you'd think if you focus on one at a time, max the trait, and pop a stew. 

Not ideal still, but not horrible
    This becomes a much different sentence if you remove "my railgun"
        Many sentences become entirely different if you change them.
            Blowing my FUCKIN' mind over here.
                This becomes a very different sentence if you replace "mind" with load.
                    Oh my god I'm flabbergasted, you are a wizard of words!!!
    Jet Force Gemini?
    This would be savage as hell. MAKE IT SO!
    This is much better than the actual post
Sometimes no even summons dare to agro the boss and remain still at place making player fully speced on summons and pets totally useless.
    I love that reaver has a ranged attack, yet won't do it against flying bosses and instead just stands there the whole time.
        Yep. Love the Reaver, but the AI can be downright brain damaged on boss fights. In the Root Nexus fight, pets will just completely ignore the boss itself. On the Annihilation fight, pets you bring into the fight through the fog gate will spawn in the floor and just sit there until they die.
            Engie sentry also ignores the Root Nexus.
                I’m okay with sparky saving ammo for the enemies that actually do damage.
            Better yet, during phase 2 of annihilation, the flying summons will bum rush the boss and fall off the edge and die instantly.  Yes, the flying ranged summon... suddenly decides it wants to melee and runs off the edge to die instantly....
        My favorite part in general about the reavers is that they like to fly in point blank to the enemies to use their *ranged* attacks. That's honestly the reason I switched off having summoner as one of my classes, because they kept getting in my way too often. For a ranged summon, they act like they're a melee summon half the time.
        Weird mine was sniping with throwing axes against flying enemies and bosses. Like i was impressed with the tracking as it seems to make shots that I don't think I would be able to make considering, if I was the one aiming the throwing axes.

        You need to have handler as your primary archetype for that to work
            [deleted]
                The only other thing I can think about is if you gave your dog a command, like attacking an enemy or moving to a particular position. Ive noticed that if you aren't near that enemy/position and get knocked down, the dog doesn't try to rez you until that command wears off. I've accidentally commanded the dog several times while trying to use the skill, so it's an easy mistake to make
            My experience with this is wildly inconsistent. 

I have 23 hours in the game, maybe half that with Handler as my primary. My dog has revived me once and my boyfriend once. In the latter case, the dog was just sitting by me while I was downed and then ran off to revive my boyfriend after he got downed as well.
                It worked perfectly every time for me, but it has a long-ish cooldown and requires you to have at least one relic charge left.
                You probably had no relic charge left while your bf had some
                    But I never actually use my Relic for anything but reviving my bf outside of boss fights, and he doesn't get downed enough to eat all my Relics.

I know that would be the cause *sometimes*, and it may have even been the cause in that specific example where my dog revived him instead of me, but in 10+ hours not more than two revives from the dog doesn't check out.
                        If you switched your handler to secondary, it won't work. Also, the dog won't heal for 90 seconds after reviving you or someone else once.
                            I know. My bf doesn't really get downed outside of bosses though, so it shouldn't be on cooldown that often. The only thing I can think of that could be causing a weird interaction is that it might be going on cooldown from the Dog *trying* to revive me, only for it to not get a chance to even start the animation because my bf is running as a Medic and uses the third(?) skill that revives instantly pretty much the second I get downed. Otherwise, I really don't know what's up with the behavior.

I didn't swap Handler to secondary until several hours of play without any more than two instances of it reviving us.
                                Its working as intended for me tbh so hard to say why it dont work in your case
                        My buddy was having this issue yesterday too. I tried to troubleshoot it with him, but it does seem like there’s a bug.

He had relic charges, dog wasn’t on cool down because he never revived anyone. The Handler was the primary class too. At some point he just started reviving people, but yeah he wasn’t being the best boy there for a good chunk of our playtime
                Well thats the classic case of the dog having a favorite.
                It can only be done once every 60 seconds or so. It says this in the ability.

And you need a relic charge
                    Yes, I know.
                Yea looks like they have to make better priority for reviving teammates with doggy. I have never encountered problems with the dog reviving me or teammates probably because i never use the ping commands on the dog and only ever used the double tap command and hold, i’m guessing when you try and revive a teammate they have too many mobs on top of them?
    Exactly my experience with the last boss. So incredibly frustrating.
Summoner and handler just feel bad. They don't scale well at all. One day a game is going to have a great minion build that scales to endgame and harder difficulties.
    yeah... summoner flyers and reavers can do well enough in veteran but you have to invest into it a LOT(you're gonna wanna get a good few ranks into rugged and siphoner traits at least + the ring that shares half of your healing to allies) and basically babysit their health

ended up running medic(primary)/summoner for most of my 1st run just to keep them alive reliably and even then i struggled to keep them from dying constantly until finding the good gear, which took some adventure rolling, least it also made me very tanky too(was basically face tanking the final boss cause of the way my relic's healing worked, constant healing and constant free relic uses)

&#x200B;

also sucks that summons dont have a command function like the dog, would be nice to be able to make them focus an enemy or force them to move back to you... and then the dog is just sad tbh, least as a minion, the best thing it offers is the self revive if primary archetype but ideally one should not be dying at all and i dont think it works if the dog is downed and that dog loves being downed, baffles me that one of its skills is an aggro drawing one, that dog has glass bones and paper skin
        popped open from the ashes again and man the skulls from the Beckon mod are so much more aggressive than the summoner Flyers, and their projectiles are at least twice as fast if not faster

&#x200B;

and that dog, annoying as the constant barking was, hits hard as hell, it hits as hard if not harder than the reaver and i dont even have evocation
Dog is also useless on high difficulties.
    Been fine for me on nightmare
        Im on hard and my dog only does 80 damage a hit. Very Good boy could easily do 300 a bite so he's definitely not as as good
Yeah the dog us useless against 90%of the enemies
I find it crazy that people actually want a dog to attack flying enemies... like he's a dog, a 4 legged grounded creature...

While you have a gun
    [deleted]
        free revive and ranged revive on your friends is pretty dang good, just beat the game with handler main 100% of the time, during longer boss fights like the last one you can pretty much get an assured 3-4 rezzes off during the phases where you don't have enough time otherwise. the damage skill ain't that shabby either
        There's secondary class for a reason. You don't always need to have handler as primary if you are worried about DPS. The only mayor factor in having handler as primary is the dog reviving you. If you want DPS, use another archetype as primary

Your dog also has increase dmg support buff as well, use that too

I am hunter main and do just fine with my DPS soloing veteran
            [deleted]
                I'd go unlock the engineer class - really easy to get. Alongside gunslinger, engineer does the almost the same DPS and has the ability to summon turrets
    I agree with this. The dog is 90% support. No way homie is helping with aerial stuff.
    so? he could jump into the air to do a bite attack or something
        ahh yes, let a dog jump 10feet in the air. Definitely a valid response...
            Yes, very strange to think that the dog that magically appears when we equip a whistle and can somehow heal you or make your guns hurt things more by howling could potentially jump high.
            Considering all the magic shit in this game, sure, why not. German shepards can jump about 5-6 feet high in real life. Give them magic dog shoes or some shit
                Doggie jet boots lmao
            Compared to everything else the dog can do, jumping is not that far fetched.
            I watched my dog fall off a thousand foot tower but then he just appeared behind me
    The dog should shoot lasers from its eyes or mouth
wish they'd give the dog silly ranged attack at least to use against out of range or flying enemies/bosses

&#x200B;

game is over the top enough to have it fit imo, give it smth like pulling out a knife out of its little doggy vest with its mouth to throw at enemies
My dog trying to fight the cubes in the labyrinth was pretty entertaining though.
Yeh. Having the dog and rolly polly summons and getting shit on by flyers made me sadge
Yeah, the dog gets replaced by the root flyers pretty immediately after unlocking them on summoner
Even the RANGED Summoner minions don't do anything against some world bosses. They just float forward off the platform
I got a nifty invader/challenger setup going I even managed to hit upwards of 7.8k with my knuckledusters once running it, but then I got to the final boss and all I could think was "Who ever designed this boss just said fuck everyone who wanted to use a shotgun or melee".
    one of the annihilation no damage annihilation kills floating around on here I think is a coachgun and double barrel set up. Shotguns have more effective range than you think, I don't recall there being a boss ive encountered where my shotgun couldn't perform.
        Coach Gun in general is just really strong because it actually has range due to firing slugs.
            I play shotgun and with the right rings, traits, they basically all do.
    The shotgun works great on endgame bosses, but you need to use Hunter as your secondary (or level the trait accordingly). That extra "ideal range" is pretty grody on shotties and turns Sporebloom into an elephant gun; just be sure to take the -spread trait as well.
    Melee on final boss? Sure. Shotguns? No you absolutely can
    And many summons. (Also applies to like, 50% of the bosses)
the only way to 'melee' the final boss is to use atom splitter or the electric axe as far as i know which is what i did with atom splitter, its kinda lame how often it turns into "this is my boss weapon" because most of the major bosses cant be melee'd. Heck so many flying enemies too
    There is also a throwing spear. Good for proccing melee mutators and not much else.
        There's another two once you clear the game on harder modes.

I feel like there's a really strong build with the >!Hero's Blade or World's Edge!< and pairing it with the Butcher's Fetish; 15% crit rate and 25% crit dam are pretty great for just mixing in a charge attack occasionally. Those two weapons also don't have extra stamina costs on the attacks so it's less damning using them.

Shoutout to Spectral Blade for also enabling this easily on *most* bosses; can hit them around corners or through walls. Lots of ways to enable the stronger trinkets!
            I like the shock axe myself! None of them are meta damage output though, I don’t think.
                It's not meta damage (only high-damage melee weapon I've found is Stonebreaker, but it only works on ground bosses), but tbh Butcher's Idol is one of the highest DPS upgrades amongst amulets you can reasonably get, but mostly because crit-damage is so insanely rare (and it gives more value to other mods, i.e. the Corrosive weapon mod is pretty awful compared to the Fire one until you've got enough crit damage to spruce it up).

It really just depends on the build you rock though and the weapon you enjoy; not all builds have room for that many amulets/trinkets, sadly.
    if you shoot all the orbs on the boss’ 2nd phase she drops down into melee range for quick dps window. difficult to pull off without enigma tho
    Yeah but electric axe + melee bleeds + dmg against bleed targets is my precious baby
        make it do more damage from buffs >:D
fyi its "cue" in this case, not "queue" -- not trying to gotcha, just letting you know
    I was just imagining all the bosses standing in a queue
    Lol, thank you.
Regarding the grenade lady. You can shoot her bomb when she takes it out snd it blows up doing a bunch of damage and she'll keep doing it over and over so its pretty consistent. Also if you hug the wall you can get some good damage on her with the shotgun.
Lmao same, I'm doing challenger/engineer with an emphasis on melee dmg after I use the challenger ability. Having to change my strategy because the boss is impossible with my (I would call it intended) build feels bad

But I'm also too stubborn so I'll just get better or find a new trait card that will help
Remnant in my experience has always been a game where one build rarely works for everything. When you fight bosses many of them require different approaches and for me that's a huge part of the fun. Lot of adds? AoE mods. Tight corridors? Melee build. Flying bosses? Single target ranged attacks. It's not perfect. Gunslinger Hunter can handle just about anything while melee certainly feels much more limited but I think that's mainly because gunslinger Hunter is just too strong. 

Remnant is meant to be hard and bosses are often vastly different for a reason. I wouldn't personally want any one build to be able to handle even half the fights in the game. Remnant gives you hundreds of items and mods. Why use one setup all the time?
    this would be fine if it wasnt expensive to not only respect, but also level up other equipment for different builds
        That's a fair point but they've said they are looking into the costs of those things. Granted it's an issue right now so I can see how people would be frustrated. All of my traits are pretty generic so I don't really respec for anything and I have plenty of material at this point so I haven't really had much issue personally.
        Levelling up equipment isn't that bad, you just might want to reroll a few areas, or help a few people, or just rest and grind a bit if you prefer, rather than a streamlined "almost fully upgraded all the time" because you dump everything into your favourite few weapons.
i know on the fiurst half of the fight, you can roll through a lot of attacks and get a hit in, but that's really it since the fucker pulls and flys away so frequently.
Have you used the flying summon against bosses and watched them spend the whole fight *not* using their ranged attack and constantly *falling to their death!?* instead? Fun.
    I can't fully express how disappointed I was in the flying summons. Their ranged attack is great, but they don't seem to know how to use it. Plus the fact they can fall off a map and die is just baffling.

The Ravager, on the other hand, is pretty amazing, if not also somewhat mentally challenged.
        On Losomn being a summoner is hard work. There's these non hostile pig looking things walking around and if your summons see them they just stop and stare at them. You can be halfway across the map and they'll still be staring at the pig

They won't go back to following you unless you kill the pig, and if they spot a pig before they spot an enemy they'll just stare at it even if they're surrounded by enemies.

Gotta kill these pigs on sight if you don't want your summons to go goofing off which is kinda annoying but also kinda hilarious

My guess it's locked on to it as if it's an enemy, but it's still somewhere registered as "not an enemy", so it's just stuck in this lock on limbo because it can't get a new lock on without killing the current locked on target
            The dog does it too! I had to shoot them all or the dog would follow them around like "IT'S BACON!!!"
            Is it the same in the fae areas with the faes hiding as statues that come to life when you walk past them? As an engineer my turret just seems to shoot random things in the sky until I realised they're statues that I can't get close enough to trigger them spawning.
                Yep that too. Was really confused why my summons were shooting at stuff that wasn't (to me) there
                I actually found that handy when i was playing, i could located the fea and shoot them before they ganked me for 30% of my health
        Bonus, the flyers get stuck in the floor of phase 2 of final boss. Rendering them even more useless.
            They also have issues following you if you use an elevator. Had to blow em up multiple times.
            Yeah, most pets seem to get stuck in the floor on the final boss. Not that they're much help anyway due to the boss' erratic movement patterns.
            That exact reason is why I swapped from Summoner/Engineer for the last fight to Engineer/Summoner.

Overclocked Gatling laser cannot be stuck on the door, and then I just sacrificed the flyers over and over
            The summons dont deal well with character transportation of any kind. 

So a fight where you are repeatedly teliported from locations is going to cause problems.
    lol… yep! I tried swapping summons before fights to see if that would “fix” them just sitting there and nope. Good times! lol… i really do love the dog and summons, and at times it really is a fun combo build. But there are also times where I felt like I completely wasted my build doing it that way.
    I was pretty sad that there were a few bosses that my flying summons just refused to hit, despite being ranged but honestly. Not enough to get over summoners value in regen having some autonomous damage. (My guess is since summons can move freely they are programmed to only hit enemies in bounds and certain bosses are out of bounds technically)
I mean level 5 and 10 summons work fine, the lvl 5 ones primarily shoot it seems and if something is out of reach for the lvl 10 then it throws its arms at them, or if they are on the ground but it just doesn’t feel like running over it’ll also throw its arms lol
The huntress spear isn't a **good** ranged weapon. But that little spin when you heft it makes me use it a lot more than I should.
    Wait. Theres more than one melee weapon you can throw? Right now im just using that krell axe because it helps me with my ammo economy.

And the little debuff is nice too.
        The huntress spear from the lady in Bloodborne-ville is thrown too. And it looks so fuckin cool
        The throwing spear feels so damn good, AND you can pretend your spear fishing cross dimensions!
            the fact that you can impale your friends and NPCs in the ward with spears and they just..... stick out of their bodies is the best.

feels a little weird they let it happen with the children though....
                I forgot about this and it’s a top tier fact
            It's also quite fast for it's basic attack. Pretty good melee weapon so far imo.
        Huntress' Spear, Hero's Sword, that flame GS, Krell Axe
        These aren't the exact names, but:

Krell Axe, Huntress Spear, World's Edge, Atom Splitter, and Hero's Blade all can work on any boss (I think) to proc on-melee effects.

Spectral Blade works on almost every boss, except the big "stand far away and constantly DPS the weakpoint" ones. It's better against those that chase you around since you can still hit them from behind cover.

Stonebreaker works on ground-based bosses from a safe range, but tbh Stonebreaker's also the only "good" melee weapon for DPS I've found; the charge attack hits like a nuke up close and doesn't demand you constantly keep attacking or leaving yourself exposed to get in damage. Feels like a great weapon for dodging an attack, then punching the boss in the mouth.
    Hell yeah it's good. 💪🏻
Use the huntress spear with the ring that gives you max Hp shield for every 25 stamina used. It conveniently uses exactly 25 stamina haha. Combine with the ring that heals max hp while you have a shield and you’re cooking with a melee build that makes you tanky and has range
    Or the amulet that gives 35% more melee damage AND 10 stam back on hit

That mutation with the stacking damage and speed per hit.

I’m really trying to make this think work 😂
        Use both! Sounds fun haha. You’d spend the 25 stam on the throw, then when it connects you’d get 10 back heh
            There's a mutator that gives you a shield on every melee hit which further synergizes with the generating band ring that recovers hp while shielded
                Yeah, but once fully levelled up that mutator consumes shields on charge attack for a damage bonus. Good if you;'re actually close quarters, bad if you're using the spear to haha funny enemies *and* build shield.
    I’m big on the Huntress spear + vengeful strike mutation + vengeance idol amulet. Gotta have the ring of restriction so you’ll be stuck with half hp too. 

I’m throwing ballistic missiles with all of these damage bonuses.
As far as the game is concerned it does.
Yes
Technically yes, thematically no.
I just got this axe yesterday, is it worth pumping levels into? Still using Challenger default weapon at +8.
    Not really. It deals shock damage and inflicts overload, which can be kind of neat, but the damage is rather low. Honestly the Iron Greatsword is just so good that it's hard to replace. I'd look for the Atom Splitter as a viable replacement. It's not difficult to get, but it is an RNG find since it can spawn in multiple dungeons and you need to find the correct room it spawns in.
        Great to know, thanks. Will look up the Atom Splitter. Iron Greatsword has been pretty damn good so far!
            If you ever manage to beat the game on Apocalypse, there's also the World's Edge which is almost a direct upgrade to the Iron Greatsword. Same attack animation, almost the same damage values, but it also shoots a wide beam on charge attacks, like the Hero's Sword.
            Atom Splitter is good for charge attacks, but has really low melee damage otherwise when compared to other greats swords, just something to keep in mind.
Ooh, where does one acquire this weapon? It sounds awesome.
    Assuming that OP is talking about the Atom Splitter and not the Atom Smasher. Atom Splitter is a relatively hard to find sword as it's in one of the side dungeons of N'erud randomly based on their generation. You need to jump on one of the metal pieces that the big fingers are lifting up, and have it carry you to a higher platform where the sword is hidden. Best to look up a guide/wiki page.
        Got it, thank you!
            I've seen the room it spawns in in three different dungeons so far. Vault of the formless, void vessel facility, and the story dungeon where you fight the big rolling blob.

Large room, foggy ceiling, large pillars full of stasis pods and spindly fingers that are grabbing and lifting different section of the pillars.
    You have to roll a certain tile set with moving machine in nerud. Can spawn in any dungeon. 

The sword is so satisfying because you can just launch one wave beam and decimate a whole group.

I've had one wave attack do like 1500 damage.
        Does it spawn in any dungeon? I've only seen it spawn in three locations so far, all dryzyr zombie dungeons. I could see the space crab dungeons also working as the use a slightly modified tileset, but I don't see how the tile will fit into the spire type dungeons.
            I found it in hatchery but the tile set should have multiple spawn areas
    The atom smasher is in Nerud. While in any dungeon with the pod towers, there is a section that just seems to lead to a broken edge. You have to wait for the mechanical arms to grab a pod section at your level then jump on it. It will pull you up and you need to jump off onto a ledge that's about 1 story above the initial jump point. The atom smasher is in there. 

It looks like a Xenoblade sword
How does that work? I'm on PC and I can't get it to shoot anything.
    Standing still, you hit spacebar to evade back and then hold down the right mouse button. Quite a few melee weapons have this combo for a special attack
        right mouse button for melee?
            Neutral backdash + hold LMB, not right
    I'm on PS5 and I just use a back button to dodge then hold melee. You have to be standing still too.
    They are referring to the Atom SPLITTER, not the Atom Smasher. Just to be clear in case you didn't catch that. The Smasher cannot shoot waves.
        It was clear, thanks.
>It's such a crazy good weapon

Have you used like... any other weapon in this game? The Atom Splitter is one of the slowest melee weapons in the game tied with weapons like Iron Greatsword whilst doing half their damage without the beam and only about tied damage with the beam. If you want a ranged melee, Huntress or Krell will just far outperform it, and if you want a melee weapon that performs better in melee but has some ranged utility, Stonebreaker is basically the same weapon except it has actual damage.

Atom Splitter is cool, but not only is it not a "crazy good weapon", it is arguably one of the worst in the game. Enjoy the weapon if you want but to say it makes it so that melee weapons are super good against anything is just wrong especially as not only is it not good compared to ranged weapons, it isn't even good compared to other melee weapons which as OP has stated is clearly problematic.
    Don't care, I've used the weapon a ton and had tons of success with it. Fun > meta
        Cool. Then say that instead of saying it is good.

Or better yet, don't say it at all because that isn't that this post is about in the first place. Obviously people can play to have fun, this post isn't that: It is about how hard people are punished for that. Like you tried to make a counterargument by bringing that up and instead just proved OP's point.
            Lol wut? 

I've been destroying bosses and elites with the weapon, tested by combat to be awesome for me. I've used it for like 20 some hours of my playtime and it's just destroyed everything I've fought.
                >I've been destroying bosses and elites with the weapon

Sure, because you can destroy any boss with almost any weapon. This game is not that hard.

But this weapon is objectively one of the worst at doing it.
                    It one shots most enemies lol

Why would I need something that one shots better

Why try to even gatekeep me for enjoying a really fun weapon and having success with it
                        >It one shots most enemies lol

So do many weapons.

>Why would I need something that one shots better

Because this is a game primarily about boss fights and you don't one shot bosses.

>Why try to even gatekeep me

It isn't gatekeeping. You said it was one of the best weapons and factually it isn't. You can use it all you want, I'm not telling you that you can't.

But sure, be the crybaby attention seeker who gets all defensive as soon as anyone says anything that goes against your viewpoint after you bring an irrelevant statement to someone else's post. You are free to do that.
                            You care way too much about this. Just go have fun with your meta bullshit.
                                "You care way too much about this"

Says the guy who is constantly replying to make himself feel better about not being able to read and having the education of someone who didn't pass high school.

Edit: the classic try to get the last word and then quickly block the other guy. Obviously the move of someone who isn't insecure.
Can you aim atom Splitter? The one I know you can aim you have to beat the game on apocalypse to unlock...so therefore do all the content of the game.
    You can! The range is actually farther than my plasma cutter too. It's crazy. I've been running around yaesha sniping the floating triangles with it.
        Even better, if ya decide to pair it with the Hunter's scan, you can even snipe enemies through walls since the beam kinda ignores them!
            That's genius. I will be trying that. The sword going through environments and the range definitely makes up for its lesser damage.
There's a better wave attack melee weapon in the World's Edge using charged attacks instead of evade neutral but you have to beat Apocalypse for it to be obtainable.  There's also the Hero Sword (also charge attack wave beam) which is the starting weapon for the Explorer, but no confirmed way to get this yet outside of starting a new Explorer.
    Yeahhh I'm good with what I have. Not sure if I'll attempt apocalypse. Maybe someday
Don’t forget the Bloodstone ring so you can apply both bleed and overload at the same time.
    I forgot about that ring! It was one of my faves in FTA
Sort of but even then: It is just a straight downgrade from ranged weapons.
[deleted]
    uh.. what? my huntress spear does like 2400 dmg on headshots/weakspots. The dmg does definitely vary but is generally in the high 3 digits low 1000s. Are you sure you're actually fully specced into melee when you were using the spear???  


The only issue I have with it is running out of stamina and things dodging it. It also isn't supposed to be better than guns when you have to resort to using it; it's likely meant to just give you a suboptimal option when you don't want to use guns or run out of ammo, unless you have a  lot of skill, in which case it can be on par with a lot of guns (obviously not optimized hunter/gunner nightfall builds, but nothing else is on par with that level of power) -- at again the benefit of infinite uses since it requires no ammo management or reloading.
        Matriarchs amulet gives you 35% melee damage and 10 stamina on melee hits, a must for melee builds
            Oooh, throwing the spear uses 25 stamina, you can combine the ring that gives max shield when you use 25 stam. With that amulet it works like throw > spend 25 and get shield > hit > get 10 stam back
            The butchers amulet is also good for the melee builds that focus on charge attacks.
                I will go look this up rn…!
        You lose stamina throwing it??I have never seen mine drop when my character does it???
            Stamina is not used outside of combat
If you start fight with it it will be for free ;)
        Would you say the huntresses spear is better than krells axe?

It seemed much harder to get, but damage didn’t seem any better when factoring in the multiple shock explosions krells gets
    I find value int he throwing of melee weapons because you can slot the ammo generator mutator into it
There’s a throwing axe in Yaesha as well, that autoinflicts the electric status
I just challenged everything with my shotgun. The buffs you get for the archetype help in close range so I just wade in there and start blasting and dodging.
    My only gripe with the auto shotgun is that it's so good it took me a while to upgrade something else worthwhile.
I use it for the 3 free stacks of bulwark on my tank build.  I haven't found another use for the class yet.
Well its pretty hard to kill with regen absorbs and reductions that can be taken,
beside that you may be right tho ;)
Usually summons are a bit slower just hitting something on the side giving bulwark charges and lifestealing for you 

Hard to say how anoing they are for party tho meet couple ppls with simillar build and never had problems with it really personally 
With 80% reduced ff i just zap enigma through everything anyway :)
I just beat it on nightmare as handler/engineer. Dog does alright healing and tanking for the turret, and the turret kicks ass.
Second tier is still good to use because of damage and stagger reduction
    That makes a lot of sense. Will keep it in mind!
Challenger does improve as you level. I did have some difficulty at first but now I have no issues at all. 

I just leveled hard into vigor and siphoning, got some rings/aspects for barrier gen. and health regen while barrier is active. I can tank most anything now
Yeah, wouldn’t the game just turn into darksouls/eldenring? Why are people so hung up about doing melee it this game 😄？
;)

Thinking through it all the only bosses I'm at a complete loss for are bloat king and mother mind, and maybe the giant servitor eye, everything else can be done with predominately melee but some will be painful. The parasite boss on nerud is a decent example, you need to shoot down the host with ranged but then the bug itself is extremely vulnerable to melee. Corruptor will be an absolute pain, but it takes damage when it revives the golem so it's still doable. The guardian of nerud has melee-able giant hands spawn in the off-phase, you might even be able to cleave 2 of them at once with some aoe melee skills. Overall I think it's doable, but there's definitely a few encounters you'll be doing extra work for and a handful that just feel bad.
I think one of the few amulets that didn't return from Remnant 1 was the White Rose, which gave you a 25% damage boost for each empty gun slot. I think the main reason is because we can do a lot more damage with skills/mods/summons/heavy weapons than we could before, but also because a pure melee build is completely unviable.
This is true, but there are a lot of bosses and even regular enemies that can't be hit at all with melee, and that's really silly. Your point of swapping to guns is fair for regular enemies, because those don't have massive health pools, but bosses? 

Having melee be harder (you're in danger more often, you need to stick to the boss) or having brief periods in a fight where the boss is inaccessible is totally fine. I'm on my third world and at least six of the bosses I've rolled have been completely impossible as melee. Part of that could be bad luck with the RNG, but also consider that the Dog and Summons can't or at best barely do anything to anything that requires range. Even though the second and third summon all have ranged attacks, their AI seems to break when enemies aren't grounded leading to them often just standing around doing nothing. 

Side note grief: The second summon literally states it's a flier yet it isn't actually flying, body blocks just as bad as any ground summon, and falls to its death (very willfully, in fact) as often as possible. Madge. :(
The problem is the gun is almost always more practical. I haven't seen any boss that punishes you for using a gun, but many punish you for going melee. Even in standard co-op situations, it's usually easier for everyone to use a gun rather than have anyone in melee who risks getting hit by friendly fire and complicates the use of AoE attacks. And I've noticed a lot of bosses that teleport around to different people in co-op, making it difficult for a melee to catch up and land anything, so they spend most of the fight with their gun out and at that point why are you even bothering to build melee?
    That big dog in the sewer event wasn't even able to attack me when I just kept smacking its hind legs with tal rathas face hammer, it's only has a charge and a kick, both need a charge first
    > I haven't seen any boss that punishes you for using a gun, but many punish you for going melee. 

Venom is far easier in melee than at range imo
        When you can hit him, as many angles will cause you to hit his protective cloak or go under his floating body. I would say he's still better to fight up close, just **with** a gun.
    The robot boss that sucks you into melee range is pretty tough to just shoot
        Any of the red bosses with the vortex modifier can go fuck right off. Got one that you have to fight in some small corridors and it was absolute hell trying to see what was going on.
There are melee weapons that have ranged attacks like the Krell Axe, Huntress Spear, The Hero's Sword, and World's Edge. They aren't ideal of course but there are options for it. The first two just take some luck on a first go.
    (Don’t forget the beauty of Atom Splitter)
        Does it also have one? Only one I don't have.
            Yes sir/ma’am/????
You can always unequip your guns lol
    I wonder if that ring that gives you bonuses for each unequipped weapons made it into Remnant 2...
        I know there's the Daredevil ring for unequipped armour, but I haven't heard of one for unequipped weapons.
            I thought daredevil ring was any unequipped item in this game
                Only unequipped armor slots. It also gives you negative damage resist for each slot, so it turns you into a pure glass cannon, which would be terrible for melee.
            https://remnantfromtheashes.wiki.fextralife.com/White+Rose

My bad, it was a Necklace.
Melee rings/mutations are fine. Especially if you're doing a Bleed/Leech or 50% HP build.

Once the Shieldbreaker mutator is fixed, faster melee weapons will also be able to get super tanky by utilizing it along with the Damage/Lifesteal Shield amulet and the 3% hp regen while shielded ring.

Ultimately, the issue isn't even melee as a mechanic. Having some bosses you need to shoot is nice and forces you to learn that style of play. It's that bosses have a weird amount of one-shot moves at melee range. granted, I am in Void armor, not Leto's, but that's still heavy, so I was a bit shocked when Tal'Ratha's belly bump move, which has barely any windup, murdered me.
    there are some pretty weak outlier melee mods, extremely situational and even in that situation are weaker than the others. Essentially if we compare it to the 50% hp mod or the lifesteal mod how much less desireable they are to them

like say "disengage" it caps at +10% per stack (50% damage) for backdash attacks but it only seems to apply to the base kinda like adding +50% melee damage for 1 attack if you got the 5 stacks and otherwise not doing anything. I would expect it should see a much bigger number since its so situational compared to a universally at all times good mod

i super agree though i mostly run into the issue where its really unsatisfying where im at 80%+ total DR at 155 hp and still die in one shot or take like 90%+ hp damage from just a regular swipe
        Something is currently wrong with the DR mechanic, I swear.

Others have noticed it too, it seems like Armor and flat are multiplicative, which is punishing for anyone not running Leto's armor, and honestly kind of irritating. Heavier armor should mean you have to invest less to reach cap and can thus get other stats. The way it's working just means everyone is going to end up running around in Leto's armor with 80% flat dr or risk getting oneshot.

Like if you have 40% armor DR and 40% flat currently, if it's multiplicative, that's only 64% DR. Compared to 80%, that's **80% more** damage taken.

Personally I want a strict cap at 80%, or an "overflow" mechanic where excess DR% over 80% becomes multiplicative and thus is subject to large diminishing returns. Could still have Havel/Leto's Monsters running around and having huge DR while not punishing everyone else that way. Alternatively could have Bulwark exceed the DR cap, but only give 2% DR if it's past cap, to make Bulwark feel more like the GIGA TANK mechanic.
            oh my god i didnt know it was multiplicative, that explains a lot

is it always armor is base and DR is multiplied to it or whichever is higher then multiplicative from whichever of the two is lower? that definitely means i need a more DR to actually hit the invisible cap well fuck me lol
                It's not confirmed, just an observation shared by players. The way the stat screen presents it is that it should be additive. However, there was a good post about a guy clearing Apocalypse where he discusses that Flat DR that exceeded cap was definitely doing something.

Also it wouldn't matter what the "base" is, since it would just be multiplying the remainder of damage. (1-DRa)x(1-DRf)
If I recall, hard-core rewards stop at veteran, and world's edge is just an apocalypse reward
    Then fextra has lied to me. Thank you for the information

Edit: it’s been updated so the wiki is correct now :)
Would have to beat the game on harder difficulties for those, huntress' spear, krell axe, and atom splitter also work
In that case, traits should be refundable on the fly.
    That they should; it's another thing to file under design conflict.
This.
I have yet to see a boss who's easier to melee than shoot, it's not like your gun stops working when they're in your face.

Meanwhile the opposite definitely exists, have fun meleeing the cube boss or anybody who flies lol.
    Red prince is a joke with a melee build
    Okay, the Cube Boss is a horrible example because it’s more of a puzzle than a real boss.
    The Root Tree boss lol, only one I can think of (random side boss in Yaesha) maybe Kaeula or whatever the name.

Honestly, most of Yaesha in general is very melee friendly compared to the rest of the game.
        The Root Nexus? It's an immobile target, prime for shooting. And it even gets a special attack if you're meleeing it to mildly punish melee (it can grab you).
            Can’t remember what it is called but the big tree that doesn’t move.

It doesn’t do anything other than summoning adds.

Literally doesn’t do a single attack.
                No, that's the boss I'm talking about, it does have a single attack: it can grab you with roots while you're in melee. Unless that's something one of the adds does.
                    I believe that’s one of the elite adds.
                    It's literally what one of the adds does. Roots you and gives you Root Rot status effect. The tree tank elite. Annoying monster.
                        Gotcha. Never encountered it while actually fighting the enemy, is it attached to the big shockwave attack?
        That’s what I’m saying is that there’s tons of places melee is usable but because it’s not like dark souls where almost everything is just a punch out they feel melee is unusable 😂
            There's also a lot of places where melee is completely unusable. But I haven't run into any situation where a gun is unusable...and very few situations where a gun is not more practical and easier in every way.
                Nerud any of the building and places with the zombies and crickets. Laesha most of the enemies besides flying one. I could go on an on the whole thing is sure melee is unusable if you can’t dodge or can’t learn timing. Acting as if melee is unusable is just goofy since it’s surely able to be used but there’s a reason why the game gives a primary, secondary, and melee. Primary = damage secondary = capacity and minimum damage melee  = aoe and crowd control
                    The unusable part refers to flying enemies and bosses, when you literally cannot reach enemies. Outside of that, melee merely finds itself at a disadvantage in a lot of situations. Having to chase after bosses teleporting to teammates, increasing the risk of friendly fire, making it harder for allies to use AoE attacks...guns just have a lot less nonsense to put up with, at least until you start using ranged melee weapons.  

It just makes melee build options feel really out of place.
        Root Nexus didn't seem possible to hit the weak spot with melee weapons, leading to all melee damage being grey. If I'm wrong and it's possible, then I think it's very unreliable at least. *Technically* killable as melee, but holy hell will it take awhile.
            I did that only hitting the nexus with melee since I was running out of ammo and it was the first encounter I found in my campaign. You can hit the weakspot with melee on a specific side of it.
            [deleted]
                Maybe? I tried Edge of the Forest and Scrap Greatsword.
                    you have to basically pretend that your melee is an aimable veryveryvery short range gun and depending on the weapon, where your reticle is when the 'shot' goes off determines if you get a weakspot/hit/whiff. 

Trick is to aim at the larger glowing red parts of the trunk as aiming for the smaller red parts surrounded by 'regular root trunk' has a much higher chance of getting resisted, especially when you get shoved around by all the adds.

Also recommend trying the engineer's turret melee as even with a crappy build i was hitting something like 3-4k on the juicy red parts of the tree. I've no clue how quickly you could destroy it if you went with an actual melee build, but I'm assuming much, much faster.
    Well the cube Boss doesn't require dpa anyway.
    There are definitely some bosses that I think I could easily take with a melee weapon but at the end of the day I really just used my melee for little mobs that crowd me. Which I honestly feel may have been the only reason melee exists to be completely honest with you. Like In Nerud you have the crickets and blobs that rush you and melee cleans them up nicely. You also have the rolly dudes on laesha that melee helps a lot with. But to say that melee is pointless I do get it but you once again have to just figure it out. Also dark souls had flying bosses and enemies that you had to wait until they got close to you or you had to wait til they landed. So it’s not an uncommon thing but since there are guns it’s rare these flying enemies land.
    the benefit of melee isn't necessarily that it's easier to take down a boss with than not. It's that it does not require (relatively speaking) aiming, ammo, or reloading. Melee light attack spam doesn't even use stamina, and there's a ring that will help if for whatever reason you need to heavy spam. Melee also has such incredibly high bonuses compared to range, it allows you to scale more efficiently while also having very high DR. Like the fact that there's an amulet that gives ***THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT*** melee dmg with not only NO downsides or conditions AND gives an ADDITIONAL benefit of 10 stamina replenished ON MELEE HIT (not even kill), is ***insane***  


Ranged amulets are like you get a significantly lower dmg bonus (usually around 20% compared to, again ***35%***) ***IF*** you meet a condition, like on kill, or at a certain health threshold etc. Like it's comically easy to reach 80% DR while maintaining dmg on melee, esp since you can use "when hit by enemy" procs since that's almost \_bound\_ to happen, whereas most ranged builds play on the premise they shouldn't get hit much, if at all.   


As for cube boss, that is wholly irrelevant since the cube nodes die to a single shot and you always have guns equipped even if you don't normally use them. Even with zero investment in range on your jewelry/traits/archetype, you will one shot the nodes on the cube boss. Your build is irrelevant in that fight for 90% of builds out there, and that 10% is basically if you have something like increased movement speed, or invader movement shenanigans. It's basically all one shots in both directions.  


Fliers are absolutely a pain for melee though; that is 100% true, but I like that using different builds for different bosses is a thing in this game. I do wish fliers at least had a landing sequence in their rotation for my melee users out there.  


(meanwhile I'm doing a mod monkey build and praying i dont' one shot myself with starshot because "big numbers go brr", so maybe i shouldn't talk about build efficiency after all aha)
        This is all very cool (genuinely, I plan to do a melee build at some point so knowing a few of the options is neat) but I think people are reading something into my post which I never said ("melee is useless") rather than what I did ("ranged attacks are usable in all circumstances, melee is more situational").
        &#x200B;

>THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT melee dmg

With is only 5% more damage than what ranged can get. Except ranged has higher than 5% dps base most of the time. SO they actually get more bonus from the 30% than melee gets from 35% because percentage works better the higher the base DPS is.

So not only is it *not* insane, it isn't even that good
    I had a much easier time meleeing one of the root bosses. Some old treet hat that likes generating big death zones if you arent in its face.
    I mean a nice melee focused build can pretty much face tank and shred but part of the problem is a lot of bosses being impossible to actually get in melee range of or having happy feet and no downtime to actually melee
Exactly this. There are literally tips in the load screens that say melee is intended for mobs and conserving ammo. It’s completely reasonable design- they want your character to be multifaceted because they need to be against their environment
    Exactly like I’m sick of everyone pitching a fit about melee when it’s literally explained. Like did everyone forget it’s dark souls with GUNS why would it be melee focused. It would just be another dark souls clone and people would than whine about that
        Did you *play* Remnant 1?

You realise they talked about giving more of a niche to melee centric playstyles in this game, right? When it overall is a bit worse than 1 due to enemy design?

It's just a slightly less rough start, but otherwise not as good.

Don't give people a wide range of melee loot, a large number of melee trinkets, and a class which has an entire skill based exclusively around improving melee if you don't want people to try and focus on melee.

Given they *did* all that, and what they've said in the past, I'd hazard a guess they absolutely *do* want the option of melee to be an entirely valid method of play.

Much like you probably swing your melee here and there, people who want to play melee understand they'll need to shoot. It's the ratio that's the issue.

**EDIT:** Like, to be clear, melee *would* be better in this game. They have made a HUGE number of changes to improve it. But then they made half the enemies fly, most of the bosses hell to melee, and gave them frankly gross close range damage.

So close, GFG. So close.
My only complaint with challenger is that their starter ability feels awful if you roll N'Erud first world. They need to give it more range, both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to stun/knockdown bosses for a few seconds. Also some better way to scale damage since most ability damage is just for mods, not skills...

Aside from that, I think Challenger/Melee are fine. Challenger even gets one of the most absurd ranged skills in the entire game. Rampage crazy
I think a few bosses could change a bit to allow for more melee fights, but I do think a lot of bosses shouldn't be melee capable. Part of what makes remnant great is that you often need to adapt to a fight. I don't think there should be a build that can handle any fight without an issue. Modifying your load out to adapt to bosses is one of the best parts of the game. 

I mean, granted gunslinger/hunter exists and that can handle everything but I try to use other builds to have fun and change things up.
I don't get it as well. This is a shooter that has a melee option, but it's a shooter. You can play however you want, but you'll have limitations. The devs specifically said they wanted to make melee good and interesting, but the main focus of the game is to shoot things.
The difference is that ranged focus builds are *never* forced to use melee.
    The game is a shooter first and foremost. Why do you people act like melee options need to be on the same level as guns? Melee is clearly there to allow the player to mix it up/have fun against regular enemies and some mini bosses but the main options are definitely the guns.

This is like complaining that guns are not as effective as melee  to kill shit in Devil May Cry. They are not supposed to.
        >The game is a shooter first and foremost

Dark Souls is a melee combat game first and foremost. You can still make a pure Sorcerer build work very *very* well if you spec completely into it.

>hy do you people act like melee options need to be on the same level as guns

It doesn't, but unlike Remnant 1 they clearly designed many *many* pieces of gear and skills around that so it *should* be.
            I know it takes a lot of inspiration from it but it's not Dark Souls, it's Remnant and the developers obviously see their game as a shooter with melee acting only as a secondary option. Having gear and skills for your secondary doesn't mean it should be usable as a primary.

How about you guys just play the game that's in front of you instead of trying to turn it into something else? Dark Souls don't have difficulties levels or procedurally generated worlds, should they get rid of that as well so it's closer to it?
                >I know it takes a lot of inspiration from it but it's not Dark Souls

Read your comment, then read my comment again. Because either you know are wrong and are deliberately trying to avoid addressing it, or you simply didn't read it.
                    No
                        Okay so you are just admitting you know you are wrong then. Guess that is one way to do it.
                            I'm saying there's nothing in your comment that would make me change my mind by reading it a second time

Just because something is possible in Dark Souls, it doesn't mean it should be in this game. They made their game as a shooter with melee acting as a secondary only and evidence of that are the bosses you cant kill only with melee. You call it a design flaw, i call it a deliberate choice.

Play the game that's in front of you not the one you made in your head
                                >I'm saying there's nothing in your comment that would make me change my mind by reading it a second time

Well allow me to walk your middle-school-level-intelligence ass through it then.

This is a quote from you, as justification for melee being bad:

>The game is a shooter first and foremost

This was my reply:

>Dark Souls is a melee combat game first and foremost. You can still make a pure Sorcerer build work very very well if you spec completely into it.

Clearly this isn't saying the game is dark souls, this is using your own logic to show how you are wrong for saying that just because the game is gun based that you *can't* inherently do something different. That fact it was dark souls is irrelevant, that was used just because they make for easier comparisons. But what it does show is that your logic is objectively incorrect and thus you have no actual argument for your point.

At first I thought you did see that and just chose to make a fallacy out of it and make it seem like you misunderstood, but no, clearly you are just that thick.
    Sure they are. It's called ammo.

&#x200B;

This is incidentally also the reason melee is both rather bad and not viable for everything. It's designed to be used when out of ammo, or if you think ahead, on enemies it is viable against so you don't run out of ammo.
        >Sure they are. It's called ammo.

You know gunslinger exists, right? But if you don't, let me tell you:

No, ammo is not a relevant thing in this game.
            Oh, so without a class that isn't immediately unlocked, nor always desired (including the trait) . Imagine sounding that stupid.
                >Oh, so without a class that isn't immediately unlocked, 

I mean it is.

>nor always desired

No, for ranged builds it kind of is. It not only has great ammo stuff but is also one of the best for damage. 

And even when you ignore that, no most weapons don't have ammo problems and even then, at worst you are going to be using a secondary not a melee which still benefits from your build completely.
Im not asking them to be balanced, just don’t make bosses that can’t be reached at all via melee strikes. I don’t think that’s asking anything crazy.
    I think it's asking for more than you think.

Flying bosses would have to have long periods where they'd be on the ground, which kills the verticality of what's normally a fight that requires you to be looking up and down.

Game design is rarely as simple as it seems on the surface and what seems like an easy change can have large consequences.
        But it was already solved in the first game by making most bosses just not fucking fly. It's not something that would be easily fixed at this phase of course, it would have needed to nipped in the bud at the design and concept phase. At this point I'll just enjoy the game for what it is of course, as this is a very tiny spill in a great lake of enjoyment.

The only reason I'm a little salty, is that for some reason: Remnant 1 had a much more viable melee-only experience despite being told at release that the game wasn't made to be played as a melee build.

Remnant 2 has a much worse melee-only experience, despite being told that melee had a lot more work done to it in order to allow it to be played as your primary strategy.
            I think that's a bit of a bad faith argument. Remnant 1 had plenty of bosses that were unkillable using melee. Raze, the Iskal Queen, Clavager, Ixilis, Barbed Terror, and both campaign final bosses to name a few. Several others had phases where they'd jump or fly out of melee range as well like Dream Eater, Tian, and Erfor. Then there's Obryk and The Thrall which both have deadly AOE mist nonsense that makes getting close to them nigh impossible. It's not like Remnant 2's boss design philosophy suddenly veered off into a new direction to fuck over melee players.
                You can hit Clavager's arms from the edge of the arena, I killed the Dreamer's first phase (But not the second, obviously) and Harsgaard completely with melee only, the Iskal Queen's knees are melee'able. Bosses with temporarily immune phases are also completely nonsensical as an argument as well, since I'm specifically talking about bosses you **CANNOT** deal with in melee in a realistic sense. Not sub-optimal, but enemies who cannot be stricken up close.

As well, elements like Obryk's and Thrall's AoEs are completely fine as well. I'm not asking to stand afk against bosses and ignore danger. I will state though, i completely forgot about Raze, and it's true that doing Barbed Terror in melee only is a slow methodical headache so I would count it as non-viable for melee.

And I'm not sure where the bad faith is. I never said that they intentionally made things worse for melee, I'm not trying to write an agenda that they have something against melee players. I literally said that the game is great, I just find it weird how I find it harder to play melee-only in the game when it was told to us that melee had more forethought put into it.

I understand you want to defend the game, and I don't think it needs defending as it stands on it's own merit. But you can't look at the percent of enemies that never touch the ground and say that there isn't a skewer towards the sequel.

And of course I could and should probably talk about the upsides to melee. The mutator system is great for melee, the many different ways to modify encumbrance and build tanky is another boon. The removal of nearly all hit-scan enemies is another thing that helps melee only. The change to lifesteal means that melee players actually need to play the game as well, no longer being able to sustain most bosses' beatings pre-apocalypse. Of course there's a ton of benefits that Remnant 2 has given a melee playstyle, I just wish I could actually use my up-close melee options against half of Nerud's base creature pool.
                    All fair points.

I'm curious now. Can you use the Invader second ability to teleport up to the molotov lady? That'd be funny as hell.
            Remnant 1 was more melee-friendly, but still had problematic fights like the moth boss. IIRC it flew just off the side of the platform, so if you tried to melee it, you would just fall off and die. Also the final boss I think had a phase where you couldn't reach it with melee.
        The problem is you’re talking about the current roster of bosses. You eliminate the problem of it being complicated by simply not designing bosses who can’t be approached from the get go. I get the game is shooting oriented, but melee has the exact same systems in place for building around it that ranged does, the only difference is melee has fights where it simply can’t do damage. It just seems like bad, lazy design to me.
            I can appreciate that, but I also think that it's a huge design limitation that would exist to the detriment of of the shooter experience.
                Yeh, but then why offer so much build chose for melee? If you’re going to make encounters that invalidate the entire gear and class choses a player has made simply so you can have a easier time making fights, then they should drop melee and make it more of a utility thing. Replace all the relics, classes, and items and throw that into more builds for ranged, mods, and skills and make melee simply a kick button because as is you’re baiting new players into a play style that is going to hit a hard wall. Joey spends all his resources on melee weapons, goes a melee class, has all melee relics, full melee ring equips, only to find he has gotten to a boss that hangs from a wall. Now Joey feels like he just wasted all of his resources and time. I just don’t think there is a good excuse developer wise for having that kind of design and I get they aren’t a big company, but I feel this is something that should have been shaped up for this sequel and where does the game broadcast, this is shooter rpg, melee is a second rate choice. Most players aren’t going to go into the game assuming there is such lack of design for melee because it has all the options available to play into it.
                    I think the "well melee isn't ment to be a main weapon" argument is so dumb. The build verity is insane for melee with sheer options alone. Then throw on the various weapons and two classes built around it and it's kinda silly to say the devs didn't intend for a full melee build. Throw in the fact that there is only a few shotguns in the game and the argument doesn't really hold much water. I think it's just poor design one way or another. I love the game, but I agree I'd rather have it not have options then having all these option and none of them able to do damage against most bosses. 

Like, ALOT of stuff in this game is melee oriented in terms of items, but then having tons of stuff jot being able to be hit by it is silly.
In monster hunter there are some stupid annoying monsters that will spend the majority of their time in the air. Rathalos is one such case.

But it also gives you tools to bring them down and keep them there. From flash pods to using the hook thing to get blows in on the wings and tear em up.
Name one boss that was made more fun for ranged builds by its inability to be meleed.
    The final boss, alternate boss to N'Erud, abomination jellyfish in Yaesha, Cube Boss in Labyrinth, firebomb girl in Losomn.
        Just wanted to mention, the Alternate boss in N'Erud is actually meleeable. The upright fist attack can be melee attacked, which feels very much like a conscious decision to allow melee players to kill him. If more bosses had even just singular attack patterns like that in their entire kit, the game would be better.

And the firebomb girl is not fun to anyone I've talked to, lmao. Basically just waiting for her to pull out 15 bombs over the duration of the fight so you can kill her.
        SO you couldn't name a single one then? Because not a single one of those bosses' mechanics rely on you not being able to get in to melee them. Nothing would change in any of those fights for ranged builds if you could melee those bosses. They would play exactly the same. 

Also I love how you mention the cube boss, a boss that is arguably the most hated boss in the game right now. Like not only are you proving my point, but you are actively making the argument that making it so bosses can't be melee not only doesn't make ranged more fun, but actively makes ranged *less fun*.
            Cube boss is the easiest and most fun boss in the game but it’s the most hated. Uh huh sure bud. 

Final boss mechanic is literally him flying around looking cool and being a stationary target while you dodge his mechanics in phase 2.

Alternate N’Erud boss would be weird meleeable when he’s a floating space fetus. 

Flying jellyfish literally has his mechanic around downing his guardian so ok take that away by making him meleeable and you stand there tanking hits from both while you kill him, real fun.

Firebomb girl is fun fight with her being up top and you dodging. Why put her on the ground and make her useless?
                >Cube boss is the easiest and most fun boss in the game but it’s the most hated. Uh huh sure bud.

Yes, it is sure.

>Final boss mechanic is literally him flying around looking cool and being a stationary target while you dodge his mechanics in phase 2.

Keyword "looking". Look has nothing to do with gameplay. You can still make that same look while allowing them to be hit in melee. Literally almost every single dragon fight in any video game ever has the same look and style in the fight and can still be hit by melee builds. This is possibly one of the most stupid takes that anyone could ever have in a video game bud.

Phase 2, as I said, pretty clearly has no reason why it needs to be unhittable in melee. You can still dodge things from afar even if you can get closer to him.

>Firebomb girl is fun fight with her being up top and you dodging. Why put her on the ground and make her useless?

She doesn't have to be on the ground, she can still be up top but you simply can get there too. Being able to get next to her wouldn't make the fight easier for ranged builds: You would still want to be below her so that you can avoid her while you reload. 

&#x200B;

Truly you are an incredibly thick person if you can't figure out this basic shit lol. It isn't complicated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq-v1TTUyhM
    Nah, thinking ALL bosses HAVE to be meleeable is pretty dumb
>Melee is there for when enemies get close or as a last resor

then design the items around that instead of making it clear that you attempted to make pure melee builds a thing and then just chose to make the enemy design not work for that.
This game has way better bosses than Remnant 1. It's not even close.

Weapons with limited range are fine, even if melee can't do some fights. I cleared everything on Vet with a shotgun and I'm moving into Apoc now and still doing decently.
Cross Venom off this list. My sword took like 75% of his hp, only used gun during flying bits.
    I know. I was justangry and lost the ability to think when I found out this list was this long
Yes because reduced dmg on a build you’ve put all your items and traits into is totally the same as literally not being able to attack a target at all with the weapon choice that you’ve put all your choices into. I swear some of you guys aren’t even trying with your logic.
    Same solution.  Go to your inventory.  Switch out your items.  

I know, it’s insane, but sometimes your 1 build isn’t going to be viable against every single thing in the game.  Wild concept.
        Right?  Like why are these nerds so scared of the gear select screen?
>You can run a balanced range/melee build

I mean true but when it feel like you are just giving yourself an handicap with some bosses compare to just playing and focusing on a purely range build... it doesn't sounds like a fun time to me. 

At least you can freely swap your build around (except for the traits) so it's not the biggest problem but I just wish they gave you a way to swap quickly between builds (at the very least, something like loadout that you could save and change at the stone)
Having builds being locked around certain gear... is literally the purpose of a build.

Builds also don't matter until you get into higher difficulties where survivor and into veteran are all about testing out what playstyle you like & farming the gear you want to make a full build. 

Then you go into nightmare and apocalypse to really test the build
Oof…
[Gestures broadly at every other soulslike game]
    All other souls like games I've played don't force you to equip two guns, so they are actually better for and designed for pure melee.

Remnent is soulslike, but not a souls game. Ya gotta use guns here.
But even the Huntress spear is just a worse version of ranged weapons. At the very least it should be on par at that point.
And even when fully specced into melee, *nothing* lowers your ranged damage, unlike the other way around.

And you still have Mutators beyond that, so it's even more forgiving to have all your rings/amulets dedicated to melee. You can run a full melee loadout and still have decent ranged damage.
mfw I had friends who struggled with certain bosses while I just made war cries with my lifesteal perk/ring and slapped them to death

Archon, gets to put an useable mod on the dog or choose an elemental attunement that is reflected in the dogs appearance and attacks. Unique dog howl can speed up mod cooldowns

Engi, gets to mount heavy weapons on the dog (dog also can now look like darpa mule) or, dog howl acts as partial reload to give HW more charges.

Challenger gets slightly enhanced effects on dog skills, dog wears armor and can wield a melee weapon. Unique bark/skill lets out a stagger effect similar to earthquake. 

Summoner, Dog can take on root appearance and skills. Can root snare enemies.  Unique bark summons a root wisp that deals light damage and counts as an additional summon.

Gunslinger, Dog now looks like a large cattle dog, will retrieve ammo to bring to party members, unique skills can have the dog yeet dynamite over designated enemies for an aoe explosion. DYNA-MUTT

Explorer, Pointer/Bloodhound/Husky.  Doggo now 'points' at nearby chests and secrets.  Can rifle through enemy corpses for additional loot.  Somewhere in each world another simulacrum is buried, follow doggos nose to find it. 

Hunter, Labrador/Catahoula leopard dog,  will also retrieve ammo to bring to the players. Can jump and latch onto designated targets to pin them briefly in the hunters directions, can also rip a new temporary weakpoint onto an enemy limb. 

Medic,  St. bernard, Bouvier. dog carries two additional dragon heart charges and dog cast rez channels are reduced by 20 percent.
                Yes to all of this. I myself would use hunter, explorer, and engi, maybe even archon

        Dog plus summons, let the rolly Bois ride the doggo
            Would prefer the big one riding dogo and throwing explosive axes :)
                Sounds like radhan
                I feel like that hurt the dogs back

How about doggo rides big one and they both toss axes
                    Nah, the big summon can just master gravity magic if he wants to ride the dog.
            I'm down for Boggan riders.
            Where’s the amulet that lets my dog bark out bees, or lasers, or bees that shoot lasers?
                It's in the backer rooms gotta learn C++ to get it XD
Really wish I hadn't started as Handler personally. Dog AI is kinda buggy and as mentioned, they can't help with flying bosses, which is kind of pain.
    Ngl. Handler is probably the best starting class other then bruiser. Every class blows at level 1 and those self res heals are clutch.
    I started on nightmare and play solo so the dog has helped out quiet a bit and usually after mastering the boss mechaniks i can get them even if the dog cant help out and the heal and res is always nice. 
I got throught the first 3 worlds and honestly felt like certain mob groups like the floating bots on Nerud are worse than most bosses
Or just a flying attack dog. We can just watch the dog play for us. Pretty sure that is why we have different builds.  Understand which one works for each boss or level and adjust accordingly. But then I like my build.
    Which would work if classes didn't take ages to grind and scrap was actually available
        Honestly, it doesn't take as long as you'd think if you focus on one at a time, max the trait, and pop a stew. 

Not ideal still, but not horrible
This becomes a much different sentence if you remove "my railgun"
    Many sentences become entirely different if you change them.
        Blowing my FUCKIN' mind over here.
            This becomes a very different sentence if you replace "mind" with load.
                Oh my god I'm flabbergasted, you are a wizard of words!!!
Jet Force Gemini?
This would be savage as hell. MAKE IT SO!
This is much better than the actual post
I love that reaver has a ranged attack, yet won't do it against flying bosses and instead just stands there the whole time.
    Yep. Love the Reaver, but the AI can be downright brain damaged on boss fights. In the Root Nexus fight, pets will just completely ignore the boss itself. On the Annihilation fight, pets you bring into the fight through the fog gate will spawn in the floor and just sit there until they die.
        Engie sentry also ignores the Root Nexus.
            I’m okay with sparky saving ammo for the enemies that actually do damage.
        Better yet, during phase 2 of annihilation, the flying summons will bum rush the boss and fall off the edge and die instantly.  Yes, the flying ranged summon... suddenly decides it wants to melee and runs off the edge to die instantly....
    My favorite part in general about the reavers is that they like to fly in point blank to the enemies to use their *ranged* attacks. That's honestly the reason I switched off having summoner as one of my classes, because they kept getting in my way too often. For a ranged summon, they act like they're a melee summon half the time.
    Weird mine was sniping with throwing axes against flying enemies and bosses. Like i was impressed with the tracking as it seems to make shots that I don't think I would be able to make considering, if I was the one aiming the throwing axes.

    You need to have handler as your primary archetype for that to work
        [deleted]
            The only other thing I can think about is if you gave your dog a command, like attacking an enemy or moving to a particular position. Ive noticed that if you aren't near that enemy/position and get knocked down, the dog doesn't try to rez you until that command wears off. I've accidentally commanded the dog several times while trying to use the skill, so it's an easy mistake to make
        My experience with this is wildly inconsistent. 

I have 23 hours in the game, maybe half that with Handler as my primary. My dog has revived me once and my boyfriend once. In the latter case, the dog was just sitting by me while I was downed and then ran off to revive my boyfriend after he got downed as well.
            It worked perfectly every time for me, but it has a long-ish cooldown and requires you to have at least one relic charge left.
            You probably had no relic charge left while your bf had some
                But I never actually use my Relic for anything but reviving my bf outside of boss fights, and he doesn't get downed enough to eat all my Relics.

I know that would be the cause *sometimes*, and it may have even been the cause in that specific example where my dog revived him instead of me, but in 10+ hours not more than two revives from the dog doesn't check out.
                    If you switched your handler to secondary, it won't work. Also, the dog won't heal for 90 seconds after reviving you or someone else once.
                        I know. My bf doesn't really get downed outside of bosses though, so it shouldn't be on cooldown that often. The only thing I can think of that could be causing a weird interaction is that it might be going on cooldown from the Dog *trying* to revive me, only for it to not get a chance to even start the animation because my bf is running as a Medic and uses the third(?) skill that revives instantly pretty much the second I get downed. Otherwise, I really don't know what's up with the behavior.

I didn't swap Handler to secondary until several hours of play without any more than two instances of it reviving us.
                            Its working as intended for me tbh so hard to say why it dont work in your case
                    My buddy was having this issue yesterday too. I tried to troubleshoot it with him, but it does seem like there’s a bug.

He had relic charges, dog wasn’t on cool down because he never revived anyone. The Handler was the primary class too. At some point he just started reviving people, but yeah he wasn’t being the best boy there for a good chunk of our playtime
            Well thats the classic case of the dog having a favorite.
            It can only be done once every 60 seconds or so. It says this in the ability.

And you need a relic charge
                Yes, I know.
            Yea looks like they have to make better priority for reviving teammates with doggy. I have never encountered problems with the dog reviving me or teammates probably because i never use the ping commands on the dog and only ever used the double tap command and hold, i’m guessing when you try and revive a teammate they have too many mobs on top of them?
Exactly my experience with the last boss. So incredibly frustrating.
yeah... summoner flyers and reavers can do well enough in veteran but you have to invest into it a LOT(you're gonna wanna get a good few ranks into rugged and siphoner traits at least + the ring that shares half of your healing to allies) and basically babysit their health

ended up running medic(primary)/summoner for most of my 1st run just to keep them alive reliably and even then i struggled to keep them from dying constantly until finding the good gear, which took some adventure rolling, least it also made me very tanky too(was basically face tanking the final boss cause of the way my relic's healing worked, constant healing and constant free relic uses)

&#x200B;

also sucks that summons dont have a command function like the dog, would be nice to be able to make them focus an enemy or force them to move back to you... and then the dog is just sad tbh, least as a minion, the best thing it offers is the self revive if primary archetype but ideally one should not be dying at all and i dont think it works if the dog is downed and that dog loves being downed, baffles me that one of its skills is an aggro drawing one, that dog has glass bones and paper skin
    popped open from the ashes again and man the skulls from the Beckon mod are so much more aggressive than the summoner Flyers, and their projectiles are at least twice as fast if not faster

&#x200B;

and that dog, annoying as the constant barking was, hits hard as hell, it hits as hard if not harder than the reaver and i dont even have evocation
Been fine for me on nightmare
    Im on hard and my dog only does 80 damage a hit. Very Good boy could easily do 300 a bite so he's definitely not as as good
[deleted]
    free revive and ranged revive on your friends is pretty dang good, just beat the game with handler main 100% of the time, during longer boss fights like the last one you can pretty much get an assured 3-4 rezzes off during the phases where you don't have enough time otherwise. the damage skill ain't that shabby either
    There's secondary class for a reason. You don't always need to have handler as primary if you are worried about DPS. The only mayor factor in having handler as primary is the dog reviving you. If you want DPS, use another archetype as primary

Your dog also has increase dmg support buff as well, use that too

I am hunter main and do just fine with my DPS soloing veteran
        [deleted]
            I'd go unlock the engineer class - really easy to get. Alongside gunslinger, engineer does the almost the same DPS and has the ability to summon turrets
I agree with this. The dog is 90% support. No way homie is helping with aerial stuff.
so? he could jump into the air to do a bite attack or something
    ahh yes, let a dog jump 10feet in the air. Definitely a valid response...
        Yes, very strange to think that the dog that magically appears when we equip a whistle and can somehow heal you or make your guns hurt things more by howling could potentially jump high.
        Considering all the magic shit in this game, sure, why not. German shepards can jump about 5-6 feet high in real life. Give them magic dog shoes or some shit
            Doggie jet boots lmao
        Compared to everything else the dog can do, jumping is not that far fetched.
        I watched my dog fall off a thousand foot tower but then he just appeared behind me
The dog should shoot lasers from its eyes or mouth
one of the annihilation no damage annihilation kills floating around on here I think is a coachgun and double barrel set up. Shotguns have more effective range than you think, I don't recall there being a boss ive encountered where my shotgun couldn't perform.
    Coach Gun in general is just really strong because it actually has range due to firing slugs.
        I play shotgun and with the right rings, traits, they basically all do.
The shotgun works great on endgame bosses, but you need to use Hunter as your secondary (or level the trait accordingly). That extra "ideal range" is pretty grody on shotties and turns Sporebloom into an elephant gun; just be sure to take the -spread trait as well.
Melee on final boss? Sure. Shotguns? No you absolutely can
And many summons. (Also applies to like, 50% of the bosses)
There is also a throwing spear. Good for proccing melee mutators and not much else.
    There's another two once you clear the game on harder modes.

I feel like there's a really strong build with the >!Hero's Blade or World's Edge!< and pairing it with the Butcher's Fetish; 15% crit rate and 25% crit dam are pretty great for just mixing in a charge attack occasionally. Those two weapons also don't have extra stamina costs on the attacks so it's less damning using them.

Shoutout to Spectral Blade for also enabling this easily on *most* bosses; can hit them around corners or through walls. Lots of ways to enable the stronger trinkets!
        I like the shock axe myself! None of them are meta damage output though, I don’t think.
            It's not meta damage (only high-damage melee weapon I've found is Stonebreaker, but it only works on ground bosses), but tbh Butcher's Idol is one of the highest DPS upgrades amongst amulets you can reasonably get, but mostly because crit-damage is so insanely rare (and it gives more value to other mods, i.e. the Corrosive weapon mod is pretty awful compared to the Fire one until you've got enough crit damage to spruce it up).

It really just depends on the build you rock though and the weapon you enjoy; not all builds have room for that many amulets/trinkets, sadly.
if you shoot all the orbs on the boss’ 2nd phase she drops down into melee range for quick dps window. difficult to pull off without enigma tho
Yeah but electric axe + melee bleeds + dmg against bleed targets is my precious baby
    make it do more damage from buffs >:D
I was just imagining all the bosses standing in a queue
Lol, thank you.
this would be fine if it wasnt expensive to not only respect, but also level up other equipment for different builds
    That's a fair point but they've said they are looking into the costs of those things. Granted it's an issue right now so I can see how people would be frustrated. All of my traits are pretty generic so I don't really respec for anything and I have plenty of material at this point so I haven't really had much issue personally.
    Levelling up equipment isn't that bad, you just might want to reroll a few areas, or help a few people, or just rest and grind a bit if you prefer, rather than a streamlined "almost fully upgraded all the time" because you dump everything into your favourite few weapons.
I can't fully express how disappointed I was in the flying summons. Their ranged attack is great, but they don't seem to know how to use it. Plus the fact they can fall off a map and die is just baffling.

The Ravager, on the other hand, is pretty amazing, if not also somewhat mentally challenged.
    On Losomn being a summoner is hard work. There's these non hostile pig looking things walking around and if your summons see them they just stop and stare at them. You can be halfway across the map and they'll still be staring at the pig

They won't go back to following you unless you kill the pig, and if they spot a pig before they spot an enemy they'll just stare at it even if they're surrounded by enemies.

Gotta kill these pigs on sight if you don't want your summons to go goofing off which is kinda annoying but also kinda hilarious

My guess it's locked on to it as if it's an enemy, but it's still somewhere registered as "not an enemy", so it's just stuck in this lock on limbo because it can't get a new lock on without killing the current locked on target
        The dog does it too! I had to shoot them all or the dog would follow them around like "IT'S BACON!!!"
        Is it the same in the fae areas with the faes hiding as statues that come to life when you walk past them? As an engineer my turret just seems to shoot random things in the sky until I realised they're statues that I can't get close enough to trigger them spawning.
            Yep that too. Was really confused why my summons were shooting at stuff that wasn't (to me) there
            I actually found that handy when i was playing, i could located the fea and shoot them before they ganked me for 30% of my health
    Bonus, the flyers get stuck in the floor of phase 2 of final boss. Rendering them even more useless.
        They also have issues following you if you use an elevator. Had to blow em up multiple times.
        Yeah, most pets seem to get stuck in the floor on the final boss. Not that they're much help anyway due to the boss' erratic movement patterns.
        That exact reason is why I swapped from Summoner/Engineer for the last fight to Engineer/Summoner.

Overclocked Gatling laser cannot be stuck on the door, and then I just sacrificed the flyers over and over
        The summons dont deal well with character transportation of any kind. 

So a fight where you are repeatedly teliported from locations is going to cause problems.
lol… yep! I tried swapping summons before fights to see if that would “fix” them just sitting there and nope. Good times! lol… i really do love the dog and summons, and at times it really is a fun combo build. But there are also times where I felt like I completely wasted my build doing it that way.
I was pretty sad that there were a few bosses that my flying summons just refused to hit, despite being ranged but honestly. Not enough to get over summoners value in regen having some autonomous damage. (My guess is since summons can move freely they are programmed to only hit enemies in bounds and certain bosses are out of bounds technically)
Wait. Theres more than one melee weapon you can throw? Right now im just using that krell axe because it helps me with my ammo economy.

And the little debuff is nice too.
    The huntress spear from the lady in Bloodborne-ville is thrown too. And it looks so fuckin cool
    The throwing spear feels so damn good, AND you can pretend your spear fishing cross dimensions!
        the fact that you can impale your friends and NPCs in the ward with spears and they just..... stick out of their bodies is the best.

feels a little weird they let it happen with the children though....
            I forgot about this and it’s a top tier fact
        It's also quite fast for it's basic attack. Pretty good melee weapon so far imo.
    Huntress' Spear, Hero's Sword, that flame GS, Krell Axe
    These aren't the exact names, but:

Krell Axe, Huntress Spear, World's Edge, Atom Splitter, and Hero's Blade all can work on any boss (I think) to proc on-melee effects.

Spectral Blade works on almost every boss, except the big "stand far away and constantly DPS the weakpoint" ones. It's better against those that chase you around since you can still hit them from behind cover.

Stonebreaker works on ground-based bosses from a safe range, but tbh Stonebreaker's also the only "good" melee weapon for DPS I've found; the charge attack hits like a nuke up close and doesn't demand you constantly keep attacking or leaving yourself exposed to get in damage. Feels like a great weapon for dodging an attack, then punching the boss in the mouth.
Hell yeah it's good. 💪🏻
Or the amulet that gives 35% more melee damage AND 10 stam back on hit

That mutation with the stacking damage and speed per hit.

I’m really trying to make this think work 😂
    Use both! Sounds fun haha. You’d spend the 25 stam on the throw, then when it connects you’d get 10 back heh
        There's a mutator that gives you a shield on every melee hit which further synergizes with the generating band ring that recovers hp while shielded
            Yeah, but once fully levelled up that mutator consumes shields on charge attack for a damage bonus. Good if you;'re actually close quarters, bad if you're using the spear to haha funny enemies *and* build shield.
I’m big on the Huntress spear + vengeful strike mutation + vengeance idol amulet. Gotta have the ring of restriction so you’ll be stuck with half hp too. 

I’m throwing ballistic missiles with all of these damage bonuses.
Not really. It deals shock damage and inflicts overload, which can be kind of neat, but the damage is rather low. Honestly the Iron Greatsword is just so good that it's hard to replace. I'd look for the Atom Splitter as a viable replacement. It's not difficult to get, but it is an RNG find since it can spawn in multiple dungeons and you need to find the correct room it spawns in.
    Great to know, thanks. Will look up the Atom Splitter. Iron Greatsword has been pretty damn good so far!
        If you ever manage to beat the game on Apocalypse, there's also the World's Edge which is almost a direct upgrade to the Iron Greatsword. Same attack animation, almost the same damage values, but it also shoots a wide beam on charge attacks, like the Hero's Sword.
        Atom Splitter is good for charge attacks, but has really low melee damage otherwise when compared to other greats swords, just something to keep in mind.
Assuming that OP is talking about the Atom Splitter and not the Atom Smasher. Atom Splitter is a relatively hard to find sword as it's in one of the side dungeons of N'erud randomly based on their generation. You need to jump on one of the metal pieces that the big fingers are lifting up, and have it carry you to a higher platform where the sword is hidden. Best to look up a guide/wiki page.
    Got it, thank you!
        I've seen the room it spawns in in three different dungeons so far. Vault of the formless, void vessel facility, and the story dungeon where you fight the big rolling blob.

Large room, foggy ceiling, large pillars full of stasis pods and spindly fingers that are grabbing and lifting different section of the pillars.
You have to roll a certain tile set with moving machine in nerud. Can spawn in any dungeon. 

The sword is so satisfying because you can just launch one wave beam and decimate a whole group.

I've had one wave attack do like 1500 damage.
    Does it spawn in any dungeon? I've only seen it spawn in three locations so far, all dryzyr zombie dungeons. I could see the space crab dungeons also working as the use a slightly modified tileset, but I don't see how the tile will fit into the spire type dungeons.
        I found it in hatchery but the tile set should have multiple spawn areas
The atom smasher is in Nerud. While in any dungeon with the pod towers, there is a section that just seems to lead to a broken edge. You have to wait for the mechanical arms to grab a pod section at your level then jump on it. It will pull you up and you need to jump off onto a ledge that's about 1 story above the initial jump point. The atom smasher is in there. 

It looks like a Xenoblade sword
Standing still, you hit spacebar to evade back and then hold down the right mouse button. Quite a few melee weapons have this combo for a special attack
    right mouse button for melee?
        Neutral backdash + hold LMB, not right
I'm on PS5 and I just use a back button to dodge then hold melee. You have to be standing still too.
They are referring to the Atom SPLITTER, not the Atom Smasher. Just to be clear in case you didn't catch that. The Smasher cannot shoot waves.
    It was clear, thanks.
Don't care, I've used the weapon a ton and had tons of success with it. Fun > meta
    Cool. Then say that instead of saying it is good.

Or better yet, don't say it at all because that isn't that this post is about in the first place. Obviously people can play to have fun, this post isn't that: It is about how hard people are punished for that. Like you tried to make a counterargument by bringing that up and instead just proved OP's point.
        Lol wut? 

I've been destroying bosses and elites with the weapon, tested by combat to be awesome for me. I've used it for like 20 some hours of my playtime and it's just destroyed everything I've fought.
            >I've been destroying bosses and elites with the weapon

Sure, because you can destroy any boss with almost any weapon. This game is not that hard.

But this weapon is objectively one of the worst at doing it.
                It one shots most enemies lol

Why would I need something that one shots better

Why try to even gatekeep me for enjoying a really fun weapon and having success with it
                    >It one shots most enemies lol

So do many weapons.

>Why would I need something that one shots better

Because this is a game primarily about boss fights and you don't one shot bosses.

>Why try to even gatekeep me

It isn't gatekeeping. You said it was one of the best weapons and factually it isn't. You can use it all you want, I'm not telling you that you can't.

But sure, be the crybaby attention seeker who gets all defensive as soon as anyone says anything that goes against your viewpoint after you bring an irrelevant statement to someone else's post. You are free to do that.
                        You care way too much about this. Just go have fun with your meta bullshit.
                            "You care way too much about this"

Says the guy who is constantly replying to make himself feel better about not being able to read and having the education of someone who didn't pass high school.

Edit: the classic try to get the last word and then quickly block the other guy. Obviously the move of someone who isn't insecure.
You can! The range is actually farther than my plasma cutter too. It's crazy. I've been running around yaesha sniping the floating triangles with it.
    Even better, if ya decide to pair it with the Hunter's scan, you can even snipe enemies through walls since the beam kinda ignores them!
        That's genius. I will be trying that. The sword going through environments and the range definitely makes up for its lesser damage.
Yeahhh I'm good with what I have. Not sure if I'll attempt apocalypse. Maybe someday
I forgot about that ring! It was one of my faves in FTA
uh.. what? my huntress spear does like 2400 dmg on headshots/weakspots. The dmg does definitely vary but is generally in the high 3 digits low 1000s. Are you sure you're actually fully specced into melee when you were using the spear???  


The only issue I have with it is running out of stamina and things dodging it. It also isn't supposed to be better than guns when you have to resort to using it; it's likely meant to just give you a suboptimal option when you don't want to use guns or run out of ammo, unless you have a  lot of skill, in which case it can be on par with a lot of guns (obviously not optimized hunter/gunner nightfall builds, but nothing else is on par with that level of power) -- at again the benefit of infinite uses since it requires no ammo management or reloading.
    Matriarchs amulet gives you 35% melee damage and 10 stamina on melee hits, a must for melee builds
        Oooh, throwing the spear uses 25 stamina, you can combine the ring that gives max shield when you use 25 stam. With that amulet it works like throw > spend 25 and get shield > hit > get 10 stam back
        The butchers amulet is also good for the melee builds that focus on charge attacks.
            I will go look this up rn…!
    You lose stamina throwing it??I have never seen mine drop when my character does it???
        Stamina is not used outside of combat
If you start fight with it it will be for free ;)
    Would you say the huntresses spear is better than krells axe?

It seemed much harder to get, but damage didn’t seem any better when factoring in the multiple shock explosions krells gets
I find value int he throwing of melee weapons because you can slot the ammo generator mutator into it
My only gripe with the auto shotgun is that it's so good it took me a while to upgrade something else worthwhile.
That makes a lot of sense. Will keep it in mind!
That big dog in the sewer event wasn't even able to attack me when I just kept smacking its hind legs with tal rathas face hammer, it's only has a charge and a kick, both need a charge first
> I haven't seen any boss that punishes you for using a gun, but many punish you for going melee. 

Venom is far easier in melee than at range imo
    When you can hit him, as many angles will cause you to hit his protective cloak or go under his floating body. I would say he's still better to fight up close, just **with** a gun.
The robot boss that sucks you into melee range is pretty tough to just shoot
    Any of the red bosses with the vortex modifier can go fuck right off. Got one that you have to fight in some small corridors and it was absolute hell trying to see what was going on.
(Don’t forget the beauty of Atom Splitter)
    Does it also have one? Only one I don't have.
        Yes sir/ma’am/????
I wonder if that ring that gives you bonuses for each unequipped weapons made it into Remnant 2...
    I know there's the Daredevil ring for unequipped armour, but I haven't heard of one for unequipped weapons.
        I thought daredevil ring was any unequipped item in this game
            Only unequipped armor slots. It also gives you negative damage resist for each slot, so it turns you into a pure glass cannon, which would be terrible for melee.
        https://remnantfromtheashes.wiki.fextralife.com/White+Rose

My bad, it was a Necklace.
there are some pretty weak outlier melee mods, extremely situational and even in that situation are weaker than the others. Essentially if we compare it to the 50% hp mod or the lifesteal mod how much less desireable they are to them

like say "disengage" it caps at +10% per stack (50% damage) for backdash attacks but it only seems to apply to the base kinda like adding +50% melee damage for 1 attack if you got the 5 stacks and otherwise not doing anything. I would expect it should see a much bigger number since its so situational compared to a universally at all times good mod

i super agree though i mostly run into the issue where its really unsatisfying where im at 80%+ total DR at 155 hp and still die in one shot or take like 90%+ hp damage from just a regular swipe
    Something is currently wrong with the DR mechanic, I swear.

Others have noticed it too, it seems like Armor and flat are multiplicative, which is punishing for anyone not running Leto's armor, and honestly kind of irritating. Heavier armor should mean you have to invest less to reach cap and can thus get other stats. The way it's working just means everyone is going to end up running around in Leto's armor with 80% flat dr or risk getting oneshot.

Like if you have 40% armor DR and 40% flat currently, if it's multiplicative, that's only 64% DR. Compared to 80%, that's **80% more** damage taken.

Personally I want a strict cap at 80%, or an "overflow" mechanic where excess DR% over 80% becomes multiplicative and thus is subject to large diminishing returns. Could still have Havel/Leto's Monsters running around and having huge DR while not punishing everyone else that way. Alternatively could have Bulwark exceed the DR cap, but only give 2% DR if it's past cap, to make Bulwark feel more like the GIGA TANK mechanic.
        oh my god i didnt know it was multiplicative, that explains a lot

is it always armor is base and DR is multiplied to it or whichever is higher then multiplicative from whichever of the two is lower? that definitely means i need a more DR to actually hit the invisible cap well fuck me lol
            It's not confirmed, just an observation shared by players. The way the stat screen presents it is that it should be additive. However, there was a good post about a guy clearing Apocalypse where he discusses that Flat DR that exceeded cap was definitely doing something.

Also it wouldn't matter what the "base" is, since it would just be multiplying the remainder of damage. (1-DRa)x(1-DRf)
Then fextra has lied to me. Thank you for the information

Edit: it’s been updated so the wiki is correct now :)
That they should; it's another thing to file under design conflict.
Red prince is a joke with a melee build
Okay, the Cube Boss is a horrible example because it’s more of a puzzle than a real boss.
The Root Tree boss lol, only one I can think of (random side boss in Yaesha) maybe Kaeula or whatever the name.

Honestly, most of Yaesha in general is very melee friendly compared to the rest of the game.
    The Root Nexus? It's an immobile target, prime for shooting. And it even gets a special attack if you're meleeing it to mildly punish melee (it can grab you).
        Can’t remember what it is called but the big tree that doesn’t move.

It doesn’t do anything other than summoning adds.

Literally doesn’t do a single attack.
            No, that's the boss I'm talking about, it does have a single attack: it can grab you with roots while you're in melee. Unless that's something one of the adds does.
                I believe that’s one of the elite adds.
                It's literally what one of the adds does. Roots you and gives you Root Rot status effect. The tree tank elite. Annoying monster.
                    Gotcha. Never encountered it while actually fighting the enemy, is it attached to the big shockwave attack?
    That’s what I’m saying is that there’s tons of places melee is usable but because it’s not like dark souls where almost everything is just a punch out they feel melee is unusable 😂
        There's also a lot of places where melee is completely unusable. But I haven't run into any situation where a gun is unusable...and very few situations where a gun is not more practical and easier in every way.
            Nerud any of the building and places with the zombies and crickets. Laesha most of the enemies besides flying one. I could go on an on the whole thing is sure melee is unusable if you can’t dodge or can’t learn timing. Acting as if melee is unusable is just goofy since it’s surely able to be used but there’s a reason why the game gives a primary, secondary, and melee. Primary = damage secondary = capacity and minimum damage melee  = aoe and crowd control
                The unusable part refers to flying enemies and bosses, when you literally cannot reach enemies. Outside of that, melee merely finds itself at a disadvantage in a lot of situations. Having to chase after bosses teleporting to teammates, increasing the risk of friendly fire, making it harder for allies to use AoE attacks...guns just have a lot less nonsense to put up with, at least until you start using ranged melee weapons.  

It just makes melee build options feel really out of place.
    Root Nexus didn't seem possible to hit the weak spot with melee weapons, leading to all melee damage being grey. If I'm wrong and it's possible, then I think it's very unreliable at least. *Technically* killable as melee, but holy hell will it take awhile.
        I did that only hitting the nexus with melee since I was running out of ammo and it was the first encounter I found in my campaign. You can hit the weakspot with melee on a specific side of it.
        [deleted]
            Maybe? I tried Edge of the Forest and Scrap Greatsword.
                you have to basically pretend that your melee is an aimable veryveryvery short range gun and depending on the weapon, where your reticle is when the 'shot' goes off determines if you get a weakspot/hit/whiff. 

Trick is to aim at the larger glowing red parts of the trunk as aiming for the smaller red parts surrounded by 'regular root trunk' has a much higher chance of getting resisted, especially when you get shoved around by all the adds.

Also recommend trying the engineer's turret melee as even with a crappy build i was hitting something like 3-4k on the juicy red parts of the tree. I've no clue how quickly you could destroy it if you went with an actual melee build, but I'm assuming much, much faster.
Well the cube Boss doesn't require dpa anyway.
There are definitely some bosses that I think I could easily take with a melee weapon but at the end of the day I really just used my melee for little mobs that crowd me. Which I honestly feel may have been the only reason melee exists to be completely honest with you. Like In Nerud you have the crickets and blobs that rush you and melee cleans them up nicely. You also have the rolly dudes on laesha that melee helps a lot with. But to say that melee is pointless I do get it but you once again have to just figure it out. Also dark souls had flying bosses and enemies that you had to wait until they got close to you or you had to wait til they landed. So it’s not an uncommon thing but since there are guns it’s rare these flying enemies land.
the benefit of melee isn't necessarily that it's easier to take down a boss with than not. It's that it does not require (relatively speaking) aiming, ammo, or reloading. Melee light attack spam doesn't even use stamina, and there's a ring that will help if for whatever reason you need to heavy spam. Melee also has such incredibly high bonuses compared to range, it allows you to scale more efficiently while also having very high DR. Like the fact that there's an amulet that gives ***THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT*** melee dmg with not only NO downsides or conditions AND gives an ADDITIONAL benefit of 10 stamina replenished ON MELEE HIT (not even kill), is ***insane***  


Ranged amulets are like you get a significantly lower dmg bonus (usually around 20% compared to, again ***35%***) ***IF*** you meet a condition, like on kill, or at a certain health threshold etc. Like it's comically easy to reach 80% DR while maintaining dmg on melee, esp since you can use "when hit by enemy" procs since that's almost \_bound\_ to happen, whereas most ranged builds play on the premise they shouldn't get hit much, if at all.   


As for cube boss, that is wholly irrelevant since the cube nodes die to a single shot and you always have guns equipped even if you don't normally use them. Even with zero investment in range on your jewelry/traits/archetype, you will one shot the nodes on the cube boss. Your build is irrelevant in that fight for 90% of builds out there, and that 10% is basically if you have something like increased movement speed, or invader movement shenanigans. It's basically all one shots in both directions.  


Fliers are absolutely a pain for melee though; that is 100% true, but I like that using different builds for different bosses is a thing in this game. I do wish fliers at least had a landing sequence in their rotation for my melee users out there.  


(meanwhile I'm doing a mod monkey build and praying i dont' one shot myself with starshot because "big numbers go brr", so maybe i shouldn't talk about build efficiency after all aha)
    This is all very cool (genuinely, I plan to do a melee build at some point so knowing a few of the options is neat) but I think people are reading something into my post which I never said ("melee is useless") rather than what I did ("ranged attacks are usable in all circumstances, melee is more situational").
    &#x200B;

>THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT melee dmg

With is only 5% more damage than what ranged can get. Except ranged has higher than 5% dps base most of the time. SO they actually get more bonus from the 30% than melee gets from 35% because percentage works better the higher the base DPS is.

So not only is it *not* insane, it isn't even that good
I had a much easier time meleeing one of the root bosses. Some old treet hat that likes generating big death zones if you arent in its face.
I mean a nice melee focused build can pretty much face tank and shred but part of the problem is a lot of bosses being impossible to actually get in melee range of or having happy feet and no downtime to actually melee
Exactly like I’m sick of everyone pitching a fit about melee when it’s literally explained. Like did everyone forget it’s dark souls with GUNS why would it be melee focused. It would just be another dark souls clone and people would than whine about that
    Did you *play* Remnant 1?

You realise they talked about giving more of a niche to melee centric playstyles in this game, right? When it overall is a bit worse than 1 due to enemy design?

It's just a slightly less rough start, but otherwise not as good.

Don't give people a wide range of melee loot, a large number of melee trinkets, and a class which has an entire skill based exclusively around improving melee if you don't want people to try and focus on melee.

Given they *did* all that, and what they've said in the past, I'd hazard a guess they absolutely *do* want the option of melee to be an entirely valid method of play.

Much like you probably swing your melee here and there, people who want to play melee understand they'll need to shoot. It's the ratio that's the issue.

**EDIT:** Like, to be clear, melee *would* be better in this game. They have made a HUGE number of changes to improve it. But then they made half the enemies fly, most of the bosses hell to melee, and gave them frankly gross close range damage.

So close, GFG. So close.
The game is a shooter first and foremost. Why do you people act like melee options need to be on the same level as guns? Melee is clearly there to allow the player to mix it up/have fun against regular enemies and some mini bosses but the main options are definitely the guns.

This is like complaining that guns are not as effective as melee  to kill shit in Devil May Cry. They are not supposed to.
    >The game is a shooter first and foremost

Dark Souls is a melee combat game first and foremost. You can still make a pure Sorcerer build work very *very* well if you spec completely into it.

>hy do you people act like melee options need to be on the same level as guns

It doesn't, but unlike Remnant 1 they clearly designed many *many* pieces of gear and skills around that so it *should* be.
        I know it takes a lot of inspiration from it but it's not Dark Souls, it's Remnant and the developers obviously see their game as a shooter with melee acting only as a secondary option. Having gear and skills for your secondary doesn't mean it should be usable as a primary.

How about you guys just play the game that's in front of you instead of trying to turn it into something else? Dark Souls don't have difficulties levels or procedurally generated worlds, should they get rid of that as well so it's closer to it?
            >I know it takes a lot of inspiration from it but it's not Dark Souls

Read your comment, then read my comment again. Because either you know are wrong and are deliberately trying to avoid addressing it, or you simply didn't read it.
                No
                    Okay so you are just admitting you know you are wrong then. Guess that is one way to do it.
                        I'm saying there's nothing in your comment that would make me change my mind by reading it a second time

Just because something is possible in Dark Souls, it doesn't mean it should be in this game. They made their game as a shooter with melee acting as a secondary only and evidence of that are the bosses you cant kill only with melee. You call it a design flaw, i call it a deliberate choice.

Play the game that's in front of you not the one you made in your head
                            >I'm saying there's nothing in your comment that would make me change my mind by reading it a second time

Well allow me to walk your middle-school-level-intelligence ass through it then.

This is a quote from you, as justification for melee being bad:

>The game is a shooter first and foremost

This was my reply:

>Dark Souls is a melee combat game first and foremost. You can still make a pure Sorcerer build work very very well if you spec completely into it.

Clearly this isn't saying the game is dark souls, this is using your own logic to show how you are wrong for saying that just because the game is gun based that you *can't* inherently do something different. That fact it was dark souls is irrelevant, that was used just because they make for easier comparisons. But what it does show is that your logic is objectively incorrect and thus you have no actual argument for your point.

At first I thought you did see that and just chose to make a fallacy out of it and make it seem like you misunderstood, but no, clearly you are just that thick.
Sure they are. It's called ammo.

&#x200B;

This is incidentally also the reason melee is both rather bad and not viable for everything. It's designed to be used when out of ammo, or if you think ahead, on enemies it is viable against so you don't run out of ammo.
    >Sure they are. It's called ammo.

You know gunslinger exists, right? But if you don't, let me tell you:

No, ammo is not a relevant thing in this game.
        Oh, so without a class that isn't immediately unlocked, nor always desired (including the trait) . Imagine sounding that stupid.
            >Oh, so without a class that isn't immediately unlocked, 

I mean it is.

>nor always desired

No, for ranged builds it kind of is. It not only has great ammo stuff but is also one of the best for damage. 

And even when you ignore that, no most weapons don't have ammo problems and even then, at worst you are going to be using a secondary not a melee which still benefits from your build completely.
I think it's asking for more than you think.

Flying bosses would have to have long periods where they'd be on the ground, which kills the verticality of what's normally a fight that requires you to be looking up and down.

Game design is rarely as simple as it seems on the surface and what seems like an easy change can have large consequences.
    But it was already solved in the first game by making most bosses just not fucking fly. It's not something that would be easily fixed at this phase of course, it would have needed to nipped in the bud at the design and concept phase. At this point I'll just enjoy the game for what it is of course, as this is a very tiny spill in a great lake of enjoyment.

The only reason I'm a little salty, is that for some reason: Remnant 1 had a much more viable melee-only experience despite being told at release that the game wasn't made to be played as a melee build.

Remnant 2 has a much worse melee-only experience, despite being told that melee had a lot more work done to it in order to allow it to be played as your primary strategy.
        I think that's a bit of a bad faith argument. Remnant 1 had plenty of bosses that were unkillable using melee. Raze, the Iskal Queen, Clavager, Ixilis, Barbed Terror, and both campaign final bosses to name a few. Several others had phases where they'd jump or fly out of melee range as well like Dream Eater, Tian, and Erfor. Then there's Obryk and The Thrall which both have deadly AOE mist nonsense that makes getting close to them nigh impossible. It's not like Remnant 2's boss design philosophy suddenly veered off into a new direction to fuck over melee players.
            You can hit Clavager's arms from the edge of the arena, I killed the Dreamer's first phase (But not the second, obviously) and Harsgaard completely with melee only, the Iskal Queen's knees are melee'able. Bosses with temporarily immune phases are also completely nonsensical as an argument as well, since I'm specifically talking about bosses you **CANNOT** deal with in melee in a realistic sense. Not sub-optimal, but enemies who cannot be stricken up close.

As well, elements like Obryk's and Thrall's AoEs are completely fine as well. I'm not asking to stand afk against bosses and ignore danger. I will state though, i completely forgot about Raze, and it's true that doing Barbed Terror in melee only is a slow methodical headache so I would count it as non-viable for melee.

And I'm not sure where the bad faith is. I never said that they intentionally made things worse for melee, I'm not trying to write an agenda that they have something against melee players. I literally said that the game is great, I just find it weird how I find it harder to play melee-only in the game when it was told to us that melee had more forethought put into it.

I understand you want to defend the game, and I don't think it needs defending as it stands on it's own merit. But you can't look at the percent of enemies that never touch the ground and say that there isn't a skewer towards the sequel.

And of course I could and should probably talk about the upsides to melee. The mutator system is great for melee, the many different ways to modify encumbrance and build tanky is another boon. The removal of nearly all hit-scan enemies is another thing that helps melee only. The change to lifesteal means that melee players actually need to play the game as well, no longer being able to sustain most bosses' beatings pre-apocalypse. Of course there's a ton of benefits that Remnant 2 has given a melee playstyle, I just wish I could actually use my up-close melee options against half of Nerud's base creature pool.
                All fair points.

I'm curious now. Can you use the Invader second ability to teleport up to the molotov lady? That'd be funny as hell.
        Remnant 1 was more melee-friendly, but still had problematic fights like the moth boss. IIRC it flew just off the side of the platform, so if you tried to melee it, you would just fall off and die. Also the final boss I think had a phase where you couldn't reach it with melee.
    The problem is you’re talking about the current roster of bosses. You eliminate the problem of it being complicated by simply not designing bosses who can’t be approached from the get go. I get the game is shooting oriented, but melee has the exact same systems in place for building around it that ranged does, the only difference is melee has fights where it simply can’t do damage. It just seems like bad, lazy design to me.
        I can appreciate that, but I also think that it's a huge design limitation that would exist to the detriment of of the shooter experience.
            Yeh, but then why offer so much build chose for melee? If you’re going to make encounters that invalidate the entire gear and class choses a player has made simply so you can have a easier time making fights, then they should drop melee and make it more of a utility thing. Replace all the relics, classes, and items and throw that into more builds for ranged, mods, and skills and make melee simply a kick button because as is you’re baiting new players into a play style that is going to hit a hard wall. Joey spends all his resources on melee weapons, goes a melee class, has all melee relics, full melee ring equips, only to find he has gotten to a boss that hangs from a wall. Now Joey feels like he just wasted all of his resources and time. I just don’t think there is a good excuse developer wise for having that kind of design and I get they aren’t a big company, but I feel this is something that should have been shaped up for this sequel and where does the game broadcast, this is shooter rpg, melee is a second rate choice. Most players aren’t going to go into the game assuming there is such lack of design for melee because it has all the options available to play into it.
                I think the "well melee isn't ment to be a main weapon" argument is so dumb. The build verity is insane for melee with sheer options alone. Then throw on the various weapons and two classes built around it and it's kinda silly to say the devs didn't intend for a full melee build. Throw in the fact that there is only a few shotguns in the game and the argument doesn't really hold much water. I think it's just poor design one way or another. I love the game, but I agree I'd rather have it not have options then having all these option and none of them able to do damage against most bosses. 

Like, ALOT of stuff in this game is melee oriented in terms of items, but then having tons of stuff jot being able to be hit by it is silly.
The final boss, alternate boss to N'Erud, abomination jellyfish in Yaesha, Cube Boss in Labyrinth, firebomb girl in Losomn.
    Just wanted to mention, the Alternate boss in N'Erud is actually meleeable. The upright fist attack can be melee attacked, which feels very much like a conscious decision to allow melee players to kill him. If more bosses had even just singular attack patterns like that in their entire kit, the game would be better.

And the firebomb girl is not fun to anyone I've talked to, lmao. Basically just waiting for her to pull out 15 bombs over the duration of the fight so you can kill her.
    SO you couldn't name a single one then? Because not a single one of those bosses' mechanics rely on you not being able to get in to melee them. Nothing would change in any of those fights for ranged builds if you could melee those bosses. They would play exactly the same. 

Also I love how you mention the cube boss, a boss that is arguably the most hated boss in the game right now. Like not only are you proving my point, but you are actively making the argument that making it so bosses can't be melee not only doesn't make ranged more fun, but actively makes ranged *less fun*.
        Cube boss is the easiest and most fun boss in the game but it’s the most hated. Uh huh sure bud. 

Final boss mechanic is literally him flying around looking cool and being a stationary target while you dodge his mechanics in phase 2.

Alternate N’Erud boss would be weird meleeable when he’s a floating space fetus. 

Flying jellyfish literally has his mechanic around downing his guardian so ok take that away by making him meleeable and you stand there tanking hits from both while you kill him, real fun.

Firebomb girl is fun fight with her being up top and you dodging. Why put her on the ground and make her useless?
            >Cube boss is the easiest and most fun boss in the game but it’s the most hated. Uh huh sure bud.

Yes, it is sure.

>Final boss mechanic is literally him flying around looking cool and being a stationary target while you dodge his mechanics in phase 2.

Keyword "looking". Look has nothing to do with gameplay. You can still make that same look while allowing them to be hit in melee. Literally almost every single dragon fight in any video game ever has the same look and style in the fight and can still be hit by melee builds. This is possibly one of the most stupid takes that anyone could ever have in a video game bud.

Phase 2, as I said, pretty clearly has no reason why it needs to be unhittable in melee. You can still dodge things from afar even if you can get closer to him.

>Firebomb girl is fun fight with her being up top and you dodging. Why put her on the ground and make her useless?

She doesn't have to be on the ground, she can still be up top but you simply can get there too. Being able to get next to her wouldn't make the fight easier for ranged builds: You would still want to be below her so that you can avoid her while you reload. 

&#x200B;

Truly you are an incredibly thick person if you can't figure out this basic shit lol. It isn't complicated.
Nah, thinking ALL bosses HAVE to be meleeable is pretty dumb
I know. I was justangry and lost the ability to think when I found out this list was this long
Same solution.  Go to your inventory.  Switch out your items.  

I know, it’s insane, but sometimes your 1 build isn’t going to be viable against every single thing in the game.  Wild concept.
    Right?  Like why are these nerds so scared of the gear select screen?
All other souls like games I've played don't force you to equip two guns, so they are actually better for and designed for pure melee.

Remnent is soulslike, but not a souls game. Ya gotta use guns here.

    Ah man, Spoony's glory days. Good memories!
        I'm just glad people remember him, one of the classic greats.
See him stream still on occasion.
            Sad that he stopped doing reviews. I still go back to things like Pumpkinhead, all the Ultima's, and his let's plays of SWAT.
                Aye it is what it is, he saw the best and the worst of those early days of influencers, a real pioneer.
Def a missed opportunity to build silly unique synergies
    Hanz get ze Flammenhund
        Hear me out... 

Archon, gets to put an useable mod on the dog or choose an elemental attunement that is reflected in the dogs appearance and attacks. Unique dog howl can speed up mod cooldowns

Engi, gets to mount heavy weapons on the dog (dog also can now look like darpa mule) or, dog howl acts as partial reload to give HW more charges.

Challenger gets slightly enhanced effects on dog skills, dog wears armor and can wield a melee weapon. Unique bark/skill lets out a stagger effect similar to earthquake. 

Summoner, Dog can take on root appearance and skills. Can root snare enemies.  Unique bark summons a root wisp that deals light damage and counts as an additional summon.

Gunslinger, Dog now looks like a large cattle dog, will retrieve ammo to bring to party members, unique skills can have the dog yeet dynamite over designated enemies for an aoe explosion. DYNA-MUTT

Explorer, Pointer/Bloodhound/Husky.  Doggo now 'points' at nearby chests and secrets.  Can rifle through enemy corpses for additional loot.  Somewhere in each world another simulacrum is buried, follow doggos nose to find it. 

Hunter, Labrador/Catahoula leopard dog,  will also retrieve ammo to bring to the players. Can jump and latch onto designated targets to pin them briefly in the hunters directions, can also rip a new temporary weakpoint onto an enemy limb. 

Medic,  St. bernard, Bouvier. dog carries two additional dragon heart charges and dog cast rez channels are reduced by 20 percent.
            Yes to all of this. I myself would use hunter, explorer, and engi, maybe even archon
            This is a really neat idea not even gonna lie
            This is probably my favorite remnant theory post I've ever seen. I want literally every single one of these, yesterday.
    Dog plus summons, let the rolly Bois ride the doggo
        Would prefer the big one riding dogo and throwing explosive axes :)
            Sounds like radhan
            I feel like that hurt the dogs back

How about doggo rides big one and they both toss axes
                Nah, the big summon can just master gravity magic if he wants to ride the dog.
        I'm down for Boggan riders.
        Where’s the amulet that lets my dog bark out bees, or lasers, or bees that shoot lasers?
            It's in the backer rooms gotta learn C++ to get it XD
Ngl. Handler is probably the best starting class other then bruiser. Every class blows at level 1 and those self res heals are clutch.
I started on nightmare and play solo so the dog has helped out quiet a bit and usually after mastering the boss mechaniks i can get them even if the dog cant help out and the heal and res is always nice. 
I got throught the first 3 worlds and honestly felt like certain mob groups like the floating bots on Nerud are worse than most bosses
Which would work if classes didn't take ages to grind and scrap was actually available
    Honestly, it doesn't take as long as you'd think if you focus on one at a time, max the trait, and pop a stew. 

Not ideal still, but not horrible
Many sentences become entirely different if you change them.
    Blowing my FUCKIN' mind over here.
        This becomes a very different sentence if you replace "mind" with load.
            Oh my god I'm flabbergasted, you are a wizard of words!!!
Yep. Love the Reaver, but the AI can be downright brain damaged on boss fights. In the Root Nexus fight, pets will just completely ignore the boss itself. On the Annihilation fight, pets you bring into the fight through the fog gate will spawn in the floor and just sit there until they die.
    Engie sentry also ignores the Root Nexus.
        I’m okay with sparky saving ammo for the enemies that actually do damage.
    Better yet, during phase 2 of annihilation, the flying summons will bum rush the boss and fall off the edge and die instantly.  Yes, the flying ranged summon... suddenly decides it wants to melee and runs off the edge to die instantly....
My favorite part in general about the reavers is that they like to fly in point blank to the enemies to use their *ranged* attacks. That's honestly the reason I switched off having summoner as one of my classes, because they kept getting in my way too often. For a ranged summon, they act like they're a melee summon half the time.
Weird mine was sniping with throwing axes against flying enemies and bosses. Like i was impressed with the tracking as it seems to make shots that I don't think I would be able to make considering, if I was the one aiming the throwing axes.
You need to have handler as your primary archetype for that to work
    [deleted]
        The only other thing I can think about is if you gave your dog a command, like attacking an enemy or moving to a particular position. Ive noticed that if you aren't near that enemy/position and get knocked down, the dog doesn't try to rez you until that command wears off. I've accidentally commanded the dog several times while trying to use the skill, so it's an easy mistake to make
    My experience with this is wildly inconsistent. 

I have 23 hours in the game, maybe half that with Handler as my primary. My dog has revived me once and my boyfriend once. In the latter case, the dog was just sitting by me while I was downed and then ran off to revive my boyfriend after he got downed as well.
        It worked perfectly every time for me, but it has a long-ish cooldown and requires you to have at least one relic charge left.
        You probably had no relic charge left while your bf had some
            But I never actually use my Relic for anything but reviving my bf outside of boss fights, and he doesn't get downed enough to eat all my Relics.

I know that would be the cause *sometimes*, and it may have even been the cause in that specific example where my dog revived him instead of me, but in 10+ hours not more than two revives from the dog doesn't check out.
                If you switched your handler to secondary, it won't work. Also, the dog won't heal for 90 seconds after reviving you or someone else once.
                    I know. My bf doesn't really get downed outside of bosses though, so it shouldn't be on cooldown that often. The only thing I can think of that could be causing a weird interaction is that it might be going on cooldown from the Dog *trying* to revive me, only for it to not get a chance to even start the animation because my bf is running as a Medic and uses the third(?) skill that revives instantly pretty much the second I get downed. Otherwise, I really don't know what's up with the behavior.

I didn't swap Handler to secondary until several hours of play without any more than two instances of it reviving us.
                        Its working as intended for me tbh so hard to say why it dont work in your case
                My buddy was having this issue yesterday too. I tried to troubleshoot it with him, but it does seem like there’s a bug.

He had relic charges, dog wasn’t on cool down because he never revived anyone. The Handler was the primary class too. At some point he just started reviving people, but yeah he wasn’t being the best boy there for a good chunk of our playtime
        Well thats the classic case of the dog having a favorite.
        It can only be done once every 60 seconds or so. It says this in the ability.

And you need a relic charge
            Yes, I know.
        Yea looks like they have to make better priority for reviving teammates with doggy. I have never encountered problems with the dog reviving me or teammates probably because i never use the ping commands on the dog and only ever used the double tap command and hold, i’m guessing when you try and revive a teammate they have too many mobs on top of them?
popped open from the ashes again and man the skulls from the Beckon mod are so much more aggressive than the summoner Flyers, and their projectiles are at least twice as fast if not faster

&#x200B;

and that dog, annoying as the constant barking was, hits hard as hell, it hits as hard if not harder than the reaver and i dont even have evocation
Im on hard and my dog only does 80 damage a hit. Very Good boy could easily do 300 a bite so he's definitely not as as good
free revive and ranged revive on your friends is pretty dang good, just beat the game with handler main 100% of the time, during longer boss fights like the last one you can pretty much get an assured 3-4 rezzes off during the phases where you don't have enough time otherwise. the damage skill ain't that shabby either
There's secondary class for a reason. You don't always need to have handler as primary if you are worried about DPS. The only mayor factor in having handler as primary is the dog reviving you. If you want DPS, use another archetype as primary

Your dog also has increase dmg support buff as well, use that too

I am hunter main and do just fine with my DPS soloing veteran

        I'd go unlock the engineer class - really easy to get. Alongside gunslinger, engineer does the almost the same DPS and has the ability to summon turrets
ahh yes, let a dog jump 10feet in the air. Definitely a valid response...
    Yes, very strange to think that the dog that magically appears when we equip a whistle and can somehow heal you or make your guns hurt things more by howling could potentially jump high.
    Considering all the magic shit in this game, sure, why not. German shepards can jump about 5-6 feet high in real life. Give them magic dog shoes or some shit
        Doggie jet boots lmao
    Compared to everything else the dog can do, jumping is not that far fetched.
    I watched my dog fall off a thousand foot tower but then he just appeared behind me
Coach Gun in general is just really strong because it actually has range due to firing slugs.
    I play shotgun and with the right rings, traits, they basically all do.
There's another two once you clear the game on harder modes.

I feel like there's a really strong build with the >!Hero's Blade or World's Edge!< and pairing it with the Butcher's Fetish; 15% crit rate and 25% crit dam are pretty great for just mixing in a charge attack occasionally. Those two weapons also don't have extra stamina costs on the attacks so it's less damning using them.

Shoutout to Spectral Blade for also enabling this easily on *most* bosses; can hit them around corners or through walls. Lots of ways to enable the stronger trinkets!
    I like the shock axe myself! None of them are meta damage output though, I don’t think.
        It's not meta damage (only high-damage melee weapon I've found is Stonebreaker, but it only works on ground bosses), but tbh Butcher's Idol is one of the highest DPS upgrades amongst amulets you can reasonably get, but mostly because crit-damage is so insanely rare (and it gives more value to other mods, i.e. the Corrosive weapon mod is pretty awful compared to the Fire one until you've got enough crit damage to spruce it up).

It really just depends on the build you rock though and the weapon you enjoy; not all builds have room for that many amulets/trinkets, sadly.
make it do more damage from buffs >:D
That's a fair point but they've said they are looking into the costs of those things. Granted it's an issue right now so I can see how people would be frustrated. All of my traits are pretty generic so I don't really respec for anything and I have plenty of material at this point so I haven't really had much issue personally.
Levelling up equipment isn't that bad, you just might want to reroll a few areas, or help a few people, or just rest and grind a bit if you prefer, rather than a streamlined "almost fully upgraded all the time" because you dump everything into your favourite few weapons.
On Losomn being a summoner is hard work. There's these non hostile pig looking things walking around and if your summons see them they just stop and stare at them. You can be halfway across the map and they'll still be staring at the pig

They won't go back to following you unless you kill the pig, and if they spot a pig before they spot an enemy they'll just stare at it even if they're surrounded by enemies.

Gotta kill these pigs on sight if you don't want your summons to go goofing off which is kinda annoying but also kinda hilarious

My guess it's locked on to it as if it's an enemy, but it's still somewhere registered as "not an enemy", so it's just stuck in this lock on limbo because it can't get a new lock on without killing the current locked on target
    The dog does it too! I had to shoot them all or the dog would follow them around like "IT'S BACON!!!"
    Is it the same in the fae areas with the faes hiding as statues that come to life when you walk past them? As an engineer my turret just seems to shoot random things in the sky until I realised they're statues that I can't get close enough to trigger them spawning.
        Yep that too. Was really confused why my summons were shooting at stuff that wasn't (to me) there
        I actually found that handy when i was playing, i could located the fea and shoot them before they ganked me for 30% of my health
Bonus, the flyers get stuck in the floor of phase 2 of final boss. Rendering them even more useless.
    They also have issues following you if you use an elevator. Had to blow em up multiple times.
    Yeah, most pets seem to get stuck in the floor on the final boss. Not that they're much help anyway due to the boss' erratic movement patterns.
    That exact reason is why I swapped from Summoner/Engineer for the last fight to Engineer/Summoner.

Overclocked Gatling laser cannot be stuck on the door, and then I just sacrificed the flyers over and over
    The summons dont deal well with character transportation of any kind. 

So a fight where you are repeatedly teliported from locations is going to cause problems.
The huntress spear from the lady in Bloodborne-ville is thrown too. And it looks so fuckin cool
The throwing spear feels so damn good, AND you can pretend your spear fishing cross dimensions!
    the fact that you can impale your friends and NPCs in the ward with spears and they just..... stick out of their bodies is the best.

feels a little weird they let it happen with the children though....
        I forgot about this and it’s a top tier fact
    It's also quite fast for it's basic attack. Pretty good melee weapon so far imo.
Huntress' Spear, Hero's Sword, that flame GS, Krell Axe
These aren't the exact names, but:

Krell Axe, Huntress Spear, World's Edge, Atom Splitter, and Hero's Blade all can work on any boss (I think) to proc on-melee effects.

Spectral Blade works on almost every boss, except the big "stand far away and constantly DPS the weakpoint" ones. It's better against those that chase you around since you can still hit them from behind cover.

Stonebreaker works on ground-based bosses from a safe range, but tbh Stonebreaker's also the only "good" melee weapon for DPS I've found; the charge attack hits like a nuke up close and doesn't demand you constantly keep attacking or leaving yourself exposed to get in damage. Feels like a great weapon for dodging an attack, then punching the boss in the mouth.
Use both! Sounds fun haha. You’d spend the 25 stam on the throw, then when it connects you’d get 10 back heh
    There's a mutator that gives you a shield on every melee hit which further synergizes with the generating band ring that recovers hp while shielded
        Yeah, but once fully levelled up that mutator consumes shields on charge attack for a damage bonus. Good if you;'re actually close quarters, bad if you're using the spear to haha funny enemies *and* build shield.
Great to know, thanks. Will look up the Atom Splitter. Iron Greatsword has been pretty damn good so far!
    If you ever manage to beat the game on Apocalypse, there's also the World's Edge which is almost a direct upgrade to the Iron Greatsword. Same attack animation, almost the same damage values, but it also shoots a wide beam on charge attacks, like the Hero's Sword.
    Atom Splitter is good for charge attacks, but has really low melee damage otherwise when compared to other greats swords, just something to keep in mind.
Got it, thank you!
    I've seen the room it spawns in in three different dungeons so far. Vault of the formless, void vessel facility, and the story dungeon where you fight the big rolling blob.

Large room, foggy ceiling, large pillars full of stasis pods and spindly fingers that are grabbing and lifting different section of the pillars.
Does it spawn in any dungeon? I've only seen it spawn in three locations so far, all dryzyr zombie dungeons. I could see the space crab dungeons also working as the use a slightly modified tileset, but I don't see how the tile will fit into the spire type dungeons.
    I found it in hatchery but the tile set should have multiple spawn areas
right mouse button for melee?
    Neutral backdash + hold LMB, not right
It was clear, thanks.
Cool. Then say that instead of saying it is good.

Or better yet, don't say it at all because that isn't that this post is about in the first place. Obviously people can play to have fun, this post isn't that: It is about how hard people are punished for that. Like you tried to make a counterargument by bringing that up and instead just proved OP's point.
    Lol wut? 

I've been destroying bosses and elites with the weapon, tested by combat to be awesome for me. I've used it for like 20 some hours of my playtime and it's just destroyed everything I've fought.
        >I've been destroying bosses and elites with the weapon

Sure, because you can destroy any boss with almost any weapon. This game is not that hard.

But this weapon is objectively one of the worst at doing it.
            It one shots most enemies lol

Why would I need something that one shots better

Why try to even gatekeep me for enjoying a really fun weapon and having success with it
                >It one shots most enemies lol

So do many weapons.

>Why would I need something that one shots better

Because this is a game primarily about boss fights and you don't one shot bosses.

>Why try to even gatekeep me

It isn't gatekeeping. You said it was one of the best weapons and factually it isn't. You can use it all you want, I'm not telling you that you can't.

But sure, be the crybaby attention seeker who gets all defensive as soon as anyone says anything that goes against your viewpoint after you bring an irrelevant statement to someone else's post. You are free to do that.
                    You care way too much about this. Just go have fun with your meta bullshit.
                        "You care way too much about this"

Says the guy who is constantly replying to make himself feel better about not being able to read and having the education of someone who didn't pass high school.

Edit: the classic try to get the last word and then quickly block the other guy. Obviously the move of someone who isn't insecure.
Even better, if ya decide to pair it with the Hunter's scan, you can even snipe enemies through walls since the beam kinda ignores them!
    That's genius. I will be trying that. The sword going through environments and the range definitely makes up for its lesser damage.
Matriarchs amulet gives you 35% melee damage and 10 stamina on melee hits, a must for melee builds
    Oooh, throwing the spear uses 25 stamina, you can combine the ring that gives max shield when you use 25 stam. With that amulet it works like throw > spend 25 and get shield > hit > get 10 stam back
    The butchers amulet is also good for the melee builds that focus on charge attacks.
        I will go look this up rn…!
You lose stamina throwing it??I have never seen mine drop when my character does it???
    Stamina is not used outside of combat
If you start fight with it it will be for free ;)
Would you say the huntresses spear is better than krells axe?

It seemed much harder to get, but damage didn’t seem any better when factoring in the multiple shock explosions krells gets
When you can hit him, as many angles will cause you to hit his protective cloak or go under his floating body. I would say he's still better to fight up close, just **with** a gun.
Any of the red bosses with the vortex modifier can go fuck right off. Got one that you have to fight in some small corridors and it was absolute hell trying to see what was going on.
Does it also have one? Only one I don't have.
    Yes sir/ma’am/????
I know there's the Daredevil ring for unequipped armour, but I haven't heard of one for unequipped weapons.
    I thought daredevil ring was any unequipped item in this game
        Only unequipped armor slots. It also gives you negative damage resist for each slot, so it turns you into a pure glass cannon, which would be terrible for melee.

My bad, it was a Necklace.
Something is currently wrong with the DR mechanic, I swear.

Others have noticed it too, it seems like Armor and flat are multiplicative, which is punishing for anyone not running Leto's armor, and honestly kind of irritating. Heavier armor should mean you have to invest less to reach cap and can thus get other stats. The way it's working just means everyone is going to end up running around in Leto's armor with 80% flat dr or risk getting oneshot.

Like if you have 40% armor DR and 40% flat currently, if it's multiplicative, that's only 64% DR. Compared to 80%, that's **80% more** damage taken.

Personally I want a strict cap at 80%, or an "overflow" mechanic where excess DR% over 80% becomes multiplicative and thus is subject to large diminishing returns. Could still have Havel/Leto's Monsters running around and having huge DR while not punishing everyone else that way. Alternatively could have Bulwark exceed the DR cap, but only give 2% DR if it's past cap, to make Bulwark feel more like the GIGA TANK mechanic.
    oh my god i didnt know it was multiplicative, that explains a lot

is it always armor is base and DR is multiplied to it or whichever is higher then multiplicative from whichever of the two is lower? that definitely means i need a more DR to actually hit the invisible cap well fuck me lol
        It's not confirmed, just an observation shared by players. The way the stat screen presents it is that it should be additive. However, there was a good post about a guy clearing Apocalypse where he discusses that Flat DR that exceeded cap was definitely doing something.

Also it wouldn't matter what the "base" is, since it would just be multiplying the remainder of damage. (1-DRa)x(1-DRf)
The Root Nexus? It's an immobile target, prime for shooting. And it even gets a special attack if you're meleeing it to mildly punish melee (it can grab you).
    Can’t remember what it is called but the big tree that doesn’t move.

It doesn’t do anything other than summoning adds.

Literally doesn’t do a single attack.
        No, that's the boss I'm talking about, it does have a single attack: it can grab you with roots while you're in melee. Unless that's something one of the adds does.
            I believe that’s one of the elite adds.
            It's literally what one of the adds does. Roots you and gives you Root Rot status effect. The tree tank elite. Annoying monster.
                Gotcha. Never encountered it while actually fighting the enemy, is it attached to the big shockwave attack?
That’s what I’m saying is that there’s tons of places melee is usable but because it’s not like dark souls where almost everything is just a punch out they feel melee is unusable 😂
    There's also a lot of places where melee is completely unusable. But I haven't run into any situation where a gun is unusable...and very few situations where a gun is not more practical and easier in every way.
        Nerud any of the building and places with the zombies and crickets. Laesha most of the enemies besides flying one. I could go on an on the whole thing is sure melee is unusable if you can’t dodge or can’t learn timing. Acting as if melee is unusable is just goofy since it’s surely able to be used but there’s a reason why the game gives a primary, secondary, and melee. Primary = damage secondary = capacity and minimum damage melee  = aoe and crowd control
            The unusable part refers to flying enemies and bosses, when you literally cannot reach enemies. Outside of that, melee merely finds itself at a disadvantage in a lot of situations. Having to chase after bosses teleporting to teammates, increasing the risk of friendly fire, making it harder for allies to use AoE attacks...guns just have a lot less nonsense to put up with, at least until you start using ranged melee weapons.  

It just makes melee build options feel really out of place.
Root Nexus didn't seem possible to hit the weak spot with melee weapons, leading to all melee damage being grey. If I'm wrong and it's possible, then I think it's very unreliable at least. *Technically* killable as melee, but holy hell will it take awhile.
    I did that only hitting the nexus with melee since I was running out of ammo and it was the first encounter I found in my campaign. You can hit the weakspot with melee on a specific side of it.
    [deleted]
        Maybe? I tried Edge of the Forest and Scrap Greatsword.
            you have to basically pretend that your melee is an aimable veryveryvery short range gun and depending on the weapon, where your reticle is when the 'shot' goes off determines if you get a weakspot/hit/whiff. 

Trick is to aim at the larger glowing red parts of the trunk as aiming for the smaller red parts surrounded by 'regular root trunk' has a much higher chance of getting resisted, especially when you get shoved around by all the adds.

Also recommend trying the engineer's turret melee as even with a crappy build i was hitting something like 3-4k on the juicy red parts of the tree. I've no clue how quickly you could destroy it if you went with an actual melee build, but I'm assuming much, much faster.
This is all very cool (genuinely, I plan to do a melee build at some point so knowing a few of the options is neat) but I think people are reading something into my post which I never said ("melee is useless") rather than what I did ("ranged attacks are usable in all circumstances, melee is more situational").
&#x200B;

>THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT melee dmg

With is only 5% more damage than what ranged can get. Except ranged has higher than 5% dps base most of the time. SO they actually get more bonus from the 30% than melee gets from 35% because percentage works better the higher the base DPS is.

So not only is it *not* insane, it isn't even that good
Did you *play* Remnant 1?

You realise they talked about giving more of a niche to melee centric playstyles in this game, right? When it overall is a bit worse than 1 due to enemy design?

It's just a slightly less rough start, but otherwise not as good.

Don't give people a wide range of melee loot, a large number of melee trinkets, and a class which has an entire skill based exclusively around improving melee if you don't want people to try and focus on melee.

Given they *did* all that, and what they've said in the past, I'd hazard a guess they absolutely *do* want the option of melee to be an entirely valid method of play.

Much like you probably swing your melee here and there, people who want to play melee understand they'll need to shoot. It's the ratio that's the issue.

**EDIT:** Like, to be clear, melee *would* be better in this game. They have made a HUGE number of changes to improve it. But then they made half the enemies fly, most of the bosses hell to melee, and gave them frankly gross close range damage.

So close, GFG. So close.
>The game is a shooter first and foremost

Dark Souls is a melee combat game first and foremost. You can still make a pure Sorcerer build work very *very* well if you spec completely into it.

>hy do you people act like melee options need to be on the same level as guns

It doesn't, but unlike Remnant 1 they clearly designed many *many* pieces of gear and skills around that so it *should* be.
    I know it takes a lot of inspiration from it but it's not Dark Souls, it's Remnant and the developers obviously see their game as a shooter with melee acting only as a secondary option. Having gear and skills for your secondary doesn't mean it should be usable as a primary.

How about you guys just play the game that's in front of you instead of trying to turn it into something else? Dark Souls don't have difficulties levels or procedurally generated worlds, should they get rid of that as well so it's closer to it?
        >I know it takes a lot of inspiration from it but it's not Dark Souls

Read your comment, then read my comment again. Because either you know are wrong and are deliberately trying to avoid addressing it, or you simply didn't read it.
            No
                Okay so you are just admitting you know you are wrong then. Guess that is one way to do it.
                    I'm saying there's nothing in your comment that would make me change my mind by reading it a second time

Just because something is possible in Dark Souls, it doesn't mean it should be in this game. They made their game as a shooter with melee acting as a secondary only and evidence of that are the bosses you cant kill only with melee. You call it a design flaw, i call it a deliberate choice.

Play the game that's in front of you not the one you made in your head
                        >I'm saying there's nothing in your comment that would make me change my mind by reading it a second time

Well allow me to walk your middle-school-level-intelligence ass through it then.

This is a quote from you, as justification for melee being bad:

>The game is a shooter first and foremost

This was my reply:

>Dark Souls is a melee combat game first and foremost. You can still make a pure Sorcerer build work very very well if you spec completely into it.

Clearly this isn't saying the game is dark souls, this is using your own logic to show how you are wrong for saying that just because the game is gun based that you *can't* inherently do something different. That fact it was dark souls is irrelevant, that was used just because they make for easier comparisons. But what it does show is that your logic is objectively incorrect and thus you have no actual argument for your point.

At first I thought you did see that and just chose to make a fallacy out of it and make it seem like you misunderstood, but no, clearly you are just that thick.
>Sure they are. It's called ammo.

You know gunslinger exists, right? But if you don't, let me tell you:

No, ammo is not a relevant thing in this game.
    Oh, so without a class that isn't immediately unlocked, nor always desired (including the trait) . Imagine sounding that stupid.
        >Oh, so without a class that isn't immediately unlocked, 

I mean it is.

>nor always desired

No, for ranged builds it kind of is. It not only has great ammo stuff but is also one of the best for damage. 

And even when you ignore that, no most weapons don't have ammo problems and even then, at worst you are going to be using a secondary not a melee which still benefits from your build completely.
But it was already solved in the first game by making most bosses just not fucking fly. It's not something that would be easily fixed at this phase of course, it would have needed to nipped in the bud at the design and concept phase. At this point I'll just enjoy the game for what it is of course, as this is a very tiny spill in a great lake of enjoyment.

The only reason I'm a little salty, is that for some reason: Remnant 1 had a much more viable melee-only experience despite being told at release that the game wasn't made to be played as a melee build.

Remnant 2 has a much worse melee-only experience, despite being told that melee had a lot more work done to it in order to allow it to be played as your primary strategy.
    I think that's a bit of a bad faith argument. Remnant 1 had plenty of bosses that were unkillable using melee. Raze, the Iskal Queen, Clavager, Ixilis, Barbed Terror, and both campaign final bosses to name a few. Several others had phases where they'd jump or fly out of melee range as well like Dream Eater, Tian, and Erfor. Then there's Obryk and The Thrall which both have deadly AOE mist nonsense that makes getting close to them nigh impossible. It's not like Remnant 2's boss design philosophy suddenly veered off into a new direction to fuck over melee players.
        You can hit Clavager's arms from the edge of the arena, I killed the Dreamer's first phase (But not the second, obviously) and Harsgaard completely with melee only, the Iskal Queen's knees are melee'able. Bosses with temporarily immune phases are also completely nonsensical as an argument as well, since I'm specifically talking about bosses you **CANNOT** deal with in melee in a realistic sense. Not sub-optimal, but enemies who cannot be stricken up close.

As well, elements like Obryk's and Thrall's AoEs are completely fine as well. I'm not asking to stand afk against bosses and ignore danger. I will state though, i completely forgot about Raze, and it's true that doing Barbed Terror in melee only is a slow methodical headache so I would count it as non-viable for melee.

And I'm not sure where the bad faith is. I never said that they intentionally made things worse for melee, I'm not trying to write an agenda that they have something against melee players. I literally said that the game is great, I just find it weird how I find it harder to play melee-only in the game when it was told to us that melee had more forethought put into it.

I understand you want to defend the game, and I don't think it needs defending as it stands on it's own merit. But you can't look at the percent of enemies that never touch the ground and say that there isn't a skewer towards the sequel.

And of course I could and should probably talk about the upsides to melee. The mutator system is great for melee, the many different ways to modify encumbrance and build tanky is another boon. The removal of nearly all hit-scan enemies is another thing that helps melee only. The change to lifesteal means that melee players actually need to play the game as well, no longer being able to sustain most bosses' beatings pre-apocalypse. Of course there's a ton of benefits that Remnant 2 has given a melee playstyle, I just wish I could actually use my up-close melee options against half of Nerud's base creature pool.
            All fair points.

I'm curious now. Can you use the Invader second ability to teleport up to the molotov lady? That'd be funny as hell.
    Remnant 1 was more melee-friendly, but still had problematic fights like the moth boss. IIRC it flew just off the side of the platform, so if you tried to melee it, you would just fall off and die. Also the final boss I think had a phase where you couldn't reach it with melee.
The problem is you’re talking about the current roster of bosses. You eliminate the problem of it being complicated by simply not designing bosses who can’t be approached from the get go. I get the game is shooting oriented, but melee has the exact same systems in place for building around it that ranged does, the only difference is melee has fights where it simply can’t do damage. It just seems like bad, lazy design to me.
    I can appreciate that, but I also think that it's a huge design limitation that would exist to the detriment of of the shooter experience.
        Yeh, but then why offer so much build chose for melee? If you’re going to make encounters that invalidate the entire gear and class choses a player has made simply so you can have a easier time making fights, then they should drop melee and make it more of a utility thing. Replace all the relics, classes, and items and throw that into more builds for ranged, mods, and skills and make melee simply a kick button because as is you’re baiting new players into a play style that is going to hit a hard wall. Joey spends all his resources on melee weapons, goes a melee class, has all melee relics, full melee ring equips, only to find he has gotten to a boss that hangs from a wall. Now Joey feels like he just wasted all of his resources and time. I just don’t think there is a good excuse developer wise for having that kind of design and I get they aren’t a big company, but I feel this is something that should have been shaped up for this sequel and where does the game broadcast, this is shooter rpg, melee is a second rate choice. Most players aren’t going to go into the game assuming there is such lack of design for melee because it has all the options available to play into it.
            I think the "well melee isn't ment to be a main weapon" argument is so dumb. The build verity is insane for melee with sheer options alone. Then throw on the various weapons and two classes built around it and it's kinda silly to say the devs didn't intend for a full melee build. Throw in the fact that there is only a few shotguns in the game and the argument doesn't really hold much water. I think it's just poor design one way or another. I love the game, but I agree I'd rather have it not have options then having all these option and none of them able to do damage against most bosses. 

Like, ALOT of stuff in this game is melee oriented in terms of items, but then having tons of stuff jot being able to be hit by it is silly.
Just wanted to mention, the Alternate boss in N'Erud is actually meleeable. The upright fist attack can be melee attacked, which feels very much like a conscious decision to allow melee players to kill him. If more bosses had even just singular attack patterns like that in their entire kit, the game would be better.

And the firebomb girl is not fun to anyone I've talked to, lmao. Basically just waiting for her to pull out 15 bombs over the duration of the fight so you can kill her.
SO you couldn't name a single one then? Because not a single one of those bosses' mechanics rely on you not being able to get in to melee them. Nothing would change in any of those fights for ranged builds if you could melee those bosses. They would play exactly the same. 

Also I love how you mention the cube boss, a boss that is arguably the most hated boss in the game right now. Like not only are you proving my point, but you are actively making the argument that making it so bosses can't be melee not only doesn't make ranged more fun, but actively makes ranged *less fun*.
    Cube boss is the easiest and most fun boss in the game but it’s the most hated. Uh huh sure bud. 

Final boss mechanic is literally him flying around looking cool and being a stationary target while you dodge his mechanics in phase 2.

Alternate N’Erud boss would be weird meleeable when he’s a floating space fetus. 

Flying jellyfish literally has his mechanic around downing his guardian so ok take that away by making him meleeable and you stand there tanking hits from both while you kill him, real fun.

Firebomb girl is fun fight with her being up top and you dodging. Why put her on the ground and make her useless?
        >Cube boss is the easiest and most fun boss in the game but it’s the most hated. Uh huh sure bud.

Yes, it is sure.

>Final boss mechanic is literally him flying around looking cool and being a stationary target while you dodge his mechanics in phase 2.

Keyword "looking". Look has nothing to do with gameplay. You can still make that same look while allowing them to be hit in melee. Literally almost every single dragon fight in any video game ever has the same look and style in the fight and can still be hit by melee builds. This is possibly one of the most stupid takes that anyone could ever have in a video game bud.

Phase 2, as I said, pretty clearly has no reason why it needs to be unhittable in melee. You can still dodge things from afar even if you can get closer to him.

>Firebomb girl is fun fight with her being up top and you dodging. Why put her on the ground and make her useless?

She doesn't have to be on the ground, she can still be up top but you simply can get there too. Being able to get next to her wouldn't make the fight easier for ranged builds: You would still want to be below her so that you can avoid her while you reload. 

&#x200B;

Truly you are an incredibly thick person if you can't figure out this basic shit lol. It isn't complicated.
Right?  Like why are these nerds so scared of the gear select screen?
Ah man, Spoony's glory days. Good memories!
    I'm just glad people remember him, one of the classic greats.
See him stream still on occasion.
        Sad that he stopped doing reviews. I still go back to things like Pumpkinhead, all the Ultima's, and his let's plays of SWAT.
            Aye it is what it is, he saw the best and the worst of those early days of influencers, a real pioneer.
Hanz get ze Flammenhund
    Hear me out... 

Archon, gets to put an useable mod on the dog or choose an elemental attunement that is reflected in the dogs appearance and attacks. Unique dog howl can speed up mod cooldowns

Engi, gets to mount heavy weapons on the dog (dog also can now look like darpa mule) or, dog howl acts as partial reload to give HW more charges.

Challenger gets slightly enhanced effects on dog skills, dog wears armor and can wield a melee weapon. Unique bark/skill lets out a stagger effect similar to earthquake. 

Summoner, Dog can take on root appearance and skills. Can root snare enemies.  Unique bark summons a root wisp that deals light damage and counts as an additional summon.

Gunslinger, Dog now looks like a large cattle dog, will retrieve ammo to bring to party members, unique skills can have the dog yeet dynamite over designated enemies for an aoe explosion. DYNA-MUTT

Explorer, Pointer/Bloodhound/Husky.  Doggo now 'points' at nearby chests and secrets.  Can rifle through enemy corpses for additional loot.  Somewhere in each world another simulacrum is buried, follow doggos nose to find it. 

Hunter, Labrador/Catahoula leopard dog,  will also retrieve ammo to bring to the players. Can jump and latch onto designated targets to pin them briefly in the hunters directions, can also rip a new temporary weakpoint onto an enemy limb. 

Medic,  St. bernard, Bouvier. dog carries two additional dragon heart charges and dog cast rez channels are reduced by 20 percent.
        Yes to all of this. I myself would use hunter, explorer, and engi, maybe even archon
        This is a really neat idea not even gonna lie
        This is probably my favorite remnant theory post I've ever seen. I want literally every single one of these, yesterday.
Dog plus summons, let the rolly Bois ride the doggo
    Would prefer the big one riding dogo and throwing explosive axes :)
        Sounds like radhan
        I feel like that hurt the dogs back

How about doggo rides big one and they both toss axes
            Nah, the big summon can just master gravity magic if he wants to ride the dog.
    I'm down for Boggan riders.
    Where’s the amulet that lets my dog bark out bees, or lasers, or bees that shoot lasers?
        It's in the backer rooms gotta learn C++ to get it XD
Honestly, it doesn't take as long as you'd think if you focus on one at a time, max the trait, and pop a stew. 

Not ideal still, but not horrible
Blowing my FUCKIN' mind over here.
    This becomes a very different sentence if you replace "mind" with load.
        Oh my god I'm flabbergasted, you are a wizard of words!!!
Engie sentry also ignores the Root Nexus.
    I’m okay with sparky saving ammo for the enemies that actually do damage.
Better yet, during phase 2 of annihilation, the flying summons will bum rush the boss and fall off the edge and die instantly.  Yes, the flying ranged summon... suddenly decides it wants to melee and runs off the edge to die instantly....

    The only other thing I can think about is if you gave your dog a command, like attacking an enemy or moving to a particular position. Ive noticed that if you aren't near that enemy/position and get knocked down, the dog doesn't try to rez you until that command wears off. I've accidentally commanded the dog several times while trying to use the skill, so it's an easy mistake to make
My experience with this is wildly inconsistent. 

I have 23 hours in the game, maybe half that with Handler as my primary. My dog has revived me once and my boyfriend once. In the latter case, the dog was just sitting by me while I was downed and then ran off to revive my boyfriend after he got downed as well.
    It worked perfectly every time for me, but it has a long-ish cooldown and requires you to have at least one relic charge left.
    You probably had no relic charge left while your bf had some
        But I never actually use my Relic for anything but reviving my bf outside of boss fights, and he doesn't get downed enough to eat all my Relics.

I know that would be the cause *sometimes*, and it may have even been the cause in that specific example where my dog revived him instead of me, but in 10+ hours not more than two revives from the dog doesn't check out.
            If you switched your handler to secondary, it won't work. Also, the dog won't heal for 90 seconds after reviving you or someone else once.
                I know. My bf doesn't really get downed outside of bosses though, so it shouldn't be on cooldown that often. The only thing I can think of that could be causing a weird interaction is that it might be going on cooldown from the Dog *trying* to revive me, only for it to not get a chance to even start the animation because my bf is running as a Medic and uses the third(?) skill that revives instantly pretty much the second I get downed. Otherwise, I really don't know what's up with the behavior.

I didn't swap Handler to secondary until several hours of play without any more than two instances of it reviving us.
                    Its working as intended for me tbh so hard to say why it dont work in your case
            My buddy was having this issue yesterday too. I tried to troubleshoot it with him, but it does seem like there’s a bug.

He had relic charges, dog wasn’t on cool down because he never revived anyone. The Handler was the primary class too. At some point he just started reviving people, but yeah he wasn’t being the best boy there for a good chunk of our playtime
    Well thats the classic case of the dog having a favorite.
    It can only be done once every 60 seconds or so. It says this in the ability.

And you need a relic charge
        Yes, I know.
    Yea looks like they have to make better priority for reviving teammates with doggy. I have never encountered problems with the dog reviving me or teammates probably because i never use the ping commands on the dog and only ever used the double tap command and hold, i’m guessing when you try and revive a teammate they have too many mobs on top of them?
[deleted]
    I'd go unlock the engineer class - really easy to get. Alongside gunslinger, engineer does the almost the same DPS and has the ability to summon turrets
Yes, very strange to think that the dog that magically appears when we equip a whistle and can somehow heal you or make your guns hurt things more by howling could potentially jump high.
Considering all the magic shit in this game, sure, why not. German shepards can jump about 5-6 feet high in real life. Give them magic dog shoes or some shit
    Doggie jet boots lmao
Compared to everything else the dog can do, jumping is not that far fetched.
I watched my dog fall off a thousand foot tower but then he just appeared behind me
I play shotgun and with the right rings, traits, they basically all do.
I like the shock axe myself! None of them are meta damage output though, I don’t think.
    It's not meta damage (only high-damage melee weapon I've found is Stonebreaker, but it only works on ground bosses), but tbh Butcher's Idol is one of the highest DPS upgrades amongst amulets you can reasonably get, but mostly because crit-damage is so insanely rare (and it gives more value to other mods, i.e. the Corrosive weapon mod is pretty awful compared to the Fire one until you've got enough crit damage to spruce it up).

It really just depends on the build you rock though and the weapon you enjoy; not all builds have room for that many amulets/trinkets, sadly.
The dog does it too! I had to shoot them all or the dog would follow them around like "IT'S BACON!!!"
Is it the same in the fae areas with the faes hiding as statues that come to life when you walk past them? As an engineer my turret just seems to shoot random things in the sky until I realised they're statues that I can't get close enough to trigger them spawning.
    Yep that too. Was really confused why my summons were shooting at stuff that wasn't (to me) there
    I actually found that handy when i was playing, i could located the fea and shoot them before they ganked me for 30% of my health
They also have issues following you if you use an elevator. Had to blow em up multiple times.
Yeah, most pets seem to get stuck in the floor on the final boss. Not that they're much help anyway due to the boss' erratic movement patterns.
That exact reason is why I swapped from Summoner/Engineer for the last fight to Engineer/Summoner.

Overclocked Gatling laser cannot be stuck on the door, and then I just sacrificed the flyers over and over
The summons dont deal well with character transportation of any kind. 

So a fight where you are repeatedly teliported from locations is going to cause problems.
the fact that you can impale your friends and NPCs in the ward with spears and they just..... stick out of their bodies is the best.

feels a little weird they let it happen with the children though....
    I forgot about this and it’s a top tier fact
It's also quite fast for it's basic attack. Pretty good melee weapon so far imo.
There's a mutator that gives you a shield on every melee hit which further synergizes with the generating band ring that recovers hp while shielded
    Yeah, but once fully levelled up that mutator consumes shields on charge attack for a damage bonus. Good if you;'re actually close quarters, bad if you're using the spear to haha funny enemies *and* build shield.
If you ever manage to beat the game on Apocalypse, there's also the World's Edge which is almost a direct upgrade to the Iron Greatsword. Same attack animation, almost the same damage values, but it also shoots a wide beam on charge attacks, like the Hero's Sword.
Atom Splitter is good for charge attacks, but has really low melee damage otherwise when compared to other greats swords, just something to keep in mind.
I've seen the room it spawns in in three different dungeons so far. Vault of the formless, void vessel facility, and the story dungeon where you fight the big rolling blob.

Large room, foggy ceiling, large pillars full of stasis pods and spindly fingers that are grabbing and lifting different section of the pillars.
I found it in hatchery but the tile set should have multiple spawn areas
Neutral backdash + hold LMB, not right
Lol wut? 

I've been destroying bosses and elites with the weapon, tested by combat to be awesome for me. I've used it for like 20 some hours of my playtime and it's just destroyed everything I've fought.
    >I've been destroying bosses and elites with the weapon

Sure, because you can destroy any boss with almost any weapon. This game is not that hard.

But this weapon is objectively one of the worst at doing it.
        It one shots most enemies lol

Why would I need something that one shots better

Why try to even gatekeep me for enjoying a really fun weapon and having success with it
            >It one shots most enemies lol

So do many weapons.

>Why would I need something that one shots better

Because this is a game primarily about boss fights and you don't one shot bosses.

>Why try to even gatekeep me

It isn't gatekeeping. You said it was one of the best weapons and factually it isn't. You can use it all you want, I'm not telling you that you can't.

But sure, be the crybaby attention seeker who gets all defensive as soon as anyone says anything that goes against your viewpoint after you bring an irrelevant statement to someone else's post. You are free to do that.
                You care way too much about this. Just go have fun with your meta bullshit.
                    "You care way too much about this"

Says the guy who is constantly replying to make himself feel better about not being able to read and having the education of someone who didn't pass high school.

Edit: the classic try to get the last word and then quickly block the other guy. Obviously the move of someone who isn't insecure.
That's genius. I will be trying that. The sword going through environments and the range definitely makes up for its lesser damage.
Oooh, throwing the spear uses 25 stamina, you can combine the ring that gives max shield when you use 25 stam. With that amulet it works like throw > spend 25 and get shield > hit > get 10 stam back
The butchers amulet is also good for the melee builds that focus on charge attacks.
    I will go look this up rn…!
Stamina is not used outside of combat
If you start fight with it it will be for free ;)
Yes sir/ma’am/????
I thought daredevil ring was any unequipped item in this game
    Only unequipped armor slots. It also gives you negative damage resist for each slot, so it turns you into a pure glass cannon, which would be terrible for melee.
https://remnantfromtheashes.wiki.fextralife.com/White+Rose

My bad, it was a Necklace.
oh my god i didnt know it was multiplicative, that explains a lot

is it always armor is base and DR is multiplied to it or whichever is higher then multiplicative from whichever of the two is lower? that definitely means i need a more DR to actually hit the invisible cap well fuck me lol
    It's not confirmed, just an observation shared by players. The way the stat screen presents it is that it should be additive. However, there was a good post about a guy clearing Apocalypse where he discusses that Flat DR that exceeded cap was definitely doing something.

Also it wouldn't matter what the "base" is, since it would just be multiplying the remainder of damage. (1-DRa)x(1-DRf)
Can’t remember what it is called but the big tree that doesn’t move.

It doesn’t do anything other than summoning adds.

Literally doesn’t do a single attack.
    No, that's the boss I'm talking about, it does have a single attack: it can grab you with roots while you're in melee. Unless that's something one of the adds does.
        I believe that’s one of the elite adds.
        It's literally what one of the adds does. Roots you and gives you Root Rot status effect. The tree tank elite. Annoying monster.
            Gotcha. Never encountered it while actually fighting the enemy, is it attached to the big shockwave attack?
There's also a lot of places where melee is completely unusable. But I haven't run into any situation where a gun is unusable...and very few situations where a gun is not more practical and easier in every way.
    Nerud any of the building and places with the zombies and crickets. Laesha most of the enemies besides flying one. I could go on an on the whole thing is sure melee is unusable if you can’t dodge or can’t learn timing. Acting as if melee is unusable is just goofy since it’s surely able to be used but there’s a reason why the game gives a primary, secondary, and melee. Primary = damage secondary = capacity and minimum damage melee  = aoe and crowd control
        The unusable part refers to flying enemies and bosses, when you literally cannot reach enemies. Outside of that, melee merely finds itself at a disadvantage in a lot of situations. Having to chase after bosses teleporting to teammates, increasing the risk of friendly fire, making it harder for allies to use AoE attacks...guns just have a lot less nonsense to put up with, at least until you start using ranged melee weapons.  

It just makes melee build options feel really out of place.
I did that only hitting the nexus with melee since I was running out of ammo and it was the first encounter I found in my campaign. You can hit the weakspot with melee on a specific side of it.
[deleted]
    Maybe? I tried Edge of the Forest and Scrap Greatsword.
        you have to basically pretend that your melee is an aimable veryveryvery short range gun and depending on the weapon, where your reticle is when the 'shot' goes off determines if you get a weakspot/hit/whiff. 

Trick is to aim at the larger glowing red parts of the trunk as aiming for the smaller red parts surrounded by 'regular root trunk' has a much higher chance of getting resisted, especially when you get shoved around by all the adds.

Also recommend trying the engineer's turret melee as even with a crappy build i was hitting something like 3-4k on the juicy red parts of the tree. I've no clue how quickly you could destroy it if you went with an actual melee build, but I'm assuming much, much faster.
I know it takes a lot of inspiration from it but it's not Dark Souls, it's Remnant and the developers obviously see their game as a shooter with melee acting only as a secondary option. Having gear and skills for your secondary doesn't mean it should be usable as a primary.

How about you guys just play the game that's in front of you instead of trying to turn it into something else? Dark Souls don't have difficulties levels or procedurally generated worlds, should they get rid of that as well so it's closer to it?
    >I know it takes a lot of inspiration from it but it's not Dark Souls

Read your comment, then read my comment again. Because either you know are wrong and are deliberately trying to avoid addressing it, or you simply didn't read it.
        No
            Okay so you are just admitting you know you are wrong then. Guess that is one way to do it.
                I'm saying there's nothing in your comment that would make me change my mind by reading it a second time

Just because something is possible in Dark Souls, it doesn't mean it should be in this game. They made their game as a shooter with melee acting as a secondary only and evidence of that are the bosses you cant kill only with melee. You call it a design flaw, i call it a deliberate choice.

Play the game that's in front of you not the one you made in your head
                    >I'm saying there's nothing in your comment that would make me change my mind by reading it a second time

Well allow me to walk your middle-school-level-intelligence ass through it then.

This is a quote from you, as justification for melee being bad:

>The game is a shooter first and foremost

This was my reply:

>Dark Souls is a melee combat game first and foremost. You can still make a pure Sorcerer build work very very well if you spec completely into it.

Clearly this isn't saying the game is dark souls, this is using your own logic to show how you are wrong for saying that just because the game is gun based that you *can't* inherently do something different. That fact it was dark souls is irrelevant, that was used just because they make for easier comparisons. But what it does show is that your logic is objectively incorrect and thus you have no actual argument for your point.

At first I thought you did see that and just chose to make a fallacy out of it and make it seem like you misunderstood, but no, clearly you are just that thick.
Oh, so without a class that isn't immediately unlocked, nor always desired (including the trait) . Imagine sounding that stupid.
    >Oh, so without a class that isn't immediately unlocked, 

I mean it is.

>nor always desired

No, for ranged builds it kind of is. It not only has great ammo stuff but is also one of the best for damage. 

And even when you ignore that, no most weapons don't have ammo problems and even then, at worst you are going to be using a secondary not a melee which still benefits from your build completely.
I think that's a bit of a bad faith argument. Remnant 1 had plenty of bosses that were unkillable using melee. Raze, the Iskal Queen, Clavager, Ixilis, Barbed Terror, and both campaign final bosses to name a few. Several others had phases where they'd jump or fly out of melee range as well like Dream Eater, Tian, and Erfor. Then there's Obryk and The Thrall which both have deadly AOE mist nonsense that makes getting close to them nigh impossible. It's not like Remnant 2's boss design philosophy suddenly veered off into a new direction to fuck over melee players.
    You can hit Clavager's arms from the edge of the arena, I killed the Dreamer's first phase (But not the second, obviously) and Harsgaard completely with melee only, the Iskal Queen's knees are melee'able. Bosses with temporarily immune phases are also completely nonsensical as an argument as well, since I'm specifically talking about bosses you **CANNOT** deal with in melee in a realistic sense. Not sub-optimal, but enemies who cannot be stricken up close.

As well, elements like Obryk's and Thrall's AoEs are completely fine as well. I'm not asking to stand afk against bosses and ignore danger. I will state though, i completely forgot about Raze, and it's true that doing Barbed Terror in melee only is a slow methodical headache so I would count it as non-viable for melee.

And I'm not sure where the bad faith is. I never said that they intentionally made things worse for melee, I'm not trying to write an agenda that they have something against melee players. I literally said that the game is great, I just find it weird how I find it harder to play melee-only in the game when it was told to us that melee had more forethought put into it.

I understand you want to defend the game, and I don't think it needs defending as it stands on it's own merit. But you can't look at the percent of enemies that never touch the ground and say that there isn't a skewer towards the sequel.

And of course I could and should probably talk about the upsides to melee. The mutator system is great for melee, the many different ways to modify encumbrance and build tanky is another boon. The removal of nearly all hit-scan enemies is another thing that helps melee only. The change to lifesteal means that melee players actually need to play the game as well, no longer being able to sustain most bosses' beatings pre-apocalypse. Of course there's a ton of benefits that Remnant 2 has given a melee playstyle, I just wish I could actually use my up-close melee options against half of Nerud's base creature pool.
        All fair points.

I'm curious now. Can you use the Invader second ability to teleport up to the molotov lady? That'd be funny as hell.
Remnant 1 was more melee-friendly, but still had problematic fights like the moth boss. IIRC it flew just off the side of the platform, so if you tried to melee it, you would just fall off and die. Also the final boss I think had a phase where you couldn't reach it with melee.
I can appreciate that, but I also think that it's a huge design limitation that would exist to the detriment of of the shooter experience.
    Yeh, but then why offer so much build chose for melee? If you’re going to make encounters that invalidate the entire gear and class choses a player has made simply so you can have a easier time making fights, then they should drop melee and make it more of a utility thing. Replace all the relics, classes, and items and throw that into more builds for ranged, mods, and skills and make melee simply a kick button because as is you’re baiting new players into a play style that is going to hit a hard wall. Joey spends all his resources on melee weapons, goes a melee class, has all melee relics, full melee ring equips, only to find he has gotten to a boss that hangs from a wall. Now Joey feels like he just wasted all of his resources and time. I just don’t think there is a good excuse developer wise for having that kind of design and I get they aren’t a big company, but I feel this is something that should have been shaped up for this sequel and where does the game broadcast, this is shooter rpg, melee is a second rate choice. Most players aren’t going to go into the game assuming there is such lack of design for melee because it has all the options available to play into it.
        I think the "well melee isn't ment to be a main weapon" argument is so dumb. The build verity is insane for melee with sheer options alone. Then throw on the various weapons and two classes built around it and it's kinda silly to say the devs didn't intend for a full melee build. Throw in the fact that there is only a few shotguns in the game and the argument doesn't really hold much water. I think it's just poor design one way or another. I love the game, but I agree I'd rather have it not have options then having all these option and none of them able to do damage against most bosses. 

Like, ALOT of stuff in this game is melee oriented in terms of items, but then having tons of stuff jot being able to be hit by it is silly.
Cube boss is the easiest and most fun boss in the game but it’s the most hated. Uh huh sure bud. 

Final boss mechanic is literally him flying around looking cool and being a stationary target while you dodge his mechanics in phase 2.

Alternate N’Erud boss would be weird meleeable when he’s a floating space fetus. 

Flying jellyfish literally has his mechanic around downing his guardian so ok take that away by making him meleeable and you stand there tanking hits from both while you kill him, real fun.

Firebomb girl is fun fight with her being up top and you dodging. Why put her on the ground and make her useless?
    >Cube boss is the easiest and most fun boss in the game but it’s the most hated. Uh huh sure bud.

Yes, it is sure.

>Final boss mechanic is literally him flying around looking cool and being a stationary target while you dodge his mechanics in phase 2.

Keyword "looking". Look has nothing to do with gameplay. You can still make that same look while allowing them to be hit in melee. Literally almost every single dragon fight in any video game ever has the same look and style in the fight and can still be hit by melee builds. This is possibly one of the most stupid takes that anyone could ever have in a video game bud.

Phase 2, as I said, pretty clearly has no reason why it needs to be unhittable in melee. You can still dodge things from afar even if you can get closer to him.

>Firebomb girl is fun fight with her being up top and you dodging. Why put her on the ground and make her useless?

She doesn't have to be on the ground, she can still be up top but you simply can get there too. Being able to get next to her wouldn't make the fight easier for ranged builds: You would still want to be below her so that you can avoid her while you reload.

Where’s the amulet that lets my dog bark out bees, or lasers, or bees that shoot lasers?
    It's in the backer rooms gotta learn C++ to get it XD
This becomes a very different sentence if you replace "mind" with load.
    Oh my god I'm flabbergasted, you are a wizard of words!!!
I’m okay with sparky saving ammo for the enemies that actually do damage.
The only other thing I can think about is if you gave your dog a command, like attacking an enemy or moving to a particular position. Ive noticed that if you aren't near that enemy/position and get knocked down, the dog doesn't try to rez you until that command wears off. I've accidentally commanded the dog several times while trying to use the skill, so it's an easy mistake to make
It worked perfectly every time for me, but it has a long-ish cooldown and requires you to have at least one relic charge left.
You probably had no relic charge left while your bf had some
    But I never actually use my Relic for anything but reviving my bf outside of boss fights, and he doesn't get downed enough to eat all my Relics.

I know that would be the cause *sometimes*, and it may have even been the cause in that specific example where my dog revived him instead of me, but in 10+ hours not more than two revives from the dog doesn't check out.
        If you switched your handler to secondary, it won't work. Also, the dog won't heal for 90 seconds after reviving you or someone else once.
            I know. My bf doesn't really get downed outside of bosses though, so it shouldn't be on cooldown that often. The only thing I can think of that could be causing a weird interaction is that it might be going on cooldown from the Dog *trying* to revive me, only for it to not get a chance to even start the animation because my bf is running as a Medic and uses the third(?) skill that revives instantly pretty much the second I get downed. Otherwise, I really don't know what's up with the behavior.

I didn't swap Handler to secondary until several hours of play without any more than two instances of it reviving us.
                Its working as intended for me tbh so hard to say why it dont work in your case
        My buddy was having this issue yesterday too. I tried to troubleshoot it with him, but it does seem like there’s a bug.

He had relic charges, dog wasn’t on cool down because he never revived anyone. The Handler was the primary class too. At some point he just started reviving people, but yeah he wasn’t being the best boy there for a good chunk of our playtime
Well thats the classic case of the dog having a favorite.
It can only be done once every 60 seconds or so. It says this in the ability.

And you need a relic charge
    Yes, I know.
Yea looks like they have to make better priority for reviving teammates with doggy. I have never encountered problems with the dog reviving me or teammates probably because i never use the ping commands on the dog and only ever used the double tap command and hold, i’m guessing when you try and revive a teammate they have too many mobs on top of them?
I'd go unlock the engineer class - really easy to get. Alongside gunslinger, engineer does the almost the same DPS and has the ability to summon turrets
Doggie jet boots lmao
It's not meta damage (only high-damage melee weapon I've found is Stonebreaker, but it only works on ground bosses), but tbh Butcher's Idol is one of the highest DPS upgrades amongst amulets you can reasonably get, but mostly because crit-damage is so insanely rare (and it gives more value to other mods, i.e. the Corrosive weapon mod is pretty awful compared to the Fire one until you've got enough crit damage to spruce it up).

It really just depends on the build you rock though and the weapon you enjoy; not all builds have room for that many amulets/trinkets, sadly.
Yep that too. Was really confused why my summons were shooting at stuff that wasn't (to me) there
I actually found that handy when i was playing, i could located the fea and shoot them before they ganked me for 30% of my health
I forgot about this and it’s a top tier fact
Yeah, but once fully levelled up that mutator consumes shields on charge attack for a damage bonus. Good if you;'re actually close quarters, bad if you're using the spear to haha funny enemies *and* build shield.
>I've been destroying bosses and elites with the weapon

Sure, because you can destroy any boss with almost any weapon. This game is not that hard.

But this weapon is objectively one of the worst at doing it.
    It one shots most enemies lol

Why would I need something that one shots better

Why try to even gatekeep me for enjoying a really fun weapon and having success with it
        >It one shots most enemies lol

So do many weapons.

>Why would I need something that one shots better

Because this is a game primarily about boss fights and you don't one shot bosses.

>Why try to even gatekeep me

It isn't gatekeeping. You said it was one of the best weapons and factually it isn't. You can use it all you want, I'm not telling you that you can't.

But sure, be the crybaby attention seeker who gets all defensive as soon as anyone says anything that goes against your viewpoint after you bring an irrelevant statement to someone else's post. You are free to do that.
            You care way too much about this. Just go have fun with your meta bullshit.
                "You care way too much about this"

Says the guy who is constantly replying to make himself feel better about not being able to read and having the education of someone who didn't pass high school.

Edit: the classic try to get the last word and then quickly block the other guy. Obviously the move of someone who isn't insecure.
I will go look this up rn…!
Only unequipped armor slots. It also gives you negative damage resist for each slot, so it turns you into a pure glass cannon, which would be terrible for melee.
It's not confirmed, just an observation shared by players. The way the stat screen presents it is that it should be additive. However, there was a good post about a guy clearing Apocalypse where he discusses that Flat DR that exceeded cap was definitely doing something.

Also it wouldn't matter what the "base" is, since it would just be multiplying the remainder of damage. (1-DRa)x(1-DRf)
No, that's the boss I'm talking about, it does have a single attack: it can grab you with roots while you're in melee. Unless that's something one of the adds does.
    I believe that’s one of the elite adds.
    It's literally what one of the adds does. Roots you and gives you Root Rot status effect. The tree tank elite. Annoying monster.
        Gotcha. Never encountered it while actually fighting the enemy, is it attached to the big shockwave attack?
Nerud any of the building and places with the zombies and crickets. Laesha most of the enemies besides flying one. I could go on an on the whole thing is sure melee is unusable if you can’t dodge or can’t learn timing. Acting as if melee is unusable is just goofy since it’s surely able to be used but there’s a reason why the game gives a primary, secondary, and melee. Primary = damage secondary = capacity and minimum damage melee  = aoe and crowd control
    The unusable part refers to flying enemies and bosses, when you literally cannot reach enemies. Outside of that, melee merely finds itself at a disadvantage in a lot of situations. Having to chase after bosses teleporting to teammates, increasing the risk of friendly fire, making it harder for allies to use AoE attacks...guns just have a lot less nonsense to put up with, at least until you start using ranged melee weapons.  

It just makes melee build options feel really out of place.
Maybe? I tried Edge of the Forest and Scrap Greatsword.
    you have to basically pretend that your melee is an aimable veryveryvery short range gun and depending on the weapon, where your reticle is when the 'shot' goes off determines if you get a weakspot/hit/whiff. 

Trick is to aim at the larger glowing red parts of the trunk as aiming for the smaller red parts surrounded by 'regular root trunk' has a much higher chance of getting resisted, especially when you get shoved around by all the adds.

Also recommend trying the engineer's turret melee as even with a crappy build i was hitting something like 3-4k on the juicy red parts of the tree. I've no clue how quickly you could destroy it if you went with an actual melee build, but I'm assuming much, much faster.
>I know it takes a lot of inspiration from it but it's not Dark Souls

Read your comment, then read my comment again. Because either you know are wrong and are deliberately trying to avoid addressing it, or you simply didn't read it.
    No
        Okay so you are just admitting you know you are wrong then. Guess that is one way to do it.
            I'm saying there's nothing in your comment that would make me change my mind by reading it a second time

Just because something is possible in Dark Souls, it doesn't mean it should be in this game. They made their game as a shooter with melee acting as a secondary only and evidence of that are the bosses you cant kill only with melee. You call it a design flaw, i call it a deliberate choice.

Play the game that's in front of you not the one you made in your head
                >I'm saying there's nothing in your comment that would make me change my mind by reading it a second time

Well allow me to walk your middle-school-level-intelligence ass through it then.

This is a quote from you, as justification for melee being bad:

>The game is a shooter first and foremost

This was my reply:

>Dark Souls is a melee combat game first and foremost. You can still make a pure Sorcerer build work very very well if you spec completely into it.

Clearly this isn't saying the game is dark souls, this is using your own logic to show how you are wrong for saying that just because the game is gun based that you *can't* inherently do something different. That fact it was dark souls is irrelevant, that was used just because they make for easier comparisons. But what it does show is that your logic is objectively incorrect and thus you have no actual argument for your point.

At first I thought you did see that and just chose to make a fallacy out of it and make it seem like you misunderstood, but no, clearly you are just that thick.
>Oh, so without a class that isn't immediately unlocked, 

I mean it is.

>nor always desired

No, for ranged builds it kind of is. It not only has great ammo stuff but is also one of the best for damage. 

And even when you ignore that, no most weapons don't have ammo problems and even then, at worst you are going to be using a secondary not a melee which still benefits from your build completely.
You can hit Clavager's arms from the edge of the arena, I killed the Dreamer's first phase (But not the second, obviously) and Harsgaard completely with melee only, the Iskal Queen's knees are melee'able. Bosses with temporarily immune phases are also completely nonsensical as an argument as well, since I'm specifically talking about bosses you **CANNOT** deal with in melee in a realistic sense. Not sub-optimal, but enemies who cannot be stricken up close.

As well, elements like Obryk's and Thrall's AoEs are completely fine as well. I'm not asking to stand afk against bosses and ignore danger. I will state though, i completely forgot about Raze, and it's true that doing Barbed Terror in melee only is a slow methodical headache so I would count it as non-viable for melee.

And I'm not sure where the bad faith is. I never said that they intentionally made things worse for melee, I'm not trying to write an agenda that they have something against melee players. I literally said that the game is great, I just find it weird how I find it harder to play melee-only in the game when it was told to us that melee had more forethought put into it.

I understand you want to defend the game, and I don't think it needs defending as it stands on it's own merit. But you can't look at the percent of enemies that never touch the ground and say that there isn't a skewer towards the sequel.

And of course I could and should probably talk about the upsides to melee. The mutator system is great for melee, the many different ways to modify encumbrance and build tanky is another boon. The removal of nearly all hit-scan enemies is another thing that helps melee only. The change to lifesteal means that melee players actually need to play the game as well, no longer being able to sustain most bosses' beatings pre-apocalypse. Of course there's a ton of benefits that Remnant 2 has given a melee playstyle, I just wish I could actually use my up-close melee options against half of Nerud's base creature pool.
    All fair points.

I'm curious now. Can you use the Invader second ability to teleport up to the molotov lady? That'd be funny as hell.
Yeh, but then why offer so much build chose for melee? If you’re going to make encounters that invalidate the entire gear and class choses a player has made simply so you can have a easier time making fights, then they should drop melee and make it more of a utility thing. Replace all the relics, classes, and items and throw that into more builds for ranged, mods, and skills and make melee simply a kick button because as is you’re baiting new players into a play style that is going to hit a hard wall. Joey spends all his resources on melee weapons, goes a melee class, has all melee relics, full melee ring equips, only to find he has gotten to a boss that hangs from a wall. Now Joey feels like he just wasted all of his resources and time. I just don’t think there is a good excuse developer wise for having that kind of design and I get they aren’t a big company, but I feel this is something that should have been shaped up for this sequel and where does the game broadcast, this is shooter rpg, melee is a second rate choice. Most players aren’t going to go into the game assuming there is such lack of design for melee because it has all the options available to play into it.
    I think the "well melee isn't ment to be a main weapon" argument is so dumb. The build verity is insane for melee with sheer options alone. Then throw on the various weapons and two classes built around it and it's kinda silly to say the devs didn't intend for a full melee build. Throw in the fact that there is only a few shotguns in the game and the argument doesn't really hold much water. I think it's just poor design one way or another. I love the game, but I agree I'd rather have it not have options then having all these option and none of them able to do damage against most bosses. 

Like, ALOT of stuff in this game is melee oriented in terms of items, but then having tons of stuff jot being able to be hit by it is silly.
>Cube boss is the easiest and most fun boss in the game but it’s the most hated. Uh huh sure bud.

Yes, it is sure.

>Final boss mechanic is literally him flying around looking cool and being a stationary target while you dodge his mechanics in phase 2.

Keyword "looking". Look has nothing to do with gameplay. You can still make that same look while allowing them to be hit in melee. Literally almost every single dragon fight in any video game ever has the same look and style in the fight and can still be hit by melee builds. This is possibly one of the most stupid takes that anyone could ever have in a video game bud.

Phase 2, as I said, pretty clearly has no reason why it needs to be unhittable in melee. You can still dodge things from afar even if you can get closer to him.

>Firebomb girl is fun fight with her being up top and you dodging. Why put her on the ground and make her useless?

She doesn't have to be on the ground, she can still be up top but you simply can get there too. Being able to get next to her wouldn't make the fight easier for ranged builds: You would still want to be below her so that you can avoid her while you reload. 

&#x200B;

Truly you are an incredibly thick person if you can't figure out this basic shit lol. It isn't complicated.
Sad that he stopped doing reviews. I still go back to things like Pumpkinhead, all the Ultima's, and his let's plays of SWAT.
    Aye it is what it is, he saw the best and the worst of those early days of influencers, a real pioneer.
Yes to all of this. I myself would use hunter, explorer, and engi, maybe even archon
This is a really neat idea not even gonna lie
This is probably my favorite remnant theory post I've ever seen. I want literally every single one of these, yesterday.
Sounds like radhan
I feel like that hurt the dogs back

How about doggo rides big one and they both toss axes
    Nah, the big summon can just master gravity magic if he wants to ride the dog.
