[[Hardest bosses entrance I've ever seen.]]


Hate the roll catches, love the design


One of those bosses that just swipe the floor with you If you don't know all the moves.
    He's a goddamn gladiator and you'll _know_ it after the first few attempts.
    Skull cracker on him hurts so much
    Or if you dont have enough stamina. I know the moves but if my homie is down.... god help me. There was one time he would not, and i mean it, would not stop attacking. There was no room for recovery no room for any mistakes and even then. The fucker got me.
        From all the Reisum Bosses, he is the greatest menace.
    this was where i was finally defeated by remnant lol
Remnant 2‚Äôs (dlc) boss Bruin that kicks a Fae goes hard too
    Bruin goes hard too, but his design made me think of "I am vengeance" in a batman impression
    Reminds me of artorias in dark souls killing a guy and throwing him at you
        Kinda, now you say. But that is also Brutal
    Just tracked that down to watch it and the impaling was pretty awesome too
    Too bad the Bruin fight is so fucking awful.
shoutout to the first castle crashers boss
    My thoughts exactly. Im so happy to see this comment. Castle crashers was a great fuckin game.
    Let‚Äôs GOOOOOOOOOO
    Looked it up. I can see the resemblance, but nah. That is also the boss after a goat thing that shoots cannons according to the video I saw, so 2nd boss.
        That is a minor boss. The Barbarian Boss is the first actual (major) boss you fight in Castle Crashers.
            Gotcha
Haven't fought him yet, but we need more characters in fiction who dual wield shields
    Gives a new meaning to ‚Äúthe best defense is a good offense‚Äù
        Especially when your defense has spikes all over it
    This was the first time I‚Äôve seen a character do that since that random summon guy from dark souls 2 Sellsword Luet
        I don't think I've seen him, or at least I didn't pay much attention when summoning him

I know Dark Souls 2 had the Reeve and Orma great shields you could power stance, and Dark Souls 3 has the door greatshield in the Ringed City, but that's about it

FromSoftware better give us a power stance shield in Shadow of The Erdtree
When I got to this fight I was really disappointed with how he looked like a normal enemy...and then the dual shields came crashing down and I had to pick my jaw off the floor lol.
    The janitors had to pick my guts up off this guys floor many many times lmfao
By far, the hardest boss of R1 and the survival ender
    I got him constantly in survivor. Only beat him twice and the 1st time was a trade w/ him a the 1st boss
        I killed him in survival with 100% turrets and minions...this guy is impossible.
    THE hardest has to go to Iskal Queen
Getting this guy early in a survival run can be a pain!
    9 times he was tgev1st boss... Only one of those did I beat him and it was a trade
Would
Overall this boss is fun *unless* he gets skullcracker as a suffix. The reason for this isn't skullcracker itself, but the imbalance in buggy mechanics interaction caused by the frostbite status effect. It slows down *all* actions ***including standing up***. This means if he has skullcracker and you get even a touch of frostbite on you then you ***cannot stand up fast enough to avoid another stagger hit***, making this boss a ***one shot*** with ***any attack*** that hits outside of wearing super heavy defense setups with Leto's. Even that can sometimes be staggered.

This has always been a problem with him and everyone, even high skill players, hate him because of that.

He has always been considered **the** hardcore and survival run ender because of this.

Why Gunfire never addressed this before abandoning the game beats me.
    I remember losing my hardcore run to him, still hate him to this day
    hence the flair lmao, that shit was absolutely wild on harder difficulties
    >super heavy defense setups with Leto's

Everyone wears Leto's though.
        No they don't, lol. Most wear Hunter set or Slayer set with a touch of Radiant here and there.
        I didn't and don't and have beat the whole game including this boss.
    Gotten him 6 times on survival. Tool me less than 10 tries on regular... Luckily
I wish we got to go back to resium, it's the best area from remnant 1 imo
    Not likely, but it's possible for a DLC. A lot of people like that and Rhom. I just want the 3 areas to have DLC stories and 1 extra area. W never saw the undead Pan of Yeasha, so I think they'll go that route
        I really hope we don't get more n'erud though
            N'erud was my 1st planet so I don't mind. Maybe they'll add Rhom in it's place? The Vir remind me of N'erud enemies tbh
            If they would just add more to N'erud it would be OK. I get its supposed to be barren but it's a little too barren.
Hate this guy so much
This guy ended all my survival runs lol
SKULLCRACKER OBRYK MY BELOVED
    Last time he had skullcracker for me, I had to freeze him so that he'd be slow enough that I could win
This guy on Apoc. Fucking yikes.
    Haven't done apoc yet since I'm still gearing up. He is brutal for shire tho
Also the hardest boss in the dlc :)
    May have figured that part out. Roll catch, roll catch, frozen movement, and roll catch... Did I mention roll catch?
Which world is he in? I've never seen him.
    Remnant 1, subject whatever # DLC area
![gif](giphy|y2i2oqWgzh5ioRp4Qa|downsized)
üé∂I‚Äôm the biggest rat that makes all of the rulesüé∂
Who tf is this‚Ä¶.do I have to redownload this shit AGAIN
    Remnant 1 DLC subject whatever #
It's been done before... but I DO agree...
![gif](giphy|ibAVHcAvrrsU8)

Reminds me that Atorias of the Abyss goes hard
I fucking hate the skullcracker variant of this boss. It's actual AIDS.
Thought this was a Skaven at first, then I saw it was from the Remnant subreddit
I currently have him in one shot mode with the hearty affix.  Not a fan.  That frozen crap....
damn i never managed to get my hands on the FTA dlcs but this is just a piece of art
Especially since the first time I encountered him was shortly after the Ratman Ninja that looks really similar to the Ratlet that got crushed by Chadiator üò§üòÆ‚Äçüí®
    That one is constantly jumping into the pit... Got stuck on some stuff in survivor, he did, and i had to find a way to get unstuck. The solution ended up being crouch... Died twice on survivor to him because I got stuck on the train...
        Lol is this comment meant for me? Sorry
            Then rat ninja jumps in the casam a lot for me, but didn't specify what I was taking about... I also just comment off of limited info cuz I got lazy at reading
                Lol all good brudda I understand now. That's funny I've never seen that happen but I don't get the ninja rat in my survival playthroughs much
                    I made a post w/ the rat jumping onto the casam after I found it for the 1st time... So many people commented "calculated" and I wish they were right üòÇ
Would have been hilarious if a bigger monster kept killing the last one to show up lol
    Get like 5 and the final is like the awakened king or Anihilation
My favorite boss in the game. So much fun to abuse using melee üòÄ
This boss was a fun fight too, he slaps if he makes contact lol.
Bleed builds wreck this dude. I kinda sashayed through the game using a bleed/corrosive Regen build.
    I mean, kinda can't help builds when u get him a they 1st boss in survival (4 times in a row at times)
Castle Crashers did it first
Just like bruin. Roll towards him.
    Did u forget ice aura of 2nd phase. If u get frozen, you're dead
BOBER KURWA
I'm going to be hated for this, but cliche. Not a bad thing but I've seen it happen in souls games and the like, that frankly, look a helluva lot better.

Now if someone could point me in the direction so I can get this subreddit off my feed, I'd be eternally grateful. Unnntil I forget about it. A ban works too, idrc.
    Just go to the subreddit page and look at some options if u wanna leave so bad. Not likely anyone but me is gonna notice this comment either. Posted this over a month ago
    I was about to say didn‚Äôt Rick call this out as Pickle Rick on Rick and morty years ago‚Ä¶ is this a Rick and morty reference
Artorius type of entrance
Stolen straight outa castle crashers
This is literally stolen from the Destiny boss that literally crushes who you originally thought would be the boss and then begins the fight.

Also, this game looks like straight doodoo no idea why reddit recommended this post to me lmao. Softest/most stolen boss entrance ever.
This reminds me of a certain first boss from an indie game with colorful knights
Clearly you ain't seen Rhulk.
    He's more classy/at ease. Taking u more lightly until damage phase. This one hits hard because he lands on top of a gladiatorial competitor
        Good point. they're both hard in their own ways.
Don‚Äôt think Rem 2 bosses are this badass
    Bruin came close, but they batman wannabe armor ruins it for me
        Yeah but he isn‚Äôt as imposing too lanky
            True
    I mean, Venom has a very similar intro where he obliterates a rootling with his sword.
        A rootling... This guy was beating his gladiatorial brethren and u compare him to... A rootling... Venom is intimidating enough by himself. Venom's cutscene reminded me of that viral meme of a girl adoring a cute rabbit only to see it get shot by and arrow
Ahhh yes. Captain America.
Hardest entrance ever? Nah

Kinda funny? Yeah

‚ÄúTime to die muthafu- *BLEGH* ‚Äú

‚ÄúFinally some peace and- oh you saw that? Welp guess I gotta kill you too.‚Äù
Ahh yes the norscan varient of the skaven. Hope we get them back in the sequal as dlc
I‚Äôve beaten remnant 2 and I don‚Äôt remember this fella so I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs from R1
    Ye. DLC subject whatever #
My god, how I hated this dude until I figured out his moves.  Early on survival run killer unless you got some good gear and baubles.
    Constantly fighting the freeze and if you get hit once....that's all she wrote folks...
I beat this boss no problem the first time i encountered him. He beats my ass every single time now. If im on survival i know if i get this boss my run is over
    I beat him like 5 times on survival... But he has way more wins against me üòÇ
Bro copied the entrance of the Jackal lmao/s
He's a goddamn gladiator and you'll _know_ it after the first few attempts.
Skull cracker on him hurts so much
