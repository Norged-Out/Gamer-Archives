[[Nier Replicant Remaster Announced]]





I wonder what the significance of the version number is (ver. 1.22474487139...), it's the square root of 1.5.
    I bet they're adding content that ties into Automata. 2B and 9S's voice actors are confirmed to have roles in this version.
        Holy shit really ? Do you have the source for that ?
            [Stream summary (In JP)](https://gamestalk.net/post-141918) One of the bullet points says their actors have a (brief) role and they finished recording it.
                This is absolute banger for fan like me ! Thanks a lot for sharing this.
                    They might be Replicants of actual humans that later serve as the blueprint for YoRHa androids?
                        I swear there was a data file that implied A2 was based on Kaine. And pretty much every android in YorHa was like the metaphorical children of her and since the robots were based on Emil from the aliens they were like his metaphorical kids.
                Holy fucking shit as somebody that loved Autonama and just figured I would never be able to play the original: I .freaking out rn
                Amazing thanks for sharing!
        If they did some tiny changes to fuck with us id be so happy
            I mean its Yoko Taro I feel like theres a very strong chance of that happening
        They also announced a mobile game, which appears to have a young Kaine on the site, so maybe additional tie-ins.
    They will release two versions of the game (Nier: Fire, Nier: Water), and you'll have to play both to get  the full Nier 1.5's story.
        The original Japanese release consisted of Nier:Replicant (PS3) and Nier:Gestalt (360)

PS3 had young Nier we see here and 360 had papa neir, Gestalt was the only version ported to the west so he's the one most western fans would be more familiar with. I'm interested to see if papa Nier makes a comeback somehow or if they'll just do Replicant.
            I hope they do the older one. It worked well for the story having an ugly desperate father that barely handles weapons well do anything for his daughter. Plus it's probably Jamieson Price's best performance.
                I have a great fondness for the Nier we got and when this comes out I don't know if I'll be able to play the Japanese dub, the English voices are just so familiar especially Weiss! Though they seem to have rerecorded the Japanese dub so they may do the same for English. Hope they get the same team
                    The English cast was stellar too, Laura Bailey, Liam O'Brien, Julie Ann Taylor, and Jamieson Price are some of my favourite VAs and they all did an amazing job in the original NieR.
                        Normally I don't play anything in English dub but this game was an exception for sure! The direction was stellar for the English dub, a place where Automata fell down a bit. I really hope the original team comes back for this!
                            Really? I thought Automata was incredibly voiced. Eve's psychotic breakdown when Adam dies is bone chilling. Ray Chase, fresh off his regal performance in FFXV, sent shivers down my spine.
                                [This is a soap box so the reply is a little long soz]

I agree there I liked Eve's voice a LOT. I really love English 9S, too. Just before I say this, I'm fond Kira Buckland and her presence in the community, I think she did a great job. I just think the English localisation team represented 2B in a way that takes away from the subtlety of her character in the original.

What I disliked particularly was the direction they went with the translation of her lines and their delivery. Japanese 2B is often detached and professional, above all else, though she has moments where emotion shows through her professional facade. English 2B is sarcastic, harsh with 9S, and at times generically "sassy" in the way commanding women in (esp. sci-fi and post apocalyptic) fiction often are.  

An example is a kind of catchphrase 2B says a lot in the game. When 9S is complaining about something, JP2B says 文句を言わない/Monku wo iwanai Japanese often omits the subject so I took it as "(we) don't complain". She says it very matter-of-fact, calmly. It's their job to do what their told and not to complain, she's reminding 9S of something he's heard a million times over from her and others. But she actually likes that impulsive part of him so she's not really giving out.

ENG2B scolds him. I believe the line is either "stop complaining" or "stop whining", I don't recall which. It totally shuts him down and gets rid of the subtlety the original had. This is where it was super clear that this was the direction the translation and localising went.

Edit: oooo!! I mentioned this to a friend as I was writing this and someone made a YouTube video about what I'm trying to say!! Halfway in the video and I totally agree with what's said here! https://youtu.be/l1jotXNoO40
                                    This might be a bit late, but I completely agree with you on what they did to 2B (Again, the script, writing, and localization, not the performance )

They did something very similar with Zero in Drakengard 3. Often times she was meant to come off as tired or lethargic, but she just seemed like an angry bitch most of the time, and It really detracted from what was supposed to be her character.
            Is there any difference between the two games outside of the character swap?
                The character himself has a slightly different personality. Brother Nier is a bit more gentle pre-timeskip and becomes nearly psychotic post-timeskip. Father Nier has a similar progression, but it's not nearly as jarring.
                    [removed]
                        Yeah even if the dialogue is exactly the same, the context of one protagonist being a seasoned older widower and the other being a inexperienced orphan teenager really makes their relationships with other characters feel a lot different. The subtext matters.
                Well, I played the English version so unfortunately I dont have first hand experience on this one but as far as I'm aware it's just the character change so that has an impact on the dialogue. I'll double check with the JP content though!

Edit: I didn't notice anything!! Kind of want to replay the game now though haha
                    I only played the old man english version too

                Wait, what part of that is false? The post you're responding to didn't assert it was the plan all along, just that two versions were ultimately released.
                    Yes he just reiterated what the previous post said with more info.
                Edit: to be clear I was discussing what was release, not what Yoko Taro wanted.

Apologies, but Nier Gestalt and Replicant released on the same day in Japan and they were on two different consoles, this is very much true. At the end of this comment are some original promotional images of the Japanese release of Gestalt, showing Papa Nier.

Sorry if the translation is weird I did it hurriedly.

From Japanese wiki:

>『ニーア レプリカント』（NieR RepliCant）および『ニーア ゲシュタルト』（NieR Gestalt）は、2010年4月22日にスクウェア・エニックスから発売されたアクションRPG。

> "Nier Replicant" and "Nier Gestalt" are Action RPGs released by Square Enix on the 22nd of April 2010.

>『レプリカント』はプレイステーション3、『ゲシュタルト』はXbox 360でそれぞれ発売。海外ではPS3・Xbox 360の両機種ともに『ゲシュタルト』の内容で『NIER』のタイトルで販売している。

>They were released separately with "Replicant" on PlayStation 3 and "Gestalt" on 360. Overseas the PS3/360 the two variations were released with the contents of "Gestalt" under the title "NIER".

Edit2: since I'm translating things I'd like to add the blurb that Famitsu review gives for Nier Gestalt.

>黒文病にかかった娘のヨナを助けるために冒険する父親のニーアとなり、仲間と巨大なマモノと戦うのだ。プレイヤーの行動によって、エンディングが変化する。
>Playing as Nier, a father who sets out on an adventure to rescue his daughter Yona from the Black scrawl[illness], you team up with your allies to fight giant *mamono* [translated in-game as Shades]. According to the player's actions the ending will change.
                what I find most wild about this is that Pappa Neir was supposed to be "macho"
                    He's fairly macho post-timeskip, but pre-timeskip he's just a down-on-his-luck dad whose desperate for money to care for his daughter. Poor dude is completely willing to throw away his pride and do anything to help her and is really empathetic to complete strangers.
                [deleted]
                    The problem is it also messes up his dynamic with Kaine and Emil. And brother/sister is still believable for the main dynamic imo as someone with 4 sisters
            I thought Replicant was brought to the West? I could've sworn I remember it at Gamestop when it came out.
                Maybe I'm remembering the titles backwards but I'm pretty sure the one with young Nier didn't get localized. There's a fan translations project for it
                    You're correct. Regardless of the name. The game devs felt that a western audience would find a "Father&Daughter" story more appealing than the "Brother&Sister" originally planned.
                        I really liked the father/daughter story more than having it be brother and sister. It felt more realistic that a father would do absolutely anything to save his sick daughter. I'll be disappointed of we don't have that story available in the West.
                            We already do, that's the one that was originally ported.

Regardless, you can tell that the game was written for the brother story. The lines papa Nier has about friendship and Emil's crush on him make more sense if he's younger. There's also him aging up on the second half, which Gestalt replaced with... an eyepatch.

                                    Well to each their own, haha. I feel the exact opposite way in every way, so I'm glad we're finally getting a translation for brother Nier.
                        and they were right because it's *way* more compelling and I believe a father >!Dooming the entire human race!< for the sake of his daughter without question, but a brother doing it for his sister just seems like an illogical stretch. But I guess then you can't appeal to the weirdly prevalent siscon crowd.
        Funny you say that considering there's two versions of the original Nier.
            The only difference is that in the Japanese only version you play as a brother while in the worldwide version you play as a dad.
    Because it's more than a remaster and less than a remake. Therefore, 1.5. With a Yoko Taro edgy flair added.
    [deleted]
        Suddenly Mickey and Goofy stroll in
    So this is NieR 1.5 then.

From the company that brought you Kingdom Hearts I.5 and II.5 (yes, Roman numerals mixed with decimals).
Holy shit. I know they trademarked Nier several months ago but I had no hope of a remaster. I loved the original and Automata. I can’t wait for this.
    Well, a remaster is easier than a new game so it should have been more probable- especially with the remaster trend we've been seeing lately.
        Is NieR Replicant any good? I have heard that previous NieR games before Automata are good in terms of story and music but have *reaaaally* rough gameplay.

I loved Automata and I am loving the continuation of its story in FF14 so I am excited to explore more of the NieR games, either way.
            So it's actually similar in a lot of ways to Automata conceptually in terms of gameplay. The problem is it's a lot rougher and the quality of life features just aren't there. Still, the story is pretty amazing. The second playthrough really turns everything on it's head, too.
                The second playthrough really made me change my worldview quite a bit.
                    How so? I played Automata and have the gist of the story of Nier. I'm just curious how it changed you.
                        not OP but imo it paints certain events into a bigger painting with much more context, much like automata. the point being that you never know how other people are feeling/why they act a certain way or do the things they do. in the it's easy to assume someone is evil/an asshole when you don't know the full story.
                            I thought that reveal during the second playthrough was a bit cheap. Everyone will keep attacking you first even if youre not fighting back, felt kinda unsatisfied when those wolves tried to kill me just because I was walking around and then theyre weeping "what did we do to deserve this ?" in the cutscenes later ...
                                i honestly didn't remember the details so i had to rewatch the cutscenes. what i seem to remember is that the wolves and humans from the village were under constant fight, so it might make sense that the wolves would attack any human on sight. but i'm not saying that nier was a flawless game, it definitely lacked in some departments.
                                    Oh dont get me wrong I really liked Nier ... in a weirdly  confusing and depressing way lol

But that big emotional gut punch just wasnt as heavy as it could have been.
                            Sounds like it made you have more empathy for people. Which is awesome.
                        It made me realize that the world isn't black and white, also made me question if what I do as a hero in a video game is actually ethical or if it's just ethical for the people I am doing it for. It awakened in me an interest in finding books/games/movies that cover similiar topics, where everything isn't black and white, but rather much like the real world, it is different shades of grey.
                            Ideally, you probably should have learned this in middle/high school through assigned reading. Good that you eventually picked up on this though.
                                and ideally, people should learn critical thinking in school which clearly many people don't. there are some things you just have to teach yourself. love you too btw :)
                                    Agreed. I think this is a failing of public school systems. There is fantastic material that is assigned in American schools, for example, that focus on the duality of good & evil (Lord of the Flies, Of Mice & Men, To Kill A Mockingbird, a TON of Shakespeare), but the reality is many teachers themselves lack good understandings of the texts themselves that they fail to engage students whom, otherwise, the texts could really resonate with. Or yknow provide good life lessons.
                                German middle/high school reading is all about "nazis bad", we did do critical interpretations, but we always needed to qrite what the teacher wanted to hear if we wanted to get a good grade and when Nier first came out, I had graduated the year before and was still a die hard commie, extremists aren't exactly known for recognizing shades of grey.
                                    I was speaking from an American perspective, so unsure of the German education system, but this doesn't sound that different. It really is a failing of schools and teachers who don't engage the students with the texts.
                I'm having flashbacks... Only different!
                To be fair though, some of Automata's "improvements" aren't really. Power leveling in Nier felt natural and word system didn't get in the way of things and items were separated out. Automata's leveling and chip system was needlessly convoluted and time consuming for the sake of being convoluted and time consuming. One upgrade though from Nier to Automata was fantastic.... the path to get a weapon upgraded with materials.  And I mean the physical path. Automata had sensible fast travel location to the blacksmith and the weapon shops. Nier... fk Nier. Fk those ladders. And fk the absolute rage (by the end of the multiple playthroughs) I felt every time I needed to go to the Brothers shop or that location in general. I swear by the end my neck was sore from all the times I swung my head back and groaned as I climbed those ladders. I kept screaming, "Why can't I just fast travel to that area?! How about just 1 ladder to climb after you clear it the first time?! Why is there not some kind of fn shortcut by hour 40?!"
            Depends.

It's worth noting that Automata was notable partially because it was basically the first Yoko taro game that didn't play like complete shit, but his other games do incredibly interesting stuff with regards to the story. So, if you're fine playing a janky piece of ass for a similar narrative experience, it's worth it. But it is *very* janky.
                I love me some proper japanese jank
                    Imagine if Japanese Jank and EuroJank worked together. They'd be unstoppable.
                        And also unplayable
                        Gothic: Nier Jankima
                            Mount and Gothic: Nierlord
                            Kingdom Nier Deliverjank
                            Gothic <3
                        The perfect meme game doesn't exist.
                        To me, Dragons Dogma hits that spot. Love that game. It still holds up, but in a completely different way. Like in a junk way.
                To say Nier Gestalt/Replicant plays like "complete shit" is really going overboard. It's very barebones but it's not "bad". Especially not "complete shit"

Drakengard on the other hand, that did not age well at all.
                To be fair, Drakengard 3 only played like complete shit because it ran like ass too. I recently(-ish) emulated it and at a stable framerate it doesn't feel too different from Nier.
                    Can you direct me to some info on how to emulate Drakengard 3? Last I checked it wasn't available on the main PS3 emulator (forgot the name).
                        It is definitely playable on RPCS3 including all DLC. Maybe an update broke it because I haven't touched it for a year.
                        Like the other poster said, it's emulatable on RPCS3 [with very little tweaking](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Drakengard_3). A bunch of (pretty much all?) Unreal Engine 3-based games are.
            Wait, does Automata story continues?
                Automata is a sequel to Replicant. During Route B if you found any "Project Gestalt reports" that's what they're referencing. Emil's character also carries over from there among with various other references.

EDIT: Sorry I didn't see you were referring to FF14.
                    Pretty sure he's asking about the FF14 thing.
                        Oh whoops, my bad. I have the same question now since I thought it was more a cameo thing.
                            It's not just a cameo, it's a full series of three raids and a plot line that act as a continuation of Automata's story (though to what degree, we don't quite know yet because only about a third of it is in the game right now). Raid 1 has two new bosses and two bosses that are familiar faces, though I won't spoil who they are. Raid 2 is dropping within the next two months and raid 3 will be six months after that.
                final fantasy 14 has a nier automata side story in it, which is tied into a yorha unit and a derelict factory. It's not finished yet so not clear how it sits in the timeline.
                    Now I need to start FF14 on PS4
                        Play an MMO for hundreds of hours for a side story? Go for it.
                            I mean it's ffxiv so he could just join boost to Shadowbringers, get carried through the end, then get carried through the raids...
                                You get carried through the 24-mans whether you like it or not when it's your first time anyway.
                        I mean honestly ffxiv has a fantastic story, and a super generous free trial (any character can get every class up to level 35 as many tines as they want). Imo its worth giving a shot
            NieR's gameplay is passable IMO but it's much worse than Automata. You don't have a lock-on, you can't shoot the equivalent of the pod program and melee/move around at the same time (the game is designed around it but still), there's no real combo system, it only runs at 30FPS and on the whole isn't really a strong point of the game by any means.

The other big problem is you can tell how low budget the game is by the fact that it recycles a lot of content. It manages to do that surprisingly well but what really sucks is you have to play the second half of the game at least three times in total to see all the endings because there's no chapter select, AND you have to collect all the weapons to see the last two. It's fine for the second go-around since there's new cutscenes and dialogue (that's a lot more impactful than the early stuff you see in route B in Automata), but after you get the second ending the game is literally the same until the very end. I love the game and all but couldn't be assed to do that, so I just watched the endings on youtube after I did the second playthrough, which sucks because the last ending is a lot more meaningful if you get it yourself.

So it's a very flawed game but if you loved the story/music/atmosphere of Automata then those are all great here, and it's probably worth looking into this if you temper your expectations a bit regarding the gameplay. This remaster could also fix some of those issues, having a chapter select would already make a big difference.
            There's actually only one game, with different protaganist depending on your region, Gestalt and Replicant. Difference is that you either play the role of a brother or father. (Only the brother for the remake it seems)

Yes, they're janky and doesn't have very good combat and poor performance, but they're said to be some of the best games ever produced, despite all it's shortcomings.
                I hope we still get to play as the father, that ugly ass man was a refreshing change of pace to me back then so I look on him fondly.
                    Plus outside of a few sparse moments, the father works better for the story. Some people would say its" more than a few sparse moments." I would say that they don't get it. His wife died and his daughter became ill. His whole world became taking care of his daughter. As a result, he isolated himself. "Social distancing." Its not like he did all these odd jobs to grab a beer with the bard. As a result, he became more socially awkward and forgot how to deal with people outside of his daughter as you would in that situation. Keeping that is mind, moments like "Yes.. you and I are friends now" makes more sense.

Weird thing is this kind of speaks more about Japan's view about parental relationships with their children. That the "father" was made to appeal to a western audience.
                        > Weird thing is this kind of speaks more about Japan's view about parental relationships with their children. That the "father" was made to appeal to a western audience.

Weird thing is that this speaks more about western views about siblings relationship. That "brother" isn't appealing to a western audience.
                            Yeah, the doting brother is quite a popular trope in Japan that, according to many in this thread, doesn't seem to translate too well to a Western audience.
                                Yeah, I wonder why that happens honestly, because tons of people here would have siblings. And in a world where the only one who the character has is their sister, that's quite the story. That ghibli movie with the world war 2 with the kid and his sister is an example to me for this.
                                    Grave of the Fireflies, fantastic movie. 
But yeah, it must be a cultural thing, but I'm struggling to associate it with a single held idea/belief. 

What I do find interesting though, is that in the West, older brothers are rarely portrayed as straight up caring and are usually either a bully or indifferent to the younger sibling's plight, until they're actually required to step up.
                                Wasn't one of the reasons why in games and anime/manga the protagonists are always young has to do with people reliving their lost youth thru them? Everyone knows the working culture in Japan is a beast of it's own. School life is also much more strict.

At least that's what i read about it ages ago.
                    If they don’t have the father I have to wonder if it’s even worth playing vs. sticking to the proper version. I just can’t imagine the game without him.
                Wasn't it two games but the console version depended on who you played as? I recall the PS3 version being different than the 360 one.

Edit: it seems that the NA versions are both Father Nier, with the PS3 version being a port of the 360 version.
            The gameplay is simple and requires some grinding. Its very easy though- you just need to invest some time into the game and anyone can reach the credits.
                Getting true ending is abomination and you're straight lying. Grinding hours one location, to drop one item, which you need 3 to upgrade 1 of 20 weapons isn't "investing some time".



Hope they will cut that bullshit, because story, characters and music are top notch.
                    Actually you only needed to \*obtain\* every weapon. Which for me brought the total playtime for the final endings to 30 -40 hours (normal people can probably do it a lot quicker).

Now getting the platinum trophy which requires ALL weapon upgrades IS pain. That brought my playtime up to 100 hours.
                        That's better, I remembered I was gatekept at Junkyard by some quest, but can't find the one. Like this one: https://nier.fandom.com/wiki/The_Damaged_Map for untrained eye it looks like no hassle. But if you played, you know goats are made purely of meat. (I think I was farming machine oils, 1 hour for a not a single one, in a location where they should drop the most - highest concentration of flying robots)
                            I believe the quest you're thinking of is for repairing Iron Will, which you still need to do in Route B ("Don't we already have this weapon?" "shhh, these things happen the second time around") - which as far as I recall guarantees spawns for that item but it's still a pain to get. 

I think there's some other jank in the game as well where it tells you stuff drops from one enemy but it actually drops from another on the opposite side of an area or something silly like that.
                        Took me 46 hours.

Not sure if it was worth it, but it's certainly a game I will remember. I really enjoyed the first 20 hours. The next were a bit repetitive, but I appreciated the storyline.
            In terms of story I preferred it to automata- gameplay isn't as bad as some people make out but defo way rougher. Cant wait for this.
            The gameplay is totally fine in Nier. 7/10 gameplay with 10/10 story, characters and music.

Now Drakengard on the other hand...
            Wait what? The continuation in FF14? please explain.
            There is only one Nier game before Automata. Gestalt and Replicant are literally the same game with the main character swapped from dad to big bro.

The gameplay is not that rough, it was perfectly fine, but they're almost certainly going to change it. This is not a remaster, it's actually going to be a new version of the game with significant changes.
        I bet a new Yoko Taro project will be announced soon.
        Lately? Hello mcfly!! Anyone home!!?? It's been going on since the last year of ps3 ffs. 

Hell I remember ps4 launch the amount of threads of people asking if they were ever going to make new games because all that was being put out was remasters.
    This pushed me to continue playing the OG weirdly enough lol. I got to the save point on top of the tower like 2 weeks ago and left it there. Doing the unthinkable and playing on easy makes it combat become serviceable, and so far its story seems more engaging than Automatas. I also think i forgot most plot details about nier 1 that were mentioned in it too so itll be relatively fresh
    Was planning to play automata at some point. Worth paying others first?
        Yes. While the gameplay is sort of clunky, the story and music is top notch.
The developer is announced to be Toylogic (Dragon Quest XI 3DS) with PlatinumGames' Takahisa Taura, Nier Automata's game design director, assisting.
    Considering it's a remaster, it's not going to make much difference, I guess. Only some touches in texture, assets, higher resolution and such, not much difference. Now if it was a remake, then it would be another story.

And Toylogic was development support in that case for DQXI, as SE developed both versions internally. Orca (Saito's company, he's SE Nier and DQ producer) was the support for PS4 and Toylogic for 3DS.

For other works, they assisted on The Evil Within, Smash bros Brawl and other games. They're more a support studio.
        Given how comprehensive Xenoblade Definitive Edition is and that we've only really seen art (par for the course for Nier), it might be bigger than we think.

I really hope the old voice cast comes back. Most of them are fairly high profile now, so I'm a little worried.
            Pretty sure they would only need to hire a new VA for young Nier. It's been a long while since I played it, but to my recollection the dialogue from the other characters avoided hard referencing any father/daughter relationship, so nothing on their end would need to be re-recorded.
            I would die for Liam O'Brien to come back as Weiss
                If I’m not hearing Liam and Laura Bailey this is going to be a pretty big disappointment, not gonna lie.
                    They were both willing to reprise their roles in Catherine: Full Body last year, so I think there’s a good chance they’ll come back.
                        That game keeping its entire cast was a bit of a surprise, considering Laura Bailey and Troy Baker hadn't done any work for non-Final Fantasy Japanese games for a few years before that and Atlus had already recast their Persona roles. I suppose it's because the majority of them had become high profile VAs after the original game's release though.
                One of my favorite tidbits about the game is that in the Japanese version Weiss is played by a guy going under the stage name Peter. I thought that was odd, and it turns out he played the court jester in Akira Kurosawa's Ran. The more you know. 

However Liam's English accent added wonderful charm to the character.
                This. I haven't played the original but have it running on a PS3 emulator, it's on my list of games to play. This update sounds like a great way to play it for the first time, and I can wait another year to play it. But, as a massive fan of Critical Role, if it doesn't have the voice work of Liam or Laura it would definitely not be an option for me, and would instead stick to the original.
            > Most of them are fairly high profile now

Unless they skimp on the budget, I don't really think that's been much of an issue for Square Enix; they're no stranger to getting high profile VAs.
                >Unless they skimp on the budget

Square Enix would never do that... not to a Nier project...
            Oh of course, but it depends on the remaster. As far as combat, it's not as normal for remasters to change them fundamentally, more on remakes.
            Assuming they don't add anything significant story wise, I don't see why they wouldn't just be using the original audio where applicable
                [removed]
                    I wouldn't mind Japanese voice with English subs (like Yakuza series) tbh
                        The English voice acting was amazing though. I wouldn’t want to miss my "WEISS YOU DUMBASS" every time I start up the game.
                            SPEAK THE TRUTH HUSSY
                        Nah, Kaine is a character people need to experience in their native language. 


The first time you boot it up and hear [“Weiss you dumbass!”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvyvQfn30uE)Hits a lot differently than if you read it.
                They are adding new story elements. I know 2b is supposed to be in it in some way. Also they hinted at a new ending.
            there's a famitsu article above that has the announced cast

koji yusa and ai nonaka are reprising their roles as nier and yunah, and nobuhiko okamoto as boy nier
            Nier is pretty high profile now too though
        They specifically said it isn't a remaster though. It's somewhere between a remaster and a remake.
        I don't see the words remaster anywhere but the title OP gave it. Not in the video or on the website.
        I'd hope for some quality of life and bug fixes too. The combat isn't too bad and of course the other stuff you didn't mention are fine!
    So Yoko Taro is not involved? That is great news! That means that Taro might be actually working on a new game instead!
        He's probably working on the next story arc which will only be told and available through interpretive dance performances.
        Huh, how you came to this conclusion? Yoko Taro is a freelancer since Cavia closed, he could work with any studio. lol
        He's also working on the Automata crossover in FF14 at the moment, he stated recently he hasn't even written the ending for it so I think it's still in ongoing development.
        Shouldn't he still be working on the NieR FF14 content? I know that he was and I doubt it's already finished.
            Second part of the raid came out in Feburary, which was supposed to be the last part afaik.
One of my favorite games ever honestly, super excited for this and also the seemingly new ost. Glad that it’s going to be accessible to a lot more people now
    I've been playing the crap out of Automata over the past couple months. How does this game compare?
        I think I prefer this game's music and writing to automata's. Automata has better gameplay though, by a longshot.
        Well, Automata has much better and deep combat and also a much larger open world that has rewards for being explored. 

However, while not as good, I still genuinely enjoyed the combat in Gestalt and found it to be pretty fun for the most part, and the best thing about Gestalt is going to the really crazy locations throughout the story as well as the interactions between all of the characters. Having played Automata, there will be a few key plot points you’ll already know, but that wont hamper your enjoyment. 


It really just depends on what you like about Automata and if you have any questions ask me and I’ll answer
        The story is almost as good. The combat is not as good, it's much less smooth and so on, but it still has its fun moments. Like Automata, the original Nier does cool stuff with switching up gameplay genres every now and then and still has its bullet hell and text adventure moments. Hopefully the combat will be a little better with the remake. Still an excellent game overall so I'm hoping more people get to play it.
        The story is amazing.
        Besides the other comments, an interesting thing that the original does is play around with the combat mechanics with each dungeon. One locks you onto a platform and focuses on the shooting. You also have the top down shmup (or similar) combat. A largely puzzle based dungeon. An isometric dungeon. A text-based "dungeon"

Not all of it is good, but it does a good job of staving off the monotony a clunkier combat system and replaying sections for the multiple playthroughs.
Nier 1 is pretty much my favorite game of all time, but if this is just going to be a graphical update, then I'm not really going to be interested and I fully expect a lot of ugliness to come out from people expecting Automata-level gameplay. If it's a full on remake that makes certain chunks of the game less of a grueling slog, then 11/10 day 1 buy.

Edit: checking out the Toylogic studio that's developing it, I have a hard time believing it won't be just a remaster. Oh well.
    Definitely if people are expecting this to have Automata level of gameplay they're gonna be sorely disappointed.
        I do hope they fix things up like a *bit* at least. I'm excited to play it for the story but almost every recap video I watched before playing Automata the person would say "yeah the game play does NOT hold up" so it would be weird for them to not change it up a bit
            It’s not that it doesn’t hold up, it’s that it’s really, really basic. No lock on, only a light and heavy attack (I think?), no combos, the magic can be abused hardcore. It’s *okay* and worlds better than drakengards gameplay, but it doesn’t fly off the hand as easy as automata does.
                It was also *really* easy too. You could get a spear early on and just mindlessly mash your way to the end of the game.
            I mean, even when the game first came out, it got pretty mediocre reviews mostly saying the story was great and the game had cool ideas but the gameplay was clunky.  So even by the standards at the time the gameplay got criticized a lot, let alone compared to modern action games.
        This is the first thing I thought up and commented in discord with some buddies when I saw this... the original nier was pretty clunky if youre coming automata. Thats honestly one of the reason I love both though. automata you're essentially a perfect android. You can do anything. While in the original, youre only human. feels a lot more human with the combat.
        Well this comment made me disappointed. What is the gameplay like then?
    [deleted]
        > Full voice acting and reorchestration

That's kind of a bummer cause I find those parts of the first Nier to still be top notch (even better than Automata imo).
            I figure they would have to redo the VO since this is the Japanese version and not the one that original released in the US.
    Actually, from what I've read, it looks to add new stuff as well. At least articles covering this announcement talk about it that way.
    https://gamestalk.net/post-141918/

They said various things were added, a new character, possibly a new ending teased, new OSTs and 2B & 9S VAs will have a small role.
    There are implications that it's more than just a remaster
    >people expecting Automata-level gameplay.

I mean... That was nothing special?

Don't get me wrong I loved the game, but I loved it for the soundtrack and the story, the actual gameplay was a very generic "press dodge roll and then mash attack buttons" style of game.

It was far from **bad**, but it didn't exactly redefine the genre either?
        The thing is, the original Nier's combat is worse than that. There's no real combo system, no lock-on, you can't fire spells and attack at the same time, moving around and doing things is more awkward, it only runs in 30 FPS and overall is just far inferior to Automata.
            And during heavy combat the framerate dips into the single digits. At least on 360.
            [removed]
                I'm aware of that, I played the game briefly with the 60fps hack on RPCS3. If this remaster does not run at 60 that would be fairly disappointing given the original on an emulator can do so.
        My point is that the first Nier's gameplay is on a sliding scale from somewhat to much worse comparatively. It doesn't really matter if Automata's standard is considered high, medium, or already low.
        If you thought Automata’s gameplay was nothing special then just wait til you play the first Nier.
        I'm sure most people when talking about the gameplay being different would be how it can change perspective and be doing different things that aren't usually expected out of a third person action game.

Normally it's just a third person action game, but sometimes it changes perspective and suddenly it's "sidescrolling". 

Or how it goes into a completely different gameplay mode when you are using the flight suits. And then even within that mode it can change perspective.

Pretty sure that is unique gameplay compared to every other "press dodge roll and then mash attack buttons" like you said.
    I’ve never seen someone be so negative about their favorite game of all time.
        It's a game that you love in spite of its glaring faults.
    So what's the difference between Nier Replicant and Nier Gestalt?
        They're basically the same game but the main character is a palette swap between teenage boy in Replicant trying to help his sister, and a middle aged man in Gestalt trying to help his daughter. There's no actual changes to the story or dialogue otherwise and they play the same.
Best news one can get at 3 in the morning. All I really want out of this is for it to be functional and run at at least 60FPS, so I'm super stoked.
I understand why the people like Father Nier better, but the problem is that the script is actually not for him. It's for Brother Nier. I want to actually see the OG. There are some awkward spots in the dialogue that you'll feel like it's pretty weird for a father to talk like that.
    I actually found Papa-Nier's awkward moments to work in the sort of bumbling dad-kind of way; like how he have been so focused on raising his daughter that he doesn't kinda know how to act outside of it to his younger companions, which contrasts to Teenage-Nier who spouts such awkwardness due to his inexperience and being naive.
        Yeah, his “we’re friends now” (or however it went specifically) to kaine is one of my favorite things. It’s super awkward and comes off as an old man having absolutely no idea what to say to talk this person down off the ledge.
    Something something Emil
        WE ARE FRIENDS NOW
    To be fair Taro has said he thinks that Ending D is the Canon ending for Father and E the Canon ending for Brother. The script may not always mesh well with Father Nier, but it's clear they took efforts to ensure the broad strokes and overall theme still work just fine. It really feels like those endings were written with both versions in mind, so it always feels off to me when people say Replicant is the "intended experience", since Yoko Taro himself has a fondness for Father Nier as well 

I think if Taro had the budget he'd probably have gone and changed the weird script moments for Dad Nier and try to have the games coexist, but I'm sure they didn't have the budget to do so.

In that sense I hope Taro can incorporate both versions in the remaster. If I remember correctly from some flavor text, both versions of Nier are acknowledged in Automata. Hopefully they'll stick with that.
        [deleted]
            The timeskip weapon options click with the adult Nier at the very least, because it comes off as him willing to kill anything in his path and his expanded arsenal reflects him needing bigger weapons after failing to defeat a bigger shade. The dialog however doesn't always mesh as you said.
            A lot of the strange script moments work for Father Nier as well, if you think of him as an awkward father who doesn't know much outside of protecting his daughter. I never saw a problem with his friendship speeches either, Kaine and Emil help him a lot to find his daughter despite the perilous situations, it makes sense he would feel a strong friendship with them, and his dialogue always depicted him as a bit awkward despite his age. 

The timeskip also isn't that aggregious either (except for the sudden ability to use two handed weapons). It still makes sense for Father Nier to undergo a change in personality because of the frustration/sobering feeling of going all those years with his daughter still missing. If you look at it in terms of a maturation of Nier, then Brother Nier works better. But if you view it as a shift in personality as a result of his circumstances, Father Nier fits the bill just fine.

It still has its awkward moments, but to say it's just a simple cut and paste is underselling the work the English scriptwriters did to make the change work in the grand scheme of the story. And like I said, these awkward moments don't take away from the broad story of protecting someone dear to you.
        Trying to get "intended experiences" confirmations out of Taro is just silly, either way.

Yoko will turn joke endings into entirely new spinoff timelines, he's a madman. If he made a sequel out of Nier Automata it would probably be based off the ending where you eat a fish and die.
        Maybe the game will feature both options? Although that would be a big load of voice work...

I am guessing that they will add Ending F to the game as well, in order to connect it to Automata.
    For me, the awkward spots are more centered around the romantic subtext scenes with Kaine.
        Eh, I didn't find it that awkward. I know she's supposedly a teenager, but she literally never acts like one in the game. If the game told me she was 25 or so, I'd believe it.
        And the fact that Emil is gay for him.
            Yeah but it's pretty easy to not pick up on that in the actual game.
        The while game I thought of Kaine as a daughter figure for Papa Nier, the romance didn't work for me. Fucking love NieR Gestalt though so it's all good.
    "Because we're friend!" 

Yeah the script was meant for brother Nier, but Father Nier fits so much more with the overall themes and motivation of the story that I can let the odd moment or two slide. Fighting to save your daughter just hits so much more then for your sister.
        I agree but it depends on your culture. The whole reason father nier was added in the localized version was because the devs figured it would be easier for Western Audiences to relate to.

The game works with both versions though and it's a bit of a shame they couldn't have both in this release.
            They weren't wrong either. Big burly grizzled man was basically the meme character design for X360/PS3 action games. Still kind of is too with the sad dad games. These days more people seem more on board with more typical anime type designs
                It's actually confirmed that God of War was the inspiration for the gameplay in this game, which makes it funny in retrospect since Kratos would later become a sad dad himself.
                    God of War 1-3 is literally about Kratos being a sad dad.
                        Yeah but mad sad, not sad sad.
                            I think we can all agree that Kratos is a mad sad dad lad.
                        [deleted]
                            No, they had a point. Kratos had already lost his daughter in the OT so he had no more reason to act like a dad. He was just rage incarnate and a bloodthirsty maniac by the third game. The stuff with Pandora was half baked at best. With Atreus, Kratos does have something to protect and starts acting like a father again in a very believable way.
            They have young nier in some side missions. “Gestalt”
        Nier's story revolves more over Nier himself than Yonah's condition, Yonah serves as a primary motivator but the story quickly evolves beyond that centering on Nier & the tragic setting. Some examples, Nier dealing with both of his dear companions Kaine(a girl) and Emil(a boy) falling in love with him. All the messed up things a fragile young Nier had to do to survive. The day to day boylike/youngish manner Nier speaks with his companions. >!The ending where Nier more so rejects Yonah & prioritizes his own desires instead!< If you pay close attention to Nier's story Dad Nier as the MC really doesn't work.

At a casual glance the idea of Dad trying to save Daughter seems easier to justify than Brother saving Sister the problem is the story primarily explores Nier himself & so all the details of a desperate 16 year old brother dealing with a harsh apocalyptic world fall out of place when you copy paste in a 40~ year old man instead.

[Old Nier official concept art](https://imgur.com/a/FwUvlRz)
        The only thing for me that is awkward for father nier and definitely fits brother nier more is that *one part* in the ending.
        [Many people disagree with that view and think the Brother theme fits far better](https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/b8c8xl/should_i_play_nier_gestalt_or_replicant/ek096ng/) 

Please keep an open mind, I'm glad we're getting Yoko Taro's intended version rather than the one westerners got previously.
            Young protagonists are boring because every game ever has one.  I played both and enjoyed Father Nier so much more simply because it wasn't a dumb teenager yet again.
                [deleted]
    Yeah, Emil and Kaine makes much more sense with Brother in the script than with the father. Otherwise, well, you know what it looks like with Gestalt.
    True, but Nier came out in a time when even dual audio wasn't a standard.
    The protagonist being a father is the most interesting part of the game imo, since it made the game accidentally ahead of its time.

The last ten years have been almost nothing but games about dads running around killing things for their children. NiER was the very first game in that trend by a longshot, but only because they were scared of making the protagonist a little boy for America. And as ridiculous as that sounds, I think it was probably a great decision.
    In the end it comes down to whether you want an awkward teenager or a a grown ass man acting like an awkward teenager.
    Absolutely agreed. I want Yoko Taro's original uncompromised work not the "should sell better in the west" version that I currently own.
        I always hate the fact that American companies think they should change other cultures to better fit their own, and for people to relate more. If people wanted an American game they would play an American game. Stop americanizing Japanese games. Especially frustrating as a European, because Europe doesn't have the same values on a lot of points that America has. Most notably the extreme casualization of extreme violence, while many other things are struck down on like lightning
            [deleted]
                Yeah, someone else told me this was actually not one of those cases. I do feel like it happens way too often though
            You're acting like Papa NieR was a bad thing. It wasn't. Jamieson Price's voice also nails the whole role.
Also, Japan isn't exactly free of doing that shit.
            It wasn't an american company who did that and they didn't americanizing the game. lol Two versions of Nier were made and released in Japan and then just one of them which was the one that would get more people into the game was localized.
                [deleted]
                Didn't know that. But my point still stands that alot of times japanese games are changed to "better capture Western audiences"
So that's the surprise for March 29 huh. Really glad to see Replicant possibly coming to the west considering there's absolutely nothing from Gestalt, which makes sense as replicant was the canon version and much of the game makes more sense as the brother than the father even when playing Gestalt.

Also, surprised to not see it for Switch as well considering it's a Square Enix game as they always are giving support (to the point of two exclusives) and a remaster, which wouldn't be demanding of the console.
    >Replicant was the canon version

Both are canon. Automata even references both.
    This is a HUGE bummer for me. Playing as the father was what makes Nier one of my all time favorite games. It's a trope to be the young adventurer or hero and it was refreshing to be someone older, that I as a father with daughters of my own could relate to. The story bad me almost sobbing sometimes because of that. I'm sorry but the journal entries regarding you as the father written by Yuna just are not going to have the same emotional power playing as someone else. Even if brother fills all the same "roles", it absolutely will not.

I live Nier and want to play the replicant version, but Gestalt would have been a day one purchase for me. Replicant will be a whenever it goes on sale purchase for me.
    > considering there's absolutely nothing from Gestalt, which makes sense 

Says you. Lots of people think Gestalt makes more sense. Maybe not with people's crushes on him, but with the entire story of the game.
        Not sure what you interpreted here but I said that because the name of the game is Nier Replicant instead of Nier Gestalt or Nier which would mean that Papa Nier isn't the focus.

And I mean, Gestalt was the one which people received so of course the majority will prefer him. And also because father and children stories get into people more than siblings.

But uh, while I can see your point, Gestalt pretty much makes Nier and Emil/Kaine with a weird relationship.
            >But uh, while I can see your point, Gestalt pretty much makes Nier and Emil/Kaine with a weird relationship.

Yeah, it's definitely got some weird parts.  I personally prefer Papa Nier because the story of a father fighting to save his daughter is much more emotionally resonant to me, but I really wish it had gotten some dialogue edits to make things a lot less....bizarre in spots.  And I understand that it was basically a marketing move and nothing more, so I get why it's not coming back.
They better keep the voice cast the same.

Obviously, Nier will be changed, but please keep Liam O'Brian and Laura Bailey.
This is awesome news ! Nier was one of my favorite games of last gen. It's odd and kind of clunky but the story, music, and design are just so good. Even if it's just a rerelease with updated textures and frame rate this is definite buy.
What is this exactly? I played NIER: Automata only. Is this the original?
    [deleted]
        A loose sequel, I’d add. The ties between Gestalt/Replicant and Automata are really fantastic for fans of the series, but ultimately not needed to enjoy the story of Automata.
            It may be a "loose sequel" but it's the extensive backstory for Emil who was one of he most significant side characters in Automata, which I expect will be a point of interest for many.
    First there was Drakengard (which has 3 games of its own) which has multiple endings, then came Nier's two versions, Gestalt and Replicant, that were mostly the same beyond their protagonist and their relationship to the girl, which was based off of one of the Drakengard's endings, and then Automata which is a sequel to Nier but it takes place way way in the future and that's why **Automata Spoilers** >!there are no more humans on earth, because of what happened in the original Nier. Several of Automata's characters also originate from Nier, including Emil, Devola, and Popola!<
        During Nier: Automata I remember some tunes that Emil was humming or that were playing.  There's the 'fight' version and the version you get when you go this (?) bunker.   It looks like lots of the music is based on music from these originals. 

Which prequel is the Emil bit from, or at least the original Emil story from, is it this Nier Replicant?
            Yes, Emil is a major character in the original Nier.
            Emil is from Replicant. [Clemps has an entire series explaining the Nier storyline.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__q_Nx9WbgY&list=PLI1L9JVl6TFdwfvKUuebNp_zOAL5XXDT5)
                Just binge watched that entire series. Dude makes some excellent videos.

Thanks for the link.
            Emil's origin is in Nier Replicant/Gestalt.
He's a major character in the first game.
            He is from gestalt/replicant because they are the same game but with different protagonist, gestalt is daddy nier,  replicant is onii-chan nier so same story different tone. Gestalt is the west version and replicant was the Japanese version
                Gestalt was also released in Japan as an Xbox 360 exclusive, while Replicant was only on PS3.
            >Which prequel is the Emil bit from, or at least the original Emil story from, is it this Nier Replicant?

Yes, Emil is from Nier 1. (Replicant/Gestalt)
            > It looks like lots of the music is based on music from these originals.

Let's just say opening that damn tower was either boring/gameplay or a tear-jerker of a scene, full of symbols and sentiments.
            My GF had me play these back to back, with Nier first, and I did nothing but complain about Emil but I loved him. You should have heard me "OMG EMIL!" When he showed up in Automata
            Emil is from the original Nier, and if you felt Devola and Popola kind of showed up out of nowhere and got kind of an out-of-place final moment for how little they'd been involved so far, that's because they're from the original Nier too... kinda.
        Speaking of Drakengard, was the last one any good? I've only played Drakengard 2 and I enjoyed it. Although I don't think I'll enjoy it if I play it today so if the latest one is the same I might skip on it.
            Only if you emulate. It was made by deadly premonition studio, and it works in literal 3FPS. And the game of course is trademark Drakengard zero budget zero content giant playtime quality.
            it was more batshit insane stuff ala Drakengard 1 so if that's up your alley, sure
            By the last one do you mean Drakengard 3? Don't expect the combat to be as smooth as Nier Automata and in terms of continuity it's like a distant prequel to Drakengard 1 which is in a parallel world whose events ended up spilling over onto the parallel world of OTL Earth which then became the Nier world.

But for what it's worth I enjoyed it. The story is like a black comedy - the subject matter is very dark and all the characters have been through terrible trauma. But the characters are all pretty badass and they joke about it a lot. The story isn't as good as Nier Automata but still very good compared to most games. Especially if you read the prequel novel (at least the chapter on Zero) to get a sense of the backstory, then play the game, and then play the DLC. Each DLC is a sidestory that lets you play as one of the villains and learn more about their characters. Quite a bit of good character development and plot in the game, and while it's story is very nontraditional, it has a lot of Yoko Taro's charm.
    Remaster of the Japanese version of nier (prequel to automata) originally on ps3 and Xbox 360
So long as Julie-Ann Taylor is back to reprise the role of Emil then I don't mind  re-recorded dialogue. She absolutely makes the character and I'd be gutted if she doesn't come back to voice him.
    She voiced him in Automata, I can't imagine they would get a different VA at this point.
I really hope brother NieR makes it overseas. The story seems like it fits a brother and sister theme a lot more than it does a father and daughter. The way daddy NieR behaves sometimes, with talks about friendship and whatnot, came off as weird as well and would suit a teenager/young adult a lot more. >! We will also finally get Emil asking NieR if he wants to be his husband. !<

Edit: the English Tweets confirms it’s going to be brother NieR. https://twitter.com/niergame/status/1244165627989897216?s=21
    But it is coming, isn't it? Afaik, Replicant was the canon version, even more when novels and other materials always used him instead of the father. I really think Gestalt don't exist and replicant will be for JP and the west.
        iirc, Yoko Taro says he prefers Father Nier, though idk if that's the canon version. The script is definitely (imo) written for Brother Nier, though.
            iirc, yoko taro's original vision of the story was of brother nier, but he liked the idea of father nier so much that he considered them equal at the time. Not sure about that now, especially given this remaster being just replicant.
                (He could also very much have been pretending, because marketing.)
                    thats true. It feels a *little* out of character for Taro to fake for marketing purposes, but it is a definite possibility
                        That's the genius behind constantly being a weirdo... You can never tell when they're being genuinely weird or just playing it up 🤔
                        What was he going to say? "You westerners won't be getting the true version, because we thought that westerners will like a bulky daddy character more than a teenager (which was true), so you won't get the canon version that was meant to be. Sorry."
        [deleted]
            I doubt this will happen considering we saw absolutely nothing and only Nier brother appeared but we'll see later on how this will go.
what's with the version number as a subtitle?
    It may or may not mean anything but that number is exactly the square root of (3/2).
        are we going to approach kingdom hearts level of titles?
            Think we surpassed it
        So ending D it is.
Wow. I beat Nier: Gestalt D on PS3 for the first time literally today. Of course that's the day they announce the remaster.
    At least this gives you an excuse to play through the story with Brother Nier?
    I don't think it'll be more than a polish, so I'm sure it's for the best that you got to play it now rather than wait.
The fact this is Replicant and not Gestalt (for now?) makes me wonder how much they're going to be remastering with this game. I'm guessing new voices may be a thing since dad Nier isn't gonna fit well with brother Nier.
Automata is a great game, but I honestly think the original Nier is superior.

(Vague spoilers ahead)

I never thought the combat was that bad. It's fine. And everything else more than makes up for it. The "replay parts of the story" thing is much, much stronger in Nier 1. And the ending save gimmick fits the story more, I didn't really like how they just repeated it in Automata.

I understand wanting the OG version of Brother Nier but I wish they gave an option to toggle between them at the start of the game. I liked Papa Nier's VA, hopefully they at least keep the rest of the English VA.
    I feel the same. Also, the first Nier truly felt like a subversion of the typical japanese RPG, while Automata was the exact opposite. All the characters and the story felt so generic and it does everything that Gestalt/Replicant tried not to be. Some of the plottwists don't even work in Automata, if you have played the first game. I thought that was just part of a bigger plottwist, but no, they just acted like we didn't know what already happened to the world
Just a warning to anyone who hasn't played the original Nier, it's very inconsistent. The story, music, dialogue, and characters are all 20/10. Absolutely perfect.

The gameplay however is really...not good. You're gonna have to force yourself past it. It's just really repetitive and boring.
    For some reason I find the game kind of charming because it's so bad and clunky. Like you said, the story and music is fantastic, and the gameplay just makes me feel like I'm playing a dates Xbox/PS2 game that didn't age well. For some reason it makes me feel fond of it even though it isn't well made.
Personally hoping we can get the Gestalt version of this. I feel like the father/daughter connection is so much stronger than the brother/sister one is, and I really liked Papa Nier's voice acting.
    Even if they don't... the VA of Weiss needs to stay. Weiss' VA made like 50% of my enjoyment of that game.
        Stop pounding me!
            Drunk Weiss towards the end is amazing


Also the way he says “Hussy” is just *chefs kiss*
        The voice acting between papa nier and weiss was 80% of my enjoyment of that game without it i think ill pass
        The voice acting is the biggest thing I want more information on. I love the English voice work in Nier, it'd be so disappointing if it's redone with a different cast, or just redone at all and isn't as good.
            Laura Bailey fucking kills it as Kaine and [i really hope they don't re-record this line, because it's one of my favourite pieces of voice acting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvyvQfn30uE)
                Oh man, that’s fantastic - I agree, that’s some of the best voice acting I’ve heard in a long time. I loved Automata, but never played the original - here’s hoping they don’t change too much.
                Nier had Laura Bailey AND Liam O'Brien? At this rate they might as well go the whole hog with Critical Role VAs and have Mercer voice the protag
        Liam' o brien. Hes also in critical role
        I mean, he sounds a bit too much like Illidan in the game, but I think that just makes it better.
    Makes me wonder if they’ll be re-recording voices and the like. They really need Jamieson Price back as Papa Nier if they do so

edit: [Famitsu article](https://www.famitsu.com/news/202003/29195616.html) says Keichii Okabe (original composer) is back with new songs for the OST as well as rerecording the soundtrack. Can't wait to hear the new rendition of Kaine's theme
        I really hope they get the original cast they were all great picks
    Depends on how they incorporate the book stuff into it. Brother Nier will do anything for his sister and the book really highlights the things he would do for her.
    Is Replicant exactly the same as Gestalt? Because I got awfully far into Gestalt without finishing it. I'm trying to decide if I should finish it or wait for Replicant and play that.
        Only difference is papa Nier vs brother Nier.
            [deleted]
                Older MC appealed more to western audiences than a bishounen MC really, it came out around 09. BrotherNier is the canonical one.

Some people think dadNier works better whilst others say broNier is better, and then some say the Father/Daughter works better while companion relationships work better with a younger character.
                    [deleted]
                        There are lore reasons, replicant vs gestalt. Going more into it is spoiler territory. You should play it, phenomenal story.
                Brother nier is the original japanese version, but they thought the whole "Onii-chan!" Extremely loving siblings thing wouldnt work in the west so they made him older, and changed him into her father.

Its not a character select because its basically a localization change.
                As far as I know, it was originally written as a story about a brother and a sister, but someone (Yoko Taro I guess?) thought it would connect with western audiences more if it was about father/daughter instead. Gestalt is the western version.
        Pretty much the same, except the character you're playing in Replicant is a young teenage boy saving his sister Yonah, but in Gestalt you're an old man trying to save his daughter Yonah.

If you still have access to the Gestalt one, you can still continue playing it, it's exactly the same casts and story, just different age for the protagonist is all.
            Why was the game made that way?
                Long story short: appeal to a Western audience
                While the game was originally made with Replicant version (the teenage protag. version) in mind, they decided to make Nier older when localizing to the west as they thought it would draw in more western audience and boost sales, since most western games feature older, gruffier main character (e.g. Gears of War, Max Payne, etc.)

Which... actually works, believe it or not. While the design of teenage Nier is more appealing to look at, a lot of people liked papa Nier because they feel that a father doing everything in his power to save his daughter is a much more compelling motivation than  a brother saving his sister. This is one of the many things that helped elevate Nier to become a cult classic in the western gaming audience.
                    I mean... okay ? That sounds absurdly overkill. Making a whole alternate version of a game and redoing the entire script and dub of the main character for a somewhat risky marketing decision ? I find that a little insane.

Good thing it worked, though.
        It's the same story but the protagonist is different, in one you're the typical JRPG teenager, in the other you're a father, in general if doesn't matter much but you can easily tell the story was written for the teen Nier because some scenes are just... weird for an adult
        The game is literally the exact same minus brother Nier being a different character and some dialogue to accomodate that. The most significant thing that really changes is more subtext than anything.
    Plus it's nice to play as an old dude in a Japanese game instead of yet another young, generic, androgynous JRPG protagonist.
        The hate that the western fanbase have with siblings stories and young characters is astonishing. Now it makes sense why Papa Nier existed, because westerns can't stand playing with young characters and sympathize with a story about siblings, while Japanese and asians prefer such stories.
    Same, father Nier is one of my all time favorite characters.
    [deleted]
        I don't see it as caricaturical. It felt to me he was acting as father figure, reinforcing Kaine she has people who care about her. They were bunch of misfits and only a Father had a clear goal, which allows him "to lead" and take care of his friends, these lost younglings.


Yeah, the time skip was weird but we get cool mask with eyepatch.
        I didn’t even know about the two versions when I played the game. I just made the insanely wild leap that he learned how to use more weapons during the time skip. And I’m the story he came off as an awkward, socially maladjusted person doing their best. That makes him fit in with the rest of the cast far more than the generic JRPG protagonist.
I really hope they can improve the god awful combat. It cant really be platinum calibur like automata but something better than it was
    Automata isn't exactly peak Platinum. But new combat would be nice.
        Oh I agree. But it serviced the story well so I was ok with it.
            Same. Repetitive, but satisfying.
    The Nier Automata director is one this project, so I'm assuming they're changing some stuff
    I read somewhere that the combat director from Platinum is involved with this somewhat, so maybe we can hope?
Probably my favorite game of all time. I'm afraid it'll get panned all over again from people going in with heightened expectations. It's a low budget last gen game through and through and I don't think a remaster is going to make that any less the case.

I'm excited that I'll have the chance to actually play the game as Brother Nier, but I'm sad they seem to not want to acknowledge Father Nier in this remaster. To me the different versions compliment each other nicely and I think the final choice of the game (won't spoil) really brings that to light. Taro has said he regards different endings as the Canon ones for Brother and Father nier, so it's a shame new fans may not to be able to see the Father side of the story, even if the script wasn't made for it. I think Taro even prefers Father Nier so I hope they intend to make that an option, and are just highlighting Brother Nier to give western fans a reason to pick it up. 

I'm fortunate enough to own the original game so I can play Father Nier if I want, but new fans won't have that option. Here's hoping someone can pull the Gestalt assets from the Xbox or Ps3 version and maybe mod them into the remaster, but that's a tall order and not something I'd bet on happening. 

Still, the music, story, characters and world are all stellar anyway so while it would sting to completely lose the Father Nier story, I think it's great this game will get a second chance like this. Hopefully they'll adjust the last endings though, since playing through the second half of the game over and over can put a real damper on game overall.
    Well, I personally don't care how well it's "aged" or whatever I am looking forward to give the game a go.

Question is, will it get localized? Because Replicant never came out in the west. Only Gestalt, sold simply as “Nier” with no subtitle.
    Multiple sources have already confirmed it getting a western release. No info about how they'll handle the English version in terms of voice acting/ rerecording though.
    What's even the difference between Gestalt and Replicant. So confusing with all the versions, and Drakengard too.. According to Wikipedia the fifth ending of that game is canon and Nier proceeds it. How about Automata? Really confusing lol Was just about to buy Gestalt for PS3 some days ago, then they announced this. Super excited! Nier looks a bit strange/unique though.. from running around planting seeds, anime characters, sad moments, killing boars... It's all over the place! Unique indeed.
        It is definitely a confusing series. Don’t go in expecting everything to make sense, because it won’t. It is really amazing though story-wise.

Let’s get into Drakengard first. Drakengard is Nier’s parent series. In other words, Nier is a spinoff of the Drakengard franchise. I’d explain how, but that involves some pretty deep spoilers of the first Drakengard game.

Drakengard is a series that has a reputation for looking like an edgy gore fest on the surface, but then progressively get deeper and deeper when you make significant progress. Being part of the same series, it shares a lot of DNA with Nier, with Drakengard 3 being basically a Nier game, making a lot of references to Nier and explaining a lot of the weird phenomenons in both series. Unlike Nier, which takes place in the near future, the Drakengard games usually take place in a more archaic fantasy setting, where the main character will usually partner up with a dragon to achieve some sort of end.

Nier Gestalt and Nier Replicant are mostly the same game, however, there is one significant difference. Nier Gestalt stars the protagonist Nier as an older man, trying to find a cure for a disease for his afflicted daughter Yonah. Nier Replicant follows the same premise, except Nier is a young adult, where Yonah is his younger sister instead of his daughter. There are other minor differences, such as the endings, but the games are mostly the same otherwise. In Japan, Nier Replicant was released on PlayStation 3, and Nier Gestalf was released on Xbox 360. In the West, we never got Nier Replicant, because Square Enix felt as though a younger male protagonist wouldn’t catch on with a Western audience, so only Nier Gestalt was localized, released for both PS3 and Xbox 360, and renamed to just “Nier”.

The stories are mostly the same between the two, but Nier Automata specifically follows one of the endings of Nier Replicant, so we never even got that part of the story in the West. Nier Automata is the most recent and popular game ( and the best one gameplay-wise, no contest ) in the franchise, in a setting that takes place thousands of years after the events of Nier. Despite being a “Nier” game, Nier Automata is mostly completely unrelated to Nier Gestalt and Replicant; there are a few returning characters that play a minor role, but nothing that would require you to play the first game to understand. Otherwise, its connection to Nier and Drakengard is mostly down to minor references.
            Thank you so much for the in depth answer buddy, that cleared up so much confusion! I'm really excited for the remake! Is there a specific reason to the two Nier games' names? What is replicant and gestalt a reference to? Gestalt means shape/form in german, does that have anything to do with the game? I find the franchise very mysterious and unique to be honest!
If I could choose just 1 game to experience for the 1st time again, this would be it. What an amazing experience this game was. Awesome to see that it might be more visible to a wider audience now.
I don't know about this... if it's "just" a remaster with the same gameplay, it's gonna be really hard to replay coming from Nier Automata.
Finally, this is so exciting.

It definitely wasn’t the perfect game, and as many have mentioned the combat wasn’t great, but it was genius is world-building, music and just creativity in general.

And Replicant was the original story, though I know for some Gestalt was how you played.
    Both are canon, everyone saying only replicant is are false. I personally feel like Gestalt is true canon though since it’s the one mentioned in Automata. Personally I’m really bummed if it’s only Replicant and not Gestalt. I probably won’t be purchasing this if that’s the case.
I would have preferred Gestalt if I had to choose since that's the one I played on the PS3. But I'm not gonna complain for any sort of remaster. PS3 copies are pretty expensive these days.
Combat is one of the worst I've ever played but such an unforgettable story and soundtrack. I wonder why they went with only the Replicant version tho.
    Cause the Replicnt script is the OG/Canon script.
        Also I agree the combat doesn't exactly hold up relative to Automata. I hope they revamp that and at the very least add a lock-on system.
    Replicant is the canon original story, and Gestalt came to be because they thought another anime boy RPG wouldn't do well in the west, so they made the protagonist a man.
        That would explain some of his weird scenes. "You and me are friends now!"
I liked the Western version of Nier (Gestalt) so I’m looking forward to seeing the other side of the story.
    [removed]
        Then how were they different?
            A texture swap and a handful of lines changed because of that swap.
Is it different from the original ?
Oh damn, I was only just thinking of this game the other day and a possible remake/Remaster. I remember really thoroughly enjoying it when I played it years ago. Don't know if I'll go again though, I'm trying to avoid replaying old games I've already played, just too much else I want to get through.
Well, they nowhere write that this is a remaster in this trailer. In description you have game will be "rebuild". Or there is other source confirming this is a remaster?
This is great news, i know the PC port was a mess but i absolutely loved Automata on PS4, it's one of my favorite games this gen.
I've missed Kaine's potty mouth and Emil's Resident Evil dungeon, but an too lazy to fire up my 360. This is pretty rad.
This trailer is soft and beautiful but my first memory of Nier is Kaine screaming out "Weiss you dumbass!" which I hope is still how they start this version.
I'm a little scared of Toylogic developing it. they are good as support studios. but the last game they fully made was Contra Rogue Corps...
    Yikes...but at least they're not designing the game.  They're just taking someone else's work and porting it.  Still, this is quite a high profile game.  They better not mess it up.
        I don't even know. Rogue Corps originally was designed by Nobuya Nakazato. Who is the dude behind most contra games since 3.

So i don't know what really happened with this game.
A remaster but of the Japanese version so it's double-fresh for western players. With extra lore and maybe even some music remasters? I'm excited.
Please add a lock-on on system the combat won't hold up to modern standards (especially of compared to Automata) if at the very least they don't add a lock-on system.
ROFL! I just started playing NieR Gestalt on RPCS3.

I wonder why they are remastering Replicant and not Gestalt? To me the story just seems better when it's a father trying to save his daughter than a boy trying to save his sister.

Get ready to love stating the game and the first thing you hear is an angry woman shouting "Weiss, you dumbass!"
 I know it's not really that big of a deal, but the decision to choose Nier Replicant instead of Gestalt for a remaster is really killing the hype for me. It just wont feel the same. Father Nier is superior to brother Nier in every single way.
Xbox One version surprised me. I would have honestly thought it would be also coming to Switch given the size of the install base. Yoko Taro is still angry at Breath of the Wild I see /s

Hopefully SE handles the PC port better than Automata.
Sooooooo psyched for this! Aitonama was o e of the most o credible experiences I've had playing video games, cannot wait to replay in anticipation!
Is Yoko Taro even involved in those new projects ( Nier remaster and the mobile game ) ?
    He's director of both projects.
        Oh good, since I couldn't see his name anywhere I was afraid he wasn't.
    I dont think Yoko Taro would let anyone touch nier without him being there tbh
I am really curious about this game, been on the lookout for a Xbox360 version, but might as well pick this one instead.

I wonder if this game is as cinematically focused as Automata though.
    The story is way better than Automata. The characters too.
I can only wait with both great hope and great anxiety because Taro is in charge. I love NieR, but I also think there is room for improvement. At the same point, I also don't trust Taro to do something so mundane as a normal remaster without throwing some major changes in because that seems like exactly something Taro would do.
I never thought Automata would happen, now I never thought a remaster would happen, this is the series that keeps on coming.
I know of the original Nier and Project Gestalt? Is this a remaster of that game or a different one? How much would this game cover of Gestalt?
    It's a remaster of the japanese version of the first NieR, where you play as Brother Nier instead of Father Nier (meaning a younger main character than in the western version).
So as soon as I saw this thread's title, I started screaming internally. I am very excited over this announcement. Nier will always hold a special place in my heart. I sincerely hope this remaster fixes some of the issues the original had. I want everyone I know to play this game, but the original is difficult to recommend.
I'm pretty excited. I played Automata recently, so I was looking into getting into the rest of the universe until I heard of the 10th anniversary event going on.. Figured we were going to be getting remaster so I held out, now I can play through Drakengard 3 (and 'watch' the OG Drakengard) and wait it out.
Do we know if they're gonna be updating the gameplay at all? I never played the original Nier but from what I understand it while the story, characters, music, etc. are amazing, its let down by mediocre gameplay and level design.
    The gameplay was honestly fine, there’s a lot of hyperbole and exaggeration over how bad it was but it played like most other action games at the time and just didn’t do anything new.

Apparently the gameplay designer for Automata is consulting so it should receive some needed updates, though I wouldn’t expect much to change.
    The level design is incredible, but the game is pretty guilty of reusing a lot of its locations. However, Automata is really no different in that regard and is arguably worse at it. Nier 1 is a much more beautiful and diverse looking world, with actual dungeons that are fun to traverse and have a lot of unique mechanics.

The problem is the combat and the sidequests. While boss fights are actually pretty well designed, better than Automata’s although less cinematic, the moment to moment combat is about as barebones as it gets and the movement is pretty wonky and early PS2 era feeling, which is by far the biggest upgrade from Replicant to Automata. 

Something that is good about Replicant is the weight behind your strikes, which is something that Automata really seems to lack. You press square and do the same four moves the whole game, but at least they feel pretty good to do. Same for the magic, which is exponentially better than the Pod Programs in Automata.

There’s a really solid base to work on there in the combat, it just needs some polish and bells and whistles. The gameplay director from Platinum who worked on Automata is involved in this, so that’s encouraging.
        Nier 1 really felt very ambitious and it definitely tried to make things interesting. Each dungeon feels like a much more significant tonal shift, and it even just played with camera angles in more interesting ways. Simply playing the game at the regular pace causes you to be vastly over leveled and ends up making those great bosses into feeling like regular enemies.  
Seems to be a series constant now that the game is terribly balanced, automata made the combat a lot smoother but the enemies were so easy you just button mashed
Woah, I did NOT see this coming. Even with the teases, I was expecting like a concert announcement or something.

I love the original NieR, and in many ways I think it's actually better than it's more famous sequel. But...one of the ways that it definitely isn't better is in the gameplay department. While playable, the original NieR is far from engaging to actually PLAY. 

I'm worried that if it's just a simple remaster that they won't touch up the gameplay, and then a ton of Automata fans are going to jump in expecting something similar and be completely turned off. Although I do guess it'll explain why NieR fans thought Automata's gameplay was awesome, even if it's one of the worse Platinum combat systems lol
What is this? I only played nier automata. Is this the first game?
    > Is this the first game?

Yes, if you ignore the fact NieR is a sequel to one of the endings of Drakengard.
        Which you can do pretty easily.

The connection to Drakengard is more of an interesting tie-in between two series. They exist on their own just fine.
If you still have the new Nier in your backlog, should you wait now to play it and play the remaster first?
    If you don't want to have Nier spoiled for you, then it might be better to wait for the Remaster.
    If you think a Father/Daughter story is more your preference, you can ahead and play the original. If a Brother/Sister story sounds more interesting then wait for the remaster. At the moment it seems to be that they're not going with the Father Nier story, but obviously that could change. 

Either way it may be worth waiting for more information about this Remaster.
So wait I'm lost. Is there two games or three? I thought this was going to be the Remaster of the 360 and ps3 game Nier?
    > I thought this was going to be the Remaster of the 360 and ps3 game Nier?

It is, but there were two different versions of that game. And this is a remaster of the Japanese one.
Kind of disappointing. It's a good game but I would have been a lot more interested if it was a remake.
Oh damn, I literally started replying Nier Automata 2 days ago. Never played this one, super excited for it!
Nice, now this is an announcement worth getting excited about.

Played Nier Automata a few years ago and loved it.
Now I’ll finally know what those two pink haired chicks in the refugee camps were going on and on about
Is this a remake of the ps3 JP version?
    Yes.
I will never really understand why people poo poo on Nier's gameplay. Was it something to be remembered as the greatness from that time period? No. But it was fine and even good at times. The worst thing I could say is that it was "average" in 2010. I would say Automata was average too for its time, especially when most of its unique elements to some were pulled from that said game in 2010. 

Can we all just admit once and for all, that the boss battles in Nier are far far better than Automata's? Seriously... just take a moment and put aside the musical transitions like "this will not continue" and focus on everything else.
Well, I've just finished it on emulator and in my opinion, it's a game that you play only once in your life. Also, the game have some problemas that Yoko Taro says are features that I don't want to hear again.
So as someone who's not played Nier Automata but it is on my list, should I be playing this first?
    You have a few options. Drakenguard 1-3 and the two neir games are all in the same universe, and have some overlapping narrative. Automata can be played alone and still enjoyed, but you will get more out of some parts if you have played Neir and Drakengaurd. That said the gameplay for the older games can make them hard for people to get into, and they can be hard to track down, going all the way back to PS2. 

&#x200B;

If you are ok waiting some then I would say get this and Automata and play them back to back. Or you could get Neir on the PS3 and run through it, but it can be a bit pricey for a PS3 game, and a little hard to find, especially with Coronavirus affecting Amazon right now. Lastly, you could check out the youtuber Clemps, he has a very deatiled breakdown of the full series, and it will give you enough that you can jump into automata right now and not feel like you are missing out. Clemps humor can be a little much for some people, though I think he is hilarious, but if that does not bother you then he has a good 3 or 4 hours worth of breakdown.
        Thanks for the detailed write up!

I think I'm probably going to wait for this and play it first.
Weird. I didn't realize it came out so long ago. Loved the game and still need to play to sequel but whole maid thing really seems stupid. Always really liked this design of nier but think the daughter father relationship a lot better. At least it'll make the experience fresh
I'm sorry, WHAT!? I never thought I'd ever see this! I was so sure nier just got lost to time. Glad automata did so well to bring us something like this!
This is not being developed by Platinum?
So we’re finally getting the replicant version?!

HELL. YES. Can’t wait to dive back into the first Nier.
I wonder if we're getting the big burly main character version or the androgynous anime character version.

And isn't the person he's trying to save his daughter in one version and his sister in the other?
    > or the androgynous anime character version.

That's the Replicant version, so unless they include both, that's the one we're getting this time.
        Gotcha. Didn't realize they named them like that. Thanks!
I've wanted to play Automata for a while, but there's also a bunch of other games on my list. Should I wait for the Remaster to play Nier, and then Automata?
Is the the one with old guy or young?
    Young
I never played the original. Played about an hour of Automata, and enjoyed it! However, got distracted with other games...
Should I wait to go back until I play this remaster? I have not had the plot spoiled for me at all.
    I never finished the first one and played through all of Automata just fine.  It's really up to you.
    Automata does spoil Nier quite a bit, so if you want to get the full impact of the story, it might be better to wait.
Hope they actually allow for a single bug fix to be done for the PC version this time, that the game doesn't crash on certain gpus in the first scene, etc.
Love this. Hope they is an option for Geshalt since I actually prefer Papa Nier despite his character design. It’s more endearing than Brother Nier to me. 

Either way I’m hyped. Nier Automata added a lot of new fans to Yoko Taro’s crazy world and a remaster of a really important entry is a great idea .
I played a bit of Automata and it was the weirdest combination of games I have ever played, but so good still. Is this why people love the Japanese? Too bad my laptop can't handle it, I'll have to hold on playing it until I get a proper PC or a console
Wait, so should I hold off on completing Nier for PS3? I've put the game on hold for about a year after finishing ending A. Been meaning to go back, but maybe not anymore..
So is this a remaster of the first Nier game that was on PS3?
I bet they're adding content that ties into Automata. 2B and 9S's voice actors are confirmed to have roles in this version.
    Holy shit really ? Do you have the source for that ?
        [Stream summary (In JP)](https://gamestalk.net/post-141918) One of the bullet points says their actors have a (brief) role and they finished recording it.
            This is absolute banger for fan like me ! Thanks a lot for sharing this.
                They might be Replicants of actual humans that later serve as the blueprint for YoRHa androids?
                    I swear there was a data file that implied A2 was based on Kaine. And pretty much every android in YorHa was like the metaphorical children of her and since the robots were based on Emil from the aliens they were like his metaphorical kids.
            Holy fucking shit as somebody that loved Autonama and just figured I would never be able to play the original: I .freaking out rn
            Amazing thanks for sharing!
    If they did some tiny changes to fuck with us id be so happy
        I mean its Yoko Taro I feel like theres a very strong chance of that happening
    They also announced a mobile game, which appears to have a young Kaine on the site, so maybe additional tie-ins.
They will release two versions of the game (Nier: Fire, Nier: Water), and you'll have to play both to get  the full Nier 1.5's story.
    The original Japanese release consisted of Nier:Replicant (PS3) and Nier:Gestalt (360)

PS3 had young Nier we see here and 360 had papa neir, Gestalt was the only version ported to the west so he's the one most western fans would be more familiar with. I'm interested to see if papa Nier makes a comeback somehow or if they'll just do Replicant.
        I hope they do the older one. It worked well for the story having an ugly desperate father that barely handles weapons well do anything for his daughter. Plus it's probably Jamieson Price's best performance.
            I have a great fondness for the Nier we got and when this comes out I don't know if I'll be able to play the Japanese dub, the English voices are just so familiar especially Weiss! Though they seem to have rerecorded the Japanese dub so they may do the same for English. Hope they get the same team
                The English cast was stellar too, Laura Bailey, Liam O'Brien, Julie Ann Taylor, and Jamieson Price are some of my favourite VAs and they all did an amazing job in the original NieR.
                    Normally I don't play anything in English dub but this game was an exception for sure! The direction was stellar for the English dub, a place where Automata fell down a bit. I really hope the original team comes back for this!
                        Really? I thought Automata was incredibly voiced. Eve's psychotic breakdown when Adam dies is bone chilling. Ray Chase, fresh off his regal performance in FFXV, sent shivers down my spine.
                            [This is a soap box so the reply is a little long soz]

I agree there I liked Eve's voice a LOT. I really love English 9S, too. Just before I say this, I'm fond Kira Buckland and her presence in the community, I think she did a great job. I just think the English localisation team represented 2B in a way that takes away from the subtlety of her character in the original.

What I disliked particularly was the direction they went with the translation of her lines and their delivery. Japanese 2B is often detached and professional, above all else, though she has moments where emotion shows through her professional facade. English 2B is sarcastic, harsh with 9S, and at times generically "sassy" in the way commanding women in (esp. sci-fi and post apocalyptic) fiction often are.  

An example is a kind of catchphrase 2B says a lot in the game. When 9S is complaining about something, JP2B says 文句を言わない/Monku wo iwanai Japanese often omits the subject so I took it as "(we) don't complain". She says it very matter-of-fact, calmly. It's their job to do what their told and not to complain, she's reminding 9S of something he's heard a million times over from her and others. But she actually likes that impulsive part of him so she's not really giving out.

ENG2B scolds him. I believe the line is either "stop complaining" or "stop whining", I don't recall which. It totally shuts him down and gets rid of the subtlety the original had. This is where it was super clear that this was the direction the translation and localising went.

Edit: oooo!! I mentioned this to a friend as I was writing this and someone made a YouTube video about what I'm trying to say!! Halfway in the video and I totally agree with what's said here! https://youtu.be/l1jotXNoO40
                                This might be a bit late, but I completely agree with you on what they did to 2B (Again, the script, writing, and localization, not the performance )

They did something very similar with Zero in Drakengard 3. Often times she was meant to come off as tired or lethargic, but she just seemed like an angry bitch most of the time, and It really detracted from what was supposed to be her character.
        Is there any difference between the two games outside of the character swap?
            The character himself has a slightly different personality. Brother Nier is a bit more gentle pre-timeskip and becomes nearly psychotic post-timeskip. Father Nier has a similar progression, but it's not nearly as jarring.
                [removed]
                    Yeah even if the dialogue is exactly the same, the context of one protagonist being a seasoned older widower and the other being a inexperienced orphan teenager really makes their relationships with other characters feel a lot different. The subtext matters.
            Well, I played the English version so unfortunately I dont have first hand experience on this one but as far as I'm aware it's just the character change so that has an impact on the dialogue. I'll double check with the JP content though!

Edit: I didn't notice anything!! Kind of want to replay the game now though haha
                I only played the old man english version too
        [deleted]
            Wait, what part of that is false? The post you're responding to didn't assert it was the plan all along, just that two versions were ultimately released.
                Yes he just reiterated what the previous post said with more info.
            Edit: to be clear I was discussing what was release, not what Yoko Taro wanted.

Apologies, but Nier Gestalt and Replicant released on the same day in Japan and they were on two different consoles, this is very much true. At the end of this comment are some original promotional images of the Japanese release of Gestalt, showing Papa Nier.

Sorry if the translation is weird I did it hurriedly.

From Japanese wiki:

>『ニーア レプリカント』（NieR RepliCant）および『ニーア ゲシュタルト』（NieR Gestalt）は、2010年4月22日にスクウェア・エニックスから発売されたアクションRPG。

> "Nier Replicant" and "Nier Gestalt" are Action RPGs released by Square Enix on the 22nd of April 2010.

>『レプリカント』はプレイステーション3、『ゲシュタルト』はXbox 360でそれぞれ発売。海外ではPS3・Xbox 360の両機種ともに『ゲシュタルト』の内容で『NIER』のタイトルで販売している。

>They were released separately with "Replicant" on PlayStation 3 and "Gestalt" on 360. Overseas the PS3/360 the two variations were released with the contents of "Gestalt" under the title "NIER".

Edit2: since I'm translating things I'd like to add the blurb that Famitsu review gives for Nier Gestalt.

>黒文病にかかった娘のヨナを助けるために冒険する父親のニーアとなり、仲間と巨大なマモノと戦うのだ。プレイヤーの行動によって、エンディングが変化する。
>Playing as Nier, a father who sets out on an adventure to rescue his daughter Yona from the Black scrawl[illness], you team up with your allies to fight giant *mamono* [translated in-game as Shades]. According to the player's actions the ending will change.
            what I find most wild about this is that Pappa Neir was supposed to be "macho"
                He's fairly macho post-timeskip, but pre-timeskip he's just a down-on-his-luck dad whose desperate for money to care for his daughter. Poor dude is completely willing to throw away his pride and do anything to help her and is really empathetic to complete strangers.
            [deleted]
                The problem is it also messes up his dynamic with Kaine and Emil. And brother/sister is still believable for the main dynamic imo as someone with 4 sisters
        I thought Replicant was brought to the West? I could've sworn I remember it at Gamestop when it came out.
            Maybe I'm remembering the titles backwards but I'm pretty sure the one with young Nier didn't get localized. There's a fan translations project for it
                You're correct. Regardless of the name. The game devs felt that a western audience would find a "Father&Daughter" story more appealing than the "Brother&Sister" originally planned.
                    I really liked the father/daughter story more than having it be brother and sister. It felt more realistic that a father would do absolutely anything to save his sick daughter. I'll be disappointed of we don't have that story available in the West.
                        We already do, that's the one that was originally ported.

Regardless, you can tell that the game was written for the brother story. The lines papa Nier has about friendship and Emil's crush on him make more sense if he's younger. There's also him aging up on the second half, which Gestalt replaced with... an eyepatch.

                                Well to each their own, haha. I feel the exact opposite way in every way, so I'm glad we're finally getting a translation for brother Nier.
                    and they were right because it's *way* more compelling and I believe a father >!Dooming the entire human race!< for the sake of his daughter without question, but a brother doing it for his sister just seems like an illogical stretch. But I guess then you can't appeal to the weirdly prevalent siscon crowd.
    Funny you say that considering there's two versions of the original Nier.
        The only difference is that in the Japanese only version you play as a brother while in the worldwide version you play as a dad.
Because it's more than a remaster and less than a remake. Therefore, 1.5. With a Yoko Taro edgy flair added.
[deleted]
    Suddenly Mickey and Goofy stroll in
So this is NieR 1.5 then.

From the company that brought you Kingdom Hearts I.5 and II.5 (yes, Roman numerals mixed with decimals).
Well, a remaster is easier than a new game so it should have been more probable- especially with the remaster trend we've been seeing lately.
    Is NieR Replicant any good? I have heard that previous NieR games before Automata are good in terms of story and music but have *reaaaally* rough gameplay.

I loved Automata and I am loving the continuation of its story in FF14 so I am excited to explore more of the NieR games, either way.
        So it's actually similar in a lot of ways to Automata conceptually in terms of gameplay. The problem is it's a lot rougher and the quality of life features just aren't there. Still, the story is pretty amazing. The second playthrough really turns everything on it's head, too.
            The second playthrough really made me change my worldview quite a bit.
                How so? I played Automata and have the gist of the story of Nier. I'm just curious how it changed you.
                    not OP but imo it paints certain events into a bigger painting with much more context, much like automata. the point being that you never know how other people are feeling/why they act a certain way or do the things they do. in the it's easy to assume someone is evil/an asshole when you don't know the full story.
                        I thought that reveal during the second playthrough was a bit cheap. Everyone will keep attacking you first even if youre not fighting back, felt kinda unsatisfied when those wolves tried to kill me just because I was walking around and then theyre weeping "what did we do to deserve this ?" in the cutscenes later ...
                            i honestly didn't remember the details so i had to rewatch the cutscenes. what i seem to remember is that the wolves and humans from the village were under constant fight, so it might make sense that the wolves would attack any human on sight. but i'm not saying that nier was a flawless game, it definitely lacked in some departments.
                                Oh dont get me wrong I really liked Nier ... in a weirdly  confusing and depressing way lol

But that big emotional gut punch just wasnt as heavy as it could have been.
                        Sounds like it made you have more empathy for people. Which is awesome.
                    It made me realize that the world isn't black and white, also made me question if what I do as a hero in a video game is actually ethical or if it's just ethical for the people I am doing it for. It awakened in me an interest in finding books/games/movies that cover similiar topics, where everything isn't black and white, but rather much like the real world, it is different shades of grey.
                        Ideally, you probably should have learned this in middle/high school through assigned reading. Good that you eventually picked up on this though.
                            and ideally, people should learn critical thinking in school which clearly many people don't. there are some things you just have to teach yourself. love you too btw :)
                                Agreed. I think this is a failing of public school systems. There is fantastic material that is assigned in American schools, for example, that focus on the duality of good & evil (Lord of the Flies, Of Mice & Men, To Kill A Mockingbird, a TON of Shakespeare), but the reality is many teachers themselves lack good understandings of the texts themselves that they fail to engage students whom, otherwise, the texts could really resonate with. Or yknow provide good life lessons.
                            German middle/high school reading is all about "nazis bad", we did do critical interpretations, but we always needed to qrite what the teacher wanted to hear if we wanted to get a good grade and when Nier first came out, I had graduated the year before and was still a die hard commie, extremists aren't exactly known for recognizing shades of grey.
                                I was speaking from an American perspective, so unsure of the German education system, but this doesn't sound that different. It really is a failing of schools and teachers who don't engage the students with the texts.
            I'm having flashbacks... Only different!
            To be fair though, some of Automata's "improvements" aren't really. Power leveling in Nier felt natural and word system didn't get in the way of things and items were separated out. Automata's leveling and chip system was needlessly convoluted and time consuming for the sake of being convoluted and time consuming. One upgrade though from Nier to Automata was fantastic.... the path to get a weapon upgraded with materials.  And I mean the physical path. Automata had sensible fast travel location to the blacksmith and the weapon shops. Nier... fk Nier. Fk those ladders. And fk the absolute rage (by the end of the multiple playthroughs) I felt every time I needed to go to the Brothers shop or that location in general. I swear by the end my neck was sore from all the times I swung my head back and groaned as I climbed those ladders. I kept screaming, "Why can't I just fast travel to that area?! How about just 1 ladder to climb after you clear it the first time?! Why is there not some kind of fn shortcut by hour 40?!"
        Depends.

It's worth noting that Automata was notable partially because it was basically the first Yoko taro game that didn't play like complete shit, but his other games do incredibly interesting stuff with regards to the story. So, if you're fine playing a janky piece of ass for a similar narrative experience, it's worth it. But it is *very* janky.
            I love me some proper japanese jank
                Imagine if Japanese Jank and EuroJank worked together. They'd be unstoppable.
                    And also unplayable
                    Gothic: Nier Jankima
                        Mount and Gothic: Nierlord
                        Kingdom Nier Deliverjank
                        Gothic <3
                    The perfect meme game doesn't exist.
                    To me, Dragons Dogma hits that spot. Love that game. It still holds up, but in a completely different way. Like in a junk way.
            To say Nier Gestalt/Replicant plays like "complete shit" is really going overboard. It's very barebones but it's not "bad". Especially not "complete shit"

Drakengard on the other hand, that did not age well at all.
            To be fair, Drakengard 3 only played like complete shit because it ran like ass too. I recently(-ish) emulated it and at a stable framerate it doesn't feel too different from Nier.
                Can you direct me to some info on how to emulate Drakengard 3? Last I checked it wasn't available on the main PS3 emulator (forgot the name).
                    It is definitely playable on RPCS3 including all DLC. Maybe an update broke it because I haven't touched it for a year.
                    Like the other poster said, it's emulatable on RPCS3 [with very little tweaking](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Drakengard_3). A bunch of (pretty much all?) Unreal Engine 3-based games are.
        Wait, does Automata story continues?
            Automata is a sequel to Replicant. During Route B if you found any "Project Gestalt reports" that's what they're referencing. Emil's character also carries over from there among with various other references.

EDIT: Sorry I didn't see you were referring to FF14.
                Pretty sure he's asking about the FF14 thing.
                    Oh whoops, my bad. I have the same question now since I thought it was more a cameo thing.
                        It's not just a cameo, it's a full series of three raids and a plot line that act as a continuation of Automata's story (though to what degree, we don't quite know yet because only about a third of it is in the game right now). Raid 1 has two new bosses and two bosses that are familiar faces, though I won't spoil who they are. Raid 2 is dropping within the next two months and raid 3 will be six months after that.
            final fantasy 14 has a nier automata side story in it, which is tied into a yorha unit and a derelict factory. It's not finished yet so not clear how it sits in the timeline.
                Now I need to start FF14 on PS4
                    Play an MMO for hundreds of hours for a side story? Go for it.
                        I mean it's ffxiv so he could just join boost to Shadowbringers, get carried through the end, then get carried through the raids...
                            You get carried through the 24-mans whether you like it or not when it's your first time anyway.
                    I mean honestly ffxiv has a fantastic story, and a super generous free trial (any character can get every class up to level 35 as many tines as they want). Imo its worth giving a shot
        NieR's gameplay is passable IMO but it's much worse than Automata. You don't have a lock-on, you can't shoot the equivalent of the pod program and melee/move around at the same time (the game is designed around it but still), there's no real combo system, it only runs at 30FPS and on the whole isn't really a strong point of the game by any means.

The other big problem is you can tell how low budget the game is by the fact that it recycles a lot of content. It manages to do that surprisingly well but what really sucks is you have to play the second half of the game at least three times in total to see all the endings because there's no chapter select, AND you have to collect all the weapons to see the last two. It's fine for the second go-around since there's new cutscenes and dialogue (that's a lot more impactful than the early stuff you see in route B in Automata), but after you get the second ending the game is literally the same until the very end. I love the game and all but couldn't be assed to do that, so I just watched the endings on youtube after I did the second playthrough, which sucks because the last ending is a lot more meaningful if you get it yourself.

So it's a very flawed game but if you loved the story/music/atmosphere of Automata then those are all great here, and it's probably worth looking into this if you temper your expectations a bit regarding the gameplay. This remaster could also fix some of those issues, having a chapter select would already make a big difference.
        There's actually only one game, with different protaganist depending on your region, Gestalt and Replicant. Difference is that you either play the role of a brother or father. (Only the brother for the remake it seems)

Yes, they're janky and doesn't have very good combat and poor performance, but they're said to be some of the best games ever produced, despite all it's shortcomings.
            I hope we still get to play as the father, that ugly ass man was a refreshing change of pace to me back then so I look on him fondly.
                Plus outside of a few sparse moments, the father works better for the story. Some people would say its" more than a few sparse moments." I would say that they don't get it. His wife died and his daughter became ill. His whole world became taking care of his daughter. As a result, he isolated himself. "Social distancing." Its not like he did all these odd jobs to grab a beer with the bard. As a result, he became more socially awkward and forgot how to deal with people outside of his daughter as you would in that situation. Keeping that is mind, moments like "Yes.. you and I are friends now" makes more sense.

Weird thing is this kind of speaks more about Japan's view about parental relationships with their children. That the "father" was made to appeal to a western audience.
                    > Weird thing is this kind of speaks more about Japan's view about parental relationships with their children. That the "father" was made to appeal to a western audience.

Weird thing is that this speaks more about western views about siblings relationship. That "brother" isn't appealing to a western audience.
                        Yeah, the doting brother is quite a popular trope in Japan that, according to many in this thread, doesn't seem to translate too well to a Western audience.
                            Yeah, I wonder why that happens honestly, because tons of people here would have siblings. And in a world where the only one who the character has is their sister, that's quite the story. That ghibli movie with the world war 2 with the kid and his sister is an example to me for this.
                                Grave of the Fireflies, fantastic movie. 
But yeah, it must be a cultural thing, but I'm struggling to associate it with a single held idea/belief. 

What I do find interesting though, is that in the West, older brothers are rarely portrayed as straight up caring and are usually either a bully or indifferent to the younger sibling's plight, until they're actually required to step up.
                            Wasn't one of the reasons why in games and anime/manga the protagonists are always young has to do with people reliving their lost youth thru them? Everyone knows the working culture in Japan is a beast of it's own. School life is also much more strict.

At least that's what i read about it ages ago.
                If they don’t have the father I have to wonder if it’s even worth playing vs. sticking to the proper version. I just can’t imagine the game without him.
            Wasn't it two games but the console version depended on who you played as? I recall the PS3 version being different than the 360 one.

Edit: it seems that the NA versions are both Father Nier, with the PS3 version being a port of the 360 version.
        The gameplay is simple and requires some grinding. Its very easy though- you just need to invest some time into the game and anyone can reach the credits.
            Getting true ending is abomination and you're straight lying. Grinding hours one location, to drop one item, which you need 3 to upgrade 1 of 20 weapons isn't "investing some time".



Hope they will cut that bullshit, because story, characters and music are top notch.
                Actually you only needed to \*obtain\* every weapon. Which for me brought the total playtime for the final endings to 30 -40 hours (normal people can probably do it a lot quicker).

Now getting the platinum trophy which requires ALL weapon upgrades IS pain. That brought my playtime up to 100 hours.
                    That's better, I remembered I was gatekept at Junkyard by some quest, but can't find the one. Like this one: https://nier.fandom.com/wiki/The_Damaged_Map for untrained eye it looks like no hassle. But if you played, you know goats are made purely of meat. (I think I was farming machine oils, 1 hour for a not a single one, in a location where they should drop the most - highest concentration of flying robots)
                        I believe the quest you're thinking of is for repairing Iron Will, which you still need to do in Route B ("Don't we already have this weapon?" "shhh, these things happen the second time around") - which as far as I recall guarantees spawns for that item but it's still a pain to get. 

I think there's some other jank in the game as well where it tells you stuff drops from one enemy but it actually drops from another on the opposite side of an area or something silly like that.
                    Took me 46 hours.

Not sure if it was worth it, but it's certainly a game I will remember. I really enjoyed the first 20 hours. The next were a bit repetitive, but I appreciated the storyline.
        In terms of story I preferred it to automata- gameplay isn't as bad as some people make out but defo way rougher. Cant wait for this.
        The gameplay is totally fine in Nier. 7/10 gameplay with 10/10 story, characters and music.

Now Drakengard on the other hand...
        Wait what? The continuation in FF14? please explain.
        There is only one Nier game before Automata. Gestalt and Replicant are literally the same game with the main character swapped from dad to big bro.

The gameplay is not that rough, it was perfectly fine, but they're almost certainly going to change it. This is not a remaster, it's actually going to be a new version of the game with significant changes.
    I bet a new Yoko Taro project will be announced soon.
    Lately? Hello mcfly!! Anyone home!!?? It's been going on since the last year of ps3 ffs. 

Hell I remember ps4 launch the amount of threads of people asking if they were ever going to make new games because all that was being put out was remasters.
This pushed me to continue playing the OG weirdly enough lol. I got to the save point on top of the tower like 2 weeks ago and left it there. Doing the unthinkable and playing on easy makes it combat become serviceable, and so far its story seems more engaging than Automatas. I also think i forgot most plot details about nier 1 that were mentioned in it too so itll be relatively fresh
Was planning to play automata at some point. Worth paying others first?
    Yes. While the gameplay is sort of clunky, the story and music is top notch.
Considering it's a remaster, it's not going to make much difference, I guess. Only some touches in texture, assets, higher resolution and such, not much difference. Now if it was a remake, then it would be another story.

And Toylogic was development support in that case for DQXI, as SE developed both versions internally. Orca (Saito's company, he's SE Nier and DQ producer) was the support for PS4 and Toylogic for 3DS.

For other works, they assisted on The Evil Within, Smash bros Brawl and other games. They're more a support studio.
    Given how comprehensive Xenoblade Definitive Edition is and that we've only really seen art (par for the course for Nier), it might be bigger than we think.

I really hope the old voice cast comes back. Most of them are fairly high profile now, so I'm a little worried.
        Pretty sure they would only need to hire a new VA for young Nier. It's been a long while since I played it, but to my recollection the dialogue from the other characters avoided hard referencing any father/daughter relationship, so nothing on their end would need to be re-recorded.
        I would die for Liam O'Brien to come back as Weiss
            If I’m not hearing Liam and Laura Bailey this is going to be a pretty big disappointment, not gonna lie.
                They were both willing to reprise their roles in Catherine: Full Body last year, so I think there’s a good chance they’ll come back.
                    That game keeping its entire cast was a bit of a surprise, considering Laura Bailey and Troy Baker hadn't done any work for non-Final Fantasy Japanese games for a few years before that and Atlus had already recast their Persona roles. I suppose it's because the majority of them had become high profile VAs after the original game's release though.
            One of my favorite tidbits about the game is that in the Japanese version Weiss is played by a guy going under the stage name Peter. I thought that was odd, and it turns out he played the court jester in Akira Kurosawa's Ran. The more you know. 

However Liam's English accent added wonderful charm to the character.
            This. I haven't played the original but have it running on a PS3 emulator, it's on my list of games to play. This update sounds like a great way to play it for the first time, and I can wait another year to play it. But, as a massive fan of Critical Role, if it doesn't have the voice work of Liam or Laura it would definitely not be an option for me, and would instead stick to the original.
        > Most of them are fairly high profile now

Unless they skimp on the budget, I don't really think that's been much of an issue for Square Enix; they're no stranger to getting high profile VAs.
            >Unless they skimp on the budget

Square Enix would never do that... not to a Nier project...
        Oh of course, but it depends on the remaster. As far as combat, it's not as normal for remasters to change them fundamentally, more on remakes.
        Assuming they don't add anything significant story wise, I don't see why they wouldn't just be using the original audio where applicable
            [removed]
                I wouldn't mind Japanese voice with English subs (like Yakuza series) tbh
                    The English voice acting was amazing though. I wouldn’t want to miss my "WEISS YOU DUMBASS" every time I start up the game.
                        SPEAK THE TRUTH HUSSY
                    Nah, Kaine is a character people need to experience in their native language. 


The first time you boot it up and hear [“Weiss you dumbass!”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvyvQfn30uE)Hits a lot differently than if you read it.
            They are adding new story elements. I know 2b is supposed to be in it in some way. Also they hinted at a new ending.
        there's a famitsu article above that has the announced cast

koji yusa and ai nonaka are reprising their roles as nier and yunah, and nobuhiko okamoto as boy nier
        Nier is pretty high profile now too though
    They specifically said it isn't a remaster though. It's somewhere between a remaster and a remake.
    I don't see the words remaster anywhere but the title OP gave it. Not in the video or on the website.
    I'd hope for some quality of life and bug fixes too. The combat isn't too bad and of course the other stuff you didn't mention are fine!
So Yoko Taro is not involved? That is great news! That means that Taro might be actually working on a new game instead!
    He's probably working on the next story arc which will only be told and available through interpretive dance performances.
    Huh, how you came to this conclusion? Yoko Taro is a freelancer since Cavia closed, he could work with any studio. lol
    He's also working on the Automata crossover in FF14 at the moment, he stated recently he hasn't even written the ending for it so I think it's still in ongoing development.
    Shouldn't he still be working on the NieR FF14 content? I know that he was and I doubt it's already finished.
        Second part of the raid came out in Feburary, which was supposed to be the last part afaik.
I've been playing the crap out of Automata over the past couple months. How does this game compare?
    I think I prefer this game's music and writing to automata's. Automata has better gameplay though, by a longshot.
    Well, Automata has much better and deep combat and also a much larger open world that has rewards for being explored. 

However, while not as good, I still genuinely enjoyed the combat in Gestalt and found it to be pretty fun for the most part, and the best thing about Gestalt is going to the really crazy locations throughout the story as well as the interactions between all of the characters. Having played Automata, there will be a few key plot points you’ll already know, but that wont hamper your enjoyment. 


It really just depends on what you like about Automata and if you have any questions ask me and I’ll answer
    The story is almost as good. The combat is not as good, it's much less smooth and so on, but it still has its fun moments. Like Automata, the original Nier does cool stuff with switching up gameplay genres every now and then and still has its bullet hell and text adventure moments. Hopefully the combat will be a little better with the remake. Still an excellent game overall so I'm hoping more people get to play it.
    The story is amazing.
    Besides the other comments, an interesting thing that the original does is play around with the combat mechanics with each dungeon. One locks you onto a platform and focuses on the shooting. You also have the top down shmup (or similar) combat. A largely puzzle based dungeon. An isometric dungeon. A text-based "dungeon"

Not all of it is good, but it does a good job of staving off the monotony a clunkier combat system and replaying sections for the multiple playthroughs.
Definitely if people are expecting this to have Automata level of gameplay they're gonna be sorely disappointed.
    I do hope they fix things up like a *bit* at least. I'm excited to play it for the story but almost every recap video I watched before playing Automata the person would say "yeah the game play does NOT hold up" so it would be weird for them to not change it up a bit
        It’s not that it doesn’t hold up, it’s that it’s really, really basic. No lock on, only a light and heavy attack (I think?), no combos, the magic can be abused hardcore. It’s *okay* and worlds better than drakengards gameplay, but it doesn’t fly off the hand as easy as automata does.
            It was also *really* easy too. You could get a spear early on and just mindlessly mash your way to the end of the game.
        I mean, even when the game first came out, it got pretty mediocre reviews mostly saying the story was great and the game had cool ideas but the gameplay was clunky.  So even by the standards at the time the gameplay got criticized a lot, let alone compared to modern action games.
    This is the first thing I thought up and commented in discord with some buddies when I saw this... the original nier was pretty clunky if youre coming automata. Thats honestly one of the reason I love both though. automata you're essentially a perfect android. You can do anything. While in the original, youre only human. feels a lot more human with the combat.
    Well this comment made me disappointed. What is the gameplay like then?
[deleted]
    > Full voice acting and reorchestration

That's kind of a bummer cause I find those parts of the first Nier to still be top notch (even better than Automata imo).
        I figure they would have to redo the VO since this is the Japanese version and not the one that original released in the US.
Actually, from what I've read, it looks to add new stuff as well. At least articles covering this announcement talk about it that way.
https://gamestalk.net/post-141918/

They said various things were added, a new character, possibly a new ending teased, new OSTs and 2B & 9S VAs will have a small role.
There are implications that it's more than just a remaster
>people expecting Automata-level gameplay.

I mean... That was nothing special?

Don't get me wrong I loved the game, but I loved it for the soundtrack and the story, the actual gameplay was a very generic "press dodge roll and then mash attack buttons" style of game.

It was far from **bad**, but it didn't exactly redefine the genre either?
    The thing is, the original Nier's combat is worse than that. There's no real combo system, no lock-on, you can't fire spells and attack at the same time, moving around and doing things is more awkward, it only runs in 30 FPS and overall is just far inferior to Automata.
        And during heavy combat the framerate dips into the single digits. At least on 360.
        [removed]
            I'm aware of that, I played the game briefly with the 60fps hack on RPCS3. If this remaster does not run at 60 that would be fairly disappointing given the original on an emulator can do so.
    My point is that the first Nier's gameplay is on a sliding scale from somewhat to much worse comparatively. It doesn't really matter if Automata's standard is considered high, medium, or already low.
    If you thought Automata’s gameplay was nothing special then just wait til you play the first Nier.
    I'm sure most people when talking about the gameplay being different would be how it can change perspective and be doing different things that aren't usually expected out of a third person action game.

Normally it's just a third person action game, but sometimes it changes perspective and suddenly it's "sidescrolling". 

Or how it goes into a completely different gameplay mode when you are using the flight suits. And then even within that mode it can change perspective.

Pretty sure that is unique gameplay compared to every other "press dodge roll and then mash attack buttons" like you said.
I’ve never seen someone be so negative about their favorite game of all time.
    It's a game that you love in spite of its glaring faults.
So what's the difference between Nier Replicant and Nier Gestalt?
    They're basically the same game but the main character is a palette swap between teenage boy in Replicant trying to help his sister, and a middle aged man in Gestalt trying to help his daughter. There's no actual changes to the story or dialogue otherwise and they play the same.
I actually found Papa-Nier's awkward moments to work in the sort of bumbling dad-kind of way; like how he have been so focused on raising his daughter that he doesn't kinda know how to act outside of it to his younger companions, which contrasts to Teenage-Nier who spouts such awkwardness due to his inexperience and being naive.
    Yeah, his “we’re friends now” (or however it went specifically) to kaine is one of my favorite things. It’s super awkward and comes off as an old man having absolutely no idea what to say to talk this person down off the ledge.
Something something Emil
    WE ARE FRIENDS NOW
To be fair Taro has said he thinks that Ending D is the Canon ending for Father and E the Canon ending for Brother. The script may not always mesh well with Father Nier, but it's clear they took efforts to ensure the broad strokes and overall theme still work just fine. It really feels like those endings were written with both versions in mind, so it always feels off to me when people say Replicant is the "intended experience", since Yoko Taro himself has a fondness for Father Nier as well 

I think if Taro had the budget he'd probably have gone and changed the weird script moments for Dad Nier and try to have the games coexist, but I'm sure they didn't have the budget to do so.

In that sense I hope Taro can incorporate both versions in the remaster. If I remember correctly from some flavor text, both versions of Nier are acknowledged in Automata. Hopefully they'll stick with that.
    [deleted]
        The timeskip weapon options click with the adult Nier at the very least, because it comes off as him willing to kill anything in his path and his expanded arsenal reflects him needing bigger weapons after failing to defeat a bigger shade. The dialog however doesn't always mesh as you said.
        A lot of the strange script moments work for Father Nier as well, if you think of him as an awkward father who doesn't know much outside of protecting his daughter. I never saw a problem with his friendship speeches either, Kaine and Emil help him a lot to find his daughter despite the perilous situations, it makes sense he would feel a strong friendship with them, and his dialogue always depicted him as a bit awkward despite his age. 

The timeskip also isn't that aggregious either (except for the sudden ability to use two handed weapons). It still makes sense for Father Nier to undergo a change in personality because of the frustration/sobering feeling of going all those years with his daughter still missing. If you look at it in terms of a maturation of Nier, then Brother Nier works better. But if you view it as a shift in personality as a result of his circumstances, Father Nier fits the bill just fine.

It still has its awkward moments, but to say it's just a simple cut and paste is underselling the work the English scriptwriters did to make the change work in the grand scheme of the story. And like I said, these awkward moments don't take away from the broad story of protecting someone dear to you.
    Trying to get "intended experiences" confirmations out of Taro is just silly, either way.

Yoko will turn joke endings into entirely new spinoff timelines, he's a madman. If he made a sequel out of Nier Automata it would probably be based off the ending where you eat a fish and die.
    Maybe the game will feature both options? Although that would be a big load of voice work...

I am guessing that they will add Ending F to the game as well, in order to connect it to Automata.
For me, the awkward spots are more centered around the romantic subtext scenes with Kaine.
    Eh, I didn't find it that awkward. I know she's supposedly a teenager, but she literally never acts like one in the game. If the game told me she was 25 or so, I'd believe it.
    And the fact that Emil is gay for him.
        Yeah but it's pretty easy to not pick up on that in the actual game.
    The while game I thought of Kaine as a daughter figure for Papa Nier, the romance didn't work for me. Fucking love NieR Gestalt though so it's all good.
"Because we're friend!" 

Yeah the script was meant for brother Nier, but Father Nier fits so much more with the overall themes and motivation of the story that I can let the odd moment or two slide. Fighting to save your daughter just hits so much more then for your sister.
    I agree but it depends on your culture. The whole reason father nier was added in the localized version was because the devs figured it would be easier for Western Audiences to relate to.

The game works with both versions though and it's a bit of a shame they couldn't have both in this release.
        They weren't wrong either. Big burly grizzled man was basically the meme character design for X360/PS3 action games. Still kind of is too with the sad dad games. These days more people seem more on board with more typical anime type designs
            It's actually confirmed that God of War was the inspiration for the gameplay in this game, which makes it funny in retrospect since Kratos would later become a sad dad himself.
                God of War 1-3 is literally about Kratos being a sad dad.
                    Yeah but mad sad, not sad sad.
                        I think we can all agree that Kratos is a mad sad dad lad.
                    [deleted]
                        No, they had a point. Kratos had already lost his daughter in the OT so he had no more reason to act like a dad. He was just rage incarnate and a bloodthirsty maniac by the third game. The stuff with Pandora was half baked at best. With Atreus, Kratos does have something to protect and starts acting like a father again in a very believable way.
        They have young nier in some side missions. “Gestalt”
    Nier's story revolves more over Nier himself than Yonah's condition, Yonah serves as a primary motivator but the story quickly evolves beyond that centering on Nier & the tragic setting. Some examples, Nier dealing with both of his dear companions Kaine(a girl) and Emil(a boy) falling in love with him. All the messed up things a fragile young Nier had to do to survive. The day to day boylike/youngish manner Nier speaks with his companions. >!The ending where Nier more so rejects Yonah & prioritizes his own desires instead!< If you pay close attention to Nier's story Dad Nier as the MC really doesn't work.

At a casual glance the idea of Dad trying to save Daughter seems easier to justify than Brother saving Sister the problem is the story primarily explores Nier himself & so all the details of a desperate 16 year old brother dealing with a harsh apocalyptic world fall out of place when you copy paste in a 40~ year old man instead.

[Old Nier official concept art](https://imgur.com/a/FwUvlRz)
    The only thing for me that is awkward for father nier and definitely fits brother nier more is that *one part* in the ending.
    [Many people disagree with that view and think the Brother theme fits far better](https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/b8c8xl/should_i_play_nier_gestalt_or_replicant/ek096ng/) 

Please keep an open mind, I'm glad we're getting Yoko Taro's intended version rather than the one westerners got previously.
        Young protagonists are boring because every game ever has one.  I played both and enjoyed Father Nier so much more simply because it wasn't a dumb teenager yet again.
            [deleted]
Yeah, Emil and Kaine makes much more sense with Brother in the script than with the father. Otherwise, well, you know what it looks like with Gestalt.
True, but Nier came out in a time when even dual audio wasn't a standard.
The protagonist being a father is the most interesting part of the game imo, since it made the game accidentally ahead of its time.

The last ten years have been almost nothing but games about dads running around killing things for their children. NiER was the very first game in that trend by a longshot, but only because they were scared of making the protagonist a little boy for America. And as ridiculous as that sounds, I think it was probably a great decision.
In the end it comes down to whether you want an awkward teenager or a a grown ass man acting like an awkward teenager.
Absolutely agreed. I want Yoko Taro's original uncompromised work not the "should sell better in the west" version that I currently own.
    I always hate the fact that American companies think they should change other cultures to better fit their own, and for people to relate more. If people wanted an American game they would play an American game. Stop americanizing Japanese games. Especially frustrating as a European, because Europe doesn't have the same values on a lot of points that America has. Most notably the extreme casualization of extreme violence, while many other things are struck down on like lightning
        [deleted]
            Yeah, someone else told me this was actually not one of those cases. I do feel like it happens way too often though
        You're acting like Papa NieR was a bad thing. It wasn't. Jamieson Price's voice also nails the whole role.
Also, Japan isn't exactly free of doing that shit.
        It wasn't an american company who did that and they didn't americanizing the game. lol Two versions of Nier were made and released in Japan and then just one of them which was the one that would get more people into the game was localized.
            [deleted]
            Didn't know that. But my point still stands that alot of times japanese games are changed to "better capture Western audiences"
>Replicant was the canon version

Both are canon. Automata even references both.
This is a HUGE bummer for me. Playing as the father was what makes Nier one of my all time favorite games. It's a trope to be the young adventurer or hero and it was refreshing to be someone older, that I as a father with daughters of my own could relate to. The story bad me almost sobbing sometimes because of that. I'm sorry but the journal entries regarding you as the father written by Yuna just are not going to have the same emotional power playing as someone else. Even if brother fills all the same "roles", it absolutely will not.

I live Nier and want to play the replicant version, but Gestalt would have been a day one purchase for me. Replicant will be a whenever it goes on sale purchase for me.
> considering there's absolutely nothing from Gestalt, which makes sense 

Says you. Lots of people think Gestalt makes more sense. Maybe not with people's crushes on him, but with the entire story of the game.
    Not sure what you interpreted here but I said that because the name of the game is Nier Replicant instead of Nier Gestalt or Nier which would mean that Papa Nier isn't the focus.

And I mean, Gestalt was the one which people received so of course the majority will prefer him. And also because father and children stories get into people more than siblings.

But uh, while I can see your point, Gestalt pretty much makes Nier and Emil/Kaine with a weird relationship.
        >But uh, while I can see your point, Gestalt pretty much makes Nier and Emil/Kaine with a weird relationship.

Yeah, it's definitely got some weird parts.  I personally prefer Papa Nier because the story of a father fighting to save his daughter is much more emotionally resonant to me, but I really wish it had gotten some dialogue edits to make things a lot less....bizarre in spots.  And I understand that it was basically a marketing move and nothing more, so I get why it's not coming back.

    A loose sequel, I’d add. The ties between Gestalt/Replicant and Automata are really fantastic for fans of the series, but ultimately not needed to enjoy the story of Automata.
        It may be a "loose sequel" but it's the extensive backstory for Emil who was one of he most significant side characters in Automata, which I expect will be a point of interest for many.
First there was Drakengard (which has 3 games of its own) which has multiple endings, then came Nier's two versions, Gestalt and Replicant, that were mostly the same beyond their protagonist and their relationship to the girl, which was based off of one of the Drakengard's endings, and then Automata which is a sequel to Nier but it takes place way way in the future and that's why **Automata Spoilers** >!there are no more humans on earth, because of what happened in the original Nier. Several of Automata's characters also originate from Nier, including Emil, Devola, and Popola!<
    During Nier: Automata I remember some tunes that Emil was humming or that were playing.  There's the 'fight' version and the version you get when you go this (?) bunker.   It looks like lots of the music is based on music from these originals. 

Which prequel is the Emil bit from, or at least the original Emil story from, is it this Nier Replicant?
        Yes, Emil is a major character in the original Nier.
        Emil is from Replicant. [Clemps has an entire series explaining the Nier storyline.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__q_Nx9WbgY&list=PLI1L9JVl6TFdwfvKUuebNp_zOAL5XXDT5)
            Just binge watched that entire series. Dude makes some excellent videos.

Thanks for the link.
        Emil's origin is in Nier Replicant/Gestalt.
He's a major character in the first game.
        He is from gestalt/replicant because they are the same game but with different protagonist, gestalt is daddy nier,  replicant is onii-chan nier so same story different tone. Gestalt is the west version and replicant was the Japanese version
            Gestalt was also released in Japan as an Xbox 360 exclusive, while Replicant was only on PS3.
        >Which prequel is the Emil bit from, or at least the original Emil story from, is it this Nier Replicant?

Yes, Emil is from Nier 1. (Replicant/Gestalt)
        > It looks like lots of the music is based on music from these originals.

Let's just say opening that damn tower was either boring/gameplay or a tear-jerker of a scene, full of symbols and sentiments.
        My GF had me play these back to back, with Nier first, and I did nothing but complain about Emil but I loved him. You should have heard me "OMG EMIL!" When he showed up in Automata
        Emil is from the original Nier, and if you felt Devola and Popola kind of showed up out of nowhere and got kind of an out-of-place final moment for how little they'd been involved so far, that's because they're from the original Nier too... kinda.
    Speaking of Drakengard, was the last one any good? I've only played Drakengard 2 and I enjoyed it. Although I don't think I'll enjoy it if I play it today so if the latest one is the same I might skip on it.
        Only if you emulate. It was made by deadly premonition studio, and it works in literal 3FPS. And the game of course is trademark Drakengard zero budget zero content giant playtime quality.
        it was more batshit insane stuff ala Drakengard 1 so if that's up your alley, sure
        By the last one do you mean Drakengard 3? Don't expect the combat to be as smooth as Nier Automata and in terms of continuity it's like a distant prequel to Drakengard 1 which is in a parallel world whose events ended up spilling over onto the parallel world of OTL Earth which then became the Nier world.

But for what it's worth I enjoyed it. The story is like a black comedy - the subject matter is very dark and all the characters have been through terrible trauma. But the characters are all pretty badass and they joke about it a lot. The story isn't as good as Nier Automata but still very good compared to most games. Especially if you read the prequel novel (at least the chapter on Zero) to get a sense of the backstory, then play the game, and then play the DLC. Each DLC is a sidestory that lets you play as one of the villains and learn more about their characters. Quite a bit of good character development and plot in the game, and while it's story is very nontraditional, it has a lot of Yoko Taro's charm.
Remaster of the Japanese version of nier (prequel to automata) originally on ps3 and Xbox 360
She voiced him in Automata, I can't imagine they would get a different VA at this point.
But it is coming, isn't it? Afaik, Replicant was the canon version, even more when novels and other materials always used him instead of the father. I really think Gestalt don't exist and replicant will be for JP and the west.
    iirc, Yoko Taro says he prefers Father Nier, though idk if that's the canon version. The script is definitely (imo) written for Brother Nier, though.
        iirc, yoko taro's original vision of the story was of brother nier, but he liked the idea of father nier so much that he considered them equal at the time. Not sure about that now, especially given this remaster being just replicant.
            (He could also very much have been pretending, because marketing.)
                thats true. It feels a *little* out of character for Taro to fake for marketing purposes, but it is a definite possibility
                    That's the genius behind constantly being a weirdo... You can never tell when they're being genuinely weird or just playing it up 🤔
                    What was he going to say? "You westerners won't be getting the true version, because we thought that westerners will like a bulky daddy character more than a teenager (which was true), so you won't get the canon version that was meant to be. Sorry."
    [deleted]
        I doubt this will happen considering we saw absolutely nothing and only Nier brother appeared but we'll see later on how this will go.
It may or may not mean anything but that number is exactly the square root of (3/2).
    are we going to approach kingdom hearts level of titles?
        Think we surpassed it
    So ending D it is.
At least this gives you an excuse to play through the story with Brother Nier?
I don't think it'll be more than a polish, so I'm sure it's for the best that you got to play it now rather than wait.
I feel the same. Also, the first Nier truly felt like a subversion of the typical japanese RPG, while Automata was the exact opposite. All the characters and the story felt so generic and it does everything that Gestalt/Replicant tried not to be. Some of the plottwists don't even work in Automata, if you have played the first game. I thought that was just part of a bigger plottwist, but no, they just acted like we didn't know what already happened to the world
For some reason I find the game kind of charming because it's so bad and clunky. Like you said, the story and music is fantastic, and the gameplay just makes me feel like I'm playing a dates Xbox/PS2 game that didn't age well. For some reason it makes me feel fond of it even though it isn't well made.
Even if they don't... the VA of Weiss needs to stay. Weiss' VA made like 50% of my enjoyment of that game.
    Stop pounding me!
        Drunk Weiss towards the end is amazing


Also the way he says “Hussy” is just *chefs kiss*
    The voice acting between papa nier and weiss was 80% of my enjoyment of that game without it i think ill pass
    The voice acting is the biggest thing I want more information on. I love the English voice work in Nier, it'd be so disappointing if it's redone with a different cast, or just redone at all and isn't as good.
        Laura Bailey fucking kills it as Kaine and [i really hope they don't re-record this line, because it's one of my favourite pieces of voice acting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvyvQfn30uE)
            Oh man, that’s fantastic - I agree, that’s some of the best voice acting I’ve heard in a long time. I loved Automata, but never played the original - here’s hoping they don’t change too much.
            Nier had Laura Bailey AND Liam O'Brien? At this rate they might as well go the whole hog with Critical Role VAs and have Mercer voice the protag
    Liam' o brien. Hes also in critical role
    I mean, he sounds a bit too much like Illidan in the game, but I think that just makes it better.
Makes me wonder if they’ll be re-recording voices and the like. They really need Jamieson Price back as Papa Nier if they do so

edit: [Famitsu article](https://www.famitsu.com/news/202003/29195616.html) says Keichii Okabe (original composer) is back with new songs for the OST as well as rerecording the soundtrack. Can't wait to hear the new rendition of Kaine's theme
    I really hope they get the original cast they were all great picks
Depends on how they incorporate the book stuff into it. Brother Nier will do anything for his sister and the book really highlights the things he would do for her.
Is Replicant exactly the same as Gestalt? Because I got awfully far into Gestalt without finishing it. I'm trying to decide if I should finish it or wait for Replicant and play that.
    Only difference is papa Nier vs brother Nier.
        [deleted]
            Older MC appealed more to western audiences than a bishounen MC really, it came out around 09. BrotherNier is the canonical one.

Some people think dadNier works better whilst others say broNier is better, and then some say the Father/Daughter works better while companion relationships work better with a younger character.
                [deleted]
                    There are lore reasons, replicant vs gestalt. Going more into it is spoiler territory. You should play it, phenomenal story.
            Brother nier is the original japanese version, but they thought the whole "Onii-chan!" Extremely loving siblings thing wouldnt work in the west so they made him older, and changed him into her father.

Its not a character select because its basically a localization change.
            As far as I know, it was originally written as a story about a brother and a sister, but someone (Yoko Taro I guess?) thought it would connect with western audiences more if it was about father/daughter instead. Gestalt is the western version.
    Pretty much the same, except the character you're playing in Replicant is a young teenage boy saving his sister Yonah, but in Gestalt you're an old man trying to save his daughter Yonah.

If you still have access to the Gestalt one, you can still continue playing it, it's exactly the same casts and story, just different age for the protagonist is all.
        Why was the game made that way?
            Long story short: appeal to a Western audience
            While the game was originally made with Replicant version (the teenage protag. version) in mind, they decided to make Nier older when localizing to the west as they thought it would draw in more western audience and boost sales, since most western games feature older, gruffier main character (e.g. Gears of War, Max Payne, etc.)

Which... actually works, believe it or not. While the design of teenage Nier is more appealing to look at, a lot of people liked papa Nier because they feel that a father doing everything in his power to save his daughter is a much more compelling motivation than  a brother saving his sister. This is one of the many things that helped elevate Nier to become a cult classic in the western gaming audience.
                I mean... okay ? That sounds absurdly overkill. Making a whole alternate version of a game and redoing the entire script and dub of the main character for a somewhat risky marketing decision ? I find that a little insane.

Good thing it worked, though.
    It's the same story but the protagonist is different, in one you're the typical JRPG teenager, in the other you're a father, in general if doesn't matter much but you can easily tell the story was written for the teen Nier because some scenes are just... weird for an adult
    The game is literally the exact same minus brother Nier being a different character and some dialogue to accomodate that. The most significant thing that really changes is more subtext than anything.
Plus it's nice to play as an old dude in a Japanese game instead of yet another young, generic, androgynous JRPG protagonist.
    The hate that the western fanbase have with siblings stories and young characters is astonishing. Now it makes sense why Papa Nier existed, because westerns can't stand playing with young characters and sympathize with a story about siblings, while Japanese and asians prefer such stories.
Same, father Nier is one of my all time favorite characters.
[deleted]
    I don't see it as caricaturical. It felt to me he was acting as father figure, reinforcing Kaine she has people who care about her. They were bunch of misfits and only a Father had a clear goal, which allows him "to lead" and take care of his friends, these lost younglings.


Yeah, the time skip was weird but we get cool mask with eyepatch.
    I didn’t even know about the two versions when I played the game. I just made the insanely wild leap that he learned how to use more weapons during the time skip. And I’m the story he came off as an awkward, socially maladjusted person doing their best. That makes him fit in with the rest of the cast far more than the generic JRPG protagonist.
Automata isn't exactly peak Platinum. But new combat would be nice.
    Oh I agree. But it serviced the story well so I was ok with it.
        Same. Repetitive, but satisfying.
The Nier Automata director is one this project, so I'm assuming they're changing some stuff
I read somewhere that the combat director from Platinum is involved with this somewhat, so maybe we can hope?
Well, I personally don't care how well it's "aged" or whatever I am looking forward to give the game a go.
[removed]
Multiple sources have already confirmed it getting a western release. No info about how they'll handle the English version in terms of voice acting/ rerecording though.
What's even the difference between Gestalt and Replicant. So confusing with all the versions, and Drakengard too.. According to Wikipedia the fifth ending of that game is canon and Nier proceeds it. How about Automata? Really confusing lol Was just about to buy Gestalt for PS3 some days ago, then they announced this. Super excited! Nier looks a bit strange/unique though.. from running around planting seeds, anime characters, sad moments, killing boars... It's all over the place! Unique indeed.
    It is definitely a confusing series. Don’t go in expecting everything to make sense, because it won’t. It is really amazing though story-wise.

Let’s get into Drakengard first. Drakengard is Nier’s parent series. In other words, Nier is a spinoff of the Drakengard franchise. I’d explain how, but that involves some pretty deep spoilers of the first Drakengard game.

Drakengard is a series that has a reputation for looking like an edgy gore fest on the surface, but then progressively get deeper and deeper when you make significant progress. Being part of the same series, it shares a lot of DNA with Nier, with Drakengard 3 being basically a Nier game, making a lot of references to Nier and explaining a lot of the weird phenomenons in both series. Unlike Nier, which takes place in the near future, the Drakengard games usually take place in a more archaic fantasy setting, where the main character will usually partner up with a dragon to achieve some sort of end.

Nier Gestalt and Nier Replicant are mostly the same game, however, there is one significant difference. Nier Gestalt stars the protagonist Nier as an older man, trying to find a cure for a disease for his afflicted daughter Yonah. Nier Replicant follows the same premise, except Nier is a young adult, where Yonah is his younger sister instead of his daughter. There are other minor differences, such as the endings, but the games are mostly the same otherwise. In Japan, Nier Replicant was released on PlayStation 3, and Nier Gestalf was released on Xbox 360. In the West, we never got Nier Replicant, because Square Enix felt as though a younger male protagonist wouldn’t catch on with a Western audience, so only Nier Gestalt was localized, released for both PS3 and Xbox 360, and renamed to just “Nier”.

The stories are mostly the same between the two, but Nier Automata specifically follows one of the endings of Nier Replicant, so we never even got that part of the story in the West. Nier Automata is the most recent and popular game ( and the best one gameplay-wise, no contest ) in the franchise, in a setting that takes place thousands of years after the events of Nier. Despite being a “Nier” game, Nier Automata is mostly completely unrelated to Nier Gestalt and Replicant; there are a few returning characters that play a minor role, but nothing that would require you to play the first game to understand. Otherwise, its connection to Nier and Drakengard is mostly down to minor references.
        Thank you so much for the in depth answer buddy, that cleared up so much confusion! I'm really excited for the remake! Is there a specific reason to the two Nier games' names? What is replicant and gestalt a reference to? Gestalt means shape/form in german, does that have anything to do with the game? I find the franchise very mysterious and unique to be honest!
Both are canon, everyone saying only replicant is are false. I personally feel like Gestalt is true canon though since it’s the one mentioned in Automata. Personally I’m really bummed if it’s only Replicant and not Gestalt. I probably won’t be purchasing this if that’s the case.
Cause the Replicnt script is the OG/Canon script.
    Also I agree the combat doesn't exactly hold up relative to Automata. I hope they revamp that and at the very least add a lock-on system.
Replicant is the canon original story, and Gestalt came to be because they thought another anime boy RPG wouldn't do well in the west, so they made the protagonist a man.
    That would explain some of his weird scenes. "You and me are friends now!"
[removed]
    Then how were they different?
        A texture swap and a handful of lines changed because of that swap.
Yikes...but at least they're not designing the game.  They're just taking someone else's work and porting it.  Still, this is quite a high profile game.  They better not mess it up.
    I don't even know. Rogue Corps originally was designed by Nobuya Nakazato. Who is the dude behind most contra games since 3.

So i don't know what really happened with this game.
He's director of both projects.
    Oh good, since I couldn't see his name anywhere I was afraid he wasn't.
I dont think Yoko Taro would let anyone touch nier without him being there tbh
The story is way better than Automata. The characters too.
It's a remaster of the japanese version of the first NieR, where you play as Brother Nier instead of Father Nier (meaning a younger main character than in the western version).
The gameplay was honestly fine, there’s a lot of hyperbole and exaggeration over how bad it was but it played like most other action games at the time and just didn’t do anything new.

Apparently the gameplay designer for Automata is consulting so it should receive some needed updates, though I wouldn’t expect much to change.
The level design is incredible, but the game is pretty guilty of reusing a lot of its locations. However, Automata is really no different in that regard and is arguably worse at it. Nier 1 is a much more beautiful and diverse looking world, with actual dungeons that are fun to traverse and have a lot of unique mechanics.

The problem is the combat and the sidequests. While boss fights are actually pretty well designed, better than Automata’s although less cinematic, the moment to moment combat is about as barebones as it gets and the movement is pretty wonky and early PS2 era feeling, which is by far the biggest upgrade from Replicant to Automata. 

Something that is good about Replicant is the weight behind your strikes, which is something that Automata really seems to lack. You press square and do the same four moves the whole game, but at least they feel pretty good to do. Same for the magic, which is exponentially better than the Pod Programs in Automata.

There’s a really solid base to work on there in the combat, it just needs some polish and bells and whistles. The gameplay director from Platinum who worked on Automata is involved in this, so that’s encouraging.
    Nier 1 really felt very ambitious and it definitely tried to make things interesting. Each dungeon feels like a much more significant tonal shift, and it even just played with camera angles in more interesting ways. Simply playing the game at the regular pace causes you to be vastly over leveled and ends up making those great bosses into feeling like regular enemies.  
Seems to be a series constant now that the game is terribly balanced, automata made the combat a lot smoother but the enemies were so easy you just button mashed
> Is this the first game?

Yes, if you ignore the fact NieR is a sequel to one of the endings of Drakengard.
    Which you can do pretty easily.

The connection to Drakengard is more of an interesting tie-in between two series. They exist on their own just fine.
If you don't want to have Nier spoiled for you, then it might be better to wait for the Remaster.
If you think a Father/Daughter story is more your preference, you can ahead and play the original. If a Brother/Sister story sounds more interesting then wait for the remaster. At the moment it seems to be that they're not going with the Father Nier story, but obviously that could change. 

Either way it may be worth waiting for more information about this Remaster.
> I thought this was going to be the Remaster of the 360 and ps3 game Nier?

It is, but there were two different versions of that game. And this is a remaster of the Japanese one.
Yes.
You have a few options. Drakenguard 1-3 and the two neir games are all in the same universe, and have some overlapping narrative. Automata can be played alone and still enjoyed, but you will get more out of some parts if you have played Neir and Drakengaurd. That said the gameplay for the older games can make them hard for people to get into, and they can be hard to track down, going all the way back to PS2. 

&#x200B;

If you are ok waiting some then I would say get this and Automata and play them back to back. Or you could get Neir on the PS3 and run through it, but it can be a bit pricey for a PS3 game, and a little hard to find, especially with Coronavirus affecting Amazon right now. Lastly, you could check out the youtuber Clemps, he has a very deatiled breakdown of the full series, and it will give you enough that you can jump into automata right now and not feel like you are missing out. Clemps humor can be a little much for some people, though I think he is hilarious, but if that does not bother you then he has a good 3 or 4 hours worth of breakdown.
    Thanks for the detailed write up!

I think I'm probably going to wait for this and play it first.
> or the androgynous anime character version.

That's the Replicant version, so unless they include both, that's the one we're getting this time.
    Gotcha. Didn't realize they named them like that. Thanks!
Young
I never finished the first one and played through all of Automata just fine.  It's really up to you.
Automata does spoil Nier quite a bit, so if you want to get the full impact of the story, it might be better to wait.
Holy shit really ? Do you have the source for that ?
    [Stream summary (In JP)](https://gamestalk.net/post-141918) One of the bullet points says their actors have a (brief) role and they finished recording it.
        This is absolute banger for fan like me ! Thanks a lot for sharing this.
            They might be Replicants of actual humans that later serve as the blueprint for YoRHa androids?
                I swear there was a data file that implied A2 was based on Kaine. And pretty much every android in YorHa was like the metaphorical children of her and since the robots were based on Emil from the aliens they were like his metaphorical kids.
        Holy fucking shit as somebody that loved Autonama and just figured I would never be able to play the original: I .freaking out rn
        Amazing thanks for sharing!
If they did some tiny changes to fuck with us id be so happy
    I mean its Yoko Taro I feel like theres a very strong chance of that happening
They also announced a mobile game, which appears to have a young Kaine on the site, so maybe additional tie-ins.
The original Japanese release consisted of Nier:Replicant (PS3) and Nier:Gestalt (360)

PS3 had young Nier we see here and 360 had papa neir, Gestalt was the only version ported to the west so he's the one most western fans would be more familiar with. I'm interested to see if papa Nier makes a comeback somehow or if they'll just do Replicant.
    I hope they do the older one. It worked well for the story having an ugly desperate father that barely handles weapons well do anything for his daughter. Plus it's probably Jamieson Price's best performance.
        I have a great fondness for the Nier we got and when this comes out I don't know if I'll be able to play the Japanese dub, the English voices are just so familiar especially Weiss! Though they seem to have rerecorded the Japanese dub so they may do the same for English. Hope they get the same team
            The English cast was stellar too, Laura Bailey, Liam O'Brien, Julie Ann Taylor, and Jamieson Price are some of my favourite VAs and they all did an amazing job in the original NieR.
                Normally I don't play anything in English dub but this game was an exception for sure! The direction was stellar for the English dub, a place where Automata fell down a bit. I really hope the original team comes back for this!
                    Really? I thought Automata was incredibly voiced. Eve's psychotic breakdown when Adam dies is bone chilling. Ray Chase, fresh off his regal performance in FFXV, sent shivers down my spine.
                        [This is a soap box so the reply is a little long soz]

I agree there I liked Eve's voice a LOT. I really love English 9S, too. Just before I say this, I'm fond Kira Buckland and her presence in the community, I think she did a great job. I just think the English localisation team represented 2B in a way that takes away from the subtlety of her character in the original.

What I disliked particularly was the direction they went with the translation of her lines and their delivery. Japanese 2B is often detached and professional, above all else, though she has moments where emotion shows through her professional facade. English 2B is sarcastic, harsh with 9S, and at times generically "sassy" in the way commanding women in (esp. sci-fi and post apocalyptic) fiction often are.  

An example is a kind of catchphrase 2B says a lot in the game. When 9S is complaining about something, JP2B says 文句を言わない/Monku wo iwanai Japanese often omits the subject so I took it as "(we) don't complain". She says it very matter-of-fact, calmly. It's their job to do what their told and not to complain, she's reminding 9S of something he's heard a million times over from her and others. But she actually likes that impulsive part of him so she's not really giving out.

ENG2B scolds him. I believe the line is either "stop complaining" or "stop whining", I don't recall which. It totally shuts him down and gets rid of the subtlety the original had. This is where it was super clear that this was the direction the translation and localising went.

Edit: oooo!! I mentioned this to a friend as I was writing this and someone made a YouTube video about what I'm trying to say!! Halfway in the video and I totally agree with what's said here! https://youtu.be/l1jotXNoO40
                            This might be a bit late, but I completely agree with you on what they did to 2B (Again, the script, writing, and localization, not the performance )

They did something very similar with Zero in Drakengard 3. Often times she was meant to come off as tired or lethargic, but she just seemed like an angry bitch most of the time, and It really detracted from what was supposed to be her character.
    Is there any difference between the two games outside of the character swap?
        The character himself has a slightly different personality. Brother Nier is a bit more gentle pre-timeskip and becomes nearly psychotic post-timeskip. Father Nier has a similar progression, but it's not nearly as jarring.
            [removed]
                Yeah even if the dialogue is exactly the same, the context of one protagonist being a seasoned older widower and the other being a inexperienced orphan teenager really makes their relationships with other characters feel a lot different. The subtext matters.
        Well, I played the English version so unfortunately I dont have first hand experience on this one but as far as I'm aware it's just the character change so that has an impact on the dialogue. I'll double check with the JP content though!

Edit: I didn't notice anything!! Kind of want to replay the game now though haha
            I only played the old man english version too
    [deleted]
        Wait, what part of that is false? The post you're responding to didn't assert it was the plan all along, just that two versions were ultimately released.
            Yes he just reiterated what the previous post said with more info.
        Edit: to be clear I was discussing what was release, not what Yoko Taro wanted.

Apologies, but Nier Gestalt and Replicant released on the same day in Japan and they were on two different consoles, this is very much true. At the end of this comment are some original promotional images of the Japanese release of Gestalt, showing Papa Nier.

Sorry if the translation is weird I did it hurriedly.

From Japanese wiki:

>『ニーア レプリカント』（NieR RepliCant）および『ニーア ゲシュタルト』（NieR Gestalt）は、2010年4月22日にスクウェア・エニックスから発売されたアクションRPG。

> "Nier Replicant" and "Nier Gestalt" are Action RPGs released by Square Enix on the 22nd of April 2010.

Edit2: since I'm translating things I'd like to add the blurb that Famitsu review gives for Nier Gestalt.

>黒文病にかかった娘のヨナを助けるために冒険する父親のニーアとなり、仲間と巨大なマモノと戦うのだ。プレイヤーの行動によって、エンディングが変化する。
>Playing as Nier, a father who sets out on an adventure to rescue his daughter Yona from the Black scrawl[illness], you team up with your allies to fight giant *mamono* [translated in-game as Shades]. According to the player's actions the ending will change.
        what I find most wild about this is that Pappa Neir was supposed to be "macho"
            He's fairly macho post-timeskip, but pre-timeskip he's just a down-on-his-luck dad whose desperate for money to care for his daughter. Poor dude is completely willing to throw away his pride and do anything to help her and is really empathetic to complete strangers.
        [deleted]
            The problem is it also messes up his dynamic with Kaine and Emil. And brother/sister is still believable for the main dynamic imo as someone with 4 sisters
    I thought Replicant was brought to the West? I could've sworn I remember it at Gamestop when it came out.
        Maybe I'm remembering the titles backwards but I'm pretty sure the one with young Nier didn't get localized. There's a fan translations project for it
            You're correct. Regardless of the name. The game devs felt that a western audience would find a "Father&Daughter" story more appealing than the "Brother&Sister" originally planned.
                I really liked the father/daughter story more than having it be brother and sister. It felt more realistic that a father would do absolutely anything to save his sick daughter. I'll be disappointed of we don't have that story available in the West.
                    We already do, that's the one that was originally ported.

Regardless, you can tell that the game was written for the brother story. The lines papa Nier has about friendship and Emil's crush on him make more sense if he's younger. There's also him aging up on the second half, which Gestalt replaced with... an eyepatch.

                            Well to each their own, haha. I feel the exact opposite way in every way, so I'm glad we're finally getting a translation for brother Nier.
                and they were right because it's *way* more compelling and I believe a father >!Dooming the entire human race!< for the sake of his daughter without question, but a brother doing it for his sister just seems like an illogical stretch. But I guess then you can't appeal to the weirdly prevalent siscon crowd.
Funny you say that considering there's two versions of the original Nier.
    The only difference is that in the Japanese only version you play as a brother while in the worldwide version you play as a dad.
Suddenly Mickey and Goofy stroll in
Is NieR Replicant any good? I have heard that previous NieR games before Automata are good in terms of story and music but have *reaaaally* rough gameplay.

I loved Automata and I am loving the continuation of its story in FF14 so I am excited to explore more of the NieR games, either way.
    So it's actually similar in a lot of ways to Automata conceptually in terms of gameplay. The problem is it's a lot rougher and the quality of life features just aren't there. Still, the story is pretty amazing. The second playthrough really turns everything on it's head, too.
        The second playthrough really made me change my worldview quite a bit.
            How so? I played Automata and have the gist of the story of Nier. I'm just curious how it changed you.
                not OP but imo it paints certain events into a bigger painting with much more context, much like automata. the point being that you never know how other people are feeling/why they act a certain way or do the things they do. in the it's easy to assume someone is evil/an asshole when you don't know the full story.
                    I thought that reveal during the second playthrough was a bit cheap. Everyone will keep attacking you first even if youre not fighting back, felt kinda unsatisfied when those wolves tried to kill me just because I was walking around and then theyre weeping "what did we do to deserve this ?" in the cutscenes later ...
                        i honestly didn't remember the details so i had to rewatch the cutscenes. what i seem to remember is that the wolves and humans from the village were under constant fight, so it might make sense that the wolves would attack any human on sight. but i'm not saying that nier was a flawless game, it definitely lacked in some departments.
                            Oh dont get me wrong I really liked Nier ... in a weirdly  confusing and depressing way lol

But that big emotional gut punch just wasnt as heavy as it could have been.
                    Sounds like it made you have more empathy for people. Which is awesome.
                It made me realize that the world isn't black and white, also made me question if what I do as a hero in a video game is actually ethical or if it's just ethical for the people I am doing it for. It awakened in me an interest in finding books/games/movies that cover similiar topics, where everything isn't black and white, but rather much like the real world, it is different shades of grey.
                    Ideally, you probably should have learned this in middle/high school through assigned reading. Good that you eventually picked up on this though.
                        and ideally, people should learn critical thinking in school which clearly many people don't. there are some things you just have to teach yourself. love you too btw :)
                            Agreed. I think this is a failing of public school systems. There is fantastic material that is assigned in American schools, for example, that focus on the duality of good & evil (Lord of the Flies, Of Mice & Men, To Kill A Mockingbird, a TON of Shakespeare), but the reality is many teachers themselves lack good understandings of the texts themselves that they fail to engage students whom, otherwise, the texts could really resonate with. Or yknow provide good life lessons.
                        German middle/high school reading is all about "nazis bad", we did do critical interpretations, but we always needed to qrite what the teacher wanted to hear if we wanted to get a good grade and when Nier first came out, I had graduated the year before and was still a die hard commie, extremists aren't exactly known for recognizing shades of grey.
                            I was speaking from an American perspective, so unsure of the German education system, but this doesn't sound that different. It really is a failing of schools and teachers who don't engage the students with the texts.
        I'm having flashbacks... Only different!
        To be fair though, some of Automata's "improvements" aren't really. Power leveling in Nier felt natural and word system didn't get in the way of things and items were separated out. Automata's leveling and chip system was needlessly convoluted and time consuming for the sake of being convoluted and time consuming. One upgrade though from Nier to Automata was fantastic.... the path to get a weapon upgraded with materials.  And I mean the physical path. Automata had sensible fast travel location to the blacksmith and the weapon shops. Nier... fk Nier. Fk those ladders. And fk the absolute rage (by the end of the multiple playthroughs) I felt every time I needed to go to the Brothers shop or that location in general. I swear by the end my neck was sore from all the times I swung my head back and groaned as I climbed those ladders. I kept screaming, "Why can't I just fast travel to that area?! How about just 1 ladder to climb after you clear it the first time?! Why is there not some kind of fn shortcut by hour 40?!"
    Depends.

It's worth noting that Automata was notable partially because it was basically the first Yoko taro game that didn't play like complete shit, but his other games do incredibly interesting stuff with regards to the story. So, if you're fine playing a janky piece of ass for a similar narrative experience, it's worth it. But it is *very* janky.
        I love me some proper japanese jank
            Imagine if Japanese Jank and EuroJank worked together. They'd be unstoppable.
                And also unplayable
                Gothic: Nier Jankima
                    Mount and Gothic: Nierlord
                    Kingdom Nier Deliverjank
                    Gothic <3
                The perfect meme game doesn't exist.
                To me, Dragons Dogma hits that spot. Love that game. It still holds up, but in a completely different way. Like in a junk way.
        To say Nier Gestalt/Replicant plays like "complete shit" is really going overboard. It's very barebones but it's not "bad". Especially not "complete shit"

Drakengard on the other hand, that did not age well at all.
        To be fair, Drakengard 3 only played like complete shit because it ran like ass too. I recently(-ish) emulated it and at a stable framerate it doesn't feel too different from Nier.
            Can you direct me to some info on how to emulate Drakengard 3? Last I checked it wasn't available on the main PS3 emulator (forgot the name).
                It is definitely playable on RPCS3 including all DLC. Maybe an update broke it because I haven't touched it for a year.
                Like the other poster said, it's emulatable on RPCS3 [with very little tweaking](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Drakengard_3). A bunch of (pretty much all?) Unreal Engine 3-based games are.
    Wait, does Automata story continues?
        Automata is a sequel to Replicant. During Route B if you found any "Project Gestalt reports" that's what they're referencing. Emil's character also carries over from there among with various other references.

EDIT: Sorry I didn't see you were referring to FF14.
            Pretty sure he's asking about the FF14 thing.
                Oh whoops, my bad. I have the same question now since I thought it was more a cameo thing.
                    It's not just a cameo, it's a full series of three raids and a plot line that act as a continuation of Automata's story (though to what degree, we don't quite know yet because only about a third of it is in the game right now). Raid 1 has two new bosses and two bosses that are familiar faces, though I won't spoil who they are. Raid 2 is dropping within the next two months and raid 3 will be six months after that.
        final fantasy 14 has a nier automata side story in it, which is tied into a yorha unit and a derelict factory. It's not finished yet so not clear how it sits in the timeline.
            Now I need to start FF14 on PS4
                Play an MMO for hundreds of hours for a side story? Go for it.
                    I mean it's ffxiv so he could just join boost to Shadowbringers, get carried through the end, then get carried through the raids...
                        You get carried through the 24-mans whether you like it or not when it's your first time anyway.
                I mean honestly ffxiv has a fantastic story, and a super generous free trial (any character can get every class up to level 35 as many tines as they want). Imo its worth giving a shot
    NieR's gameplay is passable IMO but it's much worse than Automata. You don't have a lock-on, you can't shoot the equivalent of the pod program and melee/move around at the same time (the game is designed around it but still), there's no real combo system, it only runs at 30FPS and on the whole isn't really a strong point of the game by any means.

The other big problem is you can tell how low budget the game is by the fact that it recycles a lot of content. It manages to do that surprisingly well but what really sucks is you have to play the second half of the game at least three times in total to see all the endings because there's no chapter select, AND you have to collect all the weapons to see the last two. It's fine for the second go-around since there's new cutscenes and dialogue (that's a lot more impactful than the early stuff you see in route B in Automata), but after you get the second ending the game is literally the same until the very end. I love the game and all but couldn't be assed to do that, so I just watched the endings on youtube after I did the second playthrough, which sucks because the last ending is a lot more meaningful if you get it yourself.

So it's a very flawed game but if you loved the story/music/atmosphere of Automata then those are all great here, and it's probably worth looking into this if you temper your expectations a bit regarding the gameplay. This remaster could also fix some of those issues, having a chapter select would already make a big difference.
    There's actually only one game, with different protaganist depending on your region, Gestalt and Replicant. Difference is that you either play the role of a brother or father. (Only the brother for the remake it seems)

Yes, they're janky and doesn't have very good combat and poor performance, but they're said to be some of the best games ever produced, despite all it's shortcomings.
        I hope we still get to play as the father, that ugly ass man was a refreshing change of pace to me back then so I look on him fondly.
            Plus outside of a few sparse moments, the father works better for the story. Some people would say its" more than a few sparse moments." I would say that they don't get it. His wife died and his daughter became ill. His whole world became taking care of his daughter. As a result, he isolated himself. "Social distancing." Its not like he did all these odd jobs to grab a beer with the bard. As a result, he became more socially awkward and forgot how to deal with people outside of his daughter as you would in that situation. Keeping that is mind, moments like "Yes.. you and I are friends now" makes more sense.

Weird thing is this kind of speaks more about Japan's view about parental relationships with their children. That the "father" was made to appeal to a western audience.
                > Weird thing is this kind of speaks more about Japan's view about parental relationships with their children. That the "father" was made to appeal to a western audience.

Weird thing is that this speaks more about western views about siblings relationship. That "brother" isn't appealing to a western audience.
                    Yeah, the doting brother is quite a popular trope in Japan that, according to many in this thread, doesn't seem to translate too well to a Western audience.
                        Yeah, I wonder why that happens honestly, because tons of people here would have siblings. And in a world where the only one who the character has is their sister, that's quite the story. That ghibli movie with the world war 2 with the kid and his sister is an example to me for this.
                            Grave of the Fireflies, fantastic movie. 
But yeah, it must be a cultural thing, but I'm struggling to associate it with a single held idea/belief. 

What I do find interesting though, is that in the West, older brothers are rarely portrayed as straight up caring and are usually either a bully or indifferent to the younger sibling's plight, until they're actually required to step up.
                        Wasn't one of the reasons why in games and anime/manga the protagonists are always young has to do with people reliving their lost youth thru them? Everyone knows the working culture in Japan is a beast of it's own. School life is also much more strict.

At least that's what i read about it ages ago.
            If they don’t have the father I have to wonder if it’s even worth playing vs. sticking to the proper version. I just can’t imagine the game without him.
        Wasn't it two games but the console version depended on who you played as? I recall the PS3 version being different than the 360 one.

Edit: it seems that the NA versions are both Father Nier, with the PS3 version being a port of the 360 version.
    The gameplay is simple and requires some grinding. Its very easy though- you just need to invest some time into the game and anyone can reach the credits.
        Getting true ending is abomination and you're straight lying. Grinding hours one location, to drop one item, which you need 3 to upgrade 1 of 20 weapons isn't "investing some time".



Hope they will cut that bullshit, because story, characters and music are top notch.
            Actually you only needed to \*obtain\* every weapon. Which for me brought the total playtime for the final endings to 30 -40 hours (normal people can probably do it a lot quicker).

Now getting the platinum trophy which requires ALL weapon upgrades IS pain. That brought my playtime up to 100 hours.
                That's better, I remembered I was gatekept at Junkyard by some quest, but can't find the one. Like this one: https://nier.fandom.com/wiki/The_Damaged_Map for untrained eye it looks like no hassle. But if you played, you know goats are made purely of meat. (I think I was farming machine oils, 1 hour for a not a single one, in a location where they should drop the most - highest concentration of flying robots)
                    I believe the quest you're thinking of is for repairing Iron Will, which you still need to do in Route B ("Don't we already have this weapon?" "shhh, these things happen the second time around") - which as far as I recall guarantees spawns for that item but it's still a pain to get. 

I think there's some other jank in the game as well where it tells you stuff drops from one enemy but it actually drops from another on the opposite side of an area or something silly like that.
                Took me 46 hours.

Not sure if it was worth it, but it's certainly a game I will remember. I really enjoyed the first 20 hours. The next were a bit repetitive, but I appreciated the storyline.
    In terms of story I preferred it to automata- gameplay isn't as bad as some people make out but defo way rougher. Cant wait for this.
    The gameplay is totally fine in Nier. 7/10 gameplay with 10/10 story, characters and music.

Now Drakengard on the other hand...
    Wait what? The continuation in FF14? please explain.
    There is only one Nier game before Automata. Gestalt and Replicant are literally the same game with the main character swapped from dad to big bro.

The gameplay is not that rough, it was perfectly fine, but they're almost certainly going to change it. This is not a remaster, it's actually going to be a new version of the game with significant changes.
I bet a new Yoko Taro project will be announced soon.
Lately? Hello mcfly!! Anyone home!!?? It's been going on since the last year of ps3 ffs. 

Hell I remember ps4 launch the amount of threads of people asking if they were ever going to make new games because all that was being put out was remasters.
Yes. While the gameplay is sort of clunky, the story and music is top notch.
Given how comprehensive Xenoblade Definitive Edition is and that we've only really seen art (par for the course for Nier), it might be bigger than we think.

I really hope the old voice cast comes back. Most of them are fairly high profile now, so I'm a little worried.
    Pretty sure they would only need to hire a new VA for young Nier. It's been a long while since I played it, but to my recollection the dialogue from the other characters avoided hard referencing any father/daughter relationship, so nothing on their end would need to be re-recorded.
    I would die for Liam O'Brien to come back as Weiss
        If I’m not hearing Liam and Laura Bailey this is going to be a pretty big disappointment, not gonna lie.
            They were both willing to reprise their roles in Catherine: Full Body last year, so I think there’s a good chance they’ll come back.
                That game keeping its entire cast was a bit of a surprise, considering Laura Bailey and Troy Baker hadn't done any work for non-Final Fantasy Japanese games for a few years before that and Atlus had already recast their Persona roles. I suppose it's because the majority of them had become high profile VAs after the original game's release though.
        One of my favorite tidbits about the game is that in the Japanese version Weiss is played by a guy going under the stage name Peter. I thought that was odd, and it turns out he played the court jester in Akira Kurosawa's Ran. The more you know. 

However Liam's English accent added wonderful charm to the character.
        This. I haven't played the original but have it running on a PS3 emulator, it's on my list of games to play. This update sounds like a great way to play it for the first time, and I can wait another year to play it. But, as a massive fan of Critical Role, if it doesn't have the voice work of Liam or Laura it would definitely not be an option for me, and would instead stick to the original.
    > Most of them are fairly high profile now

Unless they skimp on the budget, I don't really think that's been much of an issue for Square Enix; they're no stranger to getting high profile VAs.
        >Unless they skimp on the budget

Square Enix would never do that... not to a Nier project...
    Oh of course, but it depends on the remaster. As far as combat, it's not as normal for remasters to change them fundamentally, more on remakes.
    Assuming they don't add anything significant story wise, I don't see why they wouldn't just be using the original audio where applicable
        [removed]
            I wouldn't mind Japanese voice with English subs (like Yakuza series) tbh
                The English voice acting was amazing though. I wouldn’t want to miss my "WEISS YOU DUMBASS" every time I start up the game.
                    SPEAK THE TRUTH HUSSY
                Nah, Kaine is a character people need to experience in their native language. 


The first time you boot it up and hear [“Weiss you dumbass!”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvyvQfn30uE)Hits a lot differently than if you read it.
        They are adding new story elements. I know 2b is supposed to be in it in some way. Also they hinted at a new ending.
    there's a famitsu article above that has the announced cast

koji yusa and ai nonaka are reprising their roles as nier and yunah, and nobuhiko okamoto as boy nier
    Nier is pretty high profile now too though
They specifically said it isn't a remaster though. It's somewhere between a remaster and a remake.
I don't see the words remaster anywhere but the title OP gave it. Not in the video or on the website.
I'd hope for some quality of life and bug fixes too. The combat isn't too bad and of course the other stuff you didn't mention are fine!
He's probably working on the next story arc which will only be told and available through interpretive dance performances.
Huh, how you came to this conclusion? Yoko Taro is a freelancer since Cavia closed, he could work with any studio. lol
He's also working on the Automata crossover in FF14 at the moment, he stated recently he hasn't even written the ending for it so I think it's still in ongoing development.
Shouldn't he still be working on the NieR FF14 content? I know that he was and I doubt it's already finished.
    Second part of the raid came out in Feburary, which was supposed to be the last part afaik.
I think I prefer this game's music and writing to automata's. Automata has better gameplay though, by a longshot.
Well, Automata has much better and deep combat and also a much larger open world that has rewards for being explored. 

However, while not as good, I still genuinely enjoyed the combat in Gestalt and found it to be pretty fun for the most part, and the best thing about Gestalt is going to the really crazy locations throughout the story as well as the interactions between all of the characters. Having played Automata, there will be a few key plot points you’ll already know, but that wont hamper your enjoyment. 


It really just depends on what you like about Automata and if you have any questions ask me and I’ll answer
The story is almost as good. The combat is not as good, it's much less smooth and so on, but it still has its fun moments. Like Automata, the original Nier does cool stuff with switching up gameplay genres every now and then and still has its bullet hell and text adventure moments. Hopefully the combat will be a little better with the remake. Still an excellent game overall so I'm hoping more people get to play it.
The story is amazing.
Besides the other comments, an interesting thing that the original does is play around with the combat mechanics with each dungeon. One locks you onto a platform and focuses on the shooting. You also have the top down shmup (or similar) combat. A largely puzzle based dungeon. An isometric dungeon. A text-based "dungeon"

Not all of it is good, but it does a good job of staving off the monotony a clunkier combat system and replaying sections for the multiple playthroughs.
I do hope they fix things up like a *bit* at least. I'm excited to play it for the story but almost every recap video I watched before playing Automata the person would say "yeah the game play does NOT hold up" so it would be weird for them to not change it up a bit
    It’s not that it doesn’t hold up, it’s that it’s really, really basic. No lock on, only a light and heavy attack (I think?), no combos, the magic can be abused hardcore. It’s *okay* and worlds better than drakengards gameplay, but it doesn’t fly off the hand as easy as automata does.
        It was also *really* easy too. You could get a spear early on and just mindlessly mash your way to the end of the game.
    I mean, even when the game first came out, it got pretty mediocre reviews mostly saying the story was great and the game had cool ideas but the gameplay was clunky.  So even by the standards at the time the gameplay got criticized a lot, let alone compared to modern action games.
This is the first thing I thought up and commented in discord with some buddies when I saw this... the original nier was pretty clunky if youre coming automata. Thats honestly one of the reason I love both though. automata you're essentially a perfect android. You can do anything. While in the original, youre only human. feels a lot more human with the combat.
Well this comment made me disappointed. What is the gameplay like then?
> Full voice acting and reorchestration

That's kind of a bummer cause I find those parts of the first Nier to still be top notch (even better than Automata imo).
    I figure they would have to redo the VO since this is the Japanese version and not the one that original released in the US.
The thing is, the original Nier's combat is worse than that. There's no real combo system, no lock-on, you can't fire spells and attack at the same time, moving around and doing things is more awkward, it only runs in 30 FPS and overall is just far inferior to Automata.
    And during heavy combat the framerate dips into the single digits. At least on 360.
    [removed]
        I'm aware of that, I played the game briefly with the 60fps hack on RPCS3. If this remaster does not run at 60 that would be fairly disappointing given the original on an emulator can do so.
My point is that the first Nier's gameplay is on a sliding scale from somewhat to much worse comparatively. It doesn't really matter if Automata's standard is considered high, medium, or already low.
If you thought Automata’s gameplay was nothing special then just wait til you play the first Nier.
I'm sure most people when talking about the gameplay being different would be how it can change perspective and be doing different things that aren't usually expected out of a third person action game.

Normally it's just a third person action game, but sometimes it changes perspective and suddenly it's "sidescrolling". 

Or how it goes into a completely different gameplay mode when you are using the flight suits. And then even within that mode it can change perspective.

Pretty sure that is unique gameplay compared to every other "press dodge roll and then mash attack buttons" like you said.
It's a game that you love in spite of its glaring faults.
They're basically the same game but the main character is a palette swap between teenage boy in Replicant trying to help his sister, and a middle aged man in Gestalt trying to help his daughter. There's no actual changes to the story or dialogue otherwise and they play the same.
Yeah, his “we’re friends now” (or however it went specifically) to kaine is one of my favorite things. It’s super awkward and comes off as an old man having absolutely no idea what to say to talk this person down off the ledge.
WE ARE FRIENDS NOW
[deleted]
    The timeskip weapon options click with the adult Nier at the very least, because it comes off as him willing to kill anything in his path and his expanded arsenal reflects him needing bigger weapons after failing to defeat a bigger shade. The dialog however doesn't always mesh as you said.
    A lot of the strange script moments work for Father Nier as well, if you think of him as an awkward father who doesn't know much outside of protecting his daughter. I never saw a problem with his friendship speeches either, Kaine and Emil help him a lot to find his daughter despite the perilous situations, it makes sense he would feel a strong friendship with them, and his dialogue always depicted him as a bit awkward despite his age. 

The timeskip also isn't that aggregious either (except for the sudden ability to use two handed weapons). It still makes sense for Father Nier to undergo a change in personality because of the frustration/sobering feeling of going all those years with his daughter still missing. If you look at it in terms of a maturation of Nier, then Brother Nier works better. But if you view it as a shift in personality as a result of his circumstances, Father Nier fits the bill just fine.

It still has its awkward moments, but to say it's just a simple cut and paste is underselling the work the English scriptwriters did to make the change work in the grand scheme of the story. And like I said, these awkward moments don't take away from the broad story of protecting someone dear to you.
Trying to get "intended experiences" confirmations out of Taro is just silly, either way.

Yoko will turn joke endings into entirely new spinoff timelines, he's a madman. If he made a sequel out of Nier Automata it would probably be based off the ending where you eat a fish and die.
Maybe the game will feature both options? Although that would be a big load of voice work...

I am guessing that they will add Ending F to the game as well, in order to connect it to Automata.
Eh, I didn't find it that awkward. I know she's supposedly a teenager, but she literally never acts like one in the game. If the game told me she was 25 or so, I'd believe it.
And the fact that Emil is gay for him.
    Yeah but it's pretty easy to not pick up on that in the actual game.
The while game I thought of Kaine as a daughter figure for Papa Nier, the romance didn't work for me. Fucking love NieR Gestalt though so it's all good.
I agree but it depends on your culture. The whole reason father nier was added in the localized version was because the devs figured it would be easier for Western Audiences to relate to.

The game works with both versions though and it's a bit of a shame they couldn't have both in this release.
    They weren't wrong either. Big burly grizzled man was basically the meme character design for X360/PS3 action games. Still kind of is too with the sad dad games. These days more people seem more on board with more typical anime type designs
        It's actually confirmed that God of War was the inspiration for the gameplay in this game, which makes it funny in retrospect since Kratos would later become a sad dad himself.
            God of War 1-3 is literally about Kratos being a sad dad.
                Yeah but mad sad, not sad sad.
                    I think we can all agree that Kratos is a mad sad dad lad.
                [deleted]
                    No, they had a point. Kratos had already lost his daughter in the OT so he had no more reason to act like a dad. He was just rage incarnate and a bloodthirsty maniac by the third game. The stuff with Pandora was half baked at best. With Atreus, Kratos does have something to protect and starts acting like a father again in a very believable way.
    They have young nier in some side missions. “Gestalt”
Nier's story revolves more over Nier himself than Yonah's condition, Yonah serves as a primary motivator but the story quickly evolves beyond that centering on Nier & the tragic setting. Some examples, Nier dealing with both of his dear companions Kaine(a girl) and Emil(a boy) falling in love with him. All the messed up things a fragile young Nier had to do to survive. The day to day boylike/youngish manner Nier speaks with his companions. >!The ending where Nier more so rejects Yonah & prioritizes his own desires instead!< If you pay close attention to Nier's story Dad Nier as the MC really doesn't work.

At a casual glance the idea of Dad trying to save Daughter seems easier to justify than Brother saving Sister the problem is the story primarily explores Nier himself & so all the details of a desperate 16 year old brother dealing with a harsh apocalyptic world fall out of place when you copy paste in a 40~ year old man instead.

The only thing for me that is awkward for father nier and definitely fits brother nier more is that *one part* in the ending.
[Many people disagree with that view and think the Brother theme fits far better](https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/b8c8xl/should_i_play_nier_gestalt_or_replicant/ek096ng/) 

Please keep an open mind, I'm glad we're getting Yoko Taro's intended version rather than the one westerners got previously.
    Young protagonists are boring because every game ever has one.  I played both and enjoyed Father Nier so much more simply because it wasn't a dumb teenager yet again.

I always hate the fact that American companies think they should change other cultures to better fit their own, and for people to relate more. If people wanted an American game they would play an American game. Stop americanizing Japanese games. Especially frustrating as a European, because Europe doesn't have the same values on a lot of points that America has. Most notably the extreme casualization of extreme violence, while many other things are struck down on like lightning
    [deleted]
        Yeah, someone else told me this was actually not one of those cases. I do feel like it happens way too often though
    You're acting like Papa NieR was a bad thing. It wasn't. Jamieson Price's voice also nails the whole role.
Also, Japan isn't exactly free of doing that shit.
    It wasn't an american company who did that and they didn't americanizing the game. lol Two versions of Nier were made and released in Japan and then just one of them which was the one that would get more people into the game was localized.
        [deleted]
        Didn't know that. But my point still stands that alot of times japanese games are changed to "better capture Western audiences"
Not sure what you interpreted here but I said that because the name of the game is Nier Replicant instead of Nier Gestalt or Nier which would mean that Papa Nier isn't the focus.

And I mean, Gestalt was the one which people received so of course the majority will prefer him. And also because father and children stories get into people more than siblings.

But uh, while I can see your point, Gestalt pretty much makes Nier and Emil/Kaine with a weird relationship.
    >But uh, while I can see your point, Gestalt pretty much makes Nier and Emil/Kaine with a weird relationship.

Yeah, it's definitely got some weird parts.  I personally prefer Papa Nier because the story of a father fighting to save his daughter is much more emotionally resonant to me, but I really wish it had gotten some dialogue edits to make things a lot less....bizarre in spots.  And I understand that it was basically a marketing move and nothing more, so I get why it's not coming back.
A loose sequel, I’d add. The ties between Gestalt/Replicant and Automata are really fantastic for fans of the series, but ultimately not needed to enjoy the story of Automata.
    It may be a "loose sequel" but it's the extensive backstory for Emil who was one of he most significant side characters in Automata, which I expect will be a point of interest for many.
During Nier: Automata I remember some tunes that Emil was humming or that were playing.  There's the 'fight' version and the version you get when you go this (?) bunker.   It looks like lots of the music is based on music from these originals. 

Which prequel is the Emil bit from, or at least the original Emil story from, is it this Nier Replicant?
    Yes, Emil is a major character in the original Nier.
    Emil is from Replicant. [Clemps has an entire series explaining the Nier storyline.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__q_Nx9WbgY&list=PLI1L9JVl6TFdwfvKUuebNp_zOAL5XXDT5)
        Just binge watched that entire series. Dude makes some excellent videos.

Thanks for the link.
    Emil's origin is in Nier Replicant/Gestalt.
He's a major character in the first game.
    He is from gestalt/replicant because they are the same game but with different protagonist, gestalt is daddy nier,  replicant is onii-chan nier so same story different tone. Gestalt is the west version and replicant was the Japanese version
        Gestalt was also released in Japan as an Xbox 360 exclusive, while Replicant was only on PS3.
    >Which prequel is the Emil bit from, or at least the original Emil story from, is it this Nier Replicant?

Yes, Emil is from Nier 1. (Replicant/Gestalt)
    > It looks like lots of the music is based on music from these originals.

Let's just say opening that damn tower was either boring/gameplay or a tear-jerker of a scene, full of symbols and sentiments.
    My GF had me play these back to back, with Nier first, and I did nothing but complain about Emil but I loved him. You should have heard me "OMG EMIL!" When he showed up in Automata
    Emil is from the original Nier, and if you felt Devola and Popola kind of showed up out of nowhere and got kind of an out-of-place final moment for how little they'd been involved so far, that's because they're from the original Nier too... kinda.
Speaking of Drakengard, was the last one any good? I've only played Drakengard 2 and I enjoyed it. Although I don't think I'll enjoy it if I play it today so if the latest one is the same I might skip on it.
    Only if you emulate. It was made by deadly premonition studio, and it works in literal 3FPS. And the game of course is trademark Drakengard zero budget zero content giant playtime quality.
    it was more batshit insane stuff ala Drakengard 1 so if that's up your alley, sure
    By the last one do you mean Drakengard 3? Don't expect the combat to be as smooth as Nier Automata and in terms of continuity it's like a distant prequel to Drakengard 1 which is in a parallel world whose events ended up spilling over onto the parallel world of OTL Earth which then became the Nier world.

But for what it's worth I enjoyed it. The story is like a black comedy - the subject matter is very dark and all the characters have been through terrible trauma. But the characters are all pretty badass and they joke about it a lot. The story isn't as good as Nier Automata but still very good compared to most games. Especially if you read the prequel novel (at least the chapter on Zero) to get a sense of the backstory, then play the game, and then play the DLC. Each DLC is a sidestory that lets you play as one of the villains and learn more about their characters. Quite a bit of good character development and plot in the game, and while it's story is very nontraditional, it has a lot of Yoko Taro's charm.
iirc, Yoko Taro says he prefers Father Nier, though idk if that's the canon version. The script is definitely (imo) written for Brother Nier, though.
    iirc, yoko taro's original vision of the story was of brother nier, but he liked the idea of father nier so much that he considered them equal at the time. Not sure about that now, especially given this remaster being just replicant.
        (He could also very much have been pretending, because marketing.)
            thats true. It feels a *little* out of character for Taro to fake for marketing purposes, but it is a definite possibility
                That's the genius behind constantly being a weirdo... You can never tell when they're being genuinely weird or just playing it up 🤔
                What was he going to say? "You westerners won't be getting the true version, because we thought that westerners will like a bulky daddy character more than a teenager (which was true), so you won't get the canon version that was meant to be. Sorry."
[deleted]
    I doubt this will happen considering we saw absolutely nothing and only Nier brother appeared but we'll see later on how this will go.
are we going to approach kingdom hearts level of titles?
    Think we surpassed it
So ending D it is.
Stop pounding me!
    Drunk Weiss towards the end is amazing


Also the way he says “Hussy” is just *chefs kiss*
The voice acting between papa nier and weiss was 80% of my enjoyment of that game without it i think ill pass
The voice acting is the biggest thing I want more information on. I love the English voice work in Nier, it'd be so disappointing if it's redone with a different cast, or just redone at all and isn't as good.
    Laura Bailey fucking kills it as Kaine and [i really hope they don't re-record this line, because it's one of my favourite pieces of voice acting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvyvQfn30uE)
        Oh man, that’s fantastic - I agree, that’s some of the best voice acting I’ve heard in a long time. I loved Automata, but never played the original - here’s hoping they don’t change too much.
        Nier had Laura Bailey AND Liam O'Brien? At this rate they might as well go the whole hog with Critical Role VAs and have Mercer voice the protag
Liam' o brien. Hes also in critical role
I mean, he sounds a bit too much like Illidan in the game, but I think that just makes it better.
I really hope they get the original cast they were all great picks
Only difference is papa Nier vs brother Nier.
    [deleted]
        Older MC appealed more to western audiences than a bishounen MC really, it came out around 09. BrotherNier is the canonical one.

Some people think dadNier works better whilst others say broNier is better, and then some say the Father/Daughter works better while companion relationships work better with a younger character.
            [deleted]
                There are lore reasons, replicant vs gestalt. Going more into it is spoiler territory. You should play it, phenomenal story.
        Brother nier is the original japanese version, but they thought the whole "Onii-chan!" Extremely loving siblings thing wouldnt work in the west so they made him older, and changed him into her father.

Its not a character select because its basically a localization change.
        As far as I know, it was originally written as a story about a brother and a sister, but someone (Yoko Taro I guess?) thought it would connect with western audiences more if it was about father/daughter instead. Gestalt is the western version.
Pretty much the same, except the character you're playing in Replicant is a young teenage boy saving his sister Yonah, but in Gestalt you're an old man trying to save his daughter Yonah.

If you still have access to the Gestalt one, you can still continue playing it, it's exactly the same casts and story, just different age for the protagonist is all.
    Why was the game made that way?
        Long story short: appeal to a Western audience
        While the game was originally made with Replicant version (the teenage protag. version) in mind, they decided to make Nier older when localizing to the west as they thought it would draw in more western audience and boost sales, since most western games feature older, gruffier main character (e.g. Gears of War, Max Payne, etc.)

Which... actually works, believe it or not. While the design of teenage Nier is more appealing to look at, a lot of people liked papa Nier because they feel that a father doing everything in his power to save his daughter is a much more compelling motivation than  a brother saving his sister. This is one of the many things that helped elevate Nier to become a cult classic in the western gaming audience.
            I mean... okay ? That sounds absurdly overkill. Making a whole alternate version of a game and redoing the entire script and dub of the main character for a somewhat risky marketing decision ? I find that a little insane.

Good thing it worked, though.
It's the same story but the protagonist is different, in one you're the typical JRPG teenager, in the other you're a father, in general if doesn't matter much but you can easily tell the story was written for the teen Nier because some scenes are just... weird for an adult
The game is literally the exact same minus brother Nier being a different character and some dialogue to accomodate that. The most significant thing that really changes is more subtext than anything.
The hate that the western fanbase have with siblings stories and young characters is astonishing. Now it makes sense why Papa Nier existed, because westerns can't stand playing with young characters and sympathize with a story about siblings, while Japanese and asians prefer such stories.
I don't see it as caricaturical. It felt to me he was acting as father figure, reinforcing Kaine she has people who care about her. They were bunch of misfits and only a Father had a clear goal, which allows him "to lead" and take care of his friends, these lost younglings.


Yeah, the time skip was weird but we get cool mask with eyepatch.
I didn’t even know about the two versions when I played the game. I just made the insanely wild leap that he learned how to use more weapons during the time skip. And I’m the story he came off as an awkward, socially maladjusted person doing their best. That makes him fit in with the rest of the cast far more than the generic JRPG protagonist.
Oh I agree. But it serviced the story well so I was ok with it.
    Same. Repetitive, but satisfying.
It is definitely a confusing series. Don’t go in expecting everything to make sense, because it won’t. It is really amazing though story-wise.

Let’s get into Drakengard first. Drakengard is Nier’s parent series. In other words, Nier is a spinoff of the Drakengard franchise. I’d explain how, but that involves some pretty deep spoilers of the first Drakengard game.

Drakengard is a series that has a reputation for looking like an edgy gore fest on the surface, but then progressively get deeper and deeper when you make significant progress. Being part of the same series, it shares a lot of DNA with Nier, with Drakengard 3 being basically a Nier game, making a lot of references to Nier and explaining a lot of the weird phenomenons in both series. Unlike Nier, which takes place in the near future, the Drakengard games usually take place in a more archaic fantasy setting, where the main character will usually partner up with a dragon to achieve some sort of end.

Nier Gestalt and Nier Replicant are mostly the same game, however, there is one significant difference. Nier Gestalt stars the protagonist Nier as an older man, trying to find a cure for a disease for his afflicted daughter Yonah. Nier Replicant follows the same premise, except Nier is a young adult, where Yonah is his younger sister instead of his daughter. There are other minor differences, such as the endings, but the games are mostly the same otherwise. In Japan, Nier Replicant was released on PlayStation 3, and Nier Gestalf was released on Xbox 360. In the West, we never got Nier Replicant, because Square Enix felt as though a younger male protagonist wouldn’t catch on with a Western audience, so only Nier Gestalt was localized, released for both PS3 and Xbox 360, and renamed to just “Nier”.

The stories are mostly the same between the two, but Nier Automata specifically follows one of the endings of Nier Replicant, so we never even got that part of the story in the West. Nier Automata is the most recent and popular game ( and the best one gameplay-wise, no contest ) in the franchise, in a setting that takes place thousands of years after the events of Nier. Despite being a “Nier” game, Nier Automata is mostly completely unrelated to Nier Gestalt and Replicant; there are a few returning characters that play a minor role, but nothing that would require you to play the first game to understand. Otherwise, its connection to Nier and Drakengard is mostly down to minor references.
    Thank you so much for the in depth answer buddy, that cleared up so much confusion! I'm really excited for the remake! Is there a specific reason to the two Nier games' names? What is replicant and gestalt a reference to? Gestalt means shape/form in german, does that have anything to do with the game? I find the franchise very mysterious and unique to be honest!
Also I agree the combat doesn't exactly hold up relative to Automata. I hope they revamp that and at the very least add a lock-on system.
That would explain some of his weird scenes. "You and me are friends now!"
Then how were they different?
    A texture swap and a handful of lines changed because of that swap.
I don't even know. Rogue Corps originally was designed by Nobuya Nakazato. Who is the dude behind most contra games since 3.

So i don't know what really happened with this game.
Oh good, since I couldn't see his name anywhere I was afraid he wasn't.
Nier 1 really felt very ambitious and it definitely tried to make things interesting. Each dungeon feels like a much more significant tonal shift, and it even just played with camera angles in more interesting ways. Simply playing the game at the regular pace causes you to be vastly over leveled and ends up making those great bosses into feeling like regular enemies.  
Seems to be a series constant now that the game is terribly balanced, automata made the combat a lot smoother but the enemies were so easy you just button mashed
Which you can do pretty easily.

The connection to Drakengard is more of an interesting tie-in between two series. They exist on their own just fine.
Thanks for the detailed write up!

I think I'm probably going to wait for this and play it first.
Gotcha. Didn't realize they named them like that. Thanks!
[Stream summary (In JP)](https://gamestalk.net/post-141918) One of the bullet points says their actors have a (brief) role and they finished recording it.
    This is absolute banger for fan like me ! Thanks a lot for sharing this.
        They might be Replicants of actual humans that later serve as the blueprint for YoRHa androids?
            I swear there was a data file that implied A2 was based on Kaine. And pretty much every android in YorHa was like the metaphorical children of her and since the robots were based on Emil from the aliens they were like his metaphorical kids.
    Holy fucking shit as somebody that loved Autonama and just figured I would never be able to play the original: I .freaking out rn
    Amazing thanks for sharing!
I mean its Yoko Taro I feel like theres a very strong chance of that happening
I hope they do the older one. It worked well for the story having an ugly desperate father that barely handles weapons well do anything for his daughter. Plus it's probably Jamieson Price's best performance.
    I have a great fondness for the Nier we got and when this comes out I don't know if I'll be able to play the Japanese dub, the English voices are just so familiar especially Weiss! Though they seem to have rerecorded the Japanese dub so they may do the same for English. Hope they get the same team
        The English cast was stellar too, Laura Bailey, Liam O'Brien, Julie Ann Taylor, and Jamieson Price are some of my favourite VAs and they all did an amazing job in the original NieR.
            Normally I don't play anything in English dub but this game was an exception for sure! The direction was stellar for the English dub, a place where Automata fell down a bit. I really hope the original team comes back for this!
                Really? I thought Automata was incredibly voiced. Eve's psychotic breakdown when Adam dies is bone chilling. Ray Chase, fresh off his regal performance in FFXV, sent shivers down my spine.
                    [This is a soap box so the reply is a little long soz]

I agree there I liked Eve's voice a LOT. I really love English 9S, too. Just before I say this, I'm fond Kira Buckland and her presence in the community, I think she did a great job. I just think the English localisation team represented 2B in a way that takes away from the subtlety of her character in the original.

What I disliked particularly was the direction they went with the translation of her lines and their delivery. Japanese 2B is often detached and professional, above all else, though she has moments where emotion shows through her professional facade. English 2B is sarcastic, harsh with 9S, and at times generically "sassy" in the way commanding women in (esp. sci-fi and post apocalyptic) fiction often are.  

An example is a kind of catchphrase 2B says a lot in the game. When 9S is complaining about something, JP2B says 文句を言わない/Monku wo iwanai Japanese often omits the subject so I took it as "(we) don't complain". She says it very matter-of-fact, calmly. It's their job to do what their told and not to complain, she's reminding 9S of something he's heard a million times over from her and others. But she actually likes that impulsive part of him so she's not really giving out.

ENG2B scolds him. I believe the line is either "stop complaining" or "stop whining", I don't recall which. It totally shuts him down and gets rid of the subtlety the original had. This is where it was super clear that this was the direction the translation and localising went.

Edit: oooo!! I mentioned this to a friend as I was writing this and someone made a YouTube video about what I'm trying to say!! Halfway in the video and I totally agree with what's said here! https://youtu.be/l1jotXNoO40
                        This might be a bit late, but I completely agree with you on what they did to 2B (Again, the script, writing, and localization, not the performance )

They did something very similar with Zero in Drakengard 3. Often times she was meant to come off as tired or lethargic, but she just seemed like an angry bitch most of the time, and It really detracted from what was supposed to be her character.
Is there any difference between the two games outside of the character swap?
    The character himself has a slightly different personality. Brother Nier is a bit more gentle pre-timeskip and becomes nearly psychotic post-timeskip. Father Nier has a similar progression, but it's not nearly as jarring.
        [removed]
            Yeah even if the dialogue is exactly the same, the context of one protagonist being a seasoned older widower and the other being a inexperienced orphan teenager really makes their relationships with other characters feel a lot different. The subtext matters.
    Well, I played the English version so unfortunately I dont have first hand experience on this one but as far as I'm aware it's just the character change so that has an impact on the dialogue. I'll double check with the JP content though!

Edit: I didn't notice anything!! Kind of want to replay the game now though haha
        I only played the old man english version too
[deleted]
    Wait, what part of that is false? The post you're responding to didn't assert it was the plan all along, just that two versions were ultimately released.
        Yes he just reiterated what the previous post said with more info.
    Edit: to be clear I was discussing what was release, not what Yoko Taro wanted.

Apologies, but Nier Gestalt and Replicant released on the same day in Japan and they were on two different consoles, this is very much true. At the end of this comment are some original promotional images of the Japanese release of Gestalt, showing Papa Nier.

Sorry if the translation is weird I did it hurriedly.

From Japanese wiki:

>『ニーア レプリカント』（NieR RepliCant）および『ニーア ゲシュタルト』（NieR Gestalt）は、2010年4月22日にスクウェア・エニックスから発売されたアクションRPG。

Edit2: since I'm translating things I'd like to add the blurb that Famitsu review gives for Nier Gestalt.

>黒文病にかかった娘のヨナを助けるために冒険する父親のニーアとなり、仲間と巨大なマモノと戦うのだ。プレイヤーの行動によって、エンディングが変化する。
>Playing as Nier, a father who sets out on an adventure to rescue his daughter Yona from the Black scrawl[illness], you team up with your allies to fight giant *mamono* [translated in-game as Shades]. According to the player's actions the ending will change.
    what I find most wild about this is that Pappa Neir was supposed to be "macho"
        He's fairly macho post-timeskip, but pre-timeskip he's just a down-on-his-luck dad whose desperate for money to care for his daughter. Poor dude is completely willing to throw away his pride and do anything to help her and is really empathetic to complete strangers.
    [deleted]
        The problem is it also messes up his dynamic with Kaine and Emil. And brother/sister is still believable for the main dynamic imo as someone with 4 sisters
I thought Replicant was brought to the West? I could've sworn I remember it at Gamestop when it came out.
    Maybe I'm remembering the titles backwards but I'm pretty sure the one with young Nier didn't get localized. There's a fan translations project for it
        You're correct. Regardless of the name. The game devs felt that a western audience would find a "Father&Daughter" story more appealing than the "Brother&Sister" originally planned.
            I really liked the father/daughter story more than having it be brother and sister. It felt more realistic that a father would do absolutely anything to save his sick daughter. I'll be disappointed of we don't have that story available in the West.
                We already do, that's the one that was originally ported.

Regardless, you can tell that the game was written for the brother story. The lines papa Nier has about friendship and Emil's crush on him make more sense if he's younger. There's also him aging up on the second half, which Gestalt replaced with... an eyepatch.
                    [deleted]
                        Well to each their own, haha. I feel the exact opposite way in every way, so I'm glad we're finally getting a translation for brother Nier.
            and they were right because it's *way* more compelling and I believe a father >!Dooming the entire human race!< for the sake of his daughter without question, but a brother doing it for his sister just seems like an illogical stretch. But I guess then you can't appeal to the weirdly prevalent siscon crowd.
The only difference is that in the Japanese only version you play as a brother while in the worldwide version you play as a dad.
So it's actually similar in a lot of ways to Automata conceptually in terms of gameplay. The problem is it's a lot rougher and the quality of life features just aren't there. Still, the story is pretty amazing. The second playthrough really turns everything on it's head, too.
    The second playthrough really made me change my worldview quite a bit.
        How so? I played Automata and have the gist of the story of Nier. I'm just curious how it changed you.
            not OP but imo it paints certain events into a bigger painting with much more context, much like automata. the point being that you never know how other people are feeling/why they act a certain way or do the things they do. in the it's easy to assume someone is evil/an asshole when you don't know the full story.
                I thought that reveal during the second playthrough was a bit cheap. Everyone will keep attacking you first even if youre not fighting back, felt kinda unsatisfied when those wolves tried to kill me just because I was walking around and then theyre weeping "what did we do to deserve this ?" in the cutscenes later ...
                    i honestly didn't remember the details so i had to rewatch the cutscenes. what i seem to remember is that the wolves and humans from the village were under constant fight, so it might make sense that the wolves would attack any human on sight. but i'm not saying that nier was a flawless game, it definitely lacked in some departments.
                        Oh dont get me wrong I really liked Nier ... in a weirdly  confusing and depressing way lol

But that big emotional gut punch just wasnt as heavy as it could have been.
                Sounds like it made you have more empathy for people. Which is awesome.
            It made me realize that the world isn't black and white, also made me question if what I do as a hero in a video game is actually ethical or if it's just ethical for the people I am doing it for. It awakened in me an interest in finding books/games/movies that cover similiar topics, where everything isn't black and white, but rather much like the real world, it is different shades of grey.
                Ideally, you probably should have learned this in middle/high school through assigned reading. Good that you eventually picked up on this though.
                    and ideally, people should learn critical thinking in school which clearly many people don't. there are some things you just have to teach yourself. love you too btw :)
                        Agreed. I think this is a failing of public school systems. There is fantastic material that is assigned in American schools, for example, that focus on the duality of good & evil (Lord of the Flies, Of Mice & Men, To Kill A Mockingbird, a TON of Shakespeare), but the reality is many teachers themselves lack good understandings of the texts themselves that they fail to engage students whom, otherwise, the texts could really resonate with. Or yknow provide good life lessons.
                    German middle/high school reading is all about "nazis bad", we did do critical interpretations, but we always needed to qrite what the teacher wanted to hear if we wanted to get a good grade and when Nier first came out, I had graduated the year before and was still a die hard commie, extremists aren't exactly known for recognizing shades of grey.
                        I was speaking from an American perspective, so unsure of the German education system, but this doesn't sound that different. It really is a failing of schools and teachers who don't engage the students with the texts.
    I'm having flashbacks... Only different!
    To be fair though, some of Automata's "improvements" aren't really. Power leveling in Nier felt natural and word system didn't get in the way of things and items were separated out. Automata's leveling and chip system was needlessly convoluted and time consuming for the sake of being convoluted and time consuming. One upgrade though from Nier to Automata was fantastic.... the path to get a weapon upgraded with materials.  And I mean the physical path. Automata had sensible fast travel location to the blacksmith and the weapon shops. Nier... fk Nier. Fk those ladders. And fk the absolute rage (by the end of the multiple playthroughs) I felt every time I needed to go to the Brothers shop or that location in general. I swear by the end my neck was sore from all the times I swung my head back and groaned as I climbed those ladders. I kept screaming, "Why can't I just fast travel to that area?! How about just 1 ladder to climb after you clear it the first time?! Why is there not some kind of fn shortcut by hour 40?!"
Depends.

It's worth noting that Automata was notable partially because it was basically the first Yoko taro game that didn't play like complete shit, but his other games do incredibly interesting stuff with regards to the story. So, if you're fine playing a janky piece of ass for a similar narrative experience, it's worth it. But it is *very* janky.
    I love me some proper japanese jank
        Imagine if Japanese Jank and EuroJank worked together. They'd be unstoppable.
            And also unplayable
            Gothic: Nier Jankima
                Mount and Gothic: Nierlord
                Kingdom Nier Deliverjank
                Gothic <3
            The perfect meme game doesn't exist.
            To me, Dragons Dogma hits that spot. Love that game. It still holds up, but in a completely different way. Like in a junk way.
    To say Nier Gestalt/Replicant plays like "complete shit" is really going overboard. It's very barebones but it's not "bad". Especially not "complete shit"

Drakengard on the other hand, that did not age well at all.
    To be fair, Drakengard 3 only played like complete shit because it ran like ass too. I recently(-ish) emulated it and at a stable framerate it doesn't feel too different from Nier.
        Can you direct me to some info on how to emulate Drakengard 3? Last I checked it wasn't available on the main PS3 emulator (forgot the name).
            It is definitely playable on RPCS3 including all DLC. Maybe an update broke it because I haven't touched it for a year.
            Like the other poster said, it's emulatable on RPCS3 [with very little tweaking](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Drakengard_3). A bunch of (pretty much all?) Unreal Engine 3-based games are.
Wait, does Automata story continues?
    Automata is a sequel to Replicant. During Route B if you found any "Project Gestalt reports" that's what they're referencing. Emil's character also carries over from there among with various other references.

EDIT: Sorry I didn't see you were referring to FF14.
        Pretty sure he's asking about the FF14 thing.
            Oh whoops, my bad. I have the same question now since I thought it was more a cameo thing.
                It's not just a cameo, it's a full series of three raids and a plot line that act as a continuation of Automata's story (though to what degree, we don't quite know yet because only about a third of it is in the game right now). Raid 1 has two new bosses and two bosses that are familiar faces, though I won't spoil who they are. Raid 2 is dropping within the next two months and raid 3 will be six months after that.
    final fantasy 14 has a nier automata side story in it, which is tied into a yorha unit and a derelict factory. It's not finished yet so not clear how it sits in the timeline.
        Now I need to start FF14 on PS4
            Play an MMO for hundreds of hours for a side story? Go for it.
                I mean it's ffxiv so he could just join boost to Shadowbringers, get carried through the end, then get carried through the raids...
                    You get carried through the 24-mans whether you like it or not when it's your first time anyway.
            I mean honestly ffxiv has a fantastic story, and a super generous free trial (any character can get every class up to level 35 as many tines as they want). Imo its worth giving a shot
NieR's gameplay is passable IMO but it's much worse than Automata. You don't have a lock-on, you can't shoot the equivalent of the pod program and melee/move around at the same time (the game is designed around it but still), there's no real combo system, it only runs at 30FPS and on the whole isn't really a strong point of the game by any means.

The other big problem is you can tell how low budget the game is by the fact that it recycles a lot of content. It manages to do that surprisingly well but what really sucks is you have to play the second half of the game at least three times in total to see all the endings because there's no chapter select, AND you have to collect all the weapons to see the last two. It's fine for the second go-around since there's new cutscenes and dialogue (that's a lot more impactful than the early stuff you see in route B in Automata), but after you get the second ending the game is literally the same until the very end. I love the game and all but couldn't be assed to do that, so I just watched the endings on youtube after I did the second playthrough, which sucks because the last ending is a lot more meaningful if you get it yourself.

So it's a very flawed game but if you loved the story/music/atmosphere of Automata then those are all great here, and it's probably worth looking into this if you temper your expectations a bit regarding the gameplay. This remaster could also fix some of those issues, having a chapter select would already make a big difference.
There's actually only one game, with different protaganist depending on your region, Gestalt and Replicant. Difference is that you either play the role of a brother or father. (Only the brother for the remake it seems)

Yes, they're janky and doesn't have very good combat and poor performance, but they're said to be some of the best games ever produced, despite all it's shortcomings.
    I hope we still get to play as the father, that ugly ass man was a refreshing change of pace to me back then so I look on him fondly.
        Plus outside of a few sparse moments, the father works better for the story. Some people would say its" more than a few sparse moments." I would say that they don't get it. His wife died and his daughter became ill. His whole world became taking care of his daughter. As a result, he isolated himself. "Social distancing." Its not like he did all these odd jobs to grab a beer with the bard. As a result, he became more socially awkward and forgot how to deal with people outside of his daughter as you would in that situation. Keeping that is mind, moments like "Yes.. you and I are friends now" makes more sense.

Weird thing is this kind of speaks more about Japan's view about parental relationships with their children. That the "father" was made to appeal to a western audience.
            > Weird thing is this kind of speaks more about Japan's view about parental relationships with their children. That the "father" was made to appeal to a western audience.

Weird thing is that this speaks more about western views about siblings relationship. That "brother" isn't appealing to a western audience.
                Yeah, the doting brother is quite a popular trope in Japan that, according to many in this thread, doesn't seem to translate too well to a Western audience.
                    Yeah, I wonder why that happens honestly, because tons of people here would have siblings. And in a world where the only one who the character has is their sister, that's quite the story. That ghibli movie with the world war 2 with the kid and his sister is an example to me for this.
                        Grave of the Fireflies, fantastic movie. 
But yeah, it must be a cultural thing, but I'm struggling to associate it with a single held idea/belief. 

What I do find interesting though, is that in the West, older brothers are rarely portrayed as straight up caring and are usually either a bully or indifferent to the younger sibling's plight, until they're actually required to step up.
                    Wasn't one of the reasons why in games and anime/manga the protagonists are always young has to do with people reliving their lost youth thru them? Everyone knows the working culture in Japan is a beast of it's own. School life is also much more strict.

At least that's what i read about it ages ago.
        If they don’t have the father I have to wonder if it’s even worth playing vs. sticking to the proper version. I just can’t imagine the game without him.
    Wasn't it two games but the console version depended on who you played as? I recall the PS3 version being different than the 360 one.

Edit: it seems that the NA versions are both Father Nier, with the PS3 version being a port of the 360 version.
The gameplay is simple and requires some grinding. Its very easy though- you just need to invest some time into the game and anyone can reach the credits.
    Getting true ending is abomination and you're straight lying. Grinding hours one location, to drop one item, which you need 3 to upgrade 1 of 20 weapons isn't "investing some time".



Hope they will cut that bullshit, because story, characters and music are top notch.
        Actually you only needed to \*obtain\* every weapon. Which for me brought the total playtime for the final endings to 30 -40 hours (normal people can probably do it a lot quicker).

Now getting the platinum trophy which requires ALL weapon upgrades IS pain. That brought my playtime up to 100 hours.
            That's better, I remembered I was gatekept at Junkyard by some quest, but can't find the one. Like this one: https://nier.fandom.com/wiki/The_Damaged_Map for untrained eye it looks like no hassle. But if you played, you know goats are made purely of meat. (I think I was farming machine oils, 1 hour for a not a single one, in a location where they should drop the most - highest concentration of flying robots)
                I believe the quest you're thinking of is for repairing Iron Will, which you still need to do in Route B ("Don't we already have this weapon?" "shhh, these things happen the second time around") - which as far as I recall guarantees spawns for that item but it's still a pain to get. 

I think there's some other jank in the game as well where it tells you stuff drops from one enemy but it actually drops from another on the opposite side of an area or something silly like that.
            Took me 46 hours.

Not sure if it was worth it, but it's certainly a game I will remember. I really enjoyed the first 20 hours. The next were a bit repetitive, but I appreciated the storyline.
In terms of story I preferred it to automata- gameplay isn't as bad as some people make out but defo way rougher. Cant wait for this.
The gameplay is totally fine in Nier. 7/10 gameplay with 10/10 story, characters and music.

Now Drakengard on the other hand...
Wait what? The continuation in FF14? please explain.
There is only one Nier game before Automata. Gestalt and Replicant are literally the same game with the main character swapped from dad to big bro.

The gameplay is not that rough, it was perfectly fine, but they're almost certainly going to change it. This is not a remaster, it's actually going to be a new version of the game with significant changes.
Pretty sure they would only need to hire a new VA for young Nier. It's been a long while since I played it, but to my recollection the dialogue from the other characters avoided hard referencing any father/daughter relationship, so nothing on their end would need to be re-recorded.
I would die for Liam O'Brien to come back as Weiss
    If I’m not hearing Liam and Laura Bailey this is going to be a pretty big disappointment, not gonna lie.
        They were both willing to reprise their roles in Catherine: Full Body last year, so I think there’s a good chance they’ll come back.
            That game keeping its entire cast was a bit of a surprise, considering Laura Bailey and Troy Baker hadn't done any work for non-Final Fantasy Japanese games for a few years before that and Atlus had already recast their Persona roles. I suppose it's because the majority of them had become high profile VAs after the original game's release though.
    One of my favorite tidbits about the game is that in the Japanese version Weiss is played by a guy going under the stage name Peter. I thought that was odd, and it turns out he played the court jester in Akira Kurosawa's Ran. The more you know. 

However Liam's English accent added wonderful charm to the character.
    This. I haven't played the original but have it running on a PS3 emulator, it's on my list of games to play. This update sounds like a great way to play it for the first time, and I can wait another year to play it. But, as a massive fan of Critical Role, if it doesn't have the voice work of Liam or Laura it would definitely not be an option for me, and would instead stick to the original.
> Most of them are fairly high profile now

Unless they skimp on the budget, I don't really think that's been much of an issue for Square Enix; they're no stranger to getting high profile VAs.
    >Unless they skimp on the budget

Square Enix would never do that... not to a Nier project...
Oh of course, but it depends on the remaster. As far as combat, it's not as normal for remasters to change them fundamentally, more on remakes.
Assuming they don't add anything significant story wise, I don't see why they wouldn't just be using the original audio where applicable
    [removed]
        I wouldn't mind Japanese voice with English subs (like Yakuza series) tbh
            The English voice acting was amazing though. I wouldn’t want to miss my "WEISS YOU DUMBASS" every time I start up the game.
                SPEAK THE TRUTH HUSSY
            Nah, Kaine is a character people need to experience in their native language. 


The first time you boot it up and hear [“Weiss you dumbass!”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvyvQfn30uE)Hits a lot differently than if you read it.
    They are adding new story elements. I know 2b is supposed to be in it in some way. Also they hinted at a new ending.
there's a famitsu article above that has the announced cast

koji yusa and ai nonaka are reprising their roles as nier and yunah, and nobuhiko okamoto as boy nier
Nier is pretty high profile now too though
Second part of the raid came out in Feburary, which was supposed to be the last part afaik.
It’s not that it doesn’t hold up, it’s that it’s really, really basic. No lock on, only a light and heavy attack (I think?), no combos, the magic can be abused hardcore. It’s *okay* and worlds better than drakengards gameplay, but it doesn’t fly off the hand as easy as automata does.
    It was also *really* easy too. You could get a spear early on and just mindlessly mash your way to the end of the game.
I mean, even when the game first came out, it got pretty mediocre reviews mostly saying the story was great and the game had cool ideas but the gameplay was clunky.  So even by the standards at the time the gameplay got criticized a lot, let alone compared to modern action games.
I figure they would have to redo the VO since this is the Japanese version and not the one that original released in the US.
And during heavy combat the framerate dips into the single digits. At least on 360.
[removed]
    I'm aware of that, I played the game briefly with the 60fps hack on RPCS3. If this remaster does not run at 60 that would be fairly disappointing given the original on an emulator can do so.
The timeskip weapon options click with the adult Nier at the very least, because it comes off as him willing to kill anything in his path and his expanded arsenal reflects him needing bigger weapons after failing to defeat a bigger shade. The dialog however doesn't always mesh as you said.
A lot of the strange script moments work for Father Nier as well, if you think of him as an awkward father who doesn't know much outside of protecting his daughter. I never saw a problem with his friendship speeches either, Kaine and Emil help him a lot to find his daughter despite the perilous situations, it makes sense he would feel a strong friendship with them, and his dialogue always depicted him as a bit awkward despite his age. 

The timeskip also isn't that aggregious either (except for the sudden ability to use two handed weapons). It still makes sense for Father Nier to undergo a change in personality because of the frustration/sobering feeling of going all those years with his daughter still missing. If you look at it in terms of a maturation of Nier, then Brother Nier works better. But if you view it as a shift in personality as a result of his circumstances, Father Nier fits the bill just fine.

It still has its awkward moments, but to say it's just a simple cut and paste is underselling the work the English scriptwriters did to make the change work in the grand scheme of the story. And like I said, these awkward moments don't take away from the broad story of protecting someone dear to you.
Yeah but it's pretty easy to not pick up on that in the actual game.
They weren't wrong either. Big burly grizzled man was basically the meme character design for X360/PS3 action games. Still kind of is too with the sad dad games. These days more people seem more on board with more typical anime type designs
    It's actually confirmed that God of War was the inspiration for the gameplay in this game, which makes it funny in retrospect since Kratos would later become a sad dad himself.
        God of War 1-3 is literally about Kratos being a sad dad.
            Yeah but mad sad, not sad sad.
                I think we can all agree that Kratos is a mad sad dad lad.
            [deleted]
                No, they had a point. Kratos had already lost his daughter in the OT so he had no more reason to act like a dad. He was just rage incarnate and a bloodthirsty maniac by the third game. The stuff with Pandora was half baked at best. With Atreus, Kratos does have something to protect and starts acting like a father again in a very believable way.
They have young nier in some side missions. “Gestalt”
Young protagonists are boring because every game ever has one.  I played both and enjoyed Father Nier so much more simply because it wasn't a dumb teenager yet again.
    [deleted]
[deleted]
    Yeah, someone else told me this was actually not one of those cases. I do feel like it happens way too often though
You're acting like Papa NieR was a bad thing. It wasn't. Jamieson Price's voice also nails the whole role.
Also, Japan isn't exactly free of doing that shit.
It wasn't an american company who did that and they didn't americanizing the game. lol Two versions of Nier were made and released in Japan and then just one of them which was the one that would get more people into the game was localized.
    [deleted]
    Didn't know that. But my point still stands that alot of times japanese games are changed to "better capture Western audiences"
>But uh, while I can see your point, Gestalt pretty much makes Nier and Emil/Kaine with a weird relationship.

Yeah, it's definitely got some weird parts.  I personally prefer Papa Nier because the story of a father fighting to save his daughter is much more emotionally resonant to me, but I really wish it had gotten some dialogue edits to make things a lot less....bizarre in spots.  And I understand that it was basically a marketing move and nothing more, so I get why it's not coming back.
It may be a "loose sequel" but it's the extensive backstory for Emil who was one of he most significant side characters in Automata, which I expect will be a point of interest for many.
Yes, Emil is a major character in the original Nier.
Emil is from Replicant. [Clemps has an entire series explaining the Nier storyline.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__q_Nx9WbgY&list=PLI1L9JVl6TFdwfvKUuebNp_zOAL5XXDT5)
    Just binge watched that entire series. Dude makes some excellent videos.

Thanks for the link.
Emil's origin is in Nier Replicant/Gestalt.
He's a major character in the first game.
He is from gestalt/replicant because they are the same game but with different protagonist, gestalt is daddy nier,  replicant is onii-chan nier so same story different tone. Gestalt is the west version and replicant was the Japanese version
    Gestalt was also released in Japan as an Xbox 360 exclusive, while Replicant was only on PS3.
>Which prequel is the Emil bit from, or at least the original Emil story from, is it this Nier Replicant?

Yes, Emil is from Nier 1. (Replicant/Gestalt)
> It looks like lots of the music is based on music from these originals.

Let's just say opening that damn tower was either boring/gameplay or a tear-jerker of a scene, full of symbols and sentiments.
My GF had me play these back to back, with Nier first, and I did nothing but complain about Emil but I loved him. You should have heard me "OMG EMIL!" When he showed up in Automata
Emil is from the original Nier, and if you felt Devola and Popola kind of showed up out of nowhere and got kind of an out-of-place final moment for how little they'd been involved so far, that's because they're from the original Nier too... kinda.
Only if you emulate. It was made by deadly premonition studio, and it works in literal 3FPS. And the game of course is trademark Drakengard zero budget zero content giant playtime quality.
it was more batshit insane stuff ala Drakengard 1 so if that's up your alley, sure
By the last one do you mean Drakengard 3? Don't expect the combat to be as smooth as Nier Automata and in terms of continuity it's like a distant prequel to Drakengard 1 which is in a parallel world whose events ended up spilling over onto the parallel world of OTL Earth which then became the Nier world.

But for what it's worth I enjoyed it. The story is like a black comedy - the subject matter is very dark and all the characters have been through terrible trauma. But the characters are all pretty badass and they joke about it a lot. The story isn't as good as Nier Automata but still very good compared to most games. Especially if you read the prequel novel (at least the chapter on Zero) to get a sense of the backstory, then play the game, and then play the DLC. Each DLC is a sidestory that lets you play as one of the villains and learn more about their characters. Quite a bit of good character development and plot in the game, and while it's story is very nontraditional, it has a lot of Yoko Taro's charm.
iirc, yoko taro's original vision of the story was of brother nier, but he liked the idea of father nier so much that he considered them equal at the time. Not sure about that now, especially given this remaster being just replicant.
    (He could also very much have been pretending, because marketing.)
        thats true. It feels a *little* out of character for Taro to fake for marketing purposes, but it is a definite possibility
            That's the genius behind constantly being a weirdo... You can never tell when they're being genuinely weird or just playing it up 🤔
            What was he going to say? "You westerners won't be getting the true version, because we thought that westerners will like a bulky daddy character more than a teenager (which was true), so you won't get the canon version that was meant to be. Sorry."
I doubt this will happen considering we saw absolutely nothing and only Nier brother appeared but we'll see later on how this will go.
Think we surpassed it
Drunk Weiss towards the end is amazing


Also the way he says “Hussy” is just *chefs kiss*
Laura Bailey fucking kills it as Kaine and [i really hope they don't re-record this line, because it's one of my favourite pieces of voice acting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvyvQfn30uE)
    Oh man, that’s fantastic - I agree, that’s some of the best voice acting I’ve heard in a long time. I loved Automata, but never played the original - here’s hoping they don’t change too much.
    Nier had Laura Bailey AND Liam O'Brien? At this rate they might as well go the whole hog with Critical Role VAs and have Mercer voice the protag
[deleted]
    Older MC appealed more to western audiences than a bishounen MC really, it came out around 09. BrotherNier is the canonical one.

Some people think dadNier works better whilst others say broNier is better, and then some say the Father/Daughter works better while companion relationships work better with a younger character.
        [deleted]
            There are lore reasons, replicant vs gestalt. Going more into it is spoiler territory. You should play it, phenomenal story.
    Brother nier is the original japanese version, but they thought the whole "Onii-chan!" Extremely loving siblings thing wouldnt work in the west so they made him older, and changed him into her father.

Its not a character select because its basically a localization change.
    As far as I know, it was originally written as a story about a brother and a sister, but someone (Yoko Taro I guess?) thought it would connect with western audiences more if it was about father/daughter instead. Gestalt is the western version.
Why was the game made that way?
    Long story short: appeal to a Western audience
    While the game was originally made with Replicant version (the teenage protag. version) in mind, they decided to make Nier older when localizing to the west as they thought it would draw in more western audience and boost sales, since most western games feature older, gruffier main character (e.g. Gears of War, Max Payne, etc.)

Which... actually works, believe it or not. While the design of teenage Nier is more appealing to look at, a lot of people liked papa Nier because they feel that a father doing everything in his power to save his daughter is a much more compelling motivation than  a brother saving his sister. This is one of the many things that helped elevate Nier to become a cult classic in the western gaming audience.
        I mean... okay ? That sounds absurdly overkill. Making a whole alternate version of a game and redoing the entire script and dub of the main character for a somewhat risky marketing decision ? I find that a little insane.

Good thing it worked, though.
Same. Repetitive, but satisfying.
Thank you so much for the in depth answer buddy, that cleared up so much confusion! I'm really excited for the remake! Is there a specific reason to the two Nier games' names? What is replicant and gestalt a reference to? Gestalt means shape/form in german, does that have anything to do with the game? I find the franchise very mysterious and unique to be honest!
A texture swap and a handful of lines changed because of that swap.
This is absolute banger for fan like me ! Thanks a lot for sharing this.
    They might be Replicants of actual humans that later serve as the blueprint for YoRHa androids?
        I swear there was a data file that implied A2 was based on Kaine. And pretty much every android in YorHa was like the metaphorical children of her and since the robots were based on Emil from the aliens they were like his metaphorical kids.
Holy fucking shit as somebody that loved Autonama and just figured I would never be able to play the original: I .freaking out rn
Amazing thanks for sharing!
I have a great fondness for the Nier we got and when this comes out I don't know if I'll be able to play the Japanese dub, the English voices are just so familiar especially Weiss! Though they seem to have rerecorded the Japanese dub so they may do the same for English. Hope they get the same team
    The English cast was stellar too, Laura Bailey, Liam O'Brien, Julie Ann Taylor, and Jamieson Price are some of my favourite VAs and they all did an amazing job in the original NieR.
        Normally I don't play anything in English dub but this game was an exception for sure! The direction was stellar for the English dub, a place where Automata fell down a bit. I really hope the original team comes back for this!
            Really? I thought Automata was incredibly voiced. Eve's psychotic breakdown when Adam dies is bone chilling. Ray Chase, fresh off his regal performance in FFXV, sent shivers down my spine.
                [This is a soap box so the reply is a little long soz]

I agree there I liked Eve's voice a LOT. I really love English 9S, too. Just before I say this, I'm fond Kira Buckland and her presence in the community, I think she did a great job. I just think the English localisation team represented 2B in a way that takes away from the subtlety of her character in the original.

What I disliked particularly was the direction they went with the translation of her lines and their delivery. Japanese 2B is often detached and professional, above all else, though she has moments where emotion shows through her professional facade. English 2B is sarcastic, harsh with 9S, and at times generically "sassy" in the way commanding women in (esp. sci-fi and post apocalyptic) fiction often are.  

An example is a kind of catchphrase 2B says a lot in the game. When 9S is complaining about something, JP2B says 文句を言わない/Monku wo iwanai Japanese often omits the subject so I took it as "(we) don't complain". She says it very matter-of-fact, calmly. It's their job to do what their told and not to complain, she's reminding 9S of something he's heard a million times over from her and others. But she actually likes that impulsive part of him so she's not really giving out.

ENG2B scolds him. I believe the line is either "stop complaining" or "stop whining", I don't recall which. It totally shuts him down and gets rid of the subtlety the original had. This is where it was super clear that this was the direction the translation and localising went.

Edit: oooo!! I mentioned this to a friend as I was writing this and someone made a YouTube video about what I'm trying to say!! Halfway in the video and I totally agree with what's said here! https://youtu.be/l1jotXNoO40
                    This might be a bit late, but I completely agree with you on what they did to 2B (Again, the script, writing, and localization, not the performance )

They did something very similar with Zero in Drakengard 3. Often times she was meant to come off as tired or lethargic, but she just seemed like an angry bitch most of the time, and It really detracted from what was supposed to be her character.
The character himself has a slightly different personality. Brother Nier is a bit more gentle pre-timeskip and becomes nearly psychotic post-timeskip. Father Nier has a similar progression, but it's not nearly as jarring.

        Yeah even if the dialogue is exactly the same, the context of one protagonist being a seasoned older widower and the other being a inexperienced orphan teenager really makes their relationships with other characters feel a lot different. The subtext matters.
Well, I played the English version so unfortunately I dont have first hand experience on this one but as far as I'm aware it's just the character change so that has an impact on the dialogue. I'll double check with the JP content though!

Edit: I didn't notice anything!! Kind of want to replay the game now though haha
    I only played the old man english version too
Wait, what part of that is false? The post you're responding to didn't assert it was the plan all along, just that two versions were ultimately released.
    Yes he just reiterated what the previous post said with more info.
Edit: to be clear I was discussing what was release, not what Yoko Taro wanted.

Apologies, but Nier Gestalt and Replicant released on the same day in Japan and they were on two different consoles, this is very much true. At the end of this comment are some original promotional images of the Japanese release of Gestalt, showing Papa Nier.

Sorry if the translation is weird I did it hurriedly.

From Japanese wiki:

>『ニーア レプリカント』（NieR RepliCant）および『ニーア ゲシュタルト』（NieR Gestalt）は、2010年4月22日にスクウェア・エニックスから発売されたアクションRPG。

> "Nier Replicant" and "Nier Gestalt" are Action RPGs released by Square Enix on the 22nd of April 2010.

>『レプリカント』はプレイステーション3、『ゲシュタルト』はXbox 360でそれぞれ発売。海外ではPS3・Xbox 360の両機種ともに『ゲシュタルト』の内容で『NIER』のタイトルで販売している。

>They were released separately with "Replicant" on PlayStation 3 and "Gestalt" on 360. Overseas the PS3/360 the two variations were released with the contents of "Gestalt" under the title "NIER".

Edit2: since I'm translating things I'd like to add the blurb that Famitsu review gives for Nier Gestalt.

>黒文病にかかった娘のヨナを助けるために冒険する父親のニーアとなり、仲間と巨大なマモノと戦うのだ。プレイヤーの行動によって、エンディングが変化する。
>Playing as Nier, a father who sets out on an adventure to rescue his daughter Yona from the Black scrawl[illness], you team up with your allies to fight giant *mamono* [translated in-game as Shades]. According to the player's actions the ending will change.
what I find most wild about this is that Pappa Neir was supposed to be "macho"
    He's fairly macho post-timeskip, but pre-timeskip he's just a down-on-his-luck dad whose desperate for money to care for his daughter. Poor dude is completely willing to throw away his pride and do anything to help her and is really empathetic to complete strangers.
[deleted]
    The problem is it also messes up his dynamic with Kaine and Emil. And brother/sister is still believable for the main dynamic imo as someone with 4 sisters
Maybe I'm remembering the titles backwards but I'm pretty sure the one with young Nier didn't get localized. There's a fan translations project for it
    You're correct. Regardless of the name. The game devs felt that a western audience would find a "Father&Daughter" story more appealing than the "Brother&Sister" originally planned.
        I really liked the father/daughter story more than having it be brother and sister. It felt more realistic that a father would do absolutely anything to save his sick daughter. I'll be disappointed of we don't have that story available in the West.
            We already do, that's the one that was originally ported.

Regardless, you can tell that the game was written for the brother story. The lines papa Nier has about friendship and Emil's crush on him make more sense if he's younger. There's also him aging up on the second half, which Gestalt replaced with... an eyepatch.
                [deleted]
                    Well to each their own, haha. I feel the exact opposite way in every way, so I'm glad we're finally getting a translation for brother Nier.
        and they were right because it's *way* more compelling and I believe a father >!Dooming the entire human race!< for the sake of his daughter without question, but a brother doing it for his sister just seems like an illogical stretch. But I guess then you can't appeal to the weirdly prevalent siscon crowd.
The second playthrough really made me change my worldview quite a bit.
    How so? I played Automata and have the gist of the story of Nier. I'm just curious how it changed you.
        not OP but imo it paints certain events into a bigger painting with much more context, much like automata. the point being that you never know how other people are feeling/why they act a certain way or do the things they do. in the it's easy to assume someone is evil/an asshole when you don't know the full story.
            I thought that reveal during the second playthrough was a bit cheap. Everyone will keep attacking you first even if youre not fighting back, felt kinda unsatisfied when those wolves tried to kill me just because I was walking around and then theyre weeping "what did we do to deserve this ?" in the cutscenes later ...
                i honestly didn't remember the details so i had to rewatch the cutscenes. what i seem to remember is that the wolves and humans from the village were under constant fight, so it might make sense that the wolves would attack any human on sight. but i'm not saying that nier was a flawless game, it definitely lacked in some departments.
                    Oh dont get me wrong I really liked Nier ... in a weirdly  confusing and depressing way lol

But that big emotional gut punch just wasnt as heavy as it could have been.
            Sounds like it made you have more empathy for people. Which is awesome.
        It made me realize that the world isn't black and white, also made me question if what I do as a hero in a video game is actually ethical or if it's just ethical for the people I am doing it for. It awakened in me an interest in finding books/games/movies that cover similiar topics, where everything isn't black and white, but rather much like the real world, it is different shades of grey.
            Ideally, you probably should have learned this in middle/high school through assigned reading. Good that you eventually picked up on this though.
                and ideally, people should learn critical thinking in school which clearly many people don't. there are some things you just have to teach yourself. love you too btw :)
                    Agreed. I think this is a failing of public school systems. There is fantastic material that is assigned in American schools, for example, that focus on the duality of good & evil (Lord of the Flies, Of Mice & Men, To Kill A Mockingbird, a TON of Shakespeare), but the reality is many teachers themselves lack good understandings of the texts themselves that they fail to engage students whom, otherwise, the texts could really resonate with. Or yknow provide good life lessons.
                German middle/high school reading is all about "nazis bad", we did do critical interpretations, but we always needed to qrite what the teacher wanted to hear if we wanted to get a good grade and when Nier first came out, I had graduated the year before and was still a die hard commie, extremists aren't exactly known for recognizing shades of grey.
                    I was speaking from an American perspective, so unsure of the German education system, but this doesn't sound that different. It really is a failing of schools and teachers who don't engage the students with the texts.
I'm having flashbacks... Only different!
To be fair though, some of Automata's "improvements" aren't really. Power leveling in Nier felt natural and word system didn't get in the way of things and items were separated out. Automata's leveling and chip system was needlessly convoluted and time consuming for the sake of being convoluted and time consuming. One upgrade though from Nier to Automata was fantastic.... the path to get a weapon upgraded with materials.  And I mean the physical path. Automata had sensible fast travel location to the blacksmith and the weapon shops. Nier... fk Nier. Fk those ladders. And fk the absolute rage (by the end of the multiple playthroughs) I felt every time I needed to go to the Brothers shop or that location in general. I swear by the end my neck was sore from all the times I swung my head back and groaned as I climbed those ladders. I kept screaming, "Why can't I just fast travel to that area?! How about just 1 ladder to climb after you clear it the first time?! Why is there not some kind of fn shortcut by hour 40?!"
I love me some proper japanese jank
    Imagine if Japanese Jank and EuroJank worked together. They'd be unstoppable.
        And also unplayable
        Gothic: Nier Jankima
            Mount and Gothic: Nierlord
            Kingdom Nier Deliverjank
            Gothic <3
        The perfect meme game doesn't exist.
        To me, Dragons Dogma hits that spot. Love that game. It still holds up, but in a completely different way. Like in a junk way.
To say Nier Gestalt/Replicant plays like "complete shit" is really going overboard. It's very barebones but it's not "bad". Especially not "complete shit"

Drakengard on the other hand, that did not age well at all.
To be fair, Drakengard 3 only played like complete shit because it ran like ass too. I recently(-ish) emulated it and at a stable framerate it doesn't feel too different from Nier.
    Can you direct me to some info on how to emulate Drakengard 3? Last I checked it wasn't available on the main PS3 emulator (forgot the name).
        It is definitely playable on RPCS3 including all DLC. Maybe an update broke it because I haven't touched it for a year.
        Like the other poster said, it's emulatable on RPCS3 [with very little tweaking](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Drakengard_3). A bunch of (pretty much all?) Unreal Engine 3-based games are.
Automata is a sequel to Replicant. During Route B if you found any "Project Gestalt reports" that's what they're referencing. Emil's character also carries over from there among with various other references.

EDIT: Sorry I didn't see you were referring to FF14.
    Pretty sure he's asking about the FF14 thing.
        Oh whoops, my bad. I have the same question now since I thought it was more a cameo thing.
            It's not just a cameo, it's a full series of three raids and a plot line that act as a continuation of Automata's story (though to what degree, we don't quite know yet because only about a third of it is in the game right now). Raid 1 has two new bosses and two bosses that are familiar faces, though I won't spoil who they are. Raid 2 is dropping within the next two months and raid 3 will be six months after that.
final fantasy 14 has a nier automata side story in it, which is tied into a yorha unit and a derelict factory. It's not finished yet so not clear how it sits in the timeline.
    Now I need to start FF14 on PS4
        Play an MMO for hundreds of hours for a side story? Go for it.
            I mean it's ffxiv so he could just join boost to Shadowbringers, get carried through the end, then get carried through the raids...
                You get carried through the 24-mans whether you like it or not when it's your first time anyway.
        I mean honestly ffxiv has a fantastic story, and a super generous free trial (any character can get every class up to level 35 as many tines as they want). Imo its worth giving a shot
I hope we still get to play as the father, that ugly ass man was a refreshing change of pace to me back then so I look on him fondly.
    Plus outside of a few sparse moments, the father works better for the story. Some people would say its" more than a few sparse moments." I would say that they don't get it. His wife died and his daughter became ill. His whole world became taking care of his daughter. As a result, he isolated himself. "Social distancing." Its not like he did all these odd jobs to grab a beer with the bard. As a result, he became more socially awkward and forgot how to deal with people outside of his daughter as you would in that situation. Keeping that is mind, moments like "Yes.. you and I are friends now" makes more sense.

Weird thing is this kind of speaks more about Japan's view about parental relationships with their children. That the "father" was made to appeal to a western audience.
        > Weird thing is this kind of speaks more about Japan's view about parental relationships with their children. That the "father" was made to appeal to a western audience.

Weird thing is that this speaks more about western views about siblings relationship. That "brother" isn't appealing to a western audience.
            Yeah, the doting brother is quite a popular trope in Japan that, according to many in this thread, doesn't seem to translate too well to a Western audience.
                Yeah, I wonder why that happens honestly, because tons of people here would have siblings. And in a world where the only one who the character has is their sister, that's quite the story. That ghibli movie with the world war 2 with the kid and his sister is an example to me for this.
                    Grave of the Fireflies, fantastic movie. 
But yeah, it must be a cultural thing, but I'm struggling to associate it with a single held idea/belief. 

What I do find interesting though, is that in the West, older brothers are rarely portrayed as straight up caring and are usually either a bully or indifferent to the younger sibling's plight, until they're actually required to step up.
                Wasn't one of the reasons why in games and anime/manga the protagonists are always young has to do with people reliving their lost youth thru them? Everyone knows the working culture in Japan is a beast of it's own. School life is also much more strict.

At least that's what i read about it ages ago.
    If they don’t have the father I have to wonder if it’s even worth playing vs. sticking to the proper version. I just can’t imagine the game without him.
Wasn't it two games but the console version depended on who you played as? I recall the PS3 version being different than the 360 one.

Edit: it seems that the NA versions are both Father Nier, with the PS3 version being a port of the 360 version.
Getting true ending is abomination and you're straight lying. Grinding hours one location, to drop one item, which you need 3 to upgrade 1 of 20 weapons isn't "investing some time".



Hope they will cut that bullshit, because story, characters and music are top notch.
    Actually you only needed to \*obtain\* every weapon. Which for me brought the total playtime for the final endings to 30 -40 hours (normal people can probably do it a lot quicker).

Now getting the platinum trophy which requires ALL weapon upgrades IS pain. That brought my playtime up to 100 hours.
        That's better, I remembered I was gatekept at Junkyard by some quest, but can't find the one. Like this one: https://nier.fandom.com/wiki/The_Damaged_Map for untrained eye it looks like no hassle. But if you played, you know goats are made purely of meat. (I think I was farming machine oils, 1 hour for a not a single one, in a location where they should drop the most - highest concentration of flying robots)
            I believe the quest you're thinking of is for repairing Iron Will, which you still need to do in Route B ("Don't we already have this weapon?" "shhh, these things happen the second time around") - which as far as I recall guarantees spawns for that item but it's still a pain to get. 

I think there's some other jank in the game as well where it tells you stuff drops from one enemy but it actually drops from another on the opposite side of an area or something silly like that.
        Took me 46 hours.

Not sure if it was worth it, but it's certainly a game I will remember. I really enjoyed the first 20 hours. The next were a bit repetitive, but I appreciated the storyline.
If I’m not hearing Liam and Laura Bailey this is going to be a pretty big disappointment, not gonna lie.
    They were both willing to reprise their roles in Catherine: Full Body last year, so I think there’s a good chance they’ll come back.
        That game keeping its entire cast was a bit of a surprise, considering Laura Bailey and Troy Baker hadn't done any work for non-Final Fantasy Japanese games for a few years before that and Atlus had already recast their Persona roles. I suppose it's because the majority of them had become high profile VAs after the original game's release though.
One of my favorite tidbits about the game is that in the Japanese version Weiss is played by a guy going under the stage name Peter. I thought that was odd, and it turns out he played the court jester in Akira Kurosawa's Ran. The more you know. 

However Liam's English accent added wonderful charm to the character.
This. I haven't played the original but have it running on a PS3 emulator, it's on my list of games to play. This update sounds like a great way to play it for the first time, and I can wait another year to play it. But, as a massive fan of Critical Role, if it doesn't have the voice work of Liam or Laura it would definitely not be an option for me, and would instead stick to the original.
>Unless they skimp on the budget

Square Enix would never do that... not to a Nier project...

    I wouldn't mind Japanese voice with English subs (like Yakuza series) tbh
        The English voice acting was amazing though. I wouldn’t want to miss my "WEISS YOU DUMBASS" every time I start up the game.
            SPEAK THE TRUTH HUSSY
        Nah, Kaine is a character people need to experience in their native language. 


The first time you boot it up and hear [“Weiss you dumbass!”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvyvQfn30uE)Hits a lot differently than if you read it.
They are adding new story elements. I know 2b is supposed to be in it in some way. Also they hinted at a new ending.
It was also *really* easy too. You could get a spear early on and just mindlessly mash your way to the end of the game.
I'm aware of that, I played the game briefly with the 60fps hack on RPCS3. If this remaster does not run at 60 that would be fairly disappointing given the original on an emulator can do so.
It's actually confirmed that God of War was the inspiration for the gameplay in this game, which makes it funny in retrospect since Kratos would later become a sad dad himself.
    God of War 1-3 is literally about Kratos being a sad dad.
        Yeah but mad sad, not sad sad.
            I think we can all agree that Kratos is a mad sad dad lad.
        [deleted]
            No, they had a point. Kratos had already lost his daughter in the OT so he had no more reason to act like a dad. He was just rage incarnate and a bloodthirsty maniac by the third game. The stuff with Pandora was half baked at best. With Atreus, Kratos does have something to protect and starts acting like a father again in a very believable way.
[deleted]
Yeah, someone else told me this was actually not one of those cases. I do feel like it happens way too often though
[deleted]
Didn't know that. But my point still stands that alot of times japanese games are changed to "better capture Western audiences"
Just binge watched that entire series. Dude makes some excellent videos.

Thanks for the link.
Gestalt was also released in Japan as an Xbox 360 exclusive, while Replicant was only on PS3.
(He could also very much have been pretending, because marketing.)
    thats true. It feels a *little* out of character for Taro to fake for marketing purposes, but it is a definite possibility
        That's the genius behind constantly being a weirdo... You can never tell when they're being genuinely weird or just playing it up 🤔
        What was he going to say? "You westerners won't be getting the true version, because we thought that westerners will like a bulky daddy character more than a teenager (which was true), so you won't get the canon version that was meant to be. Sorry."
Oh man, that’s fantastic - I agree, that’s some of the best voice acting I’ve heard in a long time. I loved Automata, but never played the original - here’s hoping they don’t change too much.
Nier had Laura Bailey AND Liam O'Brien? At this rate they might as well go the whole hog with Critical Role VAs and have Mercer voice the protag
Older MC appealed more to western audiences than a bishounen MC really, it came out around 09. BrotherNier is the canonical one.

Some people think dadNier works better whilst others say broNier is better, and then some say the Father/Daughter works better while companion relationships work better with a younger character.
    [deleted]
        There are lore reasons, replicant vs gestalt. Going more into it is spoiler territory. You should play it, phenomenal story.
Brother nier is the original japanese version, but they thought the whole "Onii-chan!" Extremely loving siblings thing wouldnt work in the west so they made him older, and changed him into her father.

Its not a character select because its basically a localization change.
As far as I know, it was originally written as a story about a brother and a sister, but someone (Yoko Taro I guess?) thought it would connect with western audiences more if it was about father/daughter instead. Gestalt is the western version.
Long story short: appeal to a Western audience
While the game was originally made with Replicant version (the teenage protag. version) in mind, they decided to make Nier older when localizing to the west as they thought it would draw in more western audience and boost sales, since most western games feature older, gruffier main character (e.g. Gears of War, Max Payne, etc.)

Which... actually works, believe it or not. While the design of teenage Nier is more appealing to look at, a lot of people liked papa Nier because they feel that a father doing everything in his power to save his daughter is a much more compelling motivation than  a brother saving his sister. This is one of the many things that helped elevate Nier to become a cult classic in the western gaming audience.
    I mean... okay ? That sounds absurdly overkill. Making a whole alternate version of a game and redoing the entire script and dub of the main character for a somewhat risky marketing decision ? I find that a little insane.

Good thing it worked, though.
They might be Replicants of actual humans that later serve as the blueprint for YoRHa androids?
    I swear there was a data file that implied A2 was based on Kaine. And pretty much every android in YorHa was like the metaphorical children of her and since the robots were based on Emil from the aliens they were like his metaphorical kids.
The English cast was stellar too, Laura Bailey, Liam O'Brien, Julie Ann Taylor, and Jamieson Price are some of my favourite VAs and they all did an amazing job in the original NieR.
    Normally I don't play anything in English dub but this game was an exception for sure! The direction was stellar for the English dub, a place where Automata fell down a bit. I really hope the original team comes back for this!
        Really? I thought Automata was incredibly voiced. Eve's psychotic breakdown when Adam dies is bone chilling. Ray Chase, fresh off his regal performance in FFXV, sent shivers down my spine.
            [This is a soap box so the reply is a little long soz]

I agree there I liked Eve's voice a LOT. I really love English 9S, too. Just before I say this, I'm fond Kira Buckland and her presence in the community, I think she did a great job. I just think the English localisation team represented 2B in a way that takes away from the subtlety of her character in the original.

What I disliked particularly was the direction they went with the translation of her lines and their delivery. Japanese 2B is often detached and professional, above all else, though she has moments where emotion shows through her professional facade. English 2B is sarcastic, harsh with 9S, and at times generically "sassy" in the way commanding women in (esp. sci-fi and post apocalyptic) fiction often are.  

An example is a kind of catchphrase 2B says a lot in the game. When 9S is complaining about something, JP2B says 文句を言わない/Monku wo iwanai Japanese often omits the subject so I took it as "(we) don't complain". She says it very matter-of-fact, calmly. It's their job to do what their told and not to complain, she's reminding 9S of something he's heard a million times over from her and others. But she actually likes that impulsive part of him so she's not really giving out.

ENG2B scolds him. I believe the line is either "stop complaining" or "stop whining", I don't recall which. It totally shuts him down and gets rid of the subtlety the original had. This is where it was super clear that this was the direction the translation and localising went.

Edit: oooo!! I mentioned this to a friend as I was writing this and someone made a YouTube video about what I'm trying to say!! Halfway in the video and I totally agree with what's said here! https://youtu.be/l1jotXNoO40
                This might be a bit late, but I completely agree with you on what they did to 2B (Again, the script, writing, and localization, not the performance )

They did something very similar with Zero in Drakengard 3. Often times she was meant to come off as tired or lethargic, but she just seemed like an angry bitch most of the time, and It really detracted from what was supposed to be her character.
[removed]
    Yeah even if the dialogue is exactly the same, the context of one protagonist being a seasoned older widower and the other being a inexperienced orphan teenager really makes their relationships with other characters feel a lot different. The subtext matters.
I only played the old man english version too

            i honestly didn't remember the details so i had to rewatch the cutscenes. what i seem to remember is that the wolves and humans from the village were under constant fight, so it might make sense that the wolves would attack any human on sight. but i'm not saying that nier was a flawless game, it definitely lacked in some departments.
                Oh dont get me wrong I really liked Nier ... in a weirdly  confusing and depressing way lol

But that big emotional gut punch just wasnt as heavy as it could have been.
        Sounds like it made you have more empathy for people. Which is awesome.
    It made me realize that the world isn't black and white, also made me question if what I do as a hero in a video game is actually ethical or if it's just ethical for the people I am doing it for. It awakened in me an interest in finding books/games/movies that cover similiar topics, where everything isn't black and white, but rather much like the real world, it is different shades of grey.
        Ideally, you probably should have learned this in middle/high school through assigned reading. Good that you eventually picked up on this though.
            and ideally, people should learn critical thinking in school which clearly many people don't. there are some things you just have to teach yourself. love you too btw :)
                Agreed. I think this is a failing of public school systems. There is fantastic material that is assigned in American schools, for example, that focus on the duality of good & evil (Lord of the Flies, Of Mice & Men, To Kill A Mockingbird, a TON of Shakespeare), but the reality is many teachers themselves lack good understandings of the texts themselves that they fail to engage students whom, otherwise, the texts could really resonate with. Or yknow provide good life lessons.
            German middle/high school reading is all about "nazis bad", we did do critical interpretations, but we always needed to qrite what the teacher wanted to hear if we wanted to get a good grade and when Nier first came out, I had graduated the year before and was still a die hard commie, extremists aren't exactly known for recognizing shades of grey.
                I was speaking from an American perspective, so unsure of the German education system, but this doesn't sound that different. It really is a failing of schools and teachers who don't engage the students with the texts.

    The perfect meme game doesn't exist.
    To me, Dragons Dogma hits that spot. Love that game. It still holds up, but in a completely different way. Like in a junk way.
Can you direct me to some info on how to emulate Drakengard 3? Last I checked it wasn't available on the main PS3 emulator (forgot the name).
    It is definitely playable on RPCS3 including all DLC. Maybe an update broke it because I haven't touched it for a year.
    Like the other poster said, it's emulatable on RPCS3 [with very little tweaking](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Drakengard_3). A bunch of (pretty much all?) Unreal Engine 3-based games are.
Pretty sure he's asking about the FF14 thing.
    Oh whoops, my bad. I have the same question now since I thought it was more a cameo thing.
        It's not just a cameo, it's a full series of three raids and a plot line that act as a continuation of Automata's story (though to what degree, we don't quite know yet because only about a third of it is in the game right now). Raid 1 has two new bosses and two bosses that are familiar faces, though I won't spoil who they are. Raid 2 is dropping within the next two months and raid 3 will be six months after that.
Now I need to start FF14 on PS4
    Play an MMO for hundreds of hours for a side story? Go for it.
        I mean it's ffxiv so he could just join boost to Shadowbringers, get carried through the end, then get carried through the raids...
            You get carried through the 24-mans whether you like it or not when it's your first time anyway.
    I mean honestly ffxiv has a fantastic story, and a super generous free trial (any character can get every class up to level 35 as many tines as they want). Imo its worth giving a shot
Plus outside of a few sparse moments, the father works better for the story. Some people would say its" more than a few sparse moments." I would say that they don't get it. His wife died and his daughter became ill. His whole world became taking care of his daughter. As a result, he isolated himself. "Social distancing." Its not like he did all these odd jobs to grab a beer with the bard. As a result, he became more socially awkward and forgot how to deal with people outside of his daughter as you would in that situation. Keeping that is mind, moments like "Yes.. you and I are friends now" makes more sense.

Weird thing is this kind of speaks more about Japan's view about parental relationships with their children. That the "father" was made to appeal to a western audience.
    > Weird thing is this kind of speaks more about Japan's view about parental relationships with their children. That the "father" was made to appeal to a western audience.

Weird thing is that this speaks more about western views about siblings relationship. That "brother" isn't appealing to a western audience.
        Yeah, the doting brother is quite a popular trope in Japan that, according to many in this thread, doesn't seem to translate too well to a Western audience.
            Yeah, I wonder why that happens honestly, because tons of people here would have siblings. And in a world where the only one who the character has is their sister, that's quite the story. That ghibli movie with the world war 2 with the kid and his sister is an example to me for this.
                Grave of the Fireflies, fantastic movie. 
But yeah, it must be a cultural thing, but I'm struggling to associate it with a single held idea/belief. 

What I do find interesting though, is that in the West, older brothers are rarely portrayed as straight up caring and are usually either a bully or indifferent to the younger sibling's plight, until they're actually required to step up.
            Wasn't one of the reasons why in games and anime/manga the protagonists are always young has to do with people reliving their lost youth thru them? Everyone knows the working culture in Japan is a beast of it's own. School life is also much more strict.

At least that's what i read about it ages ago.
If they don’t have the father I have to wonder if it’s even worth playing vs. sticking to the proper version. I just can’t imagine the game without him.
Actually you only needed to \*obtain\* every weapon. Which for me brought the total playtime for the final endings to 30 -40 hours (normal people can probably do it a lot quicker).

Now getting the platinum trophy which requires ALL weapon upgrades IS pain. That brought my playtime up to 100 hours.
    That's better, I remembered I was gatekept at Junkyard by some quest, but can't find the one. Like this one: https://nier.fandom.com/wiki/The_Damaged_Map for untrained eye it looks like no hassle. But if you played, you know goats are made purely of meat. (I think I was farming machine oils, 1 hour for a not a single one, in a location where they should drop the most - highest concentration of flying robots)
        I believe the quest you're thinking of is for repairing Iron Will, which you still need to do in Route B ("Don't we already have this weapon?" "shhh, these things happen the second time around") - which as far as I recall guarantees spawns for that item but it's still a pain to get. 

I think there's some other jank in the game as well where it tells you stuff drops from one enemy but it actually drops from another on the opposite side of an area or something silly like that.
    Took me 46 hours.

Not sure if it was worth it, but it's certainly a game I will remember. I really enjoyed the first 20 hours. The next were a bit repetitive, but I appreciated the storyline.
They were both willing to reprise their roles in Catherine: Full Body last year, so I think there’s a good chance they’ll come back.
    That game keeping its entire cast was a bit of a surprise, considering Laura Bailey and Troy Baker hadn't done any work for non-Final Fantasy Japanese games for a few years before that and Atlus had already recast their Persona roles. I suppose it's because the majority of them had become high profile VAs after the original game's release though.
I wouldn't mind Japanese voice with English subs (like Yakuza series) tbh
    The English voice acting was amazing though. I wouldn’t want to miss my "WEISS YOU DUMBASS" every time I start up the game.
        SPEAK THE TRUTH HUSSY
    Nah, Kaine is a character people need to experience in their native language. 


The first time you boot it up and hear [“Weiss you dumbass!”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvyvQfn30uE)Hits a lot differently than if you read it.
God of War 1-3 is literally about Kratos being a sad dad.
    Yeah but mad sad, not sad sad.
        I think we can all agree that Kratos is a mad sad dad lad.
    [deleted]
        No, they had a point. Kratos had already lost his daughter in the OT so he had no more reason to act like a dad. He was just rage incarnate and a bloodthirsty maniac by the third game. The stuff with Pandora was half baked at best. With Atreus, Kratos does have something to protect and starts acting like a father again in a very believable way.
thats true. It feels a *little* out of character for Taro to fake for marketing purposes, but it is a definite possibility
    That's the genius behind constantly being a weirdo... You can never tell when they're being genuinely weird or just playing it up 🤔
    What was he going to say? "You westerners won't be getting the true version, because we thought that westerners will like a bulky daddy character more than a teenager (which was true), so you won't get the canon version that was meant to be. Sorry."
[deleted]
    There are lore reasons, replicant vs gestalt. Going more into it is spoiler territory. You should play it, phenomenal story.
I mean... okay ? That sounds absurdly overkill. Making a whole alternate version of a game and redoing the entire script and dub of the main character for a somewhat risky marketing decision ? I find that a little insane.

Good thing it worked, though.
I swear there was a data file that implied A2 was based on Kaine. And pretty much every android in YorHa was like the metaphorical children of her and since the robots were based on Emil from the aliens they were like his metaphorical kids.
Normally I don't play anything in English dub but this game was an exception for sure! The direction was stellar for the English dub, a place where Automata fell down a bit. I really hope the original team comes back for this!
    Really? I thought Automata was incredibly voiced. Eve's psychotic breakdown when Adam dies is bone chilling. Ray Chase, fresh off his regal performance in FFXV, sent shivers down my spine.
        [This is a soap box so the reply is a little long soz]

I agree there I liked Eve's voice a LOT. I really love English 9S, too. Just before I say this, I'm fond Kira Buckland and her presence in the community, I think she did a great job. I just think the English localisation team represented 2B in a way that takes away from the subtlety of her character in the original.

What I disliked particularly was the direction they went with the translation of her lines and their delivery. Japanese 2B is often detached and professional, above all else, though she has moments where emotion shows through her professional facade. English 2B is sarcastic, harsh with 9S, and at times generically "sassy" in the way commanding women in (esp. sci-fi and post apocalyptic) fiction often are.  

An example is a kind of catchphrase 2B says a lot in the game. When 9S is complaining about something, JP2B says 文句を言わない/Monku wo iwanai Japanese often omits the subject so I took it as "(we) don't complain". She says it very matter-of-fact, calmly. It's their job to do what their told and not to complain, she's reminding 9S of something he's heard a million times over from her and others. But she actually likes that impulsive part of him so she's not really giving out.

ENG2B scolds him. I believe the line is either "stop complaining" or "stop whining", I don't recall which. It totally shuts him down and gets rid of the subtlety the original had. This is where it was super clear that this was the direction the translation and localising went.

Edit: oooo!! I mentioned this to a friend as I was writing this and someone made a YouTube video about what I'm trying to say!! Halfway in the video and I totally agree with what's said here! https://youtu.be/l1jotXNoO40
            This might be a bit late, but I completely agree with you on what they did to 2B (Again, the script, writing, and localization, not the performance )

They did something very similar with Zero in Drakengard 3. Often times she was meant to come off as tired or lethargic, but she just seemed like an angry bitch most of the time, and It really detracted from what was supposed to be her character.
Yeah even if the dialogue is exactly the same, the context of one protagonist being a seasoned older widower and the other being a inexperienced orphan teenager really makes their relationships with other characters feel a lot different. The subtext matters.
I really liked the father/daughter story more than having it be brother and sister. It felt more realistic that a father would do absolutely anything to save his sick daughter. I'll be disappointed of we don't have that story available in the West.
    We already do, that's the one that was originally ported.

Regardless, you can tell that the game was written for the brother story. The lines papa Nier has about friendship and Emil's crush on him make more sense if he's younger. There's also him aging up on the second half, which Gestalt replaced with... an eyepatch.
        [deleted]
            Well to each their own, haha. I feel the exact opposite way in every way, so I'm glad we're finally getting a translation for brother Nier.
and they were right because it's *way* more compelling and I believe a father >!Dooming the entire human race!< for the sake of his daughter without question, but a brother doing it for his sister just seems like an illogical stretch. But I guess then you can't appeal to the weirdly prevalent siscon crowd.
not OP but imo it paints certain events into a bigger painting with much more context, much like automata. the point being that you never know how other people are feeling/why they act a certain way or do the things they do. in the it's easy to assume someone is evil/an asshole when you don't know the full story.
    I thought that reveal during the second playthrough was a bit cheap.

I just think the English localisation team represented 2B in a way that takes away from the subtlety of her character in the original.

What I disliked particularly was the direction they went with the translation of her lines and their delivery. Japanese 2B is often detached and professional, above all else, though she has moments where emotion shows through her professional facade. English 2B is sarcastic, harsh with 9S, and at times generically "sassy" in the way commanding women in (esp. sci-fi and post apocalyptic) fiction often are.  

An example is a kind of catchphrase 2B says a lot in the game. When 9S is complaining about something, JP2B says 文句を言わない/Monku wo iwanai Japanese often omits the subject so I took it as "(we) don't complain". She says it very matter-of-fact, calmly. It's their job to do what their told and not to complain, she's reminding 9S of something he's heard a million times over from her and others. But she actually likes that impulsive part of him so she's not really giving out.

ENG2B scolds him. I believe the line is either "stop complaining" or "stop whining", I don't recall which. It totally shuts him down and gets rid of the subtlety the original had. This is where it was super clear that this was the direction the translation and localising went.

Edit: oooo!! I mentioned this to a friend as I was writing this and someone made a YouTube video about what I'm trying to say!! Halfway in the video and I totally agree with what's said here! https://youtu.be/l1jotXNoO40
    This might be a bit late, but I completely agree with you on what they did to 2B (Again, the script, writing, and localization, not the performance )

They did something very similar with Zero in Drakengard 3. Often times she was meant to come off as tired or lethargic, but she just seemed like an angry bitch most of the time, and It really detracted from what was supposed to be her character.

    Well to each their own, haha. I feel the exact opposite way in every way, so I'm glad we're finally getting a translation for brother Nier.
i honestly didn't remember the details so i had to rewatch the cutscenes. what i seem to remember is that the wolves and humans from the village were under constant fight, so it might make sense that the wolves would attack any human on sight. but i'm not saying that nier was a flawless game, it definitely lacked in some departments.
    Oh dont get me wrong I really liked Nier ... in a weirdly  confusing and depressing way lol

But that big emotional gut punch just wasnt as heavy as it could have been.
and ideally, people should learn critical thinking in school which clearly many people don't. there are some things you just have to teach yourself. love you too btw :)
    Agreed. I think this is a failing of public school systems. There is fantastic material that is assigned in American schools, for example, that focus on the duality of good & evil (Lord of the Flies, Of Mice & Men, To Kill A Mockingbird, a TON of Shakespeare), but the reality is many teachers themselves lack good understandings of the texts themselves that they fail to engage students whom, otherwise, the texts could really resonate with. Or yknow provide good life lessons.
German middle/high school reading is all about "nazis bad", we did do critical interpretations, but we always needed to qrite what the teacher wanted to hear if we wanted to get a good grade and when Nier first came out, I had graduated the year before and was still a die hard commie, extremists aren't exactly known for recognizing shades of grey.
    I was speaking from an American perspective, so unsure of the German education system, but this doesn't sound that different. It really is a failing of schools and teachers who don't engage the students with the texts.
You get carried through the 24-mans whether you like it or not when it's your first time anyway.
Yeah, I wonder why that happens honestly, because tons of people here would have siblings. And in a world where the only one who the character has is their sister, that's quite the story. That ghibli movie with the world war 2 with the kid and his sister is an example to me for this.
    Grave of the Fireflies, fantastic movie. 
But yeah, it must be a cultural thing, but I'm struggling to associate it with a single held idea/belief. 

What I do find interesting though, is that in the West, older brothers are rarely portrayed as straight up caring and are usually either a bully or indifferent to the younger sibling's plight, until they're actually required to step up.
Wasn't one of the reasons why in games and anime/manga the protagonists are always young has to do with people reliving their lost youth thru them? Everyone knows the working culture in Japan is a beast of it's own. School life is also much more strict.

At least that's what i read about it ages ago.
