[[NieR Replicant is the most beautiful video-gaming experience]]


I truly loved NieR:Automata. I'm a very big fan of the original Final Fantasy VII.

I didn't expect NieR Replicant to be on the same level as those games or even in some ways exceed them.

Yes, the game seems unpolished. Archaic. Yes, you are forced to do a lot of fetch quests. Heck, you are forced to beat the same half of the game 3 times.

But trust me, it's worth it.

NieR Replicant has the most memorable characters I've met in any video-game, absolutely mind-blowing story, and an insane music. Combat system is great (I liked it more than the one in Automata). My only critique is the quests' design (going from place A to B and from B to A) that may make many people...not play this game.

Replicant goes against video-gaming trends. The pacing is slow, the story less bombastic than the one in Automata. It may just put off many players.

But if you're indeed a patient player, you must give this game a chance.

It's absolutely worth it.

One of the best gaming experiences in my life.

Thank you, Yoko Taro.


I trusted you until you said "trust me".
    You shouldn't trust a thing I say. Trust me.
    Trust me bro
    To play devils advocate, I also trusted Reddit with this game and was greatly disappointed by the vast and empty open world. This game is certainly not for everybody.
        It's not really an open world game... it's more in the style of pre-BOTW Zelda, where there's a linear story but sidequests scattered throughout
        Most of the best games worth playing aren't for everyone. Games that take risks inherently aren't for everyone.
        Well it's Nier. One of the main appeals of Nier is that it's genre-breaking. Which automatically also means that none of the genres is fully fleshed out. You go from open-world to hack-n-slash to retro shooter to platformer to visual novel to some odd mini-game to whatever. The whole idea is that the genre should bend around the game, not the game around a specific genre.

For me it worked very well in Automata. I haven't played Replicant yet however.
        Funny enough I found the element of packed "safe towns" connected to each other through these desolate and hostile environments to be pretty good in a world building sense. I also prefer the smaller open world areas of Nier to the larger and emptier expanses in games like BOTW so I definitely understand where you coming from though.
It's a masterpiece that's so deeply flawed that it's hard to even say it should be called a masterpiece. But at the same time, those flaws existed mostly because it was a very singular vision. It's not a corporate game, I never felt pandered to, and it isn't a rehash of other games, so I ended up enjoying the game on its own terms.

The music is amazing, the characters are unique, the story is told in a non-standard way even if the multiple playthroughs don't respect your time, the combat is not interesting but serviceable. It's not for everyone, it makes that clear immediately when a character is cussing out a book in the title sequence before you even start the game. But I liked it quite a bit. It gave me a feeling that no other game has.
Grimoire Weiss is my favourite video game companion. His and Kainé's voice acting were SO good. I'd heard their respective voice actors in plenty of other games before, but Replicant was their best performances imho. Really added to the characters.
One of my favourite games. It was especially unique back when it released, as the now relatively commonplace meta elements (replays, fourth wall breaks, genre shifts) hadn’t been seen much outside of MGS.

And it partly predates the eventual wave of dad games.
    What's a dad game?
        He means the surge of playing a fatherly protagonist in recent games like God of War or The Last of Us.

There where two versions of the game: NieR Replicant for the Japanese market where you play Brother NieR for your sister Yonah, while NieR Gestalt, the version for the western market had you play as Father NieR to your daughter Yonah. It was a unique MC when JRPG where mostly geared towards younger protagonists.
            Thank you.
            Do we know why the switch was made?
The game is a work of art for sure. I am in the camp that believes, for this game, you need to experience the “time wasting” parts to fully appreciate what the game did differently than all of its kind. The cast is among the most likable and memorable that I can remember, and that held my attention even though the last playthrough was wearing on me. The OST definitely helped too.
I think both games haves its merits.

My experience was that Neir Replicant had better characters. Automata's characters are almost caricatures in comparison. Having the more relatable characters generally made it easier to get emotionally invested in the plot. On top of that, Replicant's music is special. So many songs like Song of the Ancients, Emil's theme, Kaine's theme have stuck with me for a long time. It's more intimate than the grander soundtrack of Automata (with exceptions of course).

But on the other hand, my experience with Automata was a step above. Mainly because it's execution and structure of it's thematic elements. Everything builds up so intentionally to its conclusion. I think it pushed the boundaries of storytelling in games. Ultimately I value that more.

Game play wise, they are both heavily flawed. Automata is more polished and less repetitive but I can see why both games have people bounce off of them. Another thing is... Replicant was unique but if you break it down, no single aspect seems to truly stand out (outside the music) in the wider gaming JRPG space. Games like Final Fantasy 10 and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 simply have better written characters and more interesting interactions between them. Maybe a bigger budget would have helped. What Replicant has is Yoko Taro, who just happens to be the spice that appeals to its specific audience (including me).

I'll offer an alternative perspective. I thought the game was huge waste of time. You basically have to play the game five times in a row just to reach the true ending. Unlike Nier Automata, each playthrough was largely the same except for maybe 5 minutes of new content (dialog sometimes cinematics) until you reach the final run where you actually get a whole new section to even look at and even that was only 20 minutes long. 
  
After reaching the true ending, I deeply regret spending so much time playing it. I would've been more satisfied and less mad if I just did one playthrough and watched the true ending on youtube. Additionally, the visual novel section was a real piss take by Yoko Taro. It was just white text on a black wall for at least 10 minutes of reading every single playthrough that adds largely nothing to the overall message of the game. The fact that you have to remember specific messages in the passages in order to pass the "highschool styled multiple choice exam" in order to end the VN sequence is just icing on the dirt cake.
    I loved Automata, but felt Replicant did not respect your time *whatsoever*. Despite loving the world, the game felt a chore to play for me, which is such a shame as I really wanted more.
        I haven't played Replicant and guess I shouldn't because while I enjoyed Automata it definitely like a chore half way through.
        Lol I never understand when people say shit like "respect your time" because it quantifies art under this weird calculus.

If you spend 40 hours on a game and by the end of it it ingrains itself into your mind to the point where you can't stop thinking about it or it affects your life deeply, then that game 'respects your time' more than if you played 4 10-hour games or 8 5-hour games which merely entertained or mildly intrigued you.

In the first place, if you care so much about your time being respected, video games are like the worst medium ever for that, given that there are enough films, books, or music albums out there that can bestow thematically whole and memorable experiences for less time-investment than your average video game. There are probably enough of those to last a lifetime without having to touch video games at all.
        I just ended up ignoring all the side quests, lore and world-building be damned. I did a couple that were right in front of me, and youtubed any that seemed interesting to see what happened. There's 0 respect for my time in expecting me to run all over the place to find a guy w a gold necklace, and it's crappy that it's required to find out the truth behind a major story beat. I'll be watching the other endings so I can get on to playing Automata. I made myself play the first before touching the second, and I have enjoyed it very much. You couldn't pay me to do these mindless fetch-quests. And imho if you think doing them helps you understand the depth of separation between the revelations of bending the genre to fit the story or some such nonsense, you are a shill that takes Yoko pranking you for deep art and all I can do is laugh
        At least Nier (Replicant) had the excuse of being the first game of its series while being given barely any resources and budget. What's Automata's excuse for making us play through the game all over again but with shittier gameplay (that forces you to play a minigame every 10 seconds mid-battle in order to be efficient) and 90% of the same content for Route B?
            I can't say I know or care past my enjoyment of the time with each game.
            replicant is a spinoff of the Drakengard trilogy, and that mechanic was in those games too (PS2/PS3 era).
    Well that's the reason why Automata is the sequel.
    The novel sections were incredible to me, I can’t believe someone managed to creatively pull something like that off and actually have it work without being forced or cringe. Very emotionally impactful to me
    It might be easy (although I don't know how) but NieR didn't exactly have a mega budget. Which is the easy answer as to why it is like it is. I'm not going to say it doesn't get tedious on the third run for C/D but the budget aspect shouldn't be ignored and played off as design.

> Additionally, the visual novel section was a real piss take by Yoko Taro. It was just white text on a black wall for at least 10 minutes of reading every single playthrough that adds largely nothing to the overall message of the game.

I enjoyed it. Does it really have to contribute to the "overall message" to be worth your (gasp) 10 minutes?

Once again a sequel warps the perspective for many on what was a prequel in both story and the game before it. Heck, on a previous gen console no less. This is exactly why remakes / remasters can be detrimental.
        I really don't believe you can chalk poor design choices up to "low budget" only.

Nier wasn't the first game in its franchise. It was the third (correct me if I'm wrong), and each past game had the same design choices that don't respect your time whatsoever : replay the same shit and grind mindnumbing content just to see a few minutes of extra content.

At this point it's obvious that it's a conscious design choice because that's just how the Yoko Taro wanted his games to be like. **Not** concessions made for one reason or another, financial or not.

I love NieR to death, especially the soundtrack, but brushing off its glaring flaws as if they weren't intentional isn't doing it any service.
            NieR was "third", but Drakengard is literally a musou where you pick missions and that's pretty much what Drakengard 2 is as well. On top of that, Taro was not involved with Drakengard 2 beyond an observing role which is why it's mostly excluded from discussions. Kind of confusing why you even bring the previous games up as a fact if you're not even certain about the games that preceded it.

NieR on the other hand goes for a low budget open/connected world in its design so it's not really the same at all.

>and each past game had the same design choices that don't respect your time whatsoever : replay the same shit and grind mindnumbing content just to see a few minutes of extra content.

Welcome to huge chunk of games with more than one ending. The final ending of Drakengard 1 which was the only real grind to get was a joke ending prior to NieR's existence anyway. 

In NieR you only need all the weapons for the final ending (easy, leveling all to max is another story) and the "grind" isn't really a grind but rather just tedious retreading, which however doesn't take all too long to blast through.

Drakengard 3 getting to final ending is once again pretty easy (it's once again in mission format with stages). Then comes Automata and it's already really easy while the game takes advantage of new characters for retreading content. 

It's not really a stretch to even call NieR the first since it's just different from Drakengard altogether and then with bigger budget and some semblance of knowledge they improved to make the future runs smoother in Automata.
                >Kind of confusing why you even bring the previous games up as a fact if you're not even certain about the games that preceded it.

I bring them up because they're part of the same franchise and share many design aspects. The only reason I said "correct me if I'm wrong" is because, as far as I was aware, Drakengard 1 and 2 were the only games that preceded Nier but I didn't want to say it matter-of-fact in case there was some obscure spin-off I hadn't heard of or something of the sort.

Drakengard 3, since you're mentioning it, follows the same design philosophy which is once again the reason I've watched the final endings on Youtube instead of going through the grind myself, like every other game in the franchise. EXCEPT Automata, which I found handles the whole concept much better and is a testament to the fact that it's possible to have multiple endings without making the experience to get them a total slog to go through. It's the only Drakengard/NieR game of which I've managed to play all the endings myself.

>Welcome to huge chunk of games with more than one ending.

Whether that's true or not is debatable, and regardless, "because others do it" has never been an excuse I was willing to accept to justify a bad decision, in game design or otherwise. Also, what I said above about Automata.
                    >"because others do it" has never been an excuse I was willing to accept to justify a bad decision

Maybe, but it is for whatever reason a staple in games. However, I wouldn't place NieR anywhere near the worst of this type of deal. 

>which I found handles the whole concept much better and is a testament to the fact that it's possible to have multiple endings without making the experience to get them a total slog to go through

But like I said, only both of the NieRs share the same structure of the world where as the Drakengards share their mission type progress. Hence why, again, more budget and the previous tedium could be handled better.

Honestly, the only slog part of NieR is that you need to do another round after B ending. For B the repeat is entirely justified where as for C and D it doesn't really add anything.

That said, Taro clearly has a fetish for repeating certain elements in these games as both of his Drakengards end on >!rhythm bullshit!< and NieR on >!save deletion and the sob stories of enemies!< which turned me off from Automata as it was pretty much "been there done that" of an experience.

This honestly seems to boil down to what you consider a grind. I wouldn't consider finding all the weapons in DoD3 or NieR a grind whatsoever (nor blasting through the post-timeskip in 2 hours or so). But upgrading all of them I absolutely would. Drakengard 1 is the sole beast of the lot where it's just an absurd requirement for the final ending partly due to how annoying the requirements for finding the weapons can be.
    I have the same feelings about Nier Automata.
    >You basically have to play the game five times in a row just to reach the true ending.

"Basically"

You play the game once, and get ending A. You then load in 2/3 of the way through the story and replay the last part but with a large amount of additional lore and content which vastly changes the tone of the game. In the third playthrough you get a couple more cutscenes and a new boss segment for Louise, as well as a new end-game boss and two possible endings. You then play through the first 1/3 of the game again to reach ending E, with a considerable amount of extra content.

So when you say "basically play the game 5 times" you mean "Play the game once, play the last two hours twice more and reload a save" then sure. How can it possibly be taking you "so much time"??? Are you doing all the sidequests again too?
    I need to give you an upvote because thats exactly how I felt, the 'development' is buried under hours of filler sidequests & dialogues that give me nothing but pennies. 

It was definitely only worth the first runthrough and the last 3hours, everywhere in between is completely negligible.
    Big agree
        As a massive fan of Yoko Taro, I will be the first to agree that the replaying aspects are repetitive. In every game that has them. That seems to be, more or less, the point. The first playthrough sets up what you'd assume the game to be, a serviceable surface level tale that sort of holds up on its own but you know is obviously not the full story. Then it proceeds to deconstruct all of your assumptions about what's going on. You watch your comfortable reality break apart under closer inspection.

That isn't for everyone. Not everyone wants their games to be super meta and just wants a basic thing they can follow along with. If it was for everyone it wouldn't be interesting or unique.
            > Not everyone wants their games to be super meta and just wants a basic thing they can follow along with.

A game isn't automatically good just because it's "super meta". If a game goes for repetition and/or meta-narrative, it immediately amplifies the potential for a less than great core gameplay loop to overstay its welcome.

Look no further than Housemarque for an example of a developer that *really* understands this.
                Why are you bullying that scarecrow so much.
            If you like that kind of story telling you should check out breath of fire dragon quarter. Dying is part of the progress, and you unlock more story as you replay. I loved it
    I have only watched a playthrough, so my memory of the game isn't the best, but:

>!I really like what they were going for with the Shades turning out to be humanity, but having the whole playthrough be the same except some key moments turned into "DON'T YOU FEEL BAD NOW?" was lame.!<

I respect Yoko Taro's ideas but he just doesn't make games I can make myself care about.
    wow that VN stuff sounds absolutely terrible
    This is my plan lol
I think as far as gameplay and structure go Automata is far superior, but when it comes to story and characters Replicant is on a level that Automata just can't quite reach. Probably the most depressing game i've ever played.
    Oh man I just remembered Beepy.
        I was absolutely crushed. I think of the Fragments that one was the most depressing one for me.
It’s the grind for all the different weapons that scares me. It’s a lot of effort for an ending. At least Automata tries to shake things up a bit in the gameplay department and it’s unmissable
    Collecting all the weapons isn't nearly as bad as it seems. There are some missable weapons in the first part but none of them are difficult to obtain. Most of the weapons you need can easily be found while progressing the story, either by basic exploration or purchasing them from weapon shops. There are only a handful of weapons that are locked behind quests, but they're not very hard or time consuming. It seems incredibly daunting, but its really not too bad if you use a guide.
    It's an afternoon of work really, I think the original required a rare drop that made it more of a process.
    I replayed the original release of NIER during the pandemic and I forgot that you needed to unlock all weapons for one of the endings, which is super tedious when machine oil just never seems to drop. I don't think the recent remaster tweaked this at all either did it?

Doesn't help that the phoenix spear was basically the best weapon and didn't really incentivize others
    If this is your biggest fear over the replaying the last third of the game 3 times I can assure you the weapons collecting is embarrassingly simple. I think they even make the earlier "locked" weapons purchaseable. I actually ended up getting all the weapons except one pretty much just by playing normally. Even that last one was just like an hour of grinding which ended up helping to complete two other missions at the time.
Imo:
Replicant >>>>> Automata.
Nier Replicant is the best bad game I've ever played.

Or maybe it's the worst great game I've played?

Idk.

It's like someone took a 10/10 masterpiece and smushed it together with some 4/10 garbage. It's weird. I love it. I couldn't recommend it though.
Is that the kind game where you have to replay the same thing over and over for different sides?
I absolutely agree, it's one of my favourite games of all time. I played this then Automata straight after and adored both of them. As much as I loved Automata, I preferred Replicant. I was so sucked into the world and it's characters and I somehow never got bored anytime I replayed it for the other endings. I felt all sorts of emotions playing Replicant, it's a beautiful masterpiece.
Yo, uh…I loved Automata but I hated the whole playing the same thing twice before the story continues thing. 

And this game does it *three times*? 

I’ll still play it, but thanks for the heads up.
    FYI there is a new ending added to the remaster for automata fans, so now it would be four times.
        I mean technically there are 26 endings or some shit
    Each subsequent playthrough starts you at the half way point. By this time you already know what to do. Once you've collected all the weapons you can BREEZE through it in a couple hours. I was able to finish all three playthroughs in a night and a half. Then the very last ending is about 3 hours long and is MUCH different than the others and finally concludes the story. If you like Kainé then I highly suggest you do it. The entire game, 100% weapons, 91% side quests and 77% words took me 51:33. Absolutely worth it for the mass pounding of feels.
Also, that soundtrack.
I love Nier so much, Automata is my favorite game of all time with how incredible just every aspect of it was. Gameplay, Story, Soundtrack, all just done masterfully in my opinion. I love Replicant too, and I think many of its aspects are on-par with Automata
I absolutely adored Automata, I really loved the story and world. Was excited to go back and experience the previous game. Unfortunately I was bored most of the time. So much of the gameplay was run from one end of the map to the other, now go back, then read this short novel.   

In the end I only made it to ending A then had enough and stopped. Should probably look up the other endings on youtube, then replay Automata.
    You should at least check Route B alternate cutscenes and Endings C-E. Route A isn't even 50% of the game.
        I played through all the main endings of Automata so I understand there's a lot of the game remaining, but I had just couldn't be bothered. Will be sure to look up the endings online.
I liked it but found it to be not nearly as good as Automata. Too much repetition and just not as thought provoking as Automata in my opinion.
    I also stopped after I think the second playthrough of replicant as I found it to become a waste of time
        The thing is - you haven't beaten 50% of the game then. If you don't have time to finish it, just watch alternate scenes from Route B and Endings C-E. They're absolutely worth it.
            Yeah I watched them on youtube. But didn't quite get me as Automata. Although the story was good.
The game has a lot of amazong ideas, but fprcing you to replay the game 3 times is not one of them. That spoiled the entire experience for me, from a fantastic recommendation to a skip it unless you're really into it. Just reach the normal ending, then download a save from the web to play the true endings
    They should have included an option to replay final levels after finishing Route B.
        They definitely learned from most of their mistakes in Replicant. Having chapter select in Automata made things so much better.
    The second playthrough has a lot of new content though, and the third playthrough has just enough to justify the 2 or so hours it takes to finish that half of the game.
        No, they don't. there's also no reason why that content wasn't included in the first playthrough or couldn't at least be shown in a more time efficient way. It's 99% of the time the same bossfights and the same quests and dialogue over again. It's not 2 hours, it's way more, especially if you play on hard. Seeing the same scenes three times really makes them lose their impact.

2 times sure, it's a nice way to make the player better understand the story, reflect on the dramatic irony, and the dialogue is nice. But the third time is an insult. And then you have to replay the start of the game with no difference to get to the real ending....
            >there's also no reason why that content wasn't included in the first playthrough or couldn't at least be shown in a more time efficient way.

Putting it in the first playthrough defeats the purpose. The first playthrough (of both main NieR games) is styled as a generic RPG where you slay bizarre bosses/enemies, while the second playthrough adds context to each of the bosses to explain their actions.

>It's not 2 hours, it's way more,

Absolutely not true. I did the speedrun achievement for the game (which is the ENTIRE game, not just the last portion, which is all you have to replay) in about 4.5 hours, with no knowledge of nier speedrunning, just from walking directly to each objective and skipping sidequests. The latter segment of the game is very short if you just walk directly to every objective.

>especially if you play on hard

...then don't do that? Why would you play on hard if you want the game to be quicker?

>Seeing the same scenes three times really makes them lose their impact.

...what an earth? Were you even watching them? Essentially every scene was given additional dialogue and context. You can literally hear each shade talk. There's only a handful of scenes in the game that *aren't* changed.
                This is stockholm syndrome at its best 😂

While the addition of shade talks is interesting but not plot-changing (I think that they fact they're humans is pretty obvious from the start, since they also lose blood), certainly it's not interesting the second time around and the normal plot certainly isn't the third time

Maybe i'm just a worse gamer than you are, but if you call running for hours from objective to objective for 4 extra hours (assuming you're right about 2 hours completion, which imo you're not) engaging then I think we have different ideas about what engaging means.

I like playing games on hard difficulty, I shouldn't be penalized for choosing the difficulty I want nor treated as a second class citizen. If the hard playthrough is more boring because it's more wprk to play theough the scenes thrice, then it's on the developer's, not on me. I'm technically not even supposed to know how the game works, the devs need to balance it.
                    How dare you don't agree with me! You must have Stockholm syndrome!

I feel like it's extremely easy to figure out how long playthrough b is. Considering there's hundred of full videos on youtube. [Each taking roughly 4 hours. Lol](https://youtu.be/RQgARAx17Zo)

But I guess being a salty ass about it, is a better argument.
                        Nier Replicant is a terrible game because it just asks too much of the player while giving back so little. Incredibly overrated. Subjective opinions can be wrong, and yours simply is. It's absurd you consider 8 hours (at least) of useless padding acceptable, especially when condensed all together, especially in a game that isn't that much long. 

Like, I too enjoyed DMC4, but I won't deny that the second half of the game is literally the first half copy pasted. Thankfully they give you a new character to explore and the combat is amazing. Nier Replicant does the same, but only adds a couple lines of dialogue which were very easily intelligible from the context anyways the first time around.   


I dunno. The game is called "Nier REPLICANT", the shades lose actual blood. Coming from Nier Automata, it isn't that difficult to make the connection that shades are actually humans. And that you're not human. It's just, I was expecting more from the missing dialogue, but it's just obvious "guilt trip" stuff that was very evident the first time around. And there are basically no gameplay changes. So I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
                            That's fine it's your opinion doesn't make someone brainwashed for thinking different. Have some common sense lol
To me, this game felt like Yoko's Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Even with the time skip and everything. The story beats are similar and it even has a dark link. 

I did enjoy the game and played all the endings. To be honest, I am not a big fan of having to replay a game several times to get the endings, but I did like the endings so whatever.
I have to finish this game, I loved Automata so much so I was excited to play this. Then I got mad at myself and stopped playing because I accidentally progressed the game before finishing a side quest that you can only finish in the first half of the game. 😅
I need to go back and finish this game.  20+ years ago with all the time in the world, I would have loved it, but I played through that intro 3 times before I could finally save.  Now it's been 4 months since I took a break, probably only 1/3 of the way through it and I can't remember what's going on.  I'd like to start over, but I really don't want to play that beginning again.
I would say I prefer replicant aswell, the combat is too easy tho, and the harder difficulty just makes enemies insanely spongey not actually a threat. With that said when I stumbled into the diary arenas under levelled I had a blast, the combat system is fantastic when it pushes back but it so rarely does.

As for the story I would a
Say as good as automata was it’s story is mostly focused around it’s themes, and while not bad it just hits different against replicant whose story focused squarely on its characters
It’s defienlty one of my favorite games ever for its story, music, and characters. But man is it flawed with the fetch quests and having to repeat route c/d. Don’t even get me started on the platinum trophy. But in the end it was still all worth it because I adore the game. To me this game is a 10/10 but I know gameplay wise it’s probably a 6.5 or 7. I like it better than automata even though gameplay wise, automata is better in every way
Great game. Glad you dug it. I prefer old man Nier in the original western release over young Japanese release/Replicant Nier.  A father caring for his sick  daughter resonates a lot more with me compared to a brother caring for his sick sister.
Playing it right now!!! Fun fact: I can run this game on my 400 dollar laptop at the lowest settings.
I love Replicant and I think it blows Automata out of the water due to its character and stories.  I also played Replicant first, so not sure if that muddied my view of Automata as it mostly felt like a downgrade other than combat was a little bit better
I prefer Replicant to Automata but I found the third playthrough of the game to be entirely a waste of time aside from the new ending. That is the big flaw of the game to me.
So at which point does the game get good? I've put maybe 10-12 hours in the game, and I feel like all I've done is run back and forth across the map a bunch of times. Granted, I keep picking up side quests that I feel like I need to complete, but should I be skipping those?

I originally tried NieR on PS3 and put it down due to boredom and generally being less interested in gaming at that time in my life. This time, I started again with Replicant and told myself I'd force my way through until it gets better, but I haven't seen the light at the end of the tunnel yet.

I've found myself playing something else more and more often until now I haven't picked up NieR: Replicant in probably a week or two.
    Google recommended side quests. Skip the unnecessary. Collect all weapons. Get all endings.

Or... finish Route A. Watch alternate scenes from Route B and C on YouTube. Watch Endings B-E.

The first option is much more fun tho.
    > So at which point does the game get good?

It kind of doesn't. As much as I love the game the story and characters do all the heavy lifting. If you're not into the story enough to want to see the different endings and such then its probably just not a game for you. If you're that far in you should be close to getting the first ending. When I first played it I wasn't super into the game but was intrigued by the story and how Yoko Toro tells his stories. When I got to the first ending I was completely hooked and continued to get all endings even though I had initially planned to get ending A and watch the rest on youtube.
        The last thing I completed was rescuing the prince from the Barren Temple, and my next objective is to head to the Forest of Myth, if I remember correctly. However, the game has sent me back and forth to places too many times without anything meaningful happening.

I like RPGs, so I'm no stranger to a story and characters carrying the weight of a game, but so far, the characters haven't given me a reason to care about them and be attached yet. Maybe I just need a break, who knows... The beginning of the game sets a great premise, so I'd hate to give up on it.
            > but so far, the characters haven't given me a reason to care about them and be attached yet.

I felt pretty much the same way until the ending. I thought the game was mediocre and wasn't all too invested in the story then I got to the first ending and things started to get crazy and I was completely hooked. It sounds like you're close to the end, so you could stick it out and see if the ending changes your mind, but theres also nothing wrong with dropping the game and moving on. The game certainly isn't for everyone and if you're not feeling it now it might be a waste of time to try and force yourself to like it.
I really wish i was a fan of Nier. The gameplay is mediocre and don't like how you have to beat the game a couple times to get the full story. Big fan of the OST tho.

What sidequests were mandatory but unimportant?

>Granted, NieR: Automata suffers from the same, but at least it was a unique and interesting experience.

Replicant predates automata, and is considerably more unique.

>The text-adventure style sections were a horrid example of this

Doesn't automata have WAY more text segments?

            >"kill sheep to get X mutton" or "kill enemies at location X". In my opinion that's even worse.

The point of quests like these isn't to complete the chores, it's to drive the story forward. You have to harvest the mutton from the sheep because that's where you first meet shades (after the intro section), which sets up the idea that it's not common to see shades this close to the town, or during the day. Especially observant players will notice that those shades don't actually attack you until you attack them first. Nothing about the quest is designed to get you to harvest sheep, it's the game introducing lore without Popola just reading it out to you.

>the original version of Replicant was not available outside of Japan until this remade version released after Automata.

This isn't true at all. The original NieR was released worldwide, the only difference is that it was released with an older protagonist outside of Japan.
Honest question: what's your favorite PC game?
Well I definitely wont forget this game. The story worked as a whole, but forced drama in probably every episode separatedly was so annoying I almost dropped the game. And also its the only time I honestly felt like the soundtrack was too good for everything else
    Replicant/Gestalt wouldn't be half the game it is without that fantastic soundtrack.
Automata is just a better game. Everything in Replicant is similar to Automata but worse. The combat is simpler, the map is smaller, there are less OST tracks, main story is shorter, playthroughs are way more repetitive, side quests are much more mundane and tedious. By the time I finished the game I just wanted to be done with it.
And it had a hot chick with a big dick.
Replicant is the one on android?
    No it's the first game in the series. It's on PC and Consoles.
    That's Reincarnation, a gacha which has no real connection to the mainline Nier games.
Out of curiosity, did you play the original or the remake/remaster/extended cut, whatever it can be called
    The remake. NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139...
Do you need to play automata before playing replicant?
    Replicant is actually the first game in the series, so no. But I strongly recommend playing them both. Automata is more accessible though.
I was interested in this game after loving Nier Automata so much, but the vague opinions of the game before that were basically its "not as good as/ different from Nier Automata" while also complaining about the issue of apparently boring side quests kinda turned me away to look at other games. I know that the vagueness was somewhat due to not wanting to spoil the story though, I guess it's just that Automata seemed more appealing despite a lack of plot back then, or now I can envision what to expect from the series in story/gameplay quality. Maybe I'll buy it one day to try it for myself since I loved Automata so much, which is another game I bought a whim after hearing about how beautiful it was in the first place, despite also having quirks in the gameplay showcases like a barren world that made suspicious of the game before as well.
You shouldn't trust a thing I say. Trust me.
Trust me bro
To play devils advocate, I also trusted Reddit with this game and was greatly disappointed by the vast and empty open world. This game is certainly not for everybody.
    It's not really an open world game... it's more in the style of pre-BOTW Zelda, where there's a linear story but sidequests scattered throughout
    Most of the best games worth playing aren't for everyone. Games that take risks inherently aren't for everyone.
    Well it's Nier. One of the main appeals of Nier is that it's genre-breaking. Which automatically also means that none of the genres is fully fleshed out. You go from open-world to hack-n-slash to retro shooter to platformer to visual novel to some odd mini-game to whatever. The whole idea is that the genre should bend around the game, not the game around a specific genre.

For me it worked very well in Automata. I haven't played Replicant yet however.
    Funny enough I found the element of packed "safe towns" connected to each other through these desolate and hostile environments to be pretty good in a world building sense. I also prefer the smaller open world areas of Nier to the larger and emptier expanses in games like BOTW so I definitely understand where you coming from though.
What's a dad game?
    He means the surge of playing a fatherly protagonist in recent games like God of War or The Last of Us.

There where two versions of the game: NieR Replicant for the Japanese market where you play Brother NieR for your sister Yonah, while NieR Gestalt, the version for the western market had you play as Father NieR to your daughter Yonah. It was a unique MC when JRPG where mostly geared towards younger protagonists.
        Thank you.
        Do we know why the switch was made?

I loved Automata, but felt Replicant did not respect your time *whatsoever*. Despite loving the world, the game felt a chore to play for me, which is such a shame as I really wanted more.
    I haven't played Replicant and guess I shouldn't because while I enjoyed Automata it definitely like a chore half way through.
    Lol I never understand when people say shit like "respect your time" because it quantifies art under this weird calculus.

If you spend 40 hours on a game and by the end of it it ingrains itself into your mind to the point where you can't stop thinking about it or it affects your life deeply, then that game 'respects your time' more than if you played 4 10-hour games or 8 5-hour games which merely entertained or mildly intrigued you.

In the first place, if you care so much about your time being respected, video games are like the worst medium ever for that, given that there are enough films, books, or music albums out there that can bestow thematically whole and memorable experiences for less time-investment than your average video game. There are probably enough of those to last a lifetime without having to touch video games at all.
    I just ended up ignoring all the side quests, lore and world-building be damned. I did a couple that were right in front of me, and youtubed any that seemed interesting to see what happened. There's 0 respect for my time in expecting me to run all over the place to find a guy w a gold necklace, and it's crappy that it's required to find out the truth behind a major story beat. I'll be watching the other endings so I can get on to playing Automata. I made myself play the first before touching the second, and I have enjoyed it very much. You couldn't pay me to do these mindless fetch-quests. And imho if you think doing them helps you understand the depth of separation between the revelations of bending the genre to fit the story or some such nonsense, you are a shill that takes Yoko pranking you for deep art and all I can do is laugh
    At least Nier (Replicant) had the excuse of being the first game of its series while being given barely any resources and budget. What's Automata's excuse for making us play through the game all over again but with shittier gameplay (that forces you to play a minigame every 10 seconds mid-battle in order to be efficient) and 90% of the same content for Route B?
        I can't say I know or care past my enjoyment of the time with each game.
        replicant is a spinoff of the Drakengard trilogy, and that mechanic was in those games too (PS2/PS3 era).
Well that's the reason why Automata is the sequel.
The novel sections were incredible to me, I can’t believe someone managed to creatively pull something like that off and actually have it work without being forced or cringe. Very emotionally impactful to me
It might be easy (although I don't know how) but NieR didn't exactly have a mega budget. Which is the easy answer as to why it is like it is. I'm not going to say it doesn't get tedious on the third run for C/D but the budget aspect shouldn't be ignored and played off as design.

> Additionally, the visual novel section was a real piss take by Yoko Taro. It was just white text on a black wall for at least 10 minutes of reading every single playthrough that adds largely nothing to the overall message of the game.

I enjoyed it. Does it really have to contribute to the "overall message" to be worth your (gasp) 10 minutes?

Once again a sequel warps the perspective for many on what was a prequel in both story and the game before it. Heck, on a previous gen console no less. This is exactly why remakes / remasters can be detrimental.
    I really don't believe you can chalk poor design choices up to "low budget" only.

Nier wasn't the first game in its franchise. It was the third (correct me if I'm wrong), and each past game had the same design choices that don't respect your time whatsoever : replay the same shit and grind mindnumbing content just to see a few minutes of extra content.

At this point it's obvious that it's a conscious design choice because that's just how the Yoko Taro wanted his games to be like. **Not** concessions made for one reason or another, financial or not.

I love NieR to death, especially the soundtrack, but brushing off its glaring flaws as if they weren't intentional isn't doing it any service.
        NieR was "third", but Drakengard is literally a musou where you pick missions and that's pretty much what Drakengard 2 is as well. On top of that, Taro was not involved with Drakengard 2 beyond an observing role which is why it's mostly excluded from discussions. Kind of confusing why you even bring the previous games up as a fact if you're not even certain about the games that preceded it.

NieR on the other hand goes for a low budget open/connected world in its design so it's not really the same at all.

>and each past game had the same design choices that don't respect your time whatsoever : replay the same shit and grind mindnumbing content just to see a few minutes of extra content.

Welcome to huge chunk of games with more than one ending. The final ending of Drakengard 1 which was the only real grind to get was a joke ending prior to NieR's existence anyway. 

In NieR you only need all the weapons for the final ending (easy, leveling all to max is another story) and the "grind" isn't really a grind but rather just tedious retreading, which however doesn't take all too long to blast through.

Drakengard 3 getting to final ending is once again pretty easy (it's once again in mission format with stages). Then comes Automata and it's already really easy while the game takes advantage of new characters for retreading content. 

It's not really a stretch to even call NieR the first since it's just different from Drakengard altogether and then with bigger budget and some semblance of knowledge they improved to make the future runs smoother in Automata.
            >Kind of confusing why you even bring the previous games up as a fact if you're not even certain about the games that preceded it.

I bring them up because they're part of the same franchise and share many design aspects. The only reason I said "correct me if I'm wrong" is because, as far as I was aware, Drakengard 1 and 2 were the only games that preceded Nier but I didn't want to say it matter-of-fact in case there was some obscure spin-off I hadn't heard of or something of the sort.

Drakengard 3, since you're mentioning it, follows the same design philosophy which is once again the reason I've watched the final endings on Youtube instead of going through the grind myself, like every other game in the franchise. EXCEPT Automata, which I found handles the whole concept much better and is a testament to the fact that it's possible to have multiple endings without making the experience to get them a total slog to go through. It's the only Drakengard/NieR game of which I've managed to play all the endings myself.

>Welcome to huge chunk of games with more than one ending.

Whether that's true or not is debatable, and regardless, "because others do it" has never been an excuse I was willing to accept to justify a bad decision, in game design or otherwise. Also, what I said above about Automata.
                >"because others do it" has never been an excuse I was willing to accept to justify a bad decision

Maybe, but it is for whatever reason a staple in games. However, I wouldn't place NieR anywhere near the worst of this type of deal. 

>which I found handles the whole concept much better and is a testament to the fact that it's possible to have multiple endings without making the experience to get them a total slog to go through

But like I said, only both of the NieRs share the same structure of the world where as the Drakengards share their mission type progress. Hence why, again, more budget and the previous tedium could be handled better.

Honestly, the only slog part of NieR is that you need to do another round after B ending. For B the repeat is entirely justified where as for C and D it doesn't really add anything.

That said, Taro clearly has a fetish for repeating certain elements in these games as both of his Drakengards end on >!rhythm bullshit!< and NieR on >!save deletion and the sob stories of enemies!< which turned me off from Automata as it was pretty much "been there done that" of an experience.

This honestly seems to boil down to what you consider a grind. I wouldn't consider finding all the weapons in DoD3 or NieR a grind whatsoever (nor blasting through the post-timeskip in 2 hours or so). But upgrading all of them I absolutely would. Drakengard 1 is the sole beast of the lot where it's just an absurd requirement for the final ending partly due to how annoying the requirements for finding the weapons can be.
I have the same feelings about Nier Automata.
>You basically have to play the game five times in a row just to reach the true ending.

"Basically"

You play the game once, and get ending A. You then load in 2/3 of the way through the story and replay the last part but with a large amount of additional lore and content which vastly changes the tone of the game. In the third playthrough you get a couple more cutscenes and a new boss segment for Louise, as well as a new end-game boss and two possible endings. You then play through the first 1/3 of the game again to reach ending E, with a considerable amount of extra content.

So when you say "basically play the game 5 times" you mean "Play the game once, play the last two hours twice more and reload a save" then sure. How can it possibly be taking you "so much time"??? Are you doing all the sidequests again too?
I need to give you an upvote because thats exactly how I felt, the 'development' is buried under hours of filler sidequests & dialogues that give me nothing but pennies. 

It was definitely only worth the first runthrough and the last 3hours, everywhere in between is completely negligible.
Big agree
    As a massive fan of Yoko Taro, I will be the first to agree that the replaying aspects are repetitive. In every game that has them. That seems to be, more or less, the point. The first playthrough sets up what you'd assume the game to be, a serviceable surface level tale that sort of holds up on its own but you know is obviously not the full story. Then it proceeds to deconstruct all of your assumptions about what's going on. You watch your comfortable reality break apart under closer inspection.

That isn't for everyone. Not everyone wants their games to be super meta and just wants a basic thing they can follow along with. If it was for everyone it wouldn't be interesting or unique.
        > Not everyone wants their games to be super meta and just wants a basic thing they can follow along with.

A game isn't automatically good just because it's "super meta". If a game goes for repetition and/or meta-narrative, it immediately amplifies the potential for a less than great core gameplay loop to overstay its welcome.

Look no further than Housemarque for an example of a developer that *really* understands this.
            Why are you bullying that scarecrow so much.
        If you like that kind of story telling you should check out breath of fire dragon quarter. Dying is part of the progress, and you unlock more story as you replay. I loved it
I have only watched a playthrough, so my memory of the game isn't the best, but:

>!I really like what they were going for with the Shades turning out to be humanity, but having the whole playthrough be the same except some key moments turned into "DON'T YOU FEEL BAD NOW?" was lame.!<

I respect Yoko Taro's ideas but he just doesn't make games I can make myself care about.
wow that VN stuff sounds absolutely terrible
This is my plan lol
Oh man I just remembered Beepy.
    I was absolutely crushed. I think of the Fragments that one was the most depressing one for me.
Collecting all the weapons isn't nearly as bad as it seems. There are some missable weapons in the first part but none of them are difficult to obtain. Most of the weapons you need can easily be found while progressing the story, either by basic exploration or purchasing them from weapon shops. There are only a handful of weapons that are locked behind quests, but they're not very hard or time consuming. It seems incredibly daunting, but its really not too bad if you use a guide.
It's an afternoon of work really, I think the original required a rare drop that made it more of a process.
I replayed the original release of NIER during the pandemic and I forgot that you needed to unlock all weapons for one of the endings, which is super tedious when machine oil just never seems to drop. I don't think the recent remaster tweaked this at all either did it?

Doesn't help that the phoenix spear was basically the best weapon and didn't really incentivize others
If this is your biggest fear over the replaying the last third of the game 3 times I can assure you the weapons collecting is embarrassingly simple. I think they even make the earlier "locked" weapons purchaseable. I actually ended up getting all the weapons except one pretty much just by playing normally. Even that last one was just like an hour of grinding which ended up helping to complete two other missions at the time.
FYI there is a new ending added to the remaster for automata fans, so now it would be four times.
    I mean technically there are 26 endings or some shit
Each subsequent playthrough starts you at the half way point. By this time you already know what to do. Once you've collected all the weapons you can BREEZE through it in a couple hours. I was able to finish all three playthroughs in a night and a half. Then the very last ending is about 3 hours long and is MUCH different than the others and finally concludes the story. If you like Kainé then I highly suggest you do it. The entire game, 100% weapons, 91% side quests and 77% words took me 51:33. Absolutely worth it for the mass pounding of feels.
You should at least check Route B alternate cutscenes and Endings C-E. Route A isn't even 50% of the game.
    I played through all the main endings of Automata so I understand there's a lot of the game remaining, but I had just couldn't be bothered. Will be sure to look up the endings online.
I also stopped after I think the second playthrough of replicant as I found it to become a waste of time
    The thing is - you haven't beaten 50% of the game then. If you don't have time to finish it, just watch alternate scenes from Route B and Endings C-E. They're absolutely worth it.
        Yeah I watched them on youtube. But didn't quite get me as Automata. Although the story was good.
They should have included an option to replay final levels after finishing Route B.
    They definitely learned from most of their mistakes in Replicant. Having chapter select in Automata made things so much better.
The second playthrough has a lot of new content though, and the third playthrough has just enough to justify the 2 or so hours it takes to finish that half of the game.
    No, they don't. there's also no reason why that content wasn't included in the first playthrough or couldn't at least be shown in a more time efficient way. It's 99% of the time the same bossfights and the same quests and dialogue over again. It's not 2 hours, it's way more, especially if you play on hard. Seeing the same scenes three times really makes them lose their impact.

2 times sure, it's a nice way to make the player better understand the story, reflect on the dramatic irony, and the dialogue is nice. But the third time is an insult. And then you have to replay the start of the game with no difference to get to the real ending....
        >there's also no reason why that content wasn't included in the first playthrough or couldn't at least be shown in a more time efficient way.

Putting it in the first playthrough defeats the purpose. The first playthrough (of both main NieR games) is styled as a generic RPG where you slay bizarre bosses/enemies, while the second playthrough adds context to each of the bosses to explain their actions.

>It's not 2 hours, it's way more,

Absolutely not true. I did the speedrun achievement for the game (which is the ENTIRE game, not just the last portion, which is all you have to replay) in about 4.5 hours, with no knowledge of nier speedrunning, just from walking directly to each objective and skipping sidequests. The latter segment of the game is very short if you just walk directly to every objective.

>especially if you play on hard

...then don't do that? Why would you play on hard if you want the game to be quicker?

>Seeing the same scenes three times really makes them lose their impact.

...what an earth? Were you even watching them? Essentially every scene was given additional dialogue and context. You can literally hear each shade talk. There's only a handful of scenes in the game that *aren't* changed.
            This is stockholm syndrome at its best 😂

While the addition of shade talks is interesting but not plot-changing (I think that they fact they're humans is pretty obvious from the start, since they also lose blood), certainly it's not interesting the second time around and the normal plot certainly isn't the third time

Maybe i'm just a worse gamer than you are, but if you call running for hours from objective to objective for 4 extra hours (assuming you're right about 2 hours completion, which imo you're not) engaging then I think we have different ideas about what engaging means.

I like playing games on hard difficulty, I shouldn't be penalized for choosing the difficulty I want nor treated as a second class citizen. If the hard playthrough is more boring because it's more wprk to play theough the scenes thrice, then it's on the developer's, not on me. I'm technically not even supposed to know how the game works, the devs need to balance it.
                How dare you don't agree with me! You must have Stockholm syndrome!

I feel like it's extremely easy to figure out how long playthrough b is. Considering there's hundred of full videos on youtube. [Each taking roughly 4 hours. Lol](https://youtu.be/RQgARAx17Zo)

But I guess being a salty ass about it, is a better argument.
                    Nier Replicant is a terrible game because it just asks too much of the player while giving back so little. Incredibly overrated. Subjective opinions can be wrong, and yours simply is. It's absurd you consider 8 hours (at least) of useless padding acceptable, especially when condensed all together, especially in a game that isn't that much long. 

Like, I too enjoyed DMC4, but I won't deny that the second half of the game is literally the first half copy pasted. Thankfully they give you a new character to explore and the combat is amazing. Nier Replicant does the same, but only adds a couple lines of dialogue which were very easily intelligible from the context anyways the first time around.   


I dunno. The game is called "Nier REPLICANT", the shades lose actual blood. Coming from Nier Automata, it isn't that difficult to make the connection that shades are actually humans. And that you're not human. It's just, I was expecting more from the missing dialogue, but it's just obvious "guilt trip" stuff that was very evident the first time around. And there are basically no gameplay changes. So I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
                        That's fine it's your opinion doesn't make someone brainwashed for thinking different. Have some common sense lol
Google recommended side quests. Skip the unnecessary. Collect all weapons. Get all endings.

Or... finish Route A. Watch alternate scenes from Route B and C on YouTube. Watch Endings B-E.

The first option is much more fun tho.
> So at which point does the game get good?

It kind of doesn't. As much as I love the game the story and characters do all the heavy lifting. If you're not into the story enough to want to see the different endings and such then its probably just not a game for you. If you're that far in you should be close to getting the first ending.

I like RPGs, so I'm no stranger to a story and characters carrying the weight of a game, but so far, the characters haven't given me a reason to care about them and be attached yet. Maybe I just need a break, who knows... The beginning of the game sets a great premise, so I'd hate to give up on it.
        > but so far, the characters haven't given me a reason to care about them and be attached yet.

I felt pretty much the same way until the ending. I thought the game was mediocre and wasn't all too invested in the story then I got to the first ending and things started to get crazy and I was completely hooked. It sounds like you're close to the end, so you could stick it out and see if the ending changes your mind, but theres also nothing wrong with dropping the game and moving on. The game certainly isn't for everyone and if you're not feeling it now it might be a waste of time to try and force yourself to like it.

What sidequests were mandatory but unimportant?

>Granted, NieR: Automata suffers from the same, but at least it was a unique and interesting experience.

Replicant predates automata, and is considerably more unique.

        >"kill sheep to get X mutton" or "kill enemies at location X". In my opinion that's even worse.

The point of quests like these isn't to complete the chores, it's to drive the story forward. You have to harvest the mutton from the sheep because that's where you first meet shades (after the intro section), which sets up the idea that it's not common to see shades this close to the town, or during the day. Especially observant players will notice that those shades don't actually attack you until you attack them first. Nothing about the quest is designed to get you to harvest sheep, it's the game introducing lore without Popola just reading it out to you.

There where two versions of the game: NieR Replicant for the Japanese market where you play Brother NieR for your sister Yonah, while NieR Gestalt, the version for the western market had you play as Father NieR to your daughter Yonah. It was a unique MC when JRPG where mostly geared towards younger protagonists.
    Thank you.
    Do we know why the switch was made?
I haven't played Replicant and guess I shouldn't because while I enjoyed Automata it definitely like a chore half way through.
Lol I never understand when people say shit like "respect your time" because it quantifies art under this weird calculus.

If you spend 40 hours on a game and by the end of it it ingrains itself into your mind to the point where you can't stop thinking about it or it affects your life deeply, then that game 'respects your time' more than if you played 4 10-hour games or 8 5-hour games which merely entertained or mildly intrigued you.

In the first place, if you care so much about your time being respected, video games are like the worst medium ever for that, given that there are enough films, books, or music albums out there that can bestow thematically whole and memorable experiences for less time-investment than your average video game. There are probably enough of those to last a lifetime without having to touch video games at all.
I just ended up ignoring all the side quests, lore and world-building be damned. I did a couple that were right in front of me, and youtubed any that seemed interesting to see what happened. There's 0 respect for my time in expecting me to run all over the place to find a guy w a gold necklace, and it's crappy that it's required to find out the truth behind a major story beat. I'll be watching the other endings so I can get on to playing Automata. I made myself play the first before touching the second, and I have enjoyed it very much. You couldn't pay me to do these mindless fetch-quests. And imho if you think doing them helps you understand the depth of separation between the revelations of bending the genre to fit the story or some such nonsense, you are a shill that takes Yoko pranking you for deep art and all I can do is laugh
At least Nier (Replicant) had the excuse of being the first game of its series while being given barely any resources and budget. What's Automata's excuse for making us play through the game all over again but with shittier gameplay (that forces you to play a minigame every 10 seconds mid-battle in order to be efficient) and 90% of the same content for Route B?
    I can't say I know or care past my enjoyment of the time with each game.
    replicant is a spinoff of the Drakengard trilogy, and that mechanic was in those games too (PS2/PS3 era).
I really don't believe you can chalk poor design choices up to "low budget" only.

Nier wasn't the first game in its franchise. It was the third (correct me if I'm wrong), and each past game had the same design choices that don't respect your time whatsoever : replay the same shit and grind mindnumbing content just to see a few minutes of extra content.

At this point it's obvious that it's a conscious design choice because that's just how the Yoko Taro wanted his games to be like. **Not** concessions made for one reason or another, financial or not.

I love NieR to death, especially the soundtrack, but brushing off its glaring flaws as if they weren't intentional isn't doing it any service.
    NieR was "third", but Drakengard is literally a musou where you pick missions and that's pretty much what Drakengard 2 is as well. On top of that, Taro was not involved with Drakengard 2 beyond an observing role which is why it's mostly excluded from discussions. Kind of confusing why you even bring the previous games up as a fact if you're not even certain about the games that preceded it.

NieR on the other hand goes for a low budget open/connected world in its design so it's not really the same at all.

>and each past game had the same design choices that don't respect your time whatsoever : replay the same shit and grind mindnumbing content just to see a few minutes of extra content.

Welcome to huge chunk of games with more than one ending. The final ending of Drakengard 1 which was the only real grind to get was a joke ending prior to NieR's existence anyway. 

In NieR you only need all the weapons for the final ending (easy, leveling all to max is another story) and the "grind" isn't really a grind but rather just tedious retreading, which however doesn't take all too long to blast through.

Drakengard 3 getting to final ending is once again pretty easy (it's once again in mission format with stages). Then comes Automata and it's already really easy while the game takes advantage of new characters for retreading content. 

It's not really a stretch to even call NieR the first since it's just different from Drakengard altogether and then with bigger budget and some semblance of knowledge they improved to make the future runs smoother in Automata.
        >Kind of confusing why you even bring the previous games up as a fact if you're not even certain about the games that preceded it.

I bring them up because they're part of the same franchise and share many design aspects. The only reason I said "correct me if I'm wrong" is because, as far as I was aware, Drakengard 1 and 2 were the only games that preceded Nier but I didn't want to say it matter-of-fact in case there was some obscure spin-off I hadn't heard of or something of the sort.

Drakengard 3, since you're mentioning it, follows the same design philosophy which is once again the reason I've watched the final endings on Youtube instead of going through the grind myself, like every other game in the franchise. EXCEPT Automata, which I found handles the whole concept much better and is a testament to the fact that it's possible to have multiple endings without making the experience to get them a total slog to go through. It's the only Drakengard/NieR game of which I've managed to play all the endings myself.

>Welcome to huge chunk of games with more than one ending.

Whether that's true or not is debatable, and regardless, "because others do it" has never been an excuse I was willing to accept to justify a bad decision, in game design or otherwise. Also, what I said above about Automata.
            >"because others do it" has never been an excuse I was willing to accept to justify a bad decision

Maybe, but it is for whatever reason a staple in games. However, I wouldn't place NieR anywhere near the worst of this type of deal. 

>which I found handles the whole concept much better and is a testament to the fact that it's possible to have multiple endings without making the experience to get them a total slog to go through

But like I said, only both of the NieRs share the same structure of the world where as the Drakengards share their mission type progress. Hence why, again, more budget and the previous tedium could be handled better.

Honestly, the only slog part of NieR is that you need to do another round after B ending. For B the repeat is entirely justified where as for C and D it doesn't really add anything.

That said, Taro clearly has a fetish for repeating certain elements in these games as both of his Drakengards end on >!rhythm bullshit!< and NieR on >!save deletion and the sob stories of enemies!< which turned me off from Automata as it was pretty much "been there done that" of an experience.

This honestly seems to boil down to what you consider a grind. I wouldn't consider finding all the weapons in DoD3 or NieR a grind whatsoever (nor blasting through the post-timeskip in 2 hours or so). But upgrading all of them I absolutely would. Drakengard 1 is the sole beast of the lot where it's just an absurd requirement for the final ending partly due to how annoying the requirements for finding the weapons can be.
As a massive fan of Yoko Taro, I will be the first to agree that the replaying aspects are repetitive. In every game that has them. That seems to be, more or less, the point. The first playthrough sets up what you'd assume the game to be, a serviceable surface level tale that sort of holds up on its own but you know is obviously not the full story. Then it proceeds to deconstruct all of your assumptions about what's going on. You watch your comfortable reality break apart under closer inspection.

That isn't for everyone. Not everyone wants their games to be super meta and just wants a basic thing they can follow along with. If it was for everyone it wouldn't be interesting or unique.
    > Not everyone wants their games to be super meta and just wants a basic thing they can follow along with.

A game isn't automatically good just because it's "super meta". If a game goes for repetition and/or meta-narrative, it immediately amplifies the potential for a less than great core gameplay loop to overstay its welcome.

Look no further than Housemarque for an example of a developer that *really* understands this.
        Why are you bullying that scarecrow so much.
    If you like that kind of story telling you should check out breath of fire dragon quarter. Dying is part of the progress, and you unlock more story as you replay. I loved it
I was absolutely crushed. I think of the Fragments that one was the most depressing one for me.
I mean technically there are 26 endings or some shit
I played through all the main endings of Automata so I understand there's a lot of the game remaining, but I had just couldn't be bothered. Will be sure to look up the endings online.
The thing is - you haven't beaten 50% of the game then. If you don't have time to finish it, just watch alternate scenes from Route B and Endings C-E. They're absolutely worth it.
    Yeah I watched them on youtube. But didn't quite get me as Automata. Although the story was good.
They definitely learned from most of their mistakes in Replicant. Having chapter select in Automata made things so much better.
No, they don't. there's also no reason why that content wasn't included in the first playthrough or couldn't at least be shown in a more time efficient way. It's 99% of the time the same bossfights and the same quests and dialogue over again. It's not 2 hours, it's way more, especially if you play on hard. Seeing the same scenes three times really makes them lose their impact.

2 times sure, it's a nice way to make the player better understand the story, reflect on the dramatic irony, and the dialogue is nice. But the third time is an insult. And then you have to replay the start of the game with no difference to get to the real ending....
    >there's also no reason why that content wasn't included in the first playthrough or couldn't at least be shown in a more time efficient way.

Putting it in the first playthrough defeats the purpose. The first playthrough (of both main NieR games) is styled as a generic RPG where you slay bizarre bosses/enemies, while the second playthrough adds context to each of the bosses to explain their actions.

>It's not 2 hours, it's way more,

Absolutely not true. I did the speedrun achievement for the game (which is the ENTIRE game, not just the last portion, which is all you have to replay) in about 4.5 hours, with no knowledge of nier speedrunning, just from walking directly to each objective and skipping sidequests. The latter segment of the game is very short if you just walk directly to every objective.

>especially if you play on hard

...then don't do that? Why would you play on hard if you want the game to be quicker?

>Seeing the same scenes three times really makes them lose their impact.

...what an earth? Were you even watching them? Essentially every scene was given additional dialogue and context. You can literally hear each shade talk. There's only a handful of scenes in the game that *aren't* changed.
        This is stockholm syndrome at its best 😂

While the addition of shade talks is interesting but not plot-changing (I think that they fact they're humans is pretty obvious from the start, since they also lose blood), certainly it's not interesting the second time around and the normal plot certainly isn't the third time

Maybe i'm just a worse gamer than you are, but if you call running for hours from objective to objective for 4 extra hours (assuming you're right about 2 hours completion, which imo you're not) engaging then I think we have different ideas about what engaging means.

I like playing games on hard difficulty, I shouldn't be penalized for choosing the difficulty I want nor treated as a second class citizen. If the hard playthrough is more boring because it's more wprk to play theough the scenes thrice, then it's on the developer's, not on me. I'm technically not even supposed to know how the game works, the devs need to balance it.
            How dare you don't agree with me! You must have Stockholm syndrome!

I feel like it's extremely easy to figure out how long playthrough b is. Considering there's hundred of full videos on youtube. [Each taking roughly 4 hours. Lol](https://youtu.be/RQgARAx17Zo)

But I guess being a salty ass about it, is a better argument.
                Nier Replicant is a terrible game because it just asks too much of the player while giving back so little. Incredibly overrated. Subjective opinions can be wrong, and yours simply is. It's absurd you consider 8 hours (at least) of useless padding acceptable, especially when condensed all together, especially in a game that isn't that much long. 

Like, I too enjoyed DMC4, but I won't deny that the second half of the game is literally the first half copy pasted. Thankfully they give you a new character to explore and the combat is amazing. Nier Replicant does the same, but only adds a couple lines of dialogue which were very easily intelligible from the context anyways the first time around.   


I dunno. The game is called "Nier REPLICANT", the shades lose actual blood. Coming from Nier Automata, it isn't that difficult to make the connection that shades are actually humans. And that you're not human. It's just, I was expecting more from the missing dialogue, but it's just obvious "guilt trip" stuff that was very evident the first time around. And there are basically no gameplay changes. So I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
                    That's fine it's your opinion doesn't make someone brainwashed for thinking different. Have some common sense lol
The last thing I completed was rescuing the prince from the Barren Temple, and my next objective is to head to the Forest of Myth, if I remember correctly. However, the game has sent me back and forth to places too many times without anything meaningful happening.

I like RPGs, so I'm no stranger to a story and characters carrying the weight of a game, but so far, the characters haven't given me a reason to care about them and be attached yet. Maybe I just need a break, who knows... The beginning of the game sets a great premise, so I'd hate to give up on it.
    > but so far, the characters haven't given me a reason to care about them and be attached yet.

I felt pretty much the same way until the ending. I thought the game was mediocre and wasn't all too invested in the story then I got to the first ending and things started to get crazy and I was completely hooked. It sounds like you're close to the end, so you could stick it out and see if the ending changes your mind, but theres also nothing wrong with dropping the game and moving on. The game certainly isn't for everyone and if you're not feeling it now it might be a waste of time to try and force yourself to like it.

    >"kill sheep to get X mutton" or "kill enemies at location X". In my opinion that's even worse.

The point of quests like these isn't to complete the chores, it's to drive the story forward. You have to harvest the mutton from the sheep because that's where you first meet shades (after the intro section), which sets up the idea that it's not common to see shades this close to the town, or during the day. Especially observant players will notice that those shades don't actually attack you until you attack them first. Nothing about the quest is designed to get you to harvest sheep, it's the game introducing lore without Popola just reading it out to you.

>the original version of Replicant was not available outside of Japan until this remade version released after Automata.

This isn't true at all. The original NieR was released worldwide, the only difference is that it was released with an older protagonist outside of Japan.
Thank you.

But like I said, only both of the NieRs share the same structure of the world where as the Drakengards share their mission type progress. Hence why, again, more budget and the previous tedium could be handled better.

Honestly, the only slog part of NieR is that you need to do another round after B ending. For B the repeat is entirely justified where as for C and D it doesn't really add anything.

That said, Taro clearly has a fetish for repeating certain elements in these games as both of his Drakengards end on >!rhythm bullshit!< and NieR on >!save deletion and the sob stories of enemies!< which turned me off from Automata as it was pretty much "been there done that" of an experience.

This honestly seems to boil down to what you consider a grind. I wouldn't consider finding all the weapons in DoD3 or NieR a grind whatsoever (nor blasting through the post-timeskip in 2 hours or so). But upgrading all of them I absolutely would. Drakengard 1 is the sole beast of the lot where it's just an absurd requirement for the final ending partly due to how annoying the requirements for finding the weapons can be.
How dare you don't agree with me! You must have Stockholm syndrome!

I feel like it's extremely easy to figure out how long playthrough b is. Considering there's hundred of full videos on youtube. [Each taking roughly 4 hours. Lol](https://youtu.be/RQgARAx17Zo)

But I guess being a salty ass about it, is a better argument.
    Nier Replicant is a terrible game because it just asks too much of the player while giving back so little. Incredibly overrated. Subjective opinions can be wrong, and yours simply is. It's absurd you consider 8 hours (at least) of useless padding acceptable, especially when condensed all together, especially in a game that isn't that much long. 

Like, I too enjoyed DMC4, but I won't deny that the second half of the game is literally the first half copy pasted. Thankfully they give you a new character to explore and the combat is amazing. Nier Replicant does the same, but only adds a couple lines of dialogue which were very easily intelligible from the context anyways the first time around.   


I dunno. The game is called "Nier REPLICANT", the shades lose actual blood. Coming from Nier Automata, it isn't that difficult to make the connection that shades are actually humans. And that you're not human. It's just, I was expecting more from the missing dialogue, but it's just obvious "guilt trip" stuff that was very evident the first time around. And there are basically no gameplay changes. So I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
        That's fine it's your opinion doesn't make someone brainwashed for thinking different. Have some common sense lol
