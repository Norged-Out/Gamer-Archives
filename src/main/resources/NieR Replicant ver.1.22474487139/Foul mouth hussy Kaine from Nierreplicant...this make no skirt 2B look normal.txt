[[Foul mouth hussy Kaine from Nierreplicant...this make no skirt 2B look normal]]





I love Kaine, and I get that the outfit is a fuck you to the haters, but man…. I wish I could play this game without my wife making fun of me
    Hey, at least you have a wife
    Aw cute
    And here I am over here making fun of my wife for spending real money on the 2b outfit in FF14.

Neither of us has played Nier tho. I should have when it was on Gamepass 😔
        I did. It’s so great I still hate myself for being broke when it was like half off after it left GP.
        I’m pretty sure you can only get the 2B outfit through one of the Nier Alliance raids
            Well shit my wife confirms this. I must be confusing it with someone else.. sorry for the misinformation.
        Why would you do that the raid give the outfit for free.
Honestly it's the weird little triangle cut outs on the bra and panties that are the most baffling to me. They make for what I can only imagine to be the weirdest case of "*still* not enough skin showing! Needs MORE exposure!"

Like damn, Yoko Taro, just make her literally naked at that point. I'd respect you more for it.
    That’s not possible it would be porn if he made her naked

    She could destroy you with words worst than "ew no" if she dont like you 

There a reason why she called "Foul mouth hussy"
        Even better
        Why do you think we’re saying *Would*

Yoko Taro is a genius, but he is also very horny.
    The best kind of genius tbh
    Duality of game dev
The idea that the village waas misgendering her so her grandma made her super revealing lingerie is still so funny to me
    Wait is that seriously her lore???? 😂
        It's actually that Kaine is intersex and was shunned by the village because of it.
            Huh, how did the village know she was intersex? Someone in the comments the “machine” that made her malfunctioned or smth like that? 

Also did her grandma really sew skimpy clothes for her granddaughter to get the villagers to stop misgendering her cus that’s kinda hilarious ngl
                In the world of Neir, humanity was wiped out thousands of years before the start of the game by a pathogen from another world (See Drakengard 1's Tokyo ending). Before humans went extinct, they instituted Project Gestalt which involved separating humans from their souls.

So, the 'humans' are artificial beings called Replicants created to serve as a container for the souls to be returned to. But the program was a failure and the errant human souls became monsters called Shades.

The human that Kaine's Replicant was based off of was female. But an error when her body was produced caused her to become intersex as a Replicant. As a separate issue, she was also possessed by a Shade. In a sense, Kaine is a completed Gestalt because she's a Replicant possessed by a Shade, but the Shade inside of her isn't the human she was meant to host which causes a lot of issues.

Part of the issues is that the Shade possessing her is slowly taking over her body, but it's weakened by sunlight. So the less she wears, the better she can resist it.
                >Also did her grandma really sew skimpy clothes for her granddaughter to get the villagers to stop misgendering her cus that’s kinda hilarious ngl

From what i remember it's the last thing she did for her and that's why she wears it

&#x200B;

As well as a fuck you to the village
                They bullied her and forcefully took her clothes off, IIRC.
People always talk about how amazing this game is and how deep the story is but the costumes are just laughable.
    You know the best part:

In that game, if you stare at her panties too long she kick your camera back to supposed third person view

If you stare her for the 10th time she will KILL you for it with "daredevil" achievement unlock

"Sheesh lady let me get you a proper suit...."

        Is that a Nier Reincarnation costume?
            Yeah, the alt costumes in Reincarnation are pretty good for all the Nier characters
                Fucking love that game, too bad I lost my account due to that Facebook thing
                    What facebook thing?
                        Facebook account login doesn’t work, for some reason, effectively killing my account. Many people have had this issue
        That’s hilarious
        Really? That's hilarious!
    Emil looks awesome and i stand by that
    It’s the main reason I never finished playing the original on PS3. I could not take anything about the game seriously based on how the characters looked.
[deleted]
    The remake is pretty fun. Honestly my favorite out of the two (Mostly because of Emil, but everyone likes Emil) It's smaller mapwise than Automata but still has the "run from zone to zone thing" it does. Other than that, yeah I recommend
        [deleted]
            Absolutely! Just like Automata's. The endings closed out the game well, not to mention the remake adds a completely new ending to wrap up the whole rather nicely too. But the fact that you need all the weapons can be a bit annoying but the quests in Replicant are a bit more personal and can really gut punch you sometimes. Granted you still have your super tedious fetch quests as well as the heart stomping ones. But my advice MAKE TWO SAVE SLOTS BEFORE YOU GET TO ENDING C'S FINAL FIGHT! Saves time
    Automata is overall the better game but Replicant utterly wipes in terms of character and story

The pods don't hold a candle to Weiss. Kaine utterly violates 2B and A2 and the brother himself is far more compelling than 9S.

The Shadowlord himself is a far better antagonist than the brothers

The gameplay is meh. You get nothing from playing it on anytging higher than easy. Its less monotious than a Muso game
    Gameplay is passable, story is almost equal to automata, music is better. 

Just make sure to get the remake. The og’s gameplay was actually booty
    So this is coming from someone who played Automata first and loved it. Honestly, this might be blasphemy because people love Nier, but speaking purely about the gameplay, it's straight ass. Never played the original, just Replicant, and it was such a repetitive, unfun mess. I don't know how many hours I've played cause it's been forever, but it's deff at least like 15-20+ and I dropped it. I think I was in a new route as well. The routes are massive retreads, which just exacerbates the repetition. 

To speak on something other than gameplay, the story, side stories, quests, and lore and what not eventually kinda got old to me because everything just felt like it boiled down to being a sad, bad ending. It stopped being shocking or emotional when I progressed things or finished a side quest and just felt run of the mill. I would just wonder what next fucked up life/ending someone would get. Tho that is just the general tone of Nier, I think it just became a little excessive.

I really don't want to dunk on the game. It's beloved and just because I didn't like it doesn't mean it's bad. All of this is, of course IMO and like I said I haven't finished it. If you enjoy Automata and it's themes then I think trying Replicant is in order. Just be aware the gameplay in Automata is magnitudes better.
        [deleted]
            You're welcome. Glad to know that a lot of the things I said are things that others have said. Paints you a clear picture of the games faults. Worst comes to worst, and you decide not to play it, there are more than enough Nier lore videos for you to get the story in an enjoyable, decidedly more concise manner.
        >the routes are massive retreads; I would just wonder what next fucked up life/ending someone would get

Yo dark souls reference??
            [deleted]
                🤯
    nier is the only reason i grabbed automata when it came out, but i played gestalt (the only way to play nier in the USA until replicant was released) back on the xbox 360. the only difference is if you’re a dad or brother, and uh. yeah, the controls weren’t the best on gestalt, so playing replicant was really fun comparatively. automata is infinitely more floaty gameplay wise than replicant, but imo i think it’s a lore reason. be prepared to get exhausted by how sad everything is if you play replicant, especially if that’s not typically your jam. i love both games, and i love the drakengard/nier verse in general BECAUSE its sad, but not everyone does. if you play replicant, keep in mind that it WILL make automata seem sadder. at least, that’s what i hear from most people who play automata first. definitely worth it imo, especially because replicant technically comes before automata in the timeline lol. good luck with automata though! (and getting all the endings, if you go for all of them, i tear up thinking about some of them)
        [deleted]
            worst case scenario you *could* look up the endings for replicant if you’re the kind of person who can do that (i can’t if only because i have an inability to make playing games easy for myself lmao). but!! yeah, it can be draining after a certain point, but i combatted that by taking week/month long breaks to sort of reignite my ability to be sad and not just. exhausted. my version of exhaustion w the nier/drakengard games is more ‘god. why is this so so sad why can’t yoko taro let them be happy’ than ‘i hate this i never want to play it ever again’, but idk your personal metric for it. 

if the story wasn’t so good for replicant and automata i think i wouldn’t have cared about the characters enough to be sad after a certain point, but it genuinely is. i’m really excited for you for automata!! i think it’s actually a really fun way to get into nier/drakengard, and some fans will disagree with me, but to each their own lol. and if you end up deciding not to get replicant that’s perfectly fine too! some people just like automata the most or don’t want to get replicant or get into the overarching timeline/lore, for reasons i personally agreed with for years before i watched a full main timeline explained video on youtube. then the series became a hyperfixation turned special interest and now i know too much lol
I like that character a lot, but it went just too far with the naked lingerie thing, to the point that for me it is just cringey.
    I mean...I'd wear it, but I couldn't make that work.
        Oh, dont get me wrong, it is very sexy in the right context. Like, very much so.

But in the context of the game, it just feels so out of place and so unecessary horny that it feels cringey for me.
And she has a phat throbbing-
    Personality.
    >"throbbing"

L O R E
Her outfit looks like she should have two little friends popping out of her top. Just thinking it'd be a tad uncomfortable to keep those tucked in at all times.
    Yeah 2B cosplay is cool and all but Kaine cosplay...

Bold move
I am the horniest motherfucker to walk the earth but that just looks stupid man
Why does this exist 💀
    Yoko Taro (El creaturo)

        The creature🪱
I know there's a lore reason and all that, but I genuinely am not a fan of the fight lol
    Lore is Replicant production machine malfuntion make her intersex (is a x gender but doesnt look like one) and she wear like that to show how "feminine" she is
        It’s so baffling to me that they landed on “give the robots gender dysphoria” as an excuse to put her in an outfit strippers would balk at
            Not a robot
            She is not a robot
            Like the others have said she’s from way before the androids were a thing in the timeline. Well at least most of em. And it’s not just that she has gender dysphoria, she’s straight up intersex, she’s got both sets in that lingerie
                [deleted]
                    Oh yeah fr the outfit is goofy as fuck, but she’s not even trans. She’s intersex, she’s got both male and female genitals.
                "Both sets in that lingerie"

Ok i missed this in the lore...WHAT
                    That ain’t even the wildest thing about her. She also fucked a corpse in an audio clip you can unlock. She had a thing for this dude who died and then out of wild emotion about it fuck his corpse in front of the dude’s sister. I think it was his sister if I remember right, but she did it in front of some kind of loved one
        Like I said, I know there's lore and all that, still don't like the design.
        Second lore reason is that she has a Gheist of a murderer in her body that’s slowly taking over her body. Sunlight keeps it at bay, but direct sunlight on the subsume parts would hurt like hell. 

Hence, the bandages over her arm and the maximum amount of skin elsewhere.

imo this outfit has way too much going on with all the cutouts, straps and strings everywhere compared to 2B's more simple dress. Kinda shame, since Kaine is my favorite.
    All nier replicant designs are over designed imo

Except emil

Emil is peak
Her outfit is ridiculous but I love Kaine, she's tied with the twins for my favorite characters from the series. One of my favorite dialogue exchanges was when Emil told Nier all about the campfire stories she told him to help relax and Kaine cuts in with "that's enough, I got a fuckin reputation to upkeep."
My beloved
Something had to give. NieR's design makes up for it

https://preview.redd.it/o0lr387k952c1.jpeg?width=746&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd068b83ba5cba71bff34437534cd98231269be7
Kaine is amazing!

And she's in NiER: Gestalt too. 
The far superior game because it has Father Nier.

I hate that vapid cliché Brother Nier,  in NiER: Replicant. He's so drippy he gets in the way of gameplay.

She is way, way, better than the overated 2B.
Her outfit makes more sense.

She's determined to show she's a lady. 
Also, she lives in a place the sun never sets.
Corset ass cleavage assless booty shorts? Yoko Taro, get help.
    Look at bright side 

2B dress being both creative and being lewd was peak itself
        2B is a gift, but Taro still needs Jesus
Noice
Damn girl why is your whole booty hanging out like that
She's got a corset for her ass.
It’s a lovely design from the front, but the back view is a bit much lol. I’d like it a lot more if they just gave her a normal pair of panties without the cutouts and stuff
I’m going to be completely honest, it’s so hard to take Nier seriously. They have these themes about free will and what ever baked into the story that are honestly very thought provoking and they consistently show off really cool ideas but then they do a complete 180 with it’s constant over sexualization of 2B and other female characters. It’s so frustrating, do you want to be thought provoking and emotionally intelligent or not?
Best waifu in the entire solar system and I you can't tell otherwise.
Why does she have a bra on her ass
    Couldn't tell ya.

Maybe it aids in combat

Working theory: It prevents to clap of her ass cheeks during stealth missions.
    Double cheeked up to the point of anal hinderance
I want her so bad
Honestly she’s actually a really good character 
Despite the outfit choices that even the game lampshades
I would let her verbally annihilate me
hawt
Kaine Parker is better
I think she looks cool, but there's no way to defend it lol.
Would
I really wanna play Replicant, but I always forget to buy it when I have the money or I don't have the money when it's on sale
And this design is good because...?
    It's tagged hated design /nm
        Im legit blind x_x

Thank you kind sir! I just presumed horny redditor, i shouldn't have
            Ofc! I was also confused awhile back when I saw some in this tag cuz I didn't see it, given the tag is black and I'm in dark mode loooool
I mean it's LITERALLY lingerie. Like... it's not even a "tHe CrEaToRs KnEw WhAt ThEy WeRe DoInG!" because literally *anyone* who would look at this would recognize it as babydoll lingerie.

And I think that's the point, something to do with pussy devs trying to get back at haters or whatever, but I really just don't want to play as that character because... why would I?
This is essentially just lingerie. 

The entire design of the androids in nier makes no sense.
Well she has a dick tho
    Some people find that as a win and they scare me.
        My brother does, i live in fear
            Femboys are fine, but uhhhh the other thing I am not fine with.
                I suppose one can find a difference between guys with tits and chicks with dicks

Tempting me to play that game i see
    Is Nier, they tempting you since that girl with "2B"ig dumptruck
I often point out these kinds of costume to my wife and say, “cosplay idea?”

She hasn’t cosplayed as of yet but I’ll get there one day.
    Bold move right there
Her design is great minus the outfit just being pure fan service, her look, and color pallet is great.
i would argue that it’s good design for her lore, because if i had ghost who wanted to permanently delete everyone around me attached to my body, but i myself didn’t want that, i think i’d lean into making people uncomfortable so that i wouldn’t have to hurt anyone. she’s intersex, technically (lore), and the village probably leaves her alone even more now that she wears lingerie only. iirc she can’t feel temperature either, so it works out
    Its good lore but i think yoko was just bricked up
Who wants to tell OP
I would accompany Kaine on a journey just so I can preemptively lay towels wherever she is about to sit and the townspeople would thank me
Leave her alone, she’s doing her best
Hey, at least you have a wife
Aw cute
And here I am over here making fun of my wife for spending real money on the 2b outfit in FF14.

There a reason why she called "Foul mouth hussy"

if the story wasn’t so good for replicant and automata i think i wouldn’t have cared about the characters enough to be sad after a certain point, but it genuinely is. i’m really excited for you for automata!! i think it’s actually a really fun way to get into nier/drakengard, and some fans will disagree with me, but to each their own lol. and if you end up deciding not to get replicant that’s perfectly fine too! some people just like automata the most or don’t want to get replicant or get into the overarching timeline/lore, for reasons i personally agreed with for years before i watched a full main timeline explained video on youtube. then the series became a hyperfixation turned special interest and now i know too much lol
I mean...I'd wear it, but I couldn't make that work.
    Oh, dont get me wrong, it is very sexy in the right context. Like, very much so.

But in the context of the game, it just feels so out of place and so unecessary horny that it feels cringey for me.
Personality.
>"throbbing"

L O R E
Yeah 2B cosplay is cool and all but Kaine cosplay...

Bold move
Yoko Taro (El creaturo)

    The creature🪱
Lore is Replicant production machine malfuntion make her intersex (is a x gender but doesnt look like one) and she wear like that to show how "feminine" she is
    It’s so baffling to me that they landed on “give the robots gender dysphoria” as an excuse to put her in an outfit strippers would balk at
        Not a robot
        She is not a robot
        Like the others have said she’s from way before the androids were a thing in the timeline. Well at least most of em. And it’s not just that she has gender dysphoria, she’s straight up intersex, she’s got both sets in that lingerie
            [deleted]
                Oh yeah fr the outfit is goofy as fuck, but she’s not even trans. She’s intersex, she’s got both male and female genitals.
            "Both sets in that lingerie"

Ok i missed this in the lore...WHAT
                That ain’t even the wildest thing about her. She also fucked a corpse in an audio clip you can unlock. She had a thing for this dude who died and then out of wild emotion about it fuck his corpse in front of the dude’s sister. I think it was his sister if I remember right, but she did it in front of some kind of loved one
    Like I said, I know there's lore and all that, still don't like the design.
    Second lore reason is that she has a Gheist of a murderer in her body that’s slowly taking over her body. Sunlight keeps it at bay, but direct sunlight on the subsume parts would hurt like hell. 

Hence, the bandages over her arm and the maximum amount of skin elsewhere.
All nier replicant designs are over designed imo

Except emil

Emil is peak
Look at bright side 

2B dress being both creative and being lewd was peak itself
    2B is a gift, but Taro still needs Jesus
Couldn't tell ya.

Maybe it aids in combat

Working theory: It prevents to clap of her ass cheeks during stealth missions.
Double cheeked up to the point of anal hinderance
It's tagged hated design /nm
    Im legit blind x_x

Thank you kind sir! I just presumed horny redditor, i shouldn't have
        Ofc! I was also confused awhile back when I saw some in this tag cuz I didn't see it, given the tag is black and I'm in dark mode loooool
Some people find that as a win and they scare me.
    My brother does, i live in fear
        Femboys are fine, but uhhhh the other thing I am not fine with.
            I suppose one can find a difference between guys with tits and chicks with dicks
Is Nier, they tempting you since that girl with "2B"ig dumptruck
Bold move right there
Its good lore but i think yoko was just bricked up
I did. It’s so great I still hate myself for being broke when it was like half off after it left GP.
I’m pretty sure you can only get the 2B outfit through one of the Nier Alliance raids
    Well shit my wife confirms this. I must be confusing it with someone else.. sorry for the misinformation.
Why would you do that the raid give the outfit for free.
Even better
Why do you think we’re saying *Would*
It's actually that Kaine is intersex and was shunned by the village because of it.
    Huh, how did the village know she was intersex? Someone in the comments the “machine” that made her malfunctioned or smth like that? 

Also did her grandma really sew skimpy clothes for her granddaughter to get the villagers to stop misgendering her cus that’s kinda hilarious ngl
        In the world of Neir, humanity was wiped out thousands of years before the start of the game by a pathogen from another world (See Drakengard 1's Tokyo ending). Before humans went extinct, they instituted Project Gestalt which involved separating humans from their souls.

So, the 'humans' are artificial beings called Replicants created to serve as a container for the souls to be returned to. But the program was a failure and the errant human souls became monsters called Shades.

The human that Kaine's Replicant was based off of was female. But an error when her body was produced caused her to become intersex as a Replicant. As a separate issue, she was also possessed by a Shade. In a sense, Kaine is a completed Gestalt because she's a Replicant possessed by a Shade, but the Shade inside of her isn't the human she was meant to host which causes a lot of issues.

Part of the issues is that the Shade possessing her is slowly taking over her body, but it's weakened by sunlight. So the less she wears, the better she can resist it.
        >Also did her grandma really sew skimpy clothes for her granddaughter to get the villagers to stop misgendering her cus that’s kinda hilarious ngl

From what i remember it's the last thing she did for her and that's why she wears it

&#x200B;

As well as a fuck you to the village
        They bullied her and forcefully took her clothes off, IIRC.
Is that a Nier Reincarnation costume?
    Yeah, the alt costumes in Reincarnation are pretty good for all the Nier characters
        Fucking love that game, too bad I lost my account due to that Facebook thing
            What facebook thing?
                Facebook account login doesn’t work, for some reason, effectively killing my account. Many people have had this issue
That’s hilarious
Really? That's hilarious!

    Absolutely! Just like Automata's. The endings closed out the game well, not to mention the remake adds a completely new ending to wrap up the whole rather nicely too. But the fact that you need all the weapons can be a bit annoying but the quests in Replicant are a bit more personal and can really gut punch you sometimes. Granted you still have your super tedious fetch quests as well as the heart stomping ones. But my advice MAKE TWO SAVE SLOTS BEFORE YOU GET TO ENDING C'S FINAL FIGHT! Saves time

    You're welcome. Glad to know that a lot of the things I said are things that others have said. Paints you a clear picture of the games faults. Worst comes to worst, and you decide not to play it, there are more than enough Nier lore videos for you to get the story in an enjoyable, decidedly more concise manner.
>the routes are massive retreads; I would just wonder what next fucked up life/ending someone would get

Yo dark souls reference??
