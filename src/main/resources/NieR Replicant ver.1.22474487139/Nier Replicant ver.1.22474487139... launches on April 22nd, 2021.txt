[[Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139... launches on April 22nd, 2021]]





23rd for steam in US/EU
    that's fine
        It is fine, just happy its even coming to PC so early.
            and I'll be looking forward for another FAR mod to fix the porting issue.
                Fingers crossed its decent this time. Tho since it's still coming out on PS4 it's probably gonna be playable on most newish graphics cards and definitely on the 30 series...
                    Hahaha I don't think so
                I was thinking about getting Automata on steam but i keep hearing the port is super buggy. 

How bad is it?
                    Honestly I’ve had no issues with it but I know lots of people have. From my experience it isn’t too bad at this point though
                    I tend to check reddit and install the FAR mod before I even know there is issue with porting.


So far, from start to finish, I only encounter 1 crash and no bug is found. You experience may vary from me, but I have no issue with the game.
                    It is and it isn't, it varies unfortunately. However at worst it crashes and if you save regularly it wont be too bad, there's also a sale going on and there are mods that help to prevent the crashes. Actually the thing that is the hardest hit against Automata on PC for me is that a controller is near mandatory to play the game.
                    I have a 2060 and I got all achievements with no FAR mod or whatever and it never crashed for me as well as the fact that I played over 100 hours with no issues at all
                        FAR is primarily a mod to fix some broken parts of the graphics engine. Especially the resolution to properly run in to native fullscreen without being blurry mess. Try it, it's a difference as night a day.

The only other mods I used is to have high resolution LoD models on all distances and a high resolution texture fix for the player models. Makes pop-in go away and makes the game feel smoother when traversing through the world. Bot those are very optional.
                        1060x6gb, i5 8600k, 8gb RAM, ssd. No crashes, even fans weren't any busy during the game. For now, with 30xx on sight, this set up ages and cheapens quick.
                            The 8600K is honestly a beast, my brother had it in his PC a couple of months ago before upgrading to the 10700K and he says its one of the best processors he had simply due to how easy it overclocks and how low the temps were
                                Yeah, I was very surprised, as I thought it wouldn't be average at best, but no.
    It would be so nice if my laptop wasn't a potato and I could actually play it
    [deleted]
        PS4, Xbox One, Steam
Looks and sounds so nice! I hope they do something like this to Drakengard too...
    Yeah hope they do a drakengard 3 remaster
        Yeah, thats about the only hope. There is no way in hell they are gonna touch the original again.
            Maybe a remake or a straight port like the ps2 games on ps4 but I doubt they’d do anything else with it
                Yeah nah, Square will never re-associate their brand with the game where you are accompanied by a Cannibal, Pedophile, and Child.
                    Well they already have since nier is a sequel to it
                        Well... just barely. It's a totally different name and brand for the most part. The only people that really even would know they are related are those who have played the first one. Newcomers don't see "Nier" and are like "Isn't that a sequel to the game where you slaughter dozens of possessed children?"

And yeah Drakengard 3 exists in 2013(?) which hurts my point a bit, but I just think if Drak1 were ever retouched... They would probably alter some details of the characters.
                            Well in the translation most of what you mentioned is left up to interpretation apart from the cannibalism and the child soldiers
                    Nani the fuck

Explain
                        Yeahhhhh. Those details weren't the central focus of the plot, but there were still some very spicy character details in that game. 

Granted, 98% of Drak1 players probably quit or didn't replay multiple times to truly grasp those details.
                Id kill for even a straight port. I'd like to replay the first two, but my BC PS3 took a shit.
            Too dark? Or too bad?
                I think I followed up in another comment, but yeah. Honestly too dark.

Your main character has a mission where he murders dozens of possessed kids, and is accompanied by a party consisting of:

* A Cannibal Woman
* A Pedophile
* A Child

While like... 95% of the game could be remade I suppose, there are some touches here and there that Square probably does not want to associate their name with again.

Now, I love Drakengard 1 don't get me wrong. But it's probably something just better left in the past.
                    I know. I played it recently. I feel like it could be done though; it would just be given one of the most unsavory degrees of M ratings and it would probably tank. And I mean even the original was *heavily* censored. Caim and Furiae’s relationship was watered down so much it was essentially platonic in the English version. I think a remake would be a great shot at redemption for its miserable gameplay and censorship, but there is also a great chance it would be censored even more. Assuming it did eventually happen anyways.
        You can definitely play it on the rpcs3 emulator, if you want to play it now. With a little tweaking of course. Also runs great for how buggy that game was on the ps3, 4k60fps.
            Sadly my pc isn’t good enough to run it I can just barely play drakengard 1 with software emulation
*Nier: Replicant ver. 1.22474487139 – an upgraded version of the 2010 Japanese RPG – will be released in Europe and North America for PS4, Xbox One and PC via Steam on April 23, 2021. (Source: IGN)*

This is going to be incredible.
    >	Xbox one

Fuck I might have to do it.
    Not available on ps5/Xbox series?
        Yes, through backwards compatibility.
        At least for playstation, all games released for PS4 after this September I think, are mandatory to also work on the PS5. They don't need to offer any advantages/enhancements, just be compatible to play on.
I can not wait. I've only played automata but, looked a million videos on the whole story of the series. Can't wait to finally play it!
    Can you recommend any videos or channels? I've only played autómata also and would like to know more about the whole series
        Check out Clemps on YouTube he has a great breakdown of the drakengard and nier series in multiple part videos.
            That is exactly who I watched as well. Great videos!
            Clemps is great love his videos, so in-depth.
            RIP PixieValkyrie
                What happened to her channel? I watched her but not very regularly so I’m out of the loop
                    If she explained it, then I missed what happened. She voluntarily deleted all get videos suddenly one night. In a live stream she explained that she wanted to do more than just her YouTube content, but I don't know why that would lead her to delete everything. Either way though, while I miss her content, it was her decision to remove her work I guess.
                        On her twitter she said she just didn't enjoy doing YT anymore. I don't know if she has given a specific reason for removing all her old videos rather than just leaving them and disabling future comments or whatever, but it is what it is.
                        Ah rip, I watched her videos to understand what was going on in NieR and Drakengard even after I watched multiple playthroughs from other ppl
            Thanks! I'll definitely check it out
        Just wait for the game if you dont want major spoilers. Part of the enjoyment comes from the unexpected twists
Reason to survive this shitty year and the next one
Man, the combat looks so much better. Can't wait to visit this world again.
father nier is dead pour one out for papa
    Honestly really disappointed. Why not both? I don't wanna play as this guy, father Nier is the best.
        Because old geezer was forced by idiotic localization studio and it was never supposed to be an actual character.
            Hey, don’t you dare talk about the world’s best dad with such disrespect!!

＼＼\٩(๑`~´๑)۶//／／
            Good thing it happened then lol, he's a much better character imo
                "He's better because he's the only one i played"

fixed
                    Lmao I don't need to play the same game again with a dude who's character design is worse to make my mind up.
                Theyre the same character, how is one 'much better' than the other lol
                    Just the design and relationship with Yonah
                Have you actually played both Gestalt and Replicant to make that claim?
                    Do I really need to replay the game to make my mind up about which design and relationship with Yonah I prefer?
                        Well if you're going to claim one is a "better character" without having played both, you look pretty stupid yes. And the relationships with the other characters (Kaine and Emil especially), which have equal prominence in the story are abjectly worse since they were obviously written with a younger protagonist in mind, so too the timeskip development. They're the same character, but the character writing was done by Taro with a young protagonist in mind, and the arbitrary change to an older one was done by Sqaure Enixs corporate marketing department without much thought given to the story to appeal to westerners, so no significant script changes were done to cover up for the discrepancies it introduced.
                            You didn't need to write a wall my dude, I don't care which you prefer, I played Nier back on 360 to completion. I think it's all fine, a little awkward when he goes on about friendship, but his design and him being a dad is, again like I said, in my opinion, much better than the little boy character. If you're saying they're both the same, then why have an issue with my preference when you clearly prefer the other?
            Yoko Taro ended up liking him more tho.
                Nope, he said he liked him after he was made (though obviously he's not going to say he dislikes him), but he never said anything like that.
                This is simply a lie that was made up by some people that like jelly donuts localization.
            And yet he's so much better, go figure.
        Papa Nier is so much better.
        Would that be Replitalt? Or Gescant?
            Replicant = young Nier/sister Yonah

Gestalt = old man Nier/daughter Yonah
        I don’t have a preference since I only played as papa Nier and it’ll be cool to see the game from the brother’s perspective, but yeah both would’ve been ideal. Like how in DMC3 you can play as Vergil once you beat the game once and it’s basically the same game just with very minor differences. Whatever at least they’re remaking it I guess
            > Whatever at least they’re remaking it I guess

Papa's absence aside, gotta agree, I wondered if they'll sneak in something new
                There will be new stuff, yeah. They confirmed it in an interview. Iirc there’s a few new areas and major characters, and the rest is pretty much being reworked from the ground up. They’re making sure to try to keep the feel of the original though.
    DLC maybe?
    Maybe he’ll be in it somehow since it’s a remake of some sort, who knows. Will be salty if Father Nier isn’t playable or acknowledged at all.
    Yeah I'll be skipping this. I can't stand brother-sister relationships in anime and jrpgs.

Edit: I'm not sure how many here were there in the beginning but having a protagonist being an ugly old man and not an anime pretty boy was such a breath of fresh air at the time. Not to mention Ugly Dad ties together the band of misfits far better, and the story (especially ending D) feels far more natural and logical. 
It's plenty obvious at this point in the years since Automata that the fanbase and sub has been hijacked by hyper vigilant weebs. I think imma head out.
        Lmao what?
            Typo, fixed.
                Dude, the game is made in Japan, for a primarily Japanese audience. The game wasn't "hijacked by hyper vigilant weebs" you just aren't the target audience and/or don't have an open mind.
                    I'm not the target audiences for a series I've been a fan of for a decade, ho'kay. Politely fuck off
        Thats a very specific reason to skip a game?

                        I've never played the original, and don't know the story. But that's how you worded it too. Is this some incest shit, or you just don't like sibling relationships?
                            There isn't incest, the poster above saying "daddy"/daughter is naturally off putting for me because it implies that.

I'm not a fan the anime brother-sister trope where one is seemingly more father/motherish over the other and the parents are dead. It's just generic, overdone and contrived. Father Nier feels a lot of more natural, replacing it with pretty anime brother Nier brings it back to anime-trope territory.
                                ok, i see what you are saying. You dont like the *stereotypical* bro/sis relationships. I guess i overlooked that part of your comment.

I thought you were just saying you flat out didnt like sibling relationships in any capacity, lol
        Papa nier will probably be modded in on PC if there wont be DLC
        I'm quite content with what we're getting. I've already played Gestalt on PS3, so it'll be interesting to play Replicant this time around. Personally I think this is a better deal for us than it is for the Japanese fans seeing as how a lot of them have probably only experienced Replicant due to Gestalt being on the XBOX. I think you just need to be a little more open minded to this opportunity.
            Look, I'm happy for those that always wanted to play Replicant. I just wish we got both instead. If there is anyone that needs to be more open minded, its obviously those here that can't tolerate a different opinion.
        > Ugly Dad ties together the band of misfits far better,

Yeah like when they made Nier a 40 year old man for no reason so he could have a relationship with the 16 year old Kaine and have the pre-teen Emil crushing on him. Kind of pedophilic of you, isn't it?
    He's still canon, though.
I realy hoped that this game will be released sooner than later, but what we can do... at least this looks amazing, and will be worth waiting.
    Playing cyberpunk 2077 to bridge the time to Nier Release.
        Yea, this is only worth playing game that probably will came out in this year. But some things make me not entirely sure to this title, like that whole hype build around it.
            yeah, i agree on that. That hype fuels my scepticism, too. On the other hand CDPR havent done anything awful yet, even if the witcher wasnt my cup of tea.
            Demon's Souls Remake next month! Although that requires a PS5.
                Yea unfortunaly, but I'm not hyped on this game. Don't get me wrong game have amazing graphic, but rest for me seems bit unchanged. I wont pay that ammount of money to just play something like that, even if I'm huge souls fan. For me it'd be great if atlus tomorrow announced more ports for their games.
Worth noting that Steam release hits 2 days later on April 24th.
    This is so weird, for the pre order its telling me the 23rd.
        Timezones?
            est for me, even says on steam too.
                Huh that's odd then. No idea.
On my birthday, that is so cool!
Ha, at least I know what my wife is getting me.
    No way same here
        Happy early bday
    Happy early bday
        Heh, thanks <3
I'm hard
Who else has got the white snow edition preordered already
    Me!
Any word on the platforms it will be available on?
    the stream that is ongoing has mentioned Xbox, playstation and steam
        Xbox too, huh? It’s looking like playstation won’t be the only weeb machine anymore, with dragon quest, final fantasy, kingdom hearts, and now replicant on launch.
            [deleted]
                Now I'm torn on where I want to play Replicant. I have a Series X preorder but platinumed Automata on on PS4 and am not getting a PS5 anytime soon.
                    [deleted]
                        Yeah. Time to get emotionally wrecked again!
                    PC.
                There is no series x version
                    [deleted]
                        It’s saying that it works on series x but there is no upgraded version for series x
                            [deleted]
                                Ngl you’re kinda dumb, all Xbox one games from now on come in that case so that people know that it works on the series x
                                    [deleted]
        Oh ok, thanks! Was worried it wasn't coming to Xbox for some time, like Automata.
Can't wait to play an improved replicant. Gonna miss papa nier though. He was always my favorite.
i could literally crush a small childs spine with how hyped i am for this
    UwU
Okay, now this is epic
I hope steam version doesn't turn out to be a piece of shit like automata, seriously big thanks to the guy who scripted the FAR mod
It's probably never happening, but I hope we get a Drakengard 3 Remaster next.
I hope there's a version with just the steelbook. I don't have $188 to drop on the snow white edition, too poor
    Pre-order bonus on Amazon JP is a steel book.
        Do you have the link? I couldn't find it searching the site
If anyone is getting the White Snow Edition and HAS the money to splurge on it, I highly recommend doing so. Automata's Black Box edition is still going for absurd amounts of money on the secondhand market out there. Don't be like me and not get the limited edition (I got standard for Automata ). Don't know whether Snow White is more value for money vs. Black Box.

Again, only if you have the money. I do hope they go the P5 Royal route and just give you a steelbook, even for a slight premium for the standard.

Edit: Brain Fart, thought it was Lunar Tear for some goddamn reason. I do wish they called It the Lunar Tear Edition though.
I'm guessing that the number doesn't mean anything?
    It's the square root of 1.5, which I guess represents the philosophy behind this game (1.0 is the original, 2.0 would theoretically be a full remake, 1.5 is the something in-between that this game is).
        That makes sense I suppose, cool
    Sneaky release date: 202**1, 22**nd **4** (April)
        It also released on 22nd of April in 2010, so it's kind of amazing we get it exactly 11 years later
    It actually holds a major significance.
        Like what?
Noice!

Week after my birthday :D
Nice
Few weeks before my final, perfect
Sad it’s not this year but hype
As someone who only played automata but wants to get into other yoko taro games, any suggestions/explanaitons someone can give me?
    Drakengard 3 I recommend. Awesome characters and wild story. How the chars interact with one another is great to me.
        Hm, thanks for the recomendation. I assume that I should play the other titles first though, right?
            Not needed. It's quite standalone.
                Oh, that's great, I experienced the same with the persona series. Got 5 and have been backtracking since then. Ty for the callout, I'll definetively check it out.
                    yeah drakengard 3 is a prequel so you don’t need to have played 1&2. 2 is in its own separate universe canonically I believe and wasn’t directed by Taro so a lot of people skip it. the universe of nier follows the fifth ending of drakengard 1
            If possible emulate it, the game has serious frame rate issues on playstation (like regularly hitting single digits).  D3 can be played completely stand alone.  While it's technically a prequel, it doesn't actually flow into the game set after it (D1) and largely doesn't reference it.
            > tittles 

can't tell if accidental or on purpose joke
                Lmao, my bad, I guess it's written "Titles"? Thanks for the heads up.
    There are four main games in the series to remember: Drakengard 1, Drakengard 3, Nier Gestalt/Replicant and Nier Automata. Their chronological order in terms of timeline isn't exactly this one however, Drakengard 3 kind of comes as a prequel for the series as a whole. I'd say if you want a full view of the franchise you should at least play/watch playthroughs of those, then turn to side content if it interests you. You can skip Drakengard 2: it's a good game, but Yoko Taro wasn't really involved in the making so it gives a different vibe.
        Trying to understand all of these games and how they come together does give a little headache, but this was a good explanation either way! Thanks a bunch.
            Drakengard 1 is the original.  Drakengard 2 is a direct sequel to D1 but was not written and directed by Taro, and is tonally very different and is generally considered non-canon by the fanbase.  D3 is a prequel to D1 that does not actually directly flow into D1.

Nier: RepliCant/Gestalt are spinoff games based off of ending E of D1.  Though they do flow from D1, they are set in another dimension which (without spoilers) is linked to D1's world after a certain event from Ending E.  Automata is the sequel to RepliCant set approx 6000 years after it, this game follows ending E which did not appear in the game itself, it only appeared in tertiary material (I believe some kind of story book was released).

The concept of Automata was originally a play in Japan depicting the Pearl Harbor Descent from A2's perspective (the retelling of it in game is from Anemone's perspective so is missing some important information).  The reason A2 is so suddenly introduced without her backstory being all that fleshed out is due to this play which was only seen in Japan.
                Yoko Taro is one STRANGE fellow, but if the rest of his ideas and creativity are as amazing as Automata's, I'm all on board. One last thing, this was super helpfull, but are Gestalt and Replicant different games? I can't understand this one little bit...
                    > One last thing, this was super helpfull, but are Gestalt and Replicant different games? I can't understand this one little bit...

They are the exact same game except for a model swap. In replicant you play as younger nier who is yonah's brother, in gestalt you play as older nier who is yonah's father. There is no real difference except for some subtext stuff.
                        I see, thanks a bunch!
                    >but if the rest of his ideas and creativity are as amazing as Automata's, I'm all on board

oh yeah definitely. I've seen in said around that Automata is actually pretty tame for a Yoko Taro game, and after the absolute grimdark mindfuck that was drakengard 1, I'm inclined to agree. Just don't expect the gameplay for these to be nearly as good. Drakengard 3 is pretty alright all things considered, but can get pretty repetitive after a while, and Drakengard 1 is so damn slow that I just played the game on easy to get through the story. I can't speak on Nier since I'm waiting on this remaster to play it for the first time.
        While it might not be important, I would recommend watching a playthrough or CS compilation for 2. It is much lighter and softer but it still feels like a Drakengard game. Unfortunately the game ramps up the difficulty so high on the third playthrough that I would recommend watching the ending on youtube or cheating if you don't want to grind forever.
    I finished drakengard 3 on an emulator about 2 months ago and I loved the game so much. Definitely recommend it
Kinda disappointed at y'all in here not calling them Dadier and Broier.
    Onier-chan
was an update path for next gen mentioned?
    No even though they’ll already have released by then
Did they say anything about next gen consoles?
Feels like such a long ways away. I was personally hoping for a holiday release but so long as they stick the landing I’ll be content

    Ps5 is natively backwards compatible with 99% of PS4 games so there's no reason it shouldn't work.

Quick edit: I had a vague memory of it but after looking it up again Sony told devs all games submitted for certification past July must be compatible with the PS5... so nothing to worry about.
MY 18th BIRTHDAY WILL BE ON THE 27TH I CANT WAIT TO GET THIS!!!!!
Is there any significance to that number?

Is it a code?

A reference?

Just a random number?
    square root of 1.5
That's not tomorrow!
does anybody know if the white snow edition is exclusively for the square store? I wanna pre order but I'm in canada so yeah if anyone could let me know
[removed]
    Honestly if you are not sure the best option is to wait and see for impressions. Personally I don't have a choice since I only game on PC so I hope to god that despite the denuvo the port is at least passable (although to be fair, automata's port never gave me any trouble).
I can't wait but its so damn expensive, on steam at least
it's gonna release to the Xbox, this is something I didn't expect
    *It's gonna release*

*To the Xbox, this is something*

*I didn't expect*

Ohhh shit yes!!!
What’s it gonna be about?
I preorder the game on steam and the ps4 white edition... hehe.. needless to say I’m excited
Anyone know if the JP ver gonna have English? I want the steelbook so bad but the White Snow Edition is way too overpriced
In the trailer I only saw it say PS4, will it not be available for Xbox at launch?
YES
can’t wait.
i'm a steam user but holy cow my hype for this game just killed by nonsensical regional pricing. here in indonesia the game cost 35% of our minimum wage. even if i'm waiting for 50% sale it would be still cost pretty much. WTF Square enix?
    35% of your monthly minimum wage?
        yes. the regional prices is insane.
Is this a whole different game than the original Nier?
Haven’t watched TGS but how much has been redone for this game? Haven’t played the original so will buy regardless but I heard they were changing the combat to be more like Automata and adding some new content
Funny thing, I was planning to get the game for a while now.

The reveal of Nier Replicant was the day I bought Automata
So this takes place way before automata or something right? As someone who only played that game is it good to go into this?
    Yes this is thousands of years before automata. And yes you can just pick up and play it.
        Excellent, thank you
60$ is a hard sell, and I am a huge fan of the first game. Love it more than the Automata, easily.
any news on if Gestalt is coming with it?
3 days before my birthday : D
It's launching on what??
[deleted]
    It will be releasing on PS4 and become backwards compatible on PS5.
        Cool. Thanks!
Christ that looks smooth.  

can’t wait for it to drop.
It scares me that the locations are exactly the same.
that's fine
    It is fine, just happy its even coming to PC so early.
        and I'll be looking forward for another FAR mod to fix the porting issue.
            Fingers crossed its decent this time. Tho since it's still coming out on PS4 it's probably gonna be playable on most newish graphics cards and definitely on the 30 series...
                Hahaha I don't think so
            I was thinking about getting Automata on steam but i keep hearing the port is super buggy. 

How bad is it?
                Honestly I’ve had no issues with it but I know lots of people have. From my experience it isn’t too bad at this point though
                I tend to check reddit and install the FAR mod before I even know there is issue with porting.


So far, from start to finish, I only encounter 1 crash and no bug is found. You experience may vary from me, but I have no issue with the game.
                It is and it isn't, it varies unfortunately. However at worst it crashes and if you save regularly it wont be too bad, there's also a sale going on and there are mods that help to prevent the crashes. Actually the thing that is the hardest hit against Automata on PC for me is that a controller is near mandatory to play the game.
                I have a 2060 and I got all achievements with no FAR mod or whatever and it never crashed for me as well as the fact that I played over 100 hours with no issues at all
                    FAR is primarily a mod to fix some broken parts of the graphics engine. Especially the resolution to properly run in to native fullscreen without being blurry mess. Try it, it's a difference as night a day.

The only other mods I used is to have high resolution LoD models on all distances and a high resolution texture fix for the player models. Makes pop-in go away and makes the game feel smoother when traversing through the world. Bot those are very optional.
                    1060x6gb, i5 8600k, 8gb RAM, ssd. No crashes, even fans weren't any busy during the game. For now, with 30xx on sight, this set up ages and cheapens quick.
                        The 8600K is honestly a beast, my brother had it in his PC a couple of months ago before upgrading to the 10700K and he says its one of the best processors he had simply due to how easy it overclocks and how low the temps were
                            Yeah, I was very surprised, as I thought it wouldn't be average at best, but no.
It would be so nice if my laptop wasn't a potato and I could actually play it
[deleted]
    PS4, Xbox One, Steam
Yeah hope they do a drakengard 3 remaster
    Yeah, thats about the only hope. There is no way in hell they are gonna touch the original again.
        Maybe a remake or a straight port like the ps2 games on ps4 but I doubt they’d do anything else with it
            Yeah nah, Square will never re-associate their brand with the game where you are accompanied by a Cannibal, Pedophile, and Child.
                Well they already have since nier is a sequel to it
                    Well... just barely. It's a totally different name and brand for the most part. The only people that really even would know they are related are those who have played the first one. Newcomers don't see "Nier" and are like "Isn't that a sequel to the game where you slaughter dozens of possessed children?"

And yeah Drakengard 3 exists in 2013(?) which hurts my point a bit, but I just think if Drak1 were ever retouched... They would probably alter some details of the characters.
                        Well in the translation most of what you mentioned is left up to interpretation apart from the cannibalism and the child soldiers
                Nani the fuck

Explain
                    Yeahhhhh. Those details weren't the central focus of the plot, but there were still some very spicy character details in that game. 

Granted, 98% of Drak1 players probably quit or didn't replay multiple times to truly grasp those details.
            Id kill for even a straight port. I'd like to replay the first two, but my BC PS3 took a shit.
        Too dark? Or too bad?
            I think I followed up in another comment, but yeah. Honestly too dark.

Your main character has a mission where he murders dozens of possessed kids, and is accompanied by a party consisting of:

* A Cannibal Woman
* A Pedophile
* A Child

While like... 95% of the game could be remade I suppose, there are some touches here and there that Square probably does not want to associate their name with again.

Now, I love Drakengard 1 don't get me wrong. But it's probably something just better left in the past.
                I know. I played it recently. I feel like it could be done though; it would just be given one of the most unsavory degrees of M ratings and it would probably tank. And I mean even the original was *heavily* censored. Caim and Furiae’s relationship was watered down so much it was essentially platonic in the English version. I think a remake would be a great shot at redemption for its miserable gameplay and censorship, but there is also a great chance it would be censored even more. Assuming it did eventually happen anyways.
    You can definitely play it on the rpcs3 emulator, if you want to play it now. With a little tweaking of course. Also runs great for how buggy that game was on the ps3, 4k60fps.
        Sadly my pc isn’t good enough to run it I can just barely play drakengard 1 with software emulation
>	Xbox one

Fuck I might have to do it.
Not available on ps5/Xbox series?
    Yes, through backwards compatibility.
    At least for playstation, all games released for PS4 after this September I think, are mandatory to also work on the PS5. They don't need to offer any advantages/enhancements, just be compatible to play on.
Can you recommend any videos or channels? I've only played autómata also and would like to know more about the whole series
    Check out Clemps on YouTube he has a great breakdown of the drakengard and nier series in multiple part videos.
        That is exactly who I watched as well. Great videos!
        Clemps is great love his videos, so in-depth.
        RIP PixieValkyrie
            What happened to her channel? I watched her but not very regularly so I’m out of the loop
                If she explained it, then I missed what happened. She voluntarily deleted all get videos suddenly one night. In a live stream she explained that she wanted to do more than just her YouTube content, but I don't know why that would lead her to delete everything. Either way though, while I miss her content, it was her decision to remove her work I guess.
                    On her twitter she said she just didn't enjoy doing YT anymore. I don't know if she has given a specific reason for removing all her old videos rather than just leaving them and disabling future comments or whatever, but it is what it is.
                    Ah rip, I watched her videos to understand what was going on in NieR and Drakengard even after I watched multiple playthroughs from other ppl
        Thanks! I'll definitely check it out
    Just wait for the game if you dont want major spoilers. Part of the enjoyment comes from the unexpected twists
Honestly really disappointed. Why not both? I don't wanna play as this guy, father Nier is the best.
    Because old geezer was forced by idiotic localization studio and it was never supposed to be an actual character.
        Hey, don’t you dare talk about the world’s best dad with such disrespect!!

＼＼\٩(๑`~´๑)۶//／／
        Good thing it happened then lol, he's a much better character imo
            "He's better because he's the only one i played"

fixed
                Lmao I don't need to play the same game again with a dude who's character design is worse to make my mind up.
            Theyre the same character, how is one 'much better' than the other lol
                Just the design and relationship with Yonah
            Have you actually played both Gestalt and Replicant to make that claim?
                Do I really need to replay the game to make my mind up about which design and relationship with Yonah I prefer?
                    Well if you're going to claim one is a "better character" without having played both, you look pretty stupid yes. And the relationships with the other characters (Kaine and Emil especially), which have equal prominence in the story are abjectly worse since they were obviously written with a younger protagonist in mind, so too the timeskip development. They're the same character, but the character writing was done by Taro with a young protagonist in mind, and the arbitrary change to an older one was done by Sqaure Enixs corporate marketing department without much thought given to the story to appeal to westerners, so no significant script changes were done to cover up for the discrepancies it introduced.
                        You didn't need to write a wall my dude, I don't care which you prefer, I played Nier back on 360 to completion. I think it's all fine, a little awkward when he goes on about friendship, but his design and him being a dad is, again like I said, in my opinion, much better than the little boy character. If you're saying they're both the same, then why have an issue with my preference when you clearly prefer the other?
        Yoko Taro ended up liking him more tho.
            Nope, he said he liked him after he was made (though obviously he's not going to say he dislikes him), but he never said anything like that.
            This is simply a lie that was made up by some people that like jelly donuts localization.
        And yet he's so much better, go figure.
    Papa Nier is so much better.
    Would that be Replitalt? Or Gescant?
        Replicant = young Nier/sister Yonah

Gestalt = old man Nier/daughter Yonah
    I don’t have a preference since I only played as papa Nier and it’ll be cool to see the game from the brother’s perspective, but yeah both would’ve been ideal. Like how in DMC3 you can play as Vergil once you beat the game once and it’s basically the same game just with very minor differences. Whatever at least they’re remaking it I guess
        > Whatever at least they’re remaking it I guess

Papa's absence aside, gotta agree, I wondered if they'll sneak in something new
            There will be new stuff, yeah. They confirmed it in an interview. Iirc there’s a few new areas and major characters, and the rest is pretty much being reworked from the ground up. They’re making sure to try to keep the feel of the original though.
DLC maybe?
Maybe he’ll be in it somehow since it’s a remake of some sort, who knows. Will be salty if Father Nier isn’t playable or acknowledged at all.
Yeah I'll be skipping this. I can't stand brother-sister relationships in anime and jrpgs.

Edit: I'm not sure how many here were there in the beginning but having a protagonist being an ugly old man and not an anime pretty boy was such a breath of fresh air at the time. Not to mention Ugly Dad ties together the band of misfits far better, and the story (especially ending D) feels far more natural and logical. 
It's plenty obvious at this point in the years since Automata that the fanbase and sub has been hijacked by hyper vigilant weebs. I think imma head out.
    Lmao what?
        Typo, fixed.
            Dude, the game is made in Japan, for a primarily Japanese audience. The game wasn't "hijacked by hyper vigilant weebs" you just aren't the target audience and/or don't have an open mind.
                I'm not the target audiences for a series I've been a fan of for a decade, ho'kay. Politely fuck off
    Thats a very specific reason to skip a game?

                    I've never played the original, and don't know the story. But that's how you worded it too. Is this some incest shit, or you just don't like sibling relationships?
                        There isn't incest, the poster above saying "daddy"/daughter is naturally off putting for me because it implies that.

I'm not a fan the anime brother-sister trope where one is seemingly more father/motherish over the other and the parents are dead. It's just generic, overdone and contrived. Father Nier feels a lot of more natural, replacing it with pretty anime brother Nier brings it back to anime-trope territory.
                            ok, i see what you are saying. You dont like the *stereotypical* bro/sis relationships. I guess i overlooked that part of your comment.

I thought you were just saying you flat out didnt like sibling relationships in any capacity, lol
    Papa nier will probably be modded in on PC if there wont be DLC
    I'm quite content with what we're getting. I've already played Gestalt on PS3, so it'll be interesting to play Replicant this time around. Personally I think this is a better deal for us than it is for the Japanese fans seeing as how a lot of them have probably only experienced Replicant due to Gestalt being on the XBOX. I think you just need to be a little more open minded to this opportunity.
        Look, I'm happy for those that always wanted to play Replicant. I just wish we got both instead. If there is anyone that needs to be more open minded, its obviously those here that can't tolerate a different opinion.
    > Ugly Dad ties together the band of misfits far better,

Yeah like when they made Nier a 40 year old man for no reason so he could have a relationship with the 16 year old Kaine and have the pre-teen Emil crushing on him. Kind of pedophilic of you, isn't it?
He's still canon, though.
Playing cyberpunk 2077 to bridge the time to Nier Release.
    Yea, this is only worth playing game that probably will came out in this year. But some things make me not entirely sure to this title, like that whole hype build around it.
        yeah, i agree on that. That hype fuels my scepticism, too. On the other hand CDPR havent done anything awful yet, even if the witcher wasnt my cup of tea.
        Demon's Souls Remake next month! Although that requires a PS5.
            Yea unfortunaly, but I'm not hyped on this game. Don't get me wrong game have amazing graphic, but rest for me seems bit unchanged. I wont pay that ammount of money to just play something like that, even if I'm huge souls fan. For me it'd be great if atlus tomorrow announced more ports for their games.
This is so weird, for the pre order its telling me the 23rd.
    Timezones?
        est for me, even says on steam too.
            Huh that's odd then. No idea.
No way same here
    Happy early bday
Happy early bday
    Heh, thanks <3
Me!
the stream that is ongoing has mentioned Xbox, playstation and steam
    Xbox too, huh? It’s looking like playstation won’t be the only weeb machine anymore, with dragon quest, final fantasy, kingdom hearts, and now replicant on launch.
        [deleted]
            Now I'm torn on where I want to play Replicant. I have a Series X preorder but platinumed Automata on on PS4 and am not getting a PS5 anytime soon.
                [deleted]
                    Yeah. Time to get emotionally wrecked again!
                PC.
            There is no series x version

                    It’s saying that it works on series x but there is no upgraded version for series x

                            Ngl you’re kinda dumb, all Xbox one games from now on come in that case so that people know that it works on the series x
                                [deleted]
    Oh ok, thanks! Was worried it wasn't coming to Xbox for some time, like Automata.
UwU
Pre-order bonus on Amazon JP is a steel book.
    Do you have the link? I couldn't find it searching the site
It's the square root of 1.5, which I guess represents the philosophy behind this game (1.0 is the original, 2.0 would theoretically be a full remake, 1.5 is the something in-between that this game is).
    That makes sense I suppose, cool
Sneaky release date: 202**1, 22**nd **4** (April)
    It also released on 22nd of April in 2010, so it's kind of amazing we get it exactly 11 years later
It actually holds a major significance.
    Like what?
Drakengard 3 I recommend. Awesome characters and wild story. How the chars interact with one another is great to me.
    Hm, thanks for the recomendation. I assume that I should play the other titles first though, right?
        Not needed. It's quite standalone.
            Oh, that's great, I experienced the same with the persona series. Got 5 and have been backtracking since then. Ty for the callout, I'll definetively check it out.
                yeah drakengard 3 is a prequel so you don’t need to have played 1&2. 2 is in its own separate universe canonically I believe and wasn’t directed by Taro so a lot of people skip it. the universe of nier follows the fifth ending of drakengard 1
        If possible emulate it, the game has serious frame rate issues on playstation (like regularly hitting single digits).  D3 can be played completely stand alone.  While it's technically a prequel, it doesn't actually flow into the game set after it (D1) and largely doesn't reference it.
        > tittles 

can't tell if accidental or on purpose joke
            Lmao, my bad, I guess it's written "Titles"? Thanks for the heads up.
There are four main games in the series to remember: Drakengard 1, Drakengard 3, Nier Gestalt/Replicant and Nier Automata. Their chronological order in terms of timeline isn't exactly this one however, Drakengard 3 kind of comes as a prequel for the series as a whole. I'd say if you want a full view of the franchise you should at least play/watch playthroughs of those, then turn to side content if it interests you. You can skip Drakengard 2: it's a good game, but Yoko Taro wasn't really involved in the making so it gives a different vibe.
    Trying to understand all of these games and how they come together does give a little headache, but this was a good explanation either way! Thanks a bunch.
        Drakengard 1 is the original.  Drakengard 2 is a direct sequel to D1 but was not written and directed by Taro, and is tonally very different and is generally considered non-canon by the fanbase.  D3 is a prequel to D1 that does not actually directly flow into D1.

Nier: RepliCant/Gestalt are spinoff games based off of ending E of D1.  Though they do flow from D1, they are set in another dimension which (without spoilers) is linked to D1's world after a certain event from Ending E.  Automata is the sequel to RepliCant set approx 6000 years after it, this game follows ending E which did not appear in the game itself, it only appeared in tertiary material (I believe some kind of story book was released).

The concept of Automata was originally a play in Japan depicting the Pearl Harbor Descent from A2's perspective (the retelling of it in game is from Anemone's perspective so is missing some important information).  The reason A2 is so suddenly introduced without her backstory being all that fleshed out is due to this play which was only seen in Japan.
            Yoko Taro is one STRANGE fellow, but if the rest of his ideas and creativity are as amazing as Automata's, I'm all on board. One last thing, this was super helpfull, but are Gestalt and Replicant different games? I can't understand this one little bit...
                > One last thing, this was super helpfull, but are Gestalt and Replicant different games? I can't understand this one little bit...

They are the exact same game except for a model swap. In replicant you play as younger nier who is yonah's brother, in gestalt you play as older nier who is yonah's father. There is no real difference except for some subtext stuff.
                    I see, thanks a bunch!
                >but if the rest of his ideas and creativity are as amazing as Automata's, I'm all on board

oh yeah definitely. I've seen in said around that Automata is actually pretty tame for a Yoko Taro game, and after the absolute grimdark mindfuck that was drakengard 1, I'm inclined to agree. Just don't expect the gameplay for these to be nearly as good. Drakengard 3 is pretty alright all things considered, but can get pretty repetitive after a while, and Drakengard 1 is so damn slow that I just played the game on easy to get through the story. I can't speak on Nier since I'm waiting on this remaster to play it for the first time.
    While it might not be important, I would recommend watching a playthrough or CS compilation for 2. It is much lighter and softer but it still feels like a Drakengard game. Unfortunately the game ramps up the difficulty so high on the third playthrough that I would recommend watching the ending on youtube or cheating if you don't want to grind forever.
I finished drakengard 3 on an emulator about 2 months ago and I loved the game so much. Definitely recommend it
Onier-chan
No even though they’ll already have released by then
Ps5 is natively backwards compatible with 99% of PS4 games so there's no reason it shouldn't work.

Quick edit: I had a vague memory of it but after looking it up again Sony told devs all games submitted for certification past July must be compatible with the PS5... so nothing to worry about.
square root of 1.5
Honestly if you are not sure the best option is to wait and see for impressions. Personally I don't have a choice since I only game on PC so I hope to god that despite the denuvo the port is at least passable (although to be fair, automata's port never gave me any trouble).
*It's gonna release*

*To the Xbox, this is something*

*I didn't expect*

Yes this is thousands of years before automata. And yes you can just pick up and play it.
    Excellent, thank you
It will be releasing on PS4 and become backwards compatible on PS5.

It is fine, just happy its even coming to PC so early.

        Id kill for even a straight port. I'd like to replay the first two, but my BC PS3 took a shit.
    Too dark? Or too bad?
        I think I followed up in another comment, but yeah. Honestly too dark.

Your main character has a mission where he murders dozens of possessed kids, and is accompanied by a party consisting of:

* A Cannibal Woman
* A Pedophile
* A Child

While like... 95% of the game could be remade I suppose, there are some touches here and there that Square probably does not want to associate their name with again.

Now, I love Drakengard 1 don't get me wrong. But it's probably something just better left in the past.
            I know. I played it recently. I feel like it could be done though; it would just be given one of the most unsavory degrees of M ratings and it would probably tank. And I mean even the original was *heavily* censored. Caim and Furiae’s relationship was watered down so much it was essentially platonic in the English version. I think a remake would be a great shot at redemption for its miserable gameplay and censorship, but there is also a great chance it would be censored even more. Assuming it did eventually happen anyways.
You can definitely play it on the rpcs3 emulator, if you want to play it now. With a little tweaking of course. Also runs great for how buggy that game was on the ps3, 4k60fps.
    Sadly my pc isn’t good enough to run it I can just barely play drakengard 1 with software emulation
Yes, through backwards compatibility.
At least for playstation, all games released for PS4 after this September I think, are mandatory to also work on the PS5. They don't need to offer any advantages/enhancements, just be compatible to play on.
Check out Clemps on YouTube he has a great breakdown of the drakengard and nier series in multiple part videos.
    That is exactly who I watched as well. Great videos!
    Clemps is great love his videos, so in-depth.
    RIP PixieValkyrie
        What happened to her channel? I watched her but not very regularly so I’m out of the loop
            If she explained it, then I missed what happened. She voluntarily deleted all get videos suddenly one night. In a live stream she explained that she wanted to do more than just her YouTube content, but I don't know why that would lead her to delete everything. Either way though, while I miss her content, it was her decision to remove her work I guess.
                On her twitter she said she just didn't enjoy doing YT anymore. I don't know if she has given a specific reason for removing all her old videos rather than just leaving them and disabling future comments or whatever, but it is what it is.
                Ah rip, I watched her videos to understand what was going on in NieR and Drakengard even after I watched multiple playthroughs from other ppl
    Thanks! I'll definitely check it out
Just wait for the game if you dont want major spoilers. Part of the enjoyment comes from the unexpected twists
Because old geezer was forced by idiotic localization studio and it was never supposed to be an actual character.
    Hey, don’t you dare talk about the world’s best dad with such disrespect!!

＼＼\٩(๑`~´๑)۶//／／
    Good thing it happened then lol, he's a much better character imo
        "He's better because he's the only one i played"

fixed
            Lmao I don't need to play the same game again with a dude who's character design is worse to make my mind up.
        Theyre the same character, how is one 'much better' than the other lol
            Just the design and relationship with Yonah
        Have you actually played both Gestalt and Replicant to make that claim?
            Do I really need to replay the game to make my mind up about which design and relationship with Yonah I prefer?
                Well if you're going to claim one is a "better character" without having played both, you look pretty stupid yes. And the relationships with the other characters (Kaine and Emil especially), which have equal prominence in the story are abjectly worse since they were obviously written with a younger protagonist in mind, so too the timeskip development. They're the same character, but the character writing was done by Taro with a young protagonist in mind, and the arbitrary change to an older one was done by Sqaure Enixs corporate marketing department without much thought given to the story to appeal to westerners, so no significant script changes were done to cover up for the discrepancies it introduced.
                    You didn't need to write a wall my dude, I don't care which you prefer, I played Nier back on 360 to completion. I think it's all fine, a little awkward when he goes on about friendship, but his design and him being a dad is, again like I said, in my opinion, much better than the little boy character. If you're saying they're both the same, then why have an issue with my preference when you clearly prefer the other?
    Yoko Taro ended up liking him more tho.
        Nope, he said he liked him after he was made (though obviously he's not going to say he dislikes him), but he never said anything like that.
        This is simply a lie that was made up by some people that like jelly donuts localization.
    And yet he's so much better, go figure.
Papa Nier is so much better.
Would that be Replitalt? Or Gescant?
    Replicant = young Nier/sister Yonah

Gestalt = old man Nier/daughter Yonah
I don’t have a preference since I only played as papa Nier and it’ll be cool to see the game from the brother’s perspective, but yeah both would’ve been ideal. Like how in DMC3 you can play as Vergil once you beat the game once and it’s basically the same game just with very minor differences. Whatever at least they’re remaking it I guess
    > Whatever at least they’re remaking it I guess

Papa's absence aside, gotta agree, I wondered if they'll sneak in something new
        There will be new stuff, yeah. They confirmed it in an interview. Iirc there’s a few new areas and major characters, and the rest is pretty much being reworked from the ground up. They’re making sure to try to keep the feel of the original though.
Lmao what?
    Typo, fixed.
        Dude, the game is made in Japan, for a primarily Japanese audience. The game wasn't "hijacked by hyper vigilant weebs" you just aren't the target audience and/or don't have an open mind.
            I'm not the target audiences for a series I've been a fan of for a decade, ho'kay. Politely fuck off
Thats a very specific reason to skip a game?

                I've never played the original, and don't know the story. But that's how you worded it too. Is this some incest shit, or you just don't like sibling relationships?
                    There isn't incest, the poster above saying "daddy"/daughter is naturally off putting for me because it implies that.

I'm not a fan the anime brother-sister trope where one is seemingly more father/motherish over the other and the parents are dead. It's just generic, overdone and contrived. Father Nier feels a lot of more natural, replacing it with pretty anime brother Nier brings it back to anime-trope territory.
                        ok, i see what you are saying. You dont like the *stereotypical* bro/sis relationships. I guess i overlooked that part of your comment.

I thought you were just saying you flat out didnt like sibling relationships in any capacity, lol
Papa nier will probably be modded in on PC if there wont be DLC
I'm quite content with what we're getting. I've already played Gestalt on PS3, so it'll be interesting to play Replicant this time around. Personally I think this is a better deal for us than it is for the Japanese fans seeing as how a lot of them have probably only experienced Replicant due to Gestalt being on the XBOX. I think you just need to be a little more open minded to this opportunity.
    Look, I'm happy for those that always wanted to play Replicant. I just wish we got both instead. If there is anyone that needs to be more open minded, its obviously those here that can't tolerate a different opinion.
> Ugly Dad ties together the band of misfits far better,

Yeah like when they made Nier a 40 year old man for no reason so he could have a relationship with the 16 year old Kaine and have the pre-teen Emil crushing on him. Kind of pedophilic of you, isn't it?
Yea, this is only worth playing game that probably will came out in this year. But some things make me not entirely sure to this title, like that whole hype build around it.
    yeah, i agree on that. That hype fuels my scepticism, too. On the other hand CDPR havent done anything awful yet, even if the witcher wasnt my cup of tea.
    Demon's Souls Remake next month! Although that requires a PS5.
        Yea unfortunaly, but I'm not hyped on this game. Don't get me wrong game have amazing graphic, but rest for me seems bit unchanged. I wont pay that ammount of money to just play something like that, even if I'm huge souls fan. For me it'd be great if atlus tomorrow announced more ports for their games.
Timezones?
    est for me, even says on steam too.
        Huh that's odd then. No idea.
Happy early bday
Heh, thanks <3
Xbox too, huh? It’s looking like playstation won’t be the only weeb machine anymore, with dragon quest, final fantasy, kingdom hearts, and now replicant on launch.
    [deleted]
        Now I'm torn on where I want to play Replicant. I have a Series X preorder but platinumed Automata on on PS4 and am not getting a PS5 anytime soon.
            [deleted]
                Yeah. Time to get emotionally wrecked again!
            PC.
        There is no series x version
            [deleted]
                It’s saying that it works on series x but there is no upgraded version for series x
                    [deleted]
                        Ngl you’re kinda dumb, all Xbox one games from now on come in that case so that people know that it works on the series x
                            [deleted]
Oh ok, thanks! Was worried it wasn't coming to Xbox for some time, like Automata.
Do you have the link? I couldn't find it searching the site
That makes sense I suppose, cool
It also released on 22nd of April in 2010, so it's kind of amazing we get it exactly 11 years later
Like what?
Hm, thanks for the recomendation. I assume that I should play the other titles first though, right?
    Not needed. It's quite standalone.
        Oh, that's great, I experienced the same with the persona series. Got 5 and have been backtracking since then. Ty for the callout, I'll definetively check it out.
            yeah drakengard 3 is a prequel so you don’t need to have played 1&2. 2 is in its own separate universe canonically I believe and wasn’t directed by Taro so a lot of people skip it. the universe of nier follows the fifth ending of drakengard 1
    If possible emulate it, the game has serious frame rate issues on playstation (like regularly hitting single digits).  D3 can be played completely stand alone.  While it's technically a prequel, it doesn't actually flow into the game set after it (D1) and largely doesn't reference it.
    > tittles 

can't tell if accidental or on purpose joke
        Lmao, my bad, I guess it's written "Titles"? Thanks for the heads up.
Trying to understand all of these games and how they come together does give a little headache, but this was a good explanation either way! Thanks a bunch.
    Drakengard 1 is the original.  Drakengard 2 is a direct sequel to D1 but was not written and directed by Taro, and is tonally very different and is generally considered non-canon by the fanbase.  D3 is a prequel to D1 that does not actually directly flow into D1.

Nier: RepliCant/Gestalt are spinoff games based off of ending E of D1.  Though they do flow from D1, they are set in another dimension which (without spoilers) is linked to D1's world after a certain event from Ending E.  Automata is the sequel to RepliCant set approx 6000 years after it, this game follows ending E which did not appear in the game itself, it only appeared in tertiary material (I believe some kind of story book was released).

The concept of Automata was originally a play in Japan depicting the Pearl Harbor Descent from A2's perspective (the retelling of it in game is from Anemone's perspective so is missing some important information).  The reason A2 is so suddenly introduced without her backstory being all that fleshed out is due to this play which was only seen in Japan.
        Yoko Taro is one STRANGE fellow, but if the rest of his ideas and creativity are as amazing as Automata's, I'm all on board. One last thing, this was super helpfull, but are Gestalt and Replicant different games? I can't understand this one little bit...
            > One last thing, this was super helpfull, but are Gestalt and Replicant different games? I can't understand this one little bit...

They are the exact same game except for a model swap. In replicant you play as younger nier who is yonah's brother, in gestalt you play as older nier who is yonah's father. There is no real difference except for some subtext stuff.
                I see, thanks a bunch!
            >but if the rest of his ideas and creativity are as amazing as Automata's, I'm all on board

oh yeah definitely. I've seen in said around that Automata is actually pretty tame for a Yoko Taro game, and after the absolute grimdark mindfuck that was drakengard 1, I'm inclined to agree. Just don't expect the gameplay for these to be nearly as good. Drakengard 3 is pretty alright all things considered, but can get pretty repetitive after a while, and Drakengard 1 is so damn slow that I just played the game on easy to get through the story. I can't speak on Nier since I'm waiting on this remaster to play it for the first time.
While it might not be important, I would recommend watching a playthrough or CS compilation for 2. It is much lighter and softer but it still feels like a Drakengard game. Unfortunately the game ramps up the difficulty so high on the third playthrough that I would recommend watching the ending on youtube or cheating if you don't want to grind forever.
yes. the regional prices is insane.
Excellent, thank you
Cool. Thanks!
and I'll be looking forward for another FAR mod to fix the porting issue.
    Fingers crossed its decent this time. Tho since it's still coming out on PS4 it's probably gonna be playable on most newish graphics cards and definitely on the 30 series...
        Hahaha I don't think so
    I was thinking about getting Automata on steam but i keep hearing the port is super buggy. 

How bad is it?
        Honestly I’ve had no issues with it but I know lots of people have. From my experience it isn’t too bad at this point though
        I tend to check reddit and install the FAR mod before I even know there is issue with porting.


So far, from start to finish, I only encounter 1 crash and no bug is found. You experience may vary from me, but I have no issue with the game.
        It is and it isn't, it varies unfortunately. However at worst it crashes and if you save regularly it wont be too bad, there's also a sale going on and there are mods that help to prevent the crashes. Actually the thing that is the hardest hit against Automata on PC for me is that a controller is near mandatory to play the game.
        I have a 2060 and I got all achievements with no FAR mod or whatever and it never crashed for me as well as the fact that I played over 100 hours with no issues at all
            FAR is primarily a mod to fix some broken parts of the graphics engine. Especially the resolution to properly run in to native fullscreen without being blurry mess. Try it, it's a difference as night a day.

The only other mods I used is to have high resolution LoD models on all distances and a high resolution texture fix for the player models. Makes pop-in go away and makes the game feel smoother when traversing through the world. Bot those are very optional.
            1060x6gb, i5 8600k, 8gb RAM, ssd. No crashes, even fans weren't any busy during the game. For now, with 30xx on sight, this set up ages and cheapens quick.
                The 8600K is honestly a beast, my brother had it in his PC a couple of months ago before upgrading to the 10700K and he says its one of the best processors he had simply due to how easy it overclocks and how low the temps were
                    Yeah, I was very surprised, as I thought it wouldn't be average at best, but no.
Maybe a remake or a straight port like the ps2 games on ps4 but I doubt they’d do anything else with it
    Yeah nah, Square will never re-associate their brand with the game where you are accompanied by a Cannibal, Pedophile, and Child.
        Well they already have since nier is a sequel to it
            Well... just barely. It's a totally different name and brand for the most part. The only people that really even would know they are related are those who have played the first one. Newcomers don't see "Nier" and are like "Isn't that a sequel to the game where you slaughter dozens of possessed children?"

And yeah Drakengard 3 exists in 2013(?) which hurts my point a bit, but I just think if Drak1 were ever retouched... They would probably alter some details of the characters.
                Well in the translation most of what you mentioned is left up to interpretation apart from the cannibalism and the child soldiers
        Nani the fuck

Explain
            Yeahhhhh. Those details weren't the central focus of the plot, but there were still some very spicy character details in that game. 

Granted, 98% of Drak1 players probably quit or didn't replay multiple times to truly grasp those details.

I was thinking about getting Automata on steam but i keep hearing the port is super buggy. 

How bad is it?
    Honestly I’ve had no issues with it but I know lots of people have. From my experience it isn’t too bad at this point though
    I tend to check reddit and install the FAR mod before I even know there is issue with porting.


So far, from start to finish, I only encounter 1 crash and no bug is found. You experience may vary from me, but I have no issue with the game.
    It is and it isn't, it varies unfortunately. However at worst it crashes and if you save regularly it wont be too bad, there's also a sale going on and there are mods that help to prevent the crashes. Actually the thing that is the hardest hit against Automata on PC for me is that a controller is near mandatory to play the game.
    I have a 2060 and I got all achievements with no FAR mod or whatever and it never crashed for me as well as the fact that I played over 100 hours with no issues at all
        FAR is primarily a mod to fix some broken parts of the graphics engine. Especially the resolution to properly run in to native fullscreen without being blurry mess. Try it, it's a difference as night a day.

The only other mods I used is to have high resolution LoD models on all distances and a high resolution texture fix for the player models. Makes pop-in go away and makes the game feel smoother when traversing through the world. Bot those are very optional.
        1060x6gb, i5 8600k, 8gb RAM, ssd. No crashes, even fans weren't any busy during the game. For now, with 30xx on sight, this set up ages and cheapens quick.
            The 8600K is honestly a beast, my brother had it in his PC a couple of months ago before upgrading to the 10700K and he says its one of the best processors he had simply due to how easy it overclocks and how low the temps were
                Yeah, I was very surprised, as I thought it wouldn't be average at best, but no.
Yeah nah, Square will never re-associate their brand with the game where you are accompanied by a Cannibal, Pedophile, and Child.
    Well they already have since nier is a sequel to it
        Well... just barely. It's a totally different name and brand for the most part. The only people that really even would know they are related are those who have played the first one. Newcomers don't see "Nier" and are like "Isn't that a sequel to the game where you slaughter dozens of possessed children?"

And yeah Drakengard 3 exists in 2013(?) which hurts my point a bit, but I just think if Drak1 were ever retouched... They would probably alter some details of the characters.
            Well in the translation most of what you mentioned is left up to interpretation apart from the cannibalism and the child soldiers
    Nani the fuck

Explain
        Yeahhhhh. Those details weren't the central focus of the plot, but there were still some very spicy character details in that game. 

Granted, 98% of Drak1 players probably quit or didn't replay multiple times to truly grasp those details.
Id kill for even a straight port. I'd like to replay the first two, but my BC PS3 took a shit.
I think I followed up in another comment, but yeah. Honestly too dark.

Your main character has a mission where he murders dozens of possessed kids, and is accompanied by a party consisting of:

* A Cannibal Woman
* A Pedophile
* A Child

While like... 95% of the game could be remade I suppose, there are some touches here and there that Square probably does not want to associate their name with again.

Now, I love Drakengard 1 don't get me wrong. But it's probably something just better left in the past.
    I know. I played it recently. I feel like it could be done though; it would just be given one of the most unsavory degrees of M ratings and it would probably tank. And I mean even the original was *heavily* censored. Caim and Furiae’s relationship was watered down so much it was essentially platonic in the English version. I think a remake would be a great shot at redemption for its miserable gameplay and censorship, but there is also a great chance it would be censored even more. Assuming it did eventually happen anyways.
What happened to her channel? I watched her but not very regularly so I’m out of the loop
    If she explained it, then I missed what happened. She voluntarily deleted all get videos suddenly one night. In a live stream she explained that she wanted to do more than just her YouTube content, but I don't know why that would lead her to delete everything. Either way though, while I miss her content, it was her decision to remove her work I guess.
        On her twitter she said she just didn't enjoy doing YT anymore. I don't know if she has given a specific reason for removing all her old videos rather than just leaving them and disabling future comments or whatever, but it is what it is.
        Ah rip, I watched her videos to understand what was going on in NieR and Drakengard even after I watched multiple playthroughs from other ppl
"He's better because he's the only one i played"

fixed
    Lmao I don't need to play the same game again with a dude who's character design is worse to make my mind up.
Theyre the same character, how is one 'much better' than the other lol
    Just the design and relationship with Yonah
Have you actually played both Gestalt and Replicant to make that claim?
    Do I really need to replay the game to make my mind up about which design and relationship with Yonah I prefer?
        Well if you're going to claim one is a "better character" without having played both, you look pretty stupid yes. And the relationships with the other characters (Kaine and Emil especially), which have equal prominence in the story are abjectly worse since they were obviously written with a younger protagonist in mind, so too the timeskip development. They're the same character, but the character writing was done by Taro with a young protagonist in mind, and the arbitrary change to an older one was done by Sqaure Enixs corporate marketing department without much thought given to the story to appeal to westerners, so no significant script changes were done to cover up for the discrepancies it introduced.
            You didn't need to write a wall my dude, I don't care which you prefer, I played Nier back on 360 to completion. I think it's all fine, a little awkward when he goes on about friendship, but his design and him being a dad is, again like I said, in my opinion, much better than the little boy character. If you're saying they're both the same, then why have an issue with my preference when you clearly prefer the other?
Nope, he said he liked him after he was made (though obviously he's not going to say he dislikes him), but he never said anything like that.
This is simply a lie that was made up by some people that like jelly donuts localization.
There will be new stuff, yeah. They confirmed it in an interview. Iirc there’s a few new areas and major characters, and the rest is pretty much being reworked from the ground up. They’re making sure to try to keep the feel of the original though.
Dude, the game is made in Japan, for a primarily Japanese audience. The game wasn't "hijacked by hyper vigilant weebs" you just aren't the target audience and/or don't have an open mind.
    I'm not the target audiences for a series I've been a fan of for a decade, ho'kay. Politely fuck off

        I've never played the original, and don't know the story. But that's how you worded it too. Is this some incest shit, or you just don't like sibling relationships?
            There isn't incest, the poster above saying "daddy"/daughter is naturally off putting for me because it implies that.

I'm not a fan the anime brother-sister trope where one is seemingly more father/motherish over the other and the parents are dead. It's just generic, overdone and contrived. Father Nier feels a lot of more natural, replacing it with pretty anime brother Nier brings it back to anime-trope territory.
                ok, i see what you are saying. You dont like the *stereotypical* bro/sis relationships. I guess i overlooked that part of your comment.

I thought you were just saying you flat out didnt like sibling relationships in any capacity, lol
Yea unfortunaly, but I'm not hyped on this game. Don't get me wrong game have amazing graphic, but rest for me seems bit unchanged. I wont pay that ammount of money to just play something like that, even if I'm huge souls fan. For me it'd be great if atlus tomorrow announced more ports for their games.
Huh that's odd then. No idea.
Now I'm torn on where I want to play Replicant. I have a Series X preorder but platinumed Automata on on PS4 and am not getting a PS5 anytime soon.
    [deleted]
        Yeah. Time to get emotionally wrecked again!
    PC.
There is no series x version
    [deleted]
        It’s saying that it works on series x but there is no upgraded version for series x
            [deleted]
                Ngl you’re kinda dumb, all Xbox one games from now on come in that case so that people know that it works on the series x
                    [deleted]
Oh, that's great, I experienced the same with the persona series. Got 5 and have been backtracking since then. Ty for the callout, I'll definetively check it out.
    yeah drakengard 3 is a prequel so you don’t need to have played 1&2. 2 is in its own separate universe canonically I believe and wasn’t directed by Taro so a lot of people skip it. the universe of nier follows the fifth ending of drakengard 1
Lmao, my bad, I guess it's written "Titles"? Thanks for the heads up.
Yoko Taro is one STRANGE fellow, but if the rest of his ideas and creativity are as amazing as Automata's, I'm all on board. One last thing, this was super helpfull, but are Gestalt and Replicant different games? I can't understand this one little bit...
    > One last thing, this was super helpfull, but are Gestalt and Replicant different games? I can't understand this one little bit...

They are the exact same game except for a model swap. In replicant you play as younger nier who is yonah's brother, in gestalt you play as older nier who is yonah's father. There is no real difference except for some subtext stuff.
        I see, thanks a bunch!
    >but if the rest of his ideas and creativity are as amazing as Automata's, I'm all on board

oh yeah definitely. I've seen in said around that Automata is actually pretty tame for a Yoko Taro game, and after the absolute grimdark mindfuck that was drakengard 1, I'm inclined to agree. Just don't expect the gameplay for these to be nearly as good. Drakengard 3 is pretty alright all things considered, but can get pretty repetitive after a while, and Drakengard 1 is so damn slow that I just played the game on easy to get through the story. I can't speak on Nier since I'm waiting on this remaster to play it for the first time.
Hahaha I don't think so
