                    Better believe it. Emoji spam could lead to Reddit becoming Twitter- and we all know how bad a shitshow Twitter is.
                        twitter's quality is not caused by emoji, it's caused by the 280 char limit
                            Can't deny that Twitter has a serious emoji problem, though. I'm just trying to do my job.

Also, when I used it, I hated the 280 limit.
                                twitter may have emoji, but that doesn't mean it's a problem
                No fans of rise against here I see....
                    Imagine being a "fan" of rise against
I wish the point of Hex-A-Gone was being the first one to hit the slime. Oh boy, I’d be swimming in crowns.
    So, a vertical Door Dash?
        Like those falling Minecraft maps where you had to safely get to the bottom without dying
            Droppers
                That would be neat
    A race like that could honestly be pretty cool. Make your way down instead of forward and fall through the goal
        Mix it together with Tip Toe; find the tile that will disappear.
Achievement : fall for more than 3 second
The people who just started ”how is there one death already”
    You'd die slower if you just didn't touch the controller.
        You are die slower lol
 
 Edit: dunno why the downvotes just helping em out
            Meant to type You'd. Will edit.
                Thank you. Now I can sleep easy
That's too bad, I was expecting a save on the last layer.

You gotta spam the jump button, your bean had time to jump to a safer one and start playing.
    Don’t refer to “my bean.”  My bean and I are one.  I am he.  And she is me.

***I*** fell into oblivion.  ***I*** failed.  ***I*** am the one has been *éliminé*

And tonight, I give you my most solemn vow: this will **not** be the last time.
        Now this... this is po-fucking-etic
        I am he as you are he as you are me and we all fall together.
        Is that a fucking persona reference?
    Nah, every time that happens to me and I land on 3 like that, you may be able to jump but it won’t go far enough to make you survive the layer. Just jumps back into the hole you created.
        You gotta dive after
            With me, dives when you’re not moving just stall my jump, without much if any horizontal movement. I’ll try it next time though!
                Jump then dive
                    Don’t know why you were downvoted, you can jump dive jump and run normally.
        Indeed it is possible to escape, as the previous commenter said. I suggest holding forwards while jumping, and adding a dive if you think you won't make it. But the dive is often not necessary.
        You’re just bad. You can always get up and go to another tile if you do it right.
    I’m on console and I have the same issue he did. They just don’t jump fast enough
        I'm also on console. Make sure your tapping the jump button and not holding it down very long because the input seems not to come out sometimes when you hold it longer
            Hmm good advice I’ll remember that
    I'm lowkey glad I'm not the only one calling them beans and not guys.
        I call them beans, but "Fall Beans" doesn't have quite the same ring.
    Spamming doesn’t work for me; some reason it doesn’t register my jump when I spam. I have to time my jump for when my bean stands, and I have had better results timing it.
    Even if he did save it he would only succeed in removing the bottom platform. Id expect him to run out of platform long before the match ends. He probably could have gotten a few cheeky elims but the people above would have to royally fuck up for him to win.
God I see this shit in my nightmares
I won my first crown on this map and thought it would probably be the easiest one to win on, but I've yet to win another and have since won way more on the other ones.

It's just too chaotic, everyone focuses so hard on fucking eachother over, but they fuck themselves over in the process. Like I don't mind someone cutting off my path if they end up winning, but 95% of the time the person cutting me off loses right when I do anyway.
    People just don't think ahead when they're trying to be a dick. "Oh, you cut me off...and gave me a bigger slice of hexes so now I'm just going to make sure you can't get back to my side. See you at the podium."
    I have the most wins on Hexagon out of my 50+, It's chaotic but if you can manage to spin your camera while hopping you can plan a path/ emergency de-tour and where to fall. Also if you were in a squad, you can use your disqualified teammates as Comms support while just focusing on pathing.
> this video is only 12 seconds there's no way he possibly loses in that amount of oh shit he did it
In bigger games there is a legitimate strategy in falling to the bottom. Make a giant hole in the middle of the map and most people will just tumble through without looking.
    [deleted]
        Yeah I feel that strategy was good early on but players are better at it now. I’m no pro but I’m always angling my camera down to work out where I’m gonna drop on the level below.
            I angle my camera up, to see the sun. Shadow tile spoofing is much easier this way. 17 Hexy wins so far
                Shadow tile spoofing?
                    Im just fucking around ;) Happy Friday!
                        Oh damn lol, I'm so frustrated with this level I really hoped that was a real trick
                            Lol this got me too, I'm pretty good at Hex and was like, "wtf is that"
                                It's a wild Yellr! Your vids are great man, would have loved to see a shadow spoofing one hahaha
                                    Lol thanks man, glad you enjoy the content!  I try to make it as good as possible
        the issue with slow-jumping in big games is that players will focus really hard on cutting each other off, and players are everywhere. I've yet to have a game where someone else does a handshake with me and we both slowly hop on the same level.
        I just drop down and make a hole in the middle of the last 3 rows
    That was my old tactic when the game was a week old, but people have gotten better at the game so it doesn’t work as well
    That's not a legitimate strategy. Even when it "succeeds", as long as there is one person with functioning eyes above you they'll just land on the biggest patch at the end. Most of the time though, especially in bigger games, there will be a bunch of other people who get down to the bottom by accident or intentionally, and the layer will be pretty much entirely gone while others are two layers above.
        Yup. I’ve tried the strategy a number of times and it never works out for me. All my wins have come by playing as slow as possible. I don’t even run to cut people off unless there is A) no one above me, and B) someone on my level who will end up with a larger area to jump on if I don’t cut them off.

Keeping yourself alive and staying away from others is the best strategy 90+% of the time. If there is anyone above you at all, you want the tiles on your level to disappear as slow as possible and wait at least until you’re tied for the top position before getting aggressive
    Doesn't really work anymore with 7 people all trying that strategy at the same time
        my solution to that is to stop 1-2 levels above the bottom. Let others doing the strategy remove the lower levels.
    [deleted]
        oh yeah, every game is situational. I just found that not sitting at the top early has worked well for me.
    That strategy only works on less experienced players. Have someone who actually plans their decent and they will 9/10 times beat you (person at the bottom making a hole).
Ça m'est jamais encore arrivé... rip :|
easily word record
lmao, this was really funny to see this morning. cheers--hope it goes better next time!

I definitely thought to myself that I'd never win a hex-a-gone after my first few efforts ended very poorly. but I've won it twice now, so eventually it'll come.
F
if you didnt fall when you landed on the last platform you could have got the chance to get rid of all of it and surprise some fall guys
That weird noise you did at the end just solidified this.
I feel like I'm one of the only people who is not a huge fan of Hex-A-Gone. As a finale I just find it less fun than the alternatives. Obviously that is just personal taste as I don't think there's really anything fundamentally flawed about it or anything. I just find the Jump Showdown, Fall Mountain and the tail grab one more personally interesting. 

&#x200B;

Then again I might just hate Hex-A-Gone because its the only one I haven't won yet...
    I hate Tail Grab. Jump and Hex are great.
    In my opinion..

Fall Mountain is too much randomness to consistently be successful at.  Tail tag I literally just stand there in the middle waiting for the clock to tick down to :35 or so before I even start playing.  Jump Showdown is alright.  Hex-A-Gone is perfect!
    I want to be a fan of it but I've only gotten to play it Twice. I get Jump Showdown a ton. I really want more practice on Hex-A-Gone.
    I have a shitty keyboard and my space bar sticks sometimes so I have to run around and can't do the jump beta
    You are not alone. Honestly most of time I get it I feel like jumping off like this on purpose. I try to slow jump but get panicky and find it hard on controller to watch the level below too. Just not for me.
    of all the finales hex is the only one thats properly skill based. 

fall mountain - run fastest, don't get hit by rng balls

jump showdown - evade the bottom bar

royal fumble - just terrible.
Oooof
*Éliminé!*
That’s rough buddy
This game stresses me the fuck out. Every time it's picked, I think about doing this on purpose just to get it over with.
Why would you dive tho 😭
That was like speedrun level getting out skills
Je faisais comme toi, depuis j'utilise une manette de 360, c'est le jour et la nuit !
Can relate
Woo
That was pretty epic. Thank you for sharing. Sorry about your luck.
Well, just consider it a speed run world record.
Same, bro
F
At that point I'd just throw the whole system out
Never dive unless you absolutely have to to stay on a level.
Sabotage the last stage so no one wins fairly.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE ~~GROUND~~ SLIME!
    OVER THE LINE!!!! It’s good business*"
This is basically me. It's just not the game I'm good at! I only have 4 wins, but 3 have been on Jump Showdown and 1 was total luck on Fall Mountain.
Makes horrible decision. Blames game mode. Are you me? That sounds like me.
F
Putting the fall in fall guys there buddy
Everyone knows when you hit 3 hexagons at once there’s no looking back.
That's a feelsbadman
Your're really Hex-A-Gone now
I am the same frickin way dude I’ve gotten to the final but never gotten into the top 50% on hexagone
I’m great at jump showdown tho
Wow! You did really good...
It's the only one i havent got a crown in... one day lol
Oh you're definitely a-gone
I hate Hex-a-Gone. Still no dubs there for me...
The fact that you over shot that platform makes for an impressive jump actually

This is exactly what happens to me in Hex-A-Gone. Especially the fall bit when you land on the last platform. I feel you, buddy.
that's just painful. I feel you, my frère

I like you you get such a long time falling to reflect on how you fucked up!
I don't think I could have imagined a funnier/faster death in Hex.

As if, hexagon is the best one, just don't go for super risky jumps to get the perfect efficiency, that will usually fuck you over.
Oh you poor soul
I lose on hexagon to the stupid glitch
Yeah I just deleted the game

You're also not the historical convention which is much closer to where this happened than in the north of England, basically means dickhead

Edit: anyone who is hesitating, it's worth examining specifically how their freedom is being denied to them. When the majority of all anime characters being female might be worthy of criticism. Harems, dating show, etc. Can you see it. He received the puck with 00.5 left and shot with 00.2 left on the counter? Must've gotten a lift!
WHAT WAS THAT
Why did you dive
\*Pats On Back\*

There there
Sometimes I intentionally fall to the last platform just so I can get rid off as many fall dudes as possible.
This is completely avoidable. Let’s fucking egregious.
And the fact they had to pay for it
Bruh
That dive at the beginning was questionable
Don’t worry I’ve only won one game. It was on jump showdown and I swear it was only because the last guy lagged.
When are they going to fix the jumping bug/delay? It's been over a month.
Don't dive
Tbh, this is my favorite level :)
Omg
Im so bad at fall guys it makes me sad i really like it i just always get knocked out of the game in the first round

82 Awards!!! I got some shitty clips as well
Respectfully disagree as I honestly get pumped when this level comes up! I know people have been talking about cheaters but I seriously haven’t seen it on the PS4 and I was wondering if it was just a PC problem?
Just don’t fucking dash it’s that simple
My problem with this level is that of my hundreds of qualifications and losses....I've played it once.

        No fans of rise against here I see....
            Imagine being a "fan" of rise against
Like those falling Minecraft maps where you had to safely get to the bottom without dying
    Droppers
        That would be neat
Mix it together with Tip Toe; find the tile that will disappear.
You are die slower lol
 
 Edit: dunno why the downvotes just helping em out
    Meant to type You'd. Will edit.
        Thank you. Now I can sleep easy
Now this... this is po-fucking-etic
I am he as you are he as you are me and we all fall together.
Is that a fucking persona reference?
You gotta dive after
    With me, dives when you’re not moving just stall my jump, without much if any horizontal movement. I’ll try it next time though!
        Jump then dive
            Don’t know why you were downvoted, you can jump dive jump and run normally.
Indeed it is possible to escape, as the previous commenter said. I suggest holding forwards while jumping, and adding a dive if you think you won't make it. But the dive is often not necessary.
You’re just bad. You can always get up and go to another tile if you do it right.
I'm also on console. Make sure your tapping the jump button and not holding it down very long because the input seems not to come out sometimes when you hold it longer
    Hmm good advice I’ll remember that
I call them beans, but "Fall Beans" doesn't have quite the same ring.
Yeah I feel that strategy was good early on but players are better at it now. I’m no pro but I’m always angling my camera down to work out where I’m gonna drop on the level below.
    I angle my camera up, to see the sun. Shadow tile spoofing is much easier this way. 17 Hexy wins so far
        Shadow tile spoofing?
            Im just fucking around ;) Happy Friday!
                Oh damn lol, I'm so frustrated with this level I really hoped that was a real trick
                    Lol this got me too, I'm pretty good at Hex and was like, "wtf is that"
                        It's a wild Yellr! Your vids are great man, would have loved to see a shadow spoofing one hahaha
                            Lol thanks man, glad you enjoy the content!  I try to make it as good as possible
the issue with slow-jumping in big games is that players will focus really hard on cutting each other off, and players are everywhere. I've yet to have a game where someone else does a handshake with me and we both slowly hop on the same level.
I just drop down and make a hole in the middle of the last 3 rows
Yup. I’ve tried the strategy a number of times and it never works out for me. All my wins have come by playing as slow as possible. I don’t even run to cut people off unless there is A) no one above me, and B) someone on my level who will end up with a larger area to jump on if I don’t cut them off.

Keeping yourself alive and staying away from others is the best strategy 90+% of the time. If there is anyone above you at all, you want the tiles on your level to disappear as slow as possible and wait at least until you’re tied for the top position before getting aggressive
my solution to that is to stop 1-2 levels above the bottom. Let others doing the strategy remove the lower levels.
oh yeah, every game is situational. I just found that not sitting at the top early has worked well for me.
Great. Now the FBI are outside my house.
