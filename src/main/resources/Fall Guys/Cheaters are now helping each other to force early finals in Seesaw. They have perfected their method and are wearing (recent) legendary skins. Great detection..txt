[[Cheaters are now helping each other to force early finals in Seesaw. They have perfected their method and are wearing (recent) legendary skins. Great detection.]]





No way cheaters are being "banned" at the end of games.  This is all just a bunch of bullshit. So sad to see so many cheaters and to have them try to silence to community when they bring up the concerns.
    Yeah, many of the cheaters have 10 crown skins, which means their cheats have gone undetected, the whole “cheaters get banned after the round” is bullshit
        
Not to mention the level 40 celebration as well...
        Unless they some how hacked to get them but yeah
            Amusingly enough this was actually possible at release. There was no server-side verification of whether you actually had the currency.
                Bro what era am I living in. This is the kind of shit I was seeing in like fucking 2000-2010 back when people didn't understand the nature of cheaters. I think by fucking now we should all know better.... 

You could almost make the case that it's a free game and you get what you pay for but it's NOT EVEN FREE.
                    Even free games have better cheat detection and prevention methods.
                        Warframe to give an example is free and warns you if it detects cheat engine upon opening the launcher. Choosing to ignore said warning and launching the game anyways will give you a nice ban to your account. Don't see why the devs here can't deal with it. Surely they've raked in a fortune from the game's popularity to hire an anti-cheat specialist team?
                            Hell, if you're going to do any kind of multiplayer the least I would expect is that you did something to take care of what is essentially a hex editor that is easy to use like a game genie.
                    Well you've gotta think, the devs didn't even think to include some sort of lag abuse prevention. Something like "hit-reg." A system that would prevent things like grabbing a tail from 10 feet away among other huge lag based issues. This is something that has existed since 2010, possibly earlier.
            They aren't. They are just using cheat engine to adjust client side character values which shouldn't exist at all, let alone not on the server side. Its about as script-kiddy as it gets. From the cheat forums, there is anti cheat detection but it genuinely only kicks in if someone caps any of the values. 

If you go 20x faster rather than 200xfaster, you won't get detected and banned. The ban parameters were figured out which is why there are so many repeat offenders every game now. The fact it doesn't snap ban mid-show between games for anything over 1.0 speed, grab, stun, jump, etc is laughable.
                Snap banning for slightly over 1.0 speed would result in tons of false bans. Just provide a little bit of lag and the server could see the client moving over 1.0 speed.
                    Getting hit by obstacles would do the same. And I've seen plenty of clips of people getting flung into the air by parts of the doors in Door Dash, so the zero gravity hacks are harder to track as well
                        Obstacles cap physics impulse to a particular terminal velocity
                        All this calculation should be done server side then synced to the client and correct the values there, which were computed there just to reduce lag in visuals. Unfortunately small indie company cannot afford such strong servers.
                    At this point it's gotten so annoying I'd rather get kicked from the game with a false positive occasionally than play with cheaters
                They shouldn't let you connect online with cheat engine open. Many games do that so Mediatonic should consider doing that as well.
                Holy shit cheat engine is still a thing? Lol
                    Speaks volumes to how laughable the problem is, doesn't it?
        [deleted]
            There's a small reason to not instantly ban them, because then cheaters can use that to figure out exactly what gets detected and work around it. Delaying the ban until the end of the round or game slows down their ability to figure out the exact ban parameters.
    I just leave the game as soon as I spot a cheater, I'm not winning anyway. Everyone should do this, let the cheaters have fun playing by themselves.
        I will stay in until a team game to see if i can eliminate them through sabotage or something. Then i leave
            I did this but then I realised 2 things:

Sometimes thier team is stupid and takes the easy quality/some games it’s actually hard to sabotage the hacker.

More importantly any interaction with a hacker is still feeding into them.

If most of the lobby just quits as soon as there is a hacker they won’t have people to cheat against and there will be a better metric for devs to realise players won’t put up with this.

Eventually enough of those people won’t even re-queue every time there is a hacker.
        That's the plan as soon as I'm done grinding to 40. Until then, just gotta smile and take it.
        You're just giving them free wins, which is exactly what they want. They could care less if you drop out.   Your best bet is to coordinate against them if they land in an opposing team color.
            Imo they want to make people miserable, if you ignore them you've taken their fun from them.  Also it's so incredibly hard to win against cheaters even if everyone coordinates that it's not worth trying.
                I don’t believe any cheater in this game cares if you’re ignoring them or not. All they care about is laughing all the way to the crown. Getting the crown means they’ve cheated up to 59 other people out of a crown, regardless of the circumstance or your feelings against them.

This is the same mentality as your parents telling you not to give your bully any attention. I grew up being told that and guess what, it didn’t stop the bullying
    yeah they only type that to make people feel better. given how many cheaters i see every day, and it's getting worse, they aren't doing anything..
    I quit playing because of it.  I'm not alone.
    My partner joined the discord to report a player for cheating and they literally told him "Dont worry about it, we know what we're doing." Insanely infuriating.
    This is how online games die.
Honestly i don't know how fall guys has this huge cheater problem , i mean mechanically the game is very simple , so maybe you can measure the speed at which everyone is moving and if one fall guy's speed measurement exceeds the normal speed for extended periods of time without being pushed by anything he should be yeeted out of the game permanently . And the same goes for flying . and this obviously should go in conjunction with other classic anti cheat methods to prevent users from installing programs that alter how the game runs .
    I think a potential roadblock is running into false positives due to the game being physics based and having a spontaneous nature.
        Yeah of course there will be some challenges but i think at the very least they should flag suspicious players and see if the suspicious activity continues throughout the following rounds . And maybe even record the video of said match automatically so if there was a false positive it could be quickly corrected .
            Continuous red flags should be easy to identify though
                What if we had player moderators, and if multiple reports align then the player gets banned

Edit: it could get abused, but to avoid this the final ban must be approved by a Mediatonic employee or it must be something easily measured, like speed or amount of time off the ground, barring physics glitches.
                    Too easy to abuse. Some group of trolls reporting someone who beats them.
                        You can have something like Overwatch in CS:GO where the reported person's demos get randomly distributed to people who give a simple yes/no that the person is cheating. It's even much simpler because it's easy for anyone to know when someone is cheating in Fall Guys
                            Building a system like that is _really_ complex
                                It requires a replay system first and foremost, so you're right. I think the right move at this point is getting some stopgaps that provide basic detection, and then work on a replay + report system to create this.
                                These guys doing some armchair construction: Just build the Burj Khalifa that should take care of your housing problem.
                            I think you’re in to something there. I dunno if something that complex could be implemented but I feel like even a short 3 second clip could show whether someone is hacking or it’s just physics or a false report by a salty player.
                            Hook that up to a machine learning algo too. Eventually you'll get an ai that can do it at a high success rate without needing players to vote yes/no
        Right but a player being yeeted one time very briefly by landing on a Door Dash part is very measurably different than a person who spends the better part of multiple rounds in a row travelling above allowed speeds.
        [deleted]
            If those spinners on fall mountain hit you right, you go flying.
                With a speed-detection thing, they could just make it so hitting a bumper or spinner disables it for a split second and watches the players speed over the next few seconds.  When if you get launched really far, your speed is still constantly dropping as you fly.

Basically, it would ban people who go over the max speed unless they hit a bumper/spinner/hammer, and when they do hit those things, the game would watch their speed to make sure its dropping like it should and people aren't just hitting the spinners before activating the cheat.  This would limit false positives.
            Programming on map specific is a bad idea tho, we don’t know how fall guys will evolve over time but it will have more maps and modes, and it might even have community maps, programming on map specifics can be come a hell in the future, any programming against cheaters now should be future proof, or at least trying to.
            I mean the same could be said about a map like Door Dash but I have a clip of myself being launched into orbit on that map. Something to do with the way I was bumped before landing on one of the slightly bouncy doors.
        I'm sure there's some things they can do like checking if they finished the level faster than is possible.
            It gets a little complex as more and more strats evolve in ways that weren’t accounted for originally. For all we know, there’s some hidden exploit that can somehow launch you from the start to the end in one go.
        Yeah, but let's be honest.  As of this moment, they have millions of points of data about how much time is humanly possible to complete a level.  If anyone exceeds that now by a reasonable threshold, banned for 1 day.  Do it again, banned +1 day for each instance.

As for flying, just make it so if you don't touch any surface for longer than the longest legit drop in the game you fall to your death.  If it happens more than n times in a week, banned.  Same rule as above.  The exception is because of the physics, with things to smack you around being so unpredictable, may as well leave some room for chance.

And this means if someone keeps doing it, they screw themselves more and more.
        Using some statistics, you could probability estimate the probability that a player would have a given probability mass function for velocity.

You wouldn't be able to say for certain if someone was a cheater, but you would be able to estimate the probability that such a player would exist, given how far away they are from an average player. Then you could flag outliers for review.

But that aside, there are probably much easier ways to detect these cheaters (for example they're not touching the ground for extended periods of time), and I think the game developer is just not doing it.
    I've actually seen cheaters do something more subtle such as increase their walking speed to like 1.5x.
        But even that should be detectable. If the server is expecting a checksum from the memory data to include a movement speed of 1x, setting it to 1.5x will cause the checksum to fail.
            The server currently only checks for the maximum value allowed for each and every variable 😂
        To an algorithm checking for cheaters, 1.1* natural walking speed (ie with zero collisions) should be as blazingly obvious as 100*.
    Seriously, this boggles my mind too. You can easily log y movement relative to the ground (maybe not as easy in see saw but definitely doable for other levels where the ground is static), and then kick players who have values which are unobtainable with normal movement. Block players where it happens x times in a row, as sometimes beans do get yeeted high up in the air due to beans physics
        The far easier way to manage this is that the client should be sending expected checksums of memory values that do not change permanently. While you may be flung and moved faster than you can run (by objects, server desync between you and other clients), your base movement speed is still 1x. If a hack is adjusting memory values of base movement speed, the checksum fails.

You may be flung higher into the air than you can normally jump. Your base maximum jump height, and gravity value bringing you back to the ground do not change. If a player is sending unexpected values in jump height or gravity values the checksum fails.

If a client hack is sophisticated enough to send data that makes the server think the player is being repeatedly lifted by an in-game object (hammer, door dash piece), the server has implicit information available to determine if that object is actually at the same coordiniates as the player. If the object the client is saying is there is not there, the checksum fails and they're moving incorrectly.
            So much this. From what I have read so far, this info is almost all currently handled client side and the server checks only exist at full caps. Cheaters are telling other cheaters the detection limits, and now more people cheat and don't get caught.
            Most of these comments are people taking stabs in the dark and not really understanding the difficulty of catching false positives and the toll on servers that constant logging for every player would do. Cutting this off at the source like this comment is saying would easily do the trick and is the right way to handle this.
        Yeah exactly , you can at least flag people with suspicious values and investigate further
    I have made severals posts about utilising this technique and you usually get hand-wringing spaff of a human moaning about false positives, like the devs would really just do "If speed >= 500 then 'ban' else 'nothing'"  

It's honestly batshit insane that A) this game has such a problem with cheating and B) the complete and utter lack of imagination and understanding, yet the complete determination to discredit any attempt to stop cheating.
        Most of those who discredit attempts to stop cheating are people who do it or have done it themselves.
        This is how all these BR games are getting now. Especially on mobile! Pubg and cod mobile (maybe fortnite) both are overrun with people who are so obviously cheating that they could easily implement a flagging system. However the devs really do think somehow there are elite mobile players who manage to kill 37 people out of 100  on average over like 100 matches. Its lazy and unreal
        Nope, calculating speed would require too much computation power and could cause sever over loaded. To improve performance, we decided to not implement any server side validation at all /s
    They could even offload this detection from the server to the players as I'd expect it to be somewhat CPU heavy. When non cheating clients detect unusual movements for extended periods from cheater clients they make a report to the server and if enough of these reports come in the cheater gets booted.

        Looking in from the outside, and with very limited gamedev experience, I also can't see how the name thing hasn't been fixed. From what I remember, the problem was that you could use html formatting or something? But like... Just display it as plaintext with default formatting... Cap how tall/wide the text box is so you don't get weird stuff with unicode diacritics either.

Of course, it's easy to say "just do X" when you don't know how the game is built up.
            [deleted]
                I believe that was the original reason. But then they realized there is an E style family rating thing they want to go for. 

Which means steam allows 'any names', so they want to censor names more than steam does. So sometimes people use inappropriate names they want to block. I think that is the hold up now. Trying to devise a censorship style system. Perhaps build their own name system separate from steam?



Especially if they want cross plat play with playstation 1 day.
                    AFAIK this was the reason I thought they were disabled too.
                    Don't all rated games with multiplayer have a disclaimer along the lines of "online game not rated"
                        I don't mean in any official organizational rating, but I think they want to be children family friendly.
                    It's a pretty shit excuse at this point because the game is suffering from a massive cheating problem.  They're trying to fix something that MIGHT be an issue in the future over something that is a rampant festering wound right now.
            Yeah the names are messed up... Why don't they just rename everything that isn't standard alphabet character Fall Guys #### or just omit those characters... Or even a million times easier - let everyone name themselves inside the actual game... If they want to do crossplay it would be beneficial anyway to have a Fall Guys account so you can share your progress between devices. I love this game and I know shit about programming but I swear I never felt like this in any other game. It genuinely feels like they can't code... Hotfix for the names shouldn't take longer than a week under absolutely no circumstances.
    Another option might be to record the player’s controls and play back where they *should* be on the server side, with a certain margin of error. If they are way off, then flag them as a potential cheater. You’d probably have to resynchronize every few seconds to account for network lag as well.
        I’m sure there are innumerable ways to detect this shit. It’s 2020 and MMO games are not a new thing.
    Makes me think of this great fantasy book series, Foundryside.

Basically in the world they have these sigils instead of technology. Sigils with commands, that experts could write logic into to do things like make a carriage think it's going downhill so it rolls forward without the need of horses.

The protagonist can "talk" to the sigils, and essentially debates their programming. So when the programmer takes shortcuts, she can exploit them. These orbs were told to float simply "a foot" from an object. She redefined how long a foot was to make them all shoot in super close.

The game is simple enough that I can't imagine it'd harm performance to code in some hard detection systems. Maybe even AI that learns from cheaters' behaviors vs normal behavior, and then recognizes and bans cheaters.
    Xenoverse 2 has the bigger problem
    It’s a game made by a pretty small studio and it exploded in popularity in a way that was unexpected. They just weren’t ready to deal with the problems that come with such a big playerbase so now they’re going to have to play catch-up for a while. 

I’ve been in a ton of meetings when smaller companies discuss allocating resources to prevent problems that come with success at a scale beyond what seems like a reasonable prediction and they always get called ‘nice problems to have’ and then the can gets kicked down the road. I’ve never met a nice problem that wasn’t just a bloody ball-ache when it actually came to pass.
        Pretty much this. Whenever there's scalability issues people are always like "well why didn't they plan on selling this many copies" or something that implies as such. But demand forecasting is a very difficult thing and overestimating demand is usually a far more costly mistake than underestimating it. If you make 10,000 copies of a product and get a 100,000 people wanting to buy them then that's an issue as you have 40,000 disgruntled potential customers who you can't sell to right now. But it's manageable because you can try and increase supply and hope the demand is still there when you get the supply. If you make 50,000 copies of a product however and only sell 10,000 you're now sat on 40,000 units worth of inventory that you've paid to have produced and you have to pay to warehouse, and all of it is just bleeding money.

In this case yeah they could have sunk a bunch of time and assets into making a more robust multiplayer game better adapted to handling the issues that come with such a large playerbase. But if the game didn't take off like it did they'd have spent a bunch of time and money for nothing. And yeah people are frustrated right now, but they'll have time to correct the problems before those frustrations grow too great.
    Someone hire this man
This level of virginity is rarely captured in nature. Thank you for documenting.
    Imagine wanting to cheat in a game about sentient buttplugs.
        Alright go put jellybeans in your ass and don’t come crying that you need surgery to get them out
            Way ahead of you.
                Pics or it didn't happen
                    * *X-rays* or it didn't happen
            Where we're from, we call them grizznuggets
            They're jellybeans.  Just let them dissolve.
            Dude, they dissolve surprisingly quickly. Like, not overnight, but if you don't poop them out there won't be a trace within a week...
                But they don’t dissolve ingame what this guy is saying to use as a buttplug
        Sentient 6 foot butt plugs\*
            They- they aren’t 6 foot

I refuse to believe that
        I see this argument brought up a lot, but I don't quite get it. 

Is there some type of game where it isn't pathetic and lame to cheat ? I don't see why the goofy aesthetic of Fall Guys is always cited as some big reason not to cheat.

I'm sorry but cheating in any game is fucking sad. Doesn't matter whether it's about sentient buttplugs, non-sentient buttplugs, or anything else.
    Read that in Attenborough’s voice lol
    *clap.....clap, clap clap clap clap*
Its sad, they are doing this so blatantly knowing they won't get banned.
    And taunting the other players. They're having fun screwing other people out of their free time. So they're kids, because they don't understand the actual value of free time.
        I encountered a couple of cheaters and won in separate finals (both Royal Fumble).

The first never touched a tail. He was just having fun tripping people (he was also tripping people in earlier levels).

The second, who can fly, stole the tail with us, but he jumped up and down near the ground, and chose to stay in the ground taunting us. We non-cheaters stole the tail a couple of times, and he stole the tail back easily. In the last 15 seconds I got the tail, and managed to keep it. He focused his efforts in those last few seconds tripping and grabbing the other guy, I guess because I was also using a Pedro skin like him?

A lot of these cheaters probably don't care to win anymore. They probably laugh at those who grief their own team because of them. They just treat the game like a GTA SA with their cheats playing god and doing whatever they want with us non-cheaters, treating us as NPCs.
            Lets not refer to them as "playing god", makes them actually sound cool. Lets refer to what they're doing correctly: Being pathetic
                And honestly i feel like people who cheat on FALL GUYS A GAME THAT IS A CHILDISH GAME, IS MORE OF A LOSER THAT THEY WANNA CHEAT, Like honestly if you cheat on Fall Guys how much of a no life are you?
                    I think this kind of salty comments encourages them even more
                        I don't think there's anything that actually discourages them in the first place tbh. They lack the empathy to give a shit and like seeing people complain in any way. There is no real penalty to them as it stands.
                            If you cheat on a game like fall guys you are really a kid with nothing better to do and I mean really nothing better to do, nothing will discourage this type of behavior, it is already the bottom of the pit
        no i can totally see grown men doing this out of sadistical pleasure
    Until I see or read evidence of people getting banned, I'm assuming nobody has been banned since day one.
        Yeah, reading ban wave threads where people get mass banned in other games and go to complain to the creators of the scripts they used is one of my biggest joys in life. Where are those threads for fall guys?
Fall guys twitter: Cheaters always get get caught immediately and banned after the first game!

Meanwhile every cheater I encounter has a 10 crown skin equipped.
    Didn't they also say that the Fall Mountain crown won't let you grab it if you reach it too quickly? So much for that, the guy in this video got it in a matter of seconds.
        My wife played a game last night where the cheater won instantly.   He actually appeared to still be on the starting line when the round ended.
            That happened to me the first time I got into the finals... It sucks that people have to take the fun out of it for everyone else
    Feel bad for you guys. In ps4 I have seen 0 hackers.
        ye cant hack in ps4
            This is why I am happy that I play the ps4 version of the game.
                [deleted]
                    this game made me sign up for ps plus for the first time since i don't normally play online
                    It's free with the thing that you pay for.
                    This is always a dumb statement. It's not free if you pay any amount of money to have access to it. Ps+ and game pass are great deals, but stop calling them games free.
                        Exactly, having to pay just for the privilege to access multiplayer gaming is absurd.

                            Yeah its really irritating how many cheaters and no lifes there are, when they're cheaters who do no harm to anyone, then its fine, can care less but if it's cheaters ruining the fun then thats a big bother.
                            Yeah, when PC hackers ruined Dragon Ball Xenoverse for me, I had regretted not playing on the PS4. Now, whenever I can choose, I play on the PS4 to avoid hackers.

                            Most of the people on pcmasterrace are hilariously uninformed. And btw you cant hack on a console.
                            My friends and I do the same, but also make self deprecating jokes as our main form of gaming together is on PS4. While a small portion of me is enjoying the dumpster fire that is Fall Guys on PC, the rest really wants them to fix it. Cross play with no hackers would do magic for the game and community.
                    So is r/consolemasterrace but it's satire lol
                        Tbf PC master race started as satire and has now been adopted literally.
                            Recently they've come back around to accepting consoles for what they are. I haven't read the word "peasant" in quite a while, actually.
                                Maybe everyone realised it was all meaningless
                                    There are still a ton of people that take pcmr literally. 

Sad, lonely, pathetic people, but they're still people.
            it is completely dependent on the game. ps4 hacks take far longer to develop but the console is by no means unhackable
            You actually can, provided your PS4 has firmware version 6.72 or lower installed - downgrading is impossible. You still can't hack on XB1, however.
                But it means you can't play online.
                    Not necessarily - IIRC there were public methods for bypassing it back in 5.05, although 6.72 may or may not currently be stuck offline - I haven't followed the homebrew scene in a while.
                        Even if you can the barrier for entry is way higher. On pc all you have to do is google Fall Guy Hack and pay some dude $10 a month to easily cheat.
            I swear with every game I enjoy on PS4 I look on its subreddit and find out that it is absolutely miserable on PC because of hackers.
        Yep, I'm at level 37 and have never seen a single cheater on PS4. Really sorry to PC bros, that sucks.
        The hacking problem is the reason I haven’t bought it for pc yet
        It's a PC only issue.
    Damage control. Devs know it's a problem but they're more focused on meme'ing on socials and hosting Twitch Rivals tourneys.
        [deleted]
        The social media and the tournaments are all run by people who have nothing to do with making the game.
            [deleted]
                Oh definitely.
            It still doesn't look good for them if cheaters are in these big tournaments.
        It was infuriating seeing the season 2 preview and zero mention anti-cheat solutions. What’s the point of adding onto something that’s broken!?
    I mean they could just be hacking in skins too.
        Skins are hopefully, probably serverside. If they changed them, then they are actual hackers and not just script kiddies.
what's even the point of cheating in this game? there's no ELO
    I'm guessing they're taking advantage of the fact that they can't be easily detected. Stockpiling on crowns so they can stop cheating at a certain time but buy every new cool skin that gets released.

Either that or stockpiling the accounts so they can sell them later.

Or they're kids and they're bored. Some kids really aren't that developed yet and I can hardly blame them for not understanding how they're screwing over so many people out of their free time.
        > not understanding how they're screwing over so many people out of their free time.

Oh they understand, that's why they think is fun to do it
            Kids are sadistic little gremlins
                Seriously. Who keeps making these things?
        I don't know why you think these people have to be kids or are doing it for money. Seriously. So many adults would do this just to piss people off and waste their time. They don't care. Why would they?
            If there are adults doing that I really don't consider them as adults, they are in that category where you just think ew
    The Electric Light Orchestra could compliment this game quite well, I agree.
        damn i wish i had known about your username when i taught diff eq for a semester. would've told my students to pm you instead of email me for their homework.
    Loads of hackers don't hack to win, they see other people as toys to play with an manipulate. They feel elated when they get someone to rage. They have control complexes and get no joy from a fair game because they cannot stand the feeling of failure.
    Skins and some people like the feeling of wasting 59 other people's time. It gives them a feeling of power and control.
    To get crowns and skins
Can I just say your movement on seesaw was immaculate
    Thanks, I'm one of those sweaty try hards.
        A try hard is way more respectable than these documented low-life’s.
Just quit early and find another game when you see low-lifes like this. Cut your losses, it's not worth the frustration.

Let them feel good about their hollow undeserved win and the cosmetics that come with it. You know, I know and they know, they suck balls at the game and life in general to resort to something like this in a party game like this.
    I always leave, but this time I was in my third game on a win streak. I've won against a cheater before (them flying against the pillar in showdown and ragdolling to their death).

No streak = instant leave.
        I'm actually glad you posted it because I was curious what happened after everyone is eliminated.
        You can leave a game without losing the streak.  It's only if you've been offixially "eliminated" that the streak gets busted
            Good to know
        Aye that sucks... That achievement is so hard as it is and cheaters being dickheads doesn't help one bit. Just consider it a pointless achievement on PC because of so many hackers getting it without any effort, be happy with the rest of your progress!
        You can quit and still keep the streak for the achievement alive.

It only ends if you get the "eliminated" screen and  your rewards for that show.
        > but this time I was in my third game on a win streak

Did the patch out the "exploit" for that achievement?  Last I heard it only breaks your streak if you are eliminated and receive the eliminated screen.  But I haven't seen anyone talk about it one way or another recently.
            I have never heard of an exploit for that.
                Apparently if you close the app before you’re eliminated it won’t count it as a loss.
                    Lowkey glad that’s in the game cause the trophy is near impossible otherwise
    [deleted]
    It's why I kind of like the cheaters who make it blatantly obvious in the early rounds, means I can just dip out and not waste my time in a doomed game. The ones who really piss me off are the ballbags who don't cheat until the final round, and then just start flying the moment it starts. 

The ones who cheat from round one are still scummy fuckwits who ruin the game for people, but at least they aren't forcing me to waste my own time by continuing a game thinking there's no hackers when there actually are.
        Agree with that, also recently had a 3rd kind of cheater, they didn't cheat until a team game in the 4th round. No idea what they were thinking but of course they lost lol
    Glad ps4 doesn't have to deal with shit like this. Just M&KB for fps games but that's it.

        Actually yeah
Hey OP, that the Volcano colour you're wearing?
    Yes!
        Best colour ever! ^(If you like black & orange)
            Unfortunately it’s more of a muted brown. I wish they used the same near pitch-black as they do with the black/white.

Edit: Same with the black face, which is actually a shitty grey that only matches the grey on stealthy.
                I think that's only bc the orange metallic is kinda combined with the black. You notice it best when you're changing your look, and wear the pattern with no pattern and apply any  colour. (Works best with metallic colours)

The second colour often "shines through" the main colour
    It does appear to be
COPY-PASTED from a review on Steam

 THE GAME RUNS ENTIRELY CLIENT-SIDE, which means people can blatantly speedhack with no special hack tools. The game also has NO ANTI-CHEAT, AT ALL. The closest thing to anti-cheat is a single text channel in the game's official Discord where you can manually report cheaters, which, surprise, doesn't actually get any cheaters banned. 

 Users were able to use HTML in their Steam username to make their names appear large or colorful in-game. I never once saw this used for anything malicious yet the developers went nuclear and decided that, RATHER THAN FIXING the html injection, to just force every single player's in-game name to "Fall Guy ####". WHY NOT JUST FIX THE HTML IN USER'S NAMES. Let me give your programmers a hint, it's called input sanitization, you can look up a tutorial for it on YouTube and actually do your job.

So with those two problems coupled together, yeah let me just go and file a report against someone with nothing but the username "Fall Guy 1234" to go on—I can't even track their Steam account through recent games. Keep in mind also that this game has a million-some players and there are only 4 digits in each randomized name, so there are going to be several dozen duplicates of each numerical name. The devs couldn't track that to a player even if they wanted to, so no one is getting banned for cheating. Great work guys. It's only going to get worse as the game goes on if nothing gets fixed.
    Always wondered why the PC version used "Fall Guy ####" as opposed to the players actual username. Thought it was still in beta or something on steam etc.
        Because it's supposed to be a fun, family friendly game which doesn't work when there's usernames with N bombs in them on steam.
            Just... turn off usernames then?
                I'm just explaining their reasoning.
            I’ve seen loads of shitty names on PS4 so idk what your talking abou
                Sony has some guidelines for the naming of your account, right? Steam doesn't, which makes it easier to exploit
    As a Unity developer myself, I happen to know that 99% of Unity devs are absolute garbage. My old company tried for 4 years to hire another one (to help me), before giving up and pivoting the entire company away from using Unity LOL

Sidenote, there's literally a single checkbox for Text objects to stop the HTML injection. It might not look as crisp but a lot of this would have been avoided
        Game producer here. Fuckin agreed. Ended up just getting a programmer and asking them to learn Unity which was a step down for them and they basically saved my fucking game.
        Every time I see a game made in Unity I know to wait six months before I even bother looking at it for purchase. Unity attracts so many novices.
        I've been trying to learn Unity but this comment makes me feel like it's not worth it :/
            There's an insane amount of companies hiring Unity Devs, it's just that a lot of non- Software Engineers learn Unity as a hobby and you get a shit ton of unqualified candidates. 
 
Meanwhile learning Unreal Engine or making your own engine requires a lot more skill, so it's easier to find competent professionals with that knowledge.
                >a lot of non- Software Engineers learn Unity as a hobby and you get a shit ton of unqualified candidates. 

This is the reason
    lets not forget the pink pineapple skins that have been an issue from day 1
    wow the devs really are incompetent
    Small indie company /s
    The devs also no longer accept hacker reports because “iF yOU seE A hACkEr, it WIlL bE ThEIR LaST timE”
    Jesus the devs need to hire someone who actually knows how to do shit
    > I never once saw this used for anything malicious yet the developers went nuclear and decided that, RATHER THAN FIXING the html injection, to just force every single player's in-game name to "Fall Guy ####". 

I did! IIRC you could make giant letters out of that, and at one point I turned on usernames and there was a giant “C U M” on the screen. Gave me a fright cuz my younger cousins were watching me, but fortunately they missed it.
    Fall Guys programmers go brrrrr.
How pathetic must you be to just ruin a game like this? people just want to play and have fun. ive never seen small dick energy like it before.
    The taunting is icing on the cake.
That was so satisfying seeing 40 jelly beans fall
    Must admit, it's a fun sound.
hate everytime i see someone with the volcano skin cause it refuses to show up in my shop
Mad props for calling them what they are and not giving them the dignity of being "hackers." Script kiddies are such a pest.
    The developer of the hack is the hacker.

The users are the script kiddies.
        Its not a hack. They use cheat engine. The tool for cheating in single player games.
            What a fucking joke that cheat engine works on a game like this.

I don't know if they will ever read my message, but Devs. I am enjoying this game a lot, it's the perfect game for a quick game and then leave and do something else.

This cheater problem is getting out of control, I have encountered quite a lot more cheaters in this game than Apex when it was in peak cheating days. You really need to start focusing on making sure cheaters get banned. I know this idea could be bad, but why not having a "God" in each game? What I mean is that someone on your development team could be an invisible god taking a look at running games just to see if someone cheats, and just ban them inmediatly. I think that working on a real fix while having invisible silent "gods" that watch matches unravel could ease a bit of the pain this mishandleing of your cheater problem is doing, the cheating is starting to get annoying and it just gets worse day by day.

Sincerely, a concerned fan.
    I love the idea or if someone cheats you can report them to get flagged and sent to a game with the "god".
This is just pathetic. I've changed my review on steam from positive to negative today. It's not going to do much but if others follow, the Devs may do something due to the pressure
    I’ve stopped playing. The last time I played I had a cheater in *every* game (I wish I was exaggerating in this one). This isn’t fun anymore
        Change your review to negative. Others are.  

https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097150/Fall_Guys_Ultimate_Knockout/
        Yeah, last three finales there's been a cheater in every single one. I'm not playing without better detection
            Same for me, changing my review to negative.
        A couple of days ago I had 9 cheaters in 10 games. Weirdly enough, I won 2 of them. Some dumbass was taunting me during Jump Showdown and accidentally dropped too low when going up and down next to me above the slime.

That was my worst streak of cheaters, though. Haven't seen that many again
    This. Sadly, this is the only thing we can do. I tried posting videos here and Twitter, trying to figure out how to help. But there is honestly nothing we can do. It is simply frustrating.
    No that’s exactly why nobody pays attention to steam ratings.
        If you see mixed reviews and everyone is calling out the cheater problem, would you buy the game? Steam reviews are great for users.
        What are you talking about? I've decided against buying games several times after the reviews warned that the game was broken, buggy, full of hackers, abandoned, etc... Plus if the devs did something bad enough to lead to a review bomb, that's valuable information.

So, at least be one person pays attention to ratings.
    Why exactly do you think they're not doing anything? They're a small indie team and implementing a third-party anti-cheat is a monumental task.
Can someone please explain why the round suddenly ended?
    Every round has a hidden timer. When the game is still going when the timer goes off, everyone that didn't finish will be eliminated. If no one qualified, a random player will get the crown.

The players that do qualify, go on like usual.

The cheaters know about this, so they can have their friend qualify, and then stop the rest from going through. They know everyone will be eliminated and the game will go to the final round because not enough people qualified for more races / game modes.

This way they can have a final every 7-ish minutes.
        I see, thanks for informing
    There is invisible time countdown in every racing stage.
I don't get why pc players aren't mass refunding the game yet?
How much are you guys planning to put up with?

The game was free on PS4 and we have zero problems with cheaters.  You PC guys got fucked, and you paid for the privilege.
    Can't refund the game as I have more than 15 hours into the game now :( at first I didn't mind, I was just having fun, not hoping to win. But now whenever I think that I have a chance to win for the first time, a hacker is always there!
        Yeah I was actually convinced they were doing something about the problem back at the beginning.
        If they're is enough outcry, they'll make an exception.
            Valve let users do that with NMS, I think they will do the same for this game as well if enough users complain.
                If this shit keeps going on and the devs show no sign of fixing it, Valve will definitely give them the middle finger
    >I don't get why pc players aren't mass refunding the game yet?

It's incredibly difficult (though possible) to refund a game on Steam once you've used it for over 2 hours. Most of us passed that time simply waiting for the servers to work in the early days, and so the game became non-refundable without even playing it.
        I had no idea the return period was so short.
            I think it's more of a "will this game run and play alright" kind of timeframe. Wether you like/enjoy the game after several hours isn't enough grounds for a refund, and some games can be completed in a few hours.
        That was when I got my refund. I couldn't play a game for two days due to the servers booting me out every time. Now my decision has been vindicated with the rampant cheating.
    I’m not refunding because I haven’t encountered many cheaters and the game is a lot of fun
        I haven’t seen any yet either. I believe it is because the game has SBMM and I don’t have a win yet though. Most of the cheaters probably appear in the higher skill lobbies.
            that might explain it, if i play for 1-2 hours i'll see at least 3 cheaters

they're also more common when i play with friends instead of alone
    I came here trying to figure this out, Cheaters are only on PC correct?
        Correct
            Fortunate for console players but fuck these idiots ruining things for the PC crowd.  I didnt even know the extent they were able to manipulate the game, I thought it was just soaring to the finish line.
                You can make yourself immune to grab, alter how for you can push someone, make it so players who touch you get stunned, etc. Full suite of cheat engine at your disposal. Its a joke.
    I havent because I dont run into cheaters that often. Maybe one every 20 games
    Anecdotal, but I don't see hackers too often and when I do, it tends to be the first round. So I just back out and find another match. Minimal time wasted. There's still the chance of winning the cheater lottery and being in another lobby with another cheater.

Staying in the game when you see a hacker is almost always just wasting your time. Yes, sometimes you can beat them in a team game, but it's not worth it. They don't care if you stop them once. They care that they rustled your jimmies.
        What we see are the obvious noob hackers. Imagine how many cheaters there are that use slight speed boosts or that are already quite good and only turn on the hacks when they start to lose in the final. 

There must be cheaters in almost every game.
            I think the micro speed increase is a contributor to why my fall mountain win rate is so much worse than all the others. Sometimes other beans just seem slighly faster
                yeap,had some flawless runs where i barely even had to dodge anyting (sometimes didnt even have to dodge anyting at all)only to see a bean reaching the crown by the time im at the 2nd hammer
    I don't have a PS4. My PC was my only option for playing the game.
    > I don't get why pc players aren't mass refunding the game yet?

Wouldn't refund the game even if I could.  I've only seen a handful of cheaters and I've received more than 50 hours of some of the most fun I've had in a LONG time.  That's worth my money and the devs sure aren't going to fix this shit if everyone could and does refund.

This game was made by a small indie team.  Even with all the money they've made (which is probably held up with the publisher), it's not like you can just immediately fix problems like this.  Software development takes time, even if you're implementing existing anti-cheat solutions into your game.

I'm not even going to argue that they're going about it the right way, because the probably aren't, but remember this game has only been out about a month.
    Eh, personally I don't think meeting cheaters every now and then is so horrible to be a reason to quit the game.
        It depends on how often you're meeting them. At first I was seeing them every 5th game, eh, no biggie.

Now I'm meeting them 2 games out of 3. My time is worth more than that.
    wait it was free on ps4?? dang
        It was one of the "free" games you get for having the paid PS+ service that allows you to play online. You get to play the game as long as you have PS+.
            To me, online only games are great for ps plus, you have to pay to be online so might as well get the games that are only playable online as part of the package
>Yeah yeah, who gives a crap? Look how great season two looks!

Devs probably. Those lads n lasses are taking the fucking piss.
    “Hey fellow kids! Check out this fucking hammer we’re calling Big Yeetus even though we barely have a grasp on the product we shipped to begin with!” - Devs, probably
        I promise you that the dude that runs the twitter account is not a dev, and takes absolutely no dev time away from the game.

That’s a completely separate PR position with completely separate responsibilities and prerequisites.
    I knew it was only a matter of time before their cutesy communication and replying to all criticism with a joke was going to wear thin on people.
So what are the rewards for winning the games? What are they cheating to get?
    Cosmetics.

Costumes, colors, patterns.
>Cheater always get banned after first game

Has legendary skins
Had somthing like this happen my last game 1 random player won on round one seesaw there was one hacker that didnt let any get to the finsh line and then i was  Eliminated random player with a dove butt won the game
Mediatonic should add in-game reporting tools even if they aren't going to do anything with the reports. Being able to see data on the sheer difference between what they're detecting and the playerbase is experiencing is vital.

You must have a tiny dick to cheat in fall guys.
FIX YOUR FUCKING GAME I PLAYED 5 GAMES IN A ROW TODAY WITH HACKER THAT GETS QUALIFIED START OF THE ROUND 1-3SECONDS HOW FUCKING HARD FOR A GAME DEVELOPER TO DETECT THIS TYPE OF BULLSHIT.
I’d say give the game time, it’s such a new game that there will be cheaters and hopefully the devs will fix those cheats sometime
    Yes, they are working it as we speak.

https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1302680927605338113
Mediatonic devs are a joke and released a game early without any foresight to what might happen, like with cheaters and the server issues. Change my mind.
    They did a good job of tricking people into thinking it was made by a AAA developer. It looks like it was made by Nintendo and the music is great too. Underneath, however, it is full of flaws. Laughable anti-cheat (obviously), horrible desync, and glitches everywhere (ever seen a group of players bouncing off of each other constantly?)
    >Change my mind.

Like in most companies, the developers don't make the decisions.

There were probably a lot of developers that knew this would happen and warned the higher ups. They then told them how they could prevent it from happening, which would mean a lot of server side verification, which would mean that they probably had to cut down on the max number of players per round (no 60 players starting matches) or they had to pay more money for their server infrastructure.

When money bags hear "that would cost more" they say "but do we need it?".

I'd never actually blame the actual developers.
        Mediatonic is an individual uk studio and it's not like devolver digital is stopping them and they clearly seem to be working on season 2 so why not throw in an anti-cheat while you're at it?
            They're probably doing that. They're just taking their time. 

They should implement a temporary hotfix-like solution in the mean time though.
                Agreed
I'm happy I don't play this mess on PC
i don't plan on getting the game until this problem is solved, unfortunately, I don't have a PS4. If I'm gonna buy game,I have to get the computer version and i'm guessing computer version has so much cheaters.
    0 cheaters on ps4 because it is impossible to cheat there
I just don’t understand what’s fun about cheating
    Small kids who doesnt understand the fun of minigames, literally just qualifying as soon as a minigame starts doesnt give any gameplay and is the same as having someone play for you.
I had a similar thing happen in one of my games, I managed to qualify before the final see saw decided it was never going to reset. Didn’t realise it was from hackers doing this... so disappointing that hackers are having such an impact for us legit players hopefully the report/detection system gets improved soon
Are the cheater issues bad on console or are they just rampant on pc?
    I haven't heard a single person say there are cheaters on PS4.
        I saw what looked like a floater yesterday, but he wasn’t sky high so I was wondering. Besides that i hadn’t heard anything either. It’s all on pc every time I see crap like this.
Is that even fun? How neanderthal do you have to be to enjoy a crown you didn't earn?
"Cheaters aren't that common"
But PC master race
How is that even fun?
PC life must be hell
Cheaters have tiny penises
There’s cheaters in this already roblox look alike game? That’s a hard pass on me. How hard is it to have an anti-cheat system in a simple family friendly game downloaded by millions?
    Not totally defending Mediatonic here, because I don't like the way they've responded to the hacking issue and have seemingly lied about what's being done, but I can see why they might have trouble with a game like this due to its physics-based nature. Especially since they are an indie developer.

Most multiplayer games handle a lot of stuff server-side, which is why cheating is not exactly straightforward/possible in them.  But I would have to imagine that handling the physics calculations for all 60 players exclusively server-side instead of client-side would be way too much, and would probably introduce janky behavior in courses like Whirlygig when latency is involved. Since movement and physics behavior is handled client-side, that opens things up to manipulation on the user end. Any time you rely on the client sending accurate, game-relevant information, you're likely going to have a problem with cheaters. It's why speed and item hacks are a constant problem in every online Mario Kart game, because the item calculations and speed values can be manipulated on the client side, and the server basically just has to "take their word for it". You'd combat this by having some sort of server-side verification - for example, handling item randomization on the server side - but again, for a game like Fall Guys where the physics engine causes players to constantly fly around, I could see why this wouldn't entirely be straightforward.

Graphics, audience demographics, and number of downloads have very little to do with the complexity of implementing anti-cheat.
Boy oh boy am I glad to not be a pc gamer.
    I play on pc and apparently I’m just very lucky because I’ve only seen a few cheaters
        Me too. Almost 50 hours I've seen maybe 3 cheaters.
            I’ve played 32 hours and I think I’ve seen 2 cheaters, one of which immediately jumped off at the beginning of the final round. It’s possible that this subreddit posts hackers so much that people think that hackers are much more common than they are, but then again we could just be lucky
                Some of the cheating may go unnoticed and you also have people who only use cheats in the final round.

I didn't have too many cheaters the past few weeks, but now I am currently playing and am at game 8. 6 of those games had cheaters.

Edit: Just played game number 9, I saw three people flying within a few seconds.
                    That’s true, there are probably a lot that I haven’t noticed
        Same. Maybe 1 in every 20 games. No clue why so many people are encountering cheaters
    We dont need a dickhead saying "glad im not playing on pc" on every thread about cheaters. You dont help and it makes it feel pretty shitty when it is not our fault but the cheaters and the developers for not implementing it a better anti cheat.
Let’s all tag u/FallGuysJoe
This sub: puts high effort into videos exposing hackers as script kiddies to “own” them and makes 600 comment salt mines, providing hackers with endless attention and reactions

Also the sub: I can’t believe people actually hack. What’s even the point???
    Exposing and talking about a shared frustration helps some people to better cope with it.

When people say "What’s even the point?", they understand that some cheaters just enjoy griefing other peoples fun. But they fail to empathize with these players, that's what that sentence actually means.

"What's even the point?" => "I can't empathize with the fact that you'd enjoy ruining other peoples fun." Because they can't empathize, they assume there must be a different reason for them to cheat, but they don't know what that is.
        Damn that was a great way of putting it
            Thanks.

In hindsight of my original post, I hope I didn't kindle the fire in too many players eyes. It was originally meant to insult cheaters as little kids and not to infuriate people towards them or the developers of the game. At this point it seems to have turned into a huge circle jerk and I almost feel bad for seeing so many people turned off by it.
                It’s a complicated issue because you get into this chicken-and-egg situation where hackers cause high-profile posts about them which in turn inspire more hackers after seeing the reaction. To me, this means the only way to meaningfully address this is for someone outside of that cycle, AKA Devolver, to get their shit together and implement an effective anti-cheating system. I question how well this game was coded if people were able to develop hacks within a week of release.
How tf are you so good at seesaw
    It’s basic physics... how are you not good at it
Just make an overwatch system. Players can vent by banning these guys and it's usually very easy to tell, if not 100%, just don't ban
I never see cheaters (do they exist on PS4? I’m level 38 so I’ve played a fair amount) - but how wide spread is this problem?
Luckily I’m on ps4, but it’s sad pc players can’t enjoy a friggin online ragdoll game, like it’s some sort of competitive crap
Must feel like a god when you can cheat your way into the finals.
Imagine cheating in fall guys zero respect for any of these scummy bastards.
Lol what fucking losers, truly. Cheating in a game like this is hilariously sad.
This actually makes me sad. Cheating in a game that’s just supposed to be fun to get on and chill. I just don’t get it
I had a guy sit on top of the spinning bar final game. Getting all that way just to see a cheater sucks.
I’m not sure what pisses me off more, the lack of in game reporting options or that I had to use Forbes to get the email to send in proof of hackers.
Are cheaters a PC only thing?

Im playing since a bit less than 2 weeks on ps4 and i think i've never seen a cheater in one of my games (and i hope I didnt jinx it now)
Let's talk amazing run that OP just did in see saws. Nearly beating a hacker is really impressive
I mean hilarious video, but you need to be a loser at life to cheat at fall guys.
    500+ comments and yours is one of the only ones that comment about the comedy aspect of my video. Thank you.
        People's sense of humor takes time to mature.

Like a fine wine.
I love PC gaming but im so glad I picked this up on console instead.
i've seen posts from the devs on this sub before, do they visit here often? do they ever comment on hackers?

Im on PS4 so it doesn't affect me but this would piss me off if i had paid for thgame
Cries in ps4
Imagine cheating at a game made for 6 year olds.  Jesus Christ.
>No need for reporting!

Devs using a placebo.

It’s just not fun looking for a match and then having to leave at the start of round 1 or 2 after spotting a cheater.

Probably won’t bother trying to finish the season pass, why bother in a broken game.
Ngl the guy who was playing was sick at see saw
I love the way you refer them as script kiddies or cheaters. Bored of people calling them “hackers”.
Never understood why people cheat at online games, you're not winning, you're just an asshole
That should be an easy ban right if someone finishes the climb in 10 seconds they're cheating.
If you’re really cheating on fall guys you legit suck
almost won for the first time, the last guy got knocked off the platform.... then flew back up and knocked me off
Dont worry guys. The system will automatically detect and ban the cheaters after each game. /s
Why do people cheat? How do they have fun? Why do they have to ruin the game for everyone else? Why isnt fall guys on xbox?
F for pc players
Bring back player names for PC. Script kiddies wouldn’t like it when you can follow up on them, their profiles, etc.
I’m on console so I don’t get this problem luckily
What kind of loser cheats at a game like this?
They need to actually put unique ID’s into the game. Not some 4 digit crap. Their values go from #0001-#9999. So a thousand other players will have your same “unique” identifier. They need to implement like AAA#0001 then AAA#0002 and so forth, thus allowing more specific and unique identity tags
Your really good
Are we gonna ignore this guy’s flawless run on see saw tho?
Cheaters don’t even care about having fun, they just have a domineering complex. If they can abuse others and qualify at any cost it makes them happy. Fall Guys just ban their IP.
Bruh, why do people cheat in this game, it doesn’t make it anymore fun
In a good engine, fly hacks shouldn't work. Never trust the client
I just genuinely don't understand the point of people doing shit like this. Like its a game, its meant to be enjoyed, how is there any enjoyment in getting a crown if you didnt have to put in any effort at all. Also all for what, so they can get some more cosmetics? It really boggles my mind
yaaa needless to say ps4 version of the game is light years superior to the pc counter part
I only played 3 games today and each of them had at least 2 cheaters most of them wore skins only unlocked on a high level and the rest wore the chell outfit. The cheat detection in this game is nonexistent
This is never a problem for any game if you play on console
As if cheating in a game isn't already sad, in fall guys..? really? In what way is flying to the end in any way satisfying, I haven't played enough to know but I assume there are rewards for winning X amount of games or whatever? If not it makes even less sense to me
This is how this game dies.
The anti-cheat doesn't exist. They are lying about hackers getting banned. The devs are so novice they can't even do input sanitization for usernames. You think they can code anti-cheat?
    https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1302680927605338113

They are working on it. I have faith in them, they created this wonderful game and I'm sure they wish to have this cheater business behind them soon.
There's 3 solutions to this because the devs aren't fixing this and are instead lying to the player's faces by saying they're getting banned when they clearly aren't. Seriously over a month and they haven't even fixed the steam name problem.

1: Is to stop playing and list why on socials. A massive drop in players and community engagement.

2: Bombard their socials. Anytime they post something, ratio them with messages asking when are the hackers going to get fixed. Make it large enough to get media presence.

3: And I cannot stress this enough, I do not support this. Abuse the system, if they are not adequately punishing cheating, make the problem so bad that they have to.
    All of your solutions won't help a thing.

They know about the problem and they want to fix it. Bothering and bullying them will not help.

I didn't post this to protest that they aren't working on it. The "pls fix" is basically a meme. I post this because it's a subreddit about the game and this is, for me, the current state of the game.

Just hang tight and hope they find a solution quickly, don't think they aren't more invested in fixing this than you are yourself. These guys love their game and play it themselves, they must not all have a PS4 lol.
        > Bothering and bullying them will not help.

Hard disagree, companies respond to two things, damage to their wallet and bad pr, because it leads to damage to their wallet.
Coming to a game near you.
If they were smart they would just eliminate everyone
I’m done playing until this is addressed. It’s getting more frequent, not less.
The only time I could every think hackers could ever be not an asshole is if they hack tail tag or of the server
Is there a way to report cheaters? I couldn't find any ingame.
I don't understand why people would want to cheat in a simple, jovial game like this.
I got 12 wins in this game and I lost 13 finals bc of hacks and I'm not exaggerating I count them
I stopped playing due to this, I have literally experienced situations where 7 out of 10 games I played had a cheater, its seriously unbearable
I had the same game yesterday with my friend. Two cheaters with chell costumes pushing others off the map.
I don't know how bad your life has to be to cheat in game for kids.
This is exactly why I’m hardly playing the game now. I don’t get a lot of time to play to begin with but when I do, I have a cheater in almost every lobby now.
need a report button ASAP
If it’s as common as you guys makes it seem I’m so glad I play on console. I probably would stop playing fall guys if I had to deal with that many cheaters
Please implement a report button... It’s a shame
They need to fix the names and add a report option
How terrible must your life be to decide to cheat on a children’s platform game. Yare yare
Did they change the Anti-cheat or detection system? I remember it used to work fine but now im seeing a ton of clips of hackers. What is even the point in hacking in this game?
Wait you can't talk about it!!! This will make more cheaters!!!! stop talking about cheating you're hurting our game sales!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was in this game
Would love a report button on the game
Imagine seeing a funny game where little beans race each other through obstacle courses to earn a crown, and thinking to yourself, “You know how this would be even better? If I ruined the game for literally everyone else and took all the fun out of it.”
I was having a good day. Then I watching this clip. Now I am annoyed with the world. It's not even that *hard* of a game! It's sad to see people cheat like this. **Pathetic**.
This is why I stopped playing. Level 37 in the season and I wanted so badly to get to 40 but it is almost impossible to get gold metals or crowns when every game has a speed demon in it
Today I saw a Jacket top and my friend pedro bottom flying so this guys has been hacking since the first week and he still hasn't been banned...
I just lvled up to lv 40 and never opened the game lol. ITs Apex Legends all over again
I'm done with the game.
And now this clip is the first post on this subreddit and you bet your ass that every hacker that sees this will be doing it from now on
When someone gets banned does it prevent that IP address from playing the game ever again? Cause they should!
"chEaTErs ArE rEmoVeD fROm tHe GaMe ThE ROuNd tHEY'rE DisCoverEd. ThERe'S nO nEEd tO REpOrT."

"doN'T tALK aBouT haCkINg, it'LL jUsT eNCoURaGe otHErs tO DO iT."
Fucking master race and all there cheating
Woo-wooo!
I just don't understand. Is this fun for them? What joy does cheating like this bring?
You reported them...r-right?
    Mediatonic themselves have said that you shouldn't waste your time with reporting. No one is looking at the reports. They claim they can detect the cheating without the reports.
This is honestly such a joke. The fact that the developers are so naive as to not even include a report player button and encourage people not to report others is ridiculous. They have let the issue get out of hand and now this is happening. Do they want their game run into the ground by hackers? I simply don’t understand.
As a developer (not game developer though) I have to say that sometimes it's not that easy to fix something like this. Probably they didn't expect to have this much attention and they would be fixing small things over the time.

Don't be too harsh on them, I'm sure they have a lot of preasure from their boss and extra preasure from the community won't do anything better for them. 

Just be patient, I'm sure they're working hard to fix this.
They could just have a report button if enough people report. Bye bye
Absolutely bonkers! I didn't know that hackers were this out of hand!
How is this even fun? I guess you could say that about hackers in any game, but in Fall Guys, really? When the cheating is so blatant there can’t even be a semblance of fun in playing. They’re very clearly not being banned and sharing things about them is being discouraged. This game is extremely fun but if the anti-cheat isn’t stepped up I don’t see myself playing for long.
This is awful, if not a reporting mechanic at least give us vote kick
Cheating is sad in itself right...but how the fuck does cheating at FALL GUYS MAKE YOU FEEL ANY GOOD??
Some highschool acquaintances used cheat like this - theres a point where one must wonder why anyone like that plays games...
1) why tf is there no report button in game, u shouldn't have to send an email with all of ur account info for them to "look into it" and then do nothing.

2) instead of just saying they cheaters only hack once (which is obviously false) and deleting our reports and SCREEN RECORDED EVIDENCE in discord, listen to us and make a less toxic community. 

3) have anyone who completes a stage under a certain amount of time kicked out of matches and investigated, there are so many ways to stop cheaters, it baffles me how unhelpful mediatonic are towards reports and how seemingly supportive they are to hackers.
Fuck these kinds of people. Grinds my gears.
Devs got their money and clearly don't care.
I get that they're a small team, but can't the publisher send some aid to help them make a cheat engine considering the game has made hundreds of thousands of dollars? This issue is singlehandedly going to kill fall guys if it's not addressed soon.
is this on pc or console?
    PC
Lol rip
I'm not a huge programmer or anything, but shouldn't steam be able to verify if the code of the game has been altered before allowing a player to connect to the servers? I've seen other games, like payday 2, (which I think is actually the same devs? Maybe I'm wrong) where you'll actually get an indicator when someone is using a modded version of the game, and the option to only play with people not using mods. I think there are also some steam games where using mods automatically disables achievement progression too. So I guess my question is, why are the devs having so much trouble implementing something like that?
    I'm pretty sure the hacks are "man in the middle" hacks.

They aren't a modded version of the game. They intercept (or they don't even intercept) the outgoing network data from your game to the servers, and adjust what is happening.

The game is telling the server "I am on this location" x times per second. The hack just adjusts that message so they are telling the server that they are in the air.

The devs probably aren't having much trouble, it's probably normal that it's taking a bit. These things have to be good enough to not ban legitimate players.
u/FallGuysJoe
At least one hacker in every second game now
Played Fall Guys for one night, saw some shit like this happen, uninstalled the game.
Is there a list of known cheats somewhere?
They are having fun?
[deleted]
/u/vredditdownloader
I don’t get the losers that cheat in games like these? What’s the point?? There’s no challenge anymore, at this point they’re just doing it for other people to suffer which disgusts me, how are there actual people out there that steep THIS low.
How could you cheat in a game so cute?
I saw this 2 weeks ago except it was one guy that held one of the see saws down and eliminated the whole server but himself. Game ended after the first round I was shocked.
The cheaters in this game make it unplayable.

And the easiest couple lines of code could detect them, as they do things no legit player can do such as movement speed and height for length of time...

So frustrating.
Fall Guys cheat detection isn’t great. They need to add a report function and turn names back on.
I've only had this happen to me once.  Really sucked but oh well. For the most part, out of the hundreds and hundreds of games, I've seen that anti-cheat work really well and it not work well. It does (most of the time) kick the cheaters out after the first few rounds, if it catches them. It doesn't always work but the system definitely needs some refinement.
I will never understand the concept of cheating in a game that is not an Esport and their is nothing to gain. The whole "cheaters are kicked after round" is complete and utter bullsh\*t. This game is to be fun and derpy. Theses cheaters ruin the fun in games for everyone and is going to kill the game and the community. So RIP fall guys because the cheater pool is getting larger every day.
Honestly if you cheat in this game not only are you a fucking loser but it does not bode well for your future in life. Like.... you think with a mindset like this you’re going to be successful at 30? No lol. Get it together.
I played for long and hard and I didn’t even get close enough to get 1 crown, and here are these bozos cheating and with chell. Ugh.
Cheater problem aside: i didn't know there was timing on see-saw or any other obstacle course
I will truly never understand how this is fun for people, they aren’t even playing the game at this point.
Sat in a Jinxed game for about 10 mins because both teams had cheaters flying in the air. Love Fall Guys but the scripters need to go. It has been happening like once every 4 or 5 games.
Will  stop playing because the developers are not stopping the cheaters.
i once saw a hacker fail at block party by going too fast and falling in the slime he deserved it
Volcano Colour Masterrace!
Source: 50+ Win Player

I see 1 (obvious) hacker per hour and generally exit as soon as I notice. Sometimes, I will stick around self-grief my team game if the hacker is on my team. I have also seen hackers just grief without trying to win (i.e. I won even with hacker in the game). 

The 2 things that stand out to me are:

1) Developers should just own up to the fact that there is a problem. I see why they don't fess up though, since backlash would be bad (even though backlash is already bad).

2) I wonder what my win rate would be with 0 hackers. I do not think 5 wins in a row (Steam Achievement) is possible with the current amount of hackers present. Would love to hear from someone with that achievement.
I don’t understand the appeal of cheating. So you just godmoded to the to of the mountain before anyone else was half done. What’s the point?
Ya know, I have issues with the PS4’s performance with Fall Guys, but cheaters are practically ruining the game on PC, so I’m ok with it.
What's the deal with early finals?  Does the level have a hidden time limit?
People who cheat at Games are some of the lowest scum of the Earth.  How is this fun for them?
This happened to me and my friend the game was just givving the modes the hackers needed Door dash see saw and royal fumble what a perfect game to them
Well this is better than sitting through 5 games with a cheater
Literally every cheater I’ve come across has been wearing the legendary skin of the day. They’re clearly getting away with this kind of thing over and over.
Just played the game a few mins ago, didn't see anything suspicious the first round but come second round (Slime Climb) as soon as the round starts five players automatically qualify (like WTF!)

Dealing with 1 hacker is already a drag but to deal with 5? Mediatonic Games has to really step up or this game is gonna go the way of PUBG soon.
Are those fuckers the reason why I constantly encounter the seesaws tipped drastically to one side?
They should just invest in BE / EAC. This will get rid of most cheaters.
how did the round end with loads of people yet to qualify?
Yo imagine being a huge loser in life that you resort to cheating in a party game
I leave everytime I see a cheater. There's no point in even trying. It's a fun game but I hate how rampant the cheater problem has gotten
The game is going to die very soon if they dont do something about this.
I was going to buy this game... frick, i already quit warzone because of this...
It's actually cringe.

This is a reason why devs opt to have microtransaction shops in videogames rather than having "win" based ones like Fall Guys.

The word "virgin" always springs to mind when I see someone flying.
“I NEED THEM SKINS BRO”
Why didn't you turn names on so they could be reported?
if you're gonna hack, at least hack on 2b2t
i was in a game with some dumbass cheater today. they instantly teleported to the finish line in first two games, then rollout came. this dumbass was flying a little, but sometimes they just walked on the platforms. i grabbed him as i saw the opportunity and he tried to fly away, but somehow i got yeeted far away, and they fell. i was a little bit sad since i was on a 3win winning streak, but then i was happy someone got to win fairly.
Remember when reddit said seesaw was the best and most skill-based level. Great times.
Ran into this as well today, but they were all pedros
[deleted]
Why would someone cheat on a game that there's no reward other than feeling good about playing it well
This is why I've stopped gaming
I can not imagine how much of a virgin dweeb you need to hack in general. But hacking in a game like fall guys? That's just a whole new level of NEETdom
Game was really really fun for a few days. Then every game became cheater central. You’d play for 15 minutes+ only to have the finals race auto won by a cheater. Waste of $20.
Yeah, many of the cheaters have 10 crown skins, which means their cheats have gone undetected, the whole “cheaters get banned after the round” is bullshit
    
Not to mention the level 40 celebration as well...
    Unless they some how hacked to get them but yeah
        Amusingly enough this was actually possible at release. There was no server-side verification of whether you actually had the currency.
            Bro what era am I living in. This is the kind of shit I was seeing in like fucking 2000-2010 back when people didn't understand the nature of cheaters. I think by fucking now we should all know better.... 

You could almost make the case that it's a free game and you get what you pay for but it's NOT EVEN FREE.
                Even free games have better cheat detection and prevention methods.
                    Warframe to give an example is free and warns you if it detects cheat engine upon opening the launcher. Choosing to ignore said warning and launching the game anyways will give you a nice ban to your account. Don't see why the devs here can't deal with it. Surely they've raked in a fortune from the game's popularity to hire an anti-cheat specialist team?
                        Hell, if you're going to do any kind of multiplayer the least I would expect is that you did something to take care of what is essentially a hex editor that is easy to use like a game genie.
                Well you've gotta think, the devs didn't even think to include some sort of lag abuse prevention. Something like "hit-reg." A system that would prevent things like grabbing a tail from 10 feet away among other huge lag based issues. This is something that has existed since 2010, possibly earlier.
        They aren't. They are just using cheat engine to adjust client side character values which shouldn't exist at all, let alone not on the server side. Its about as script-kiddy as it gets. From the cheat forums, there is anti cheat detection but it genuinely only kicks in if someone caps any of the values. 

If you go 20x faster rather than 200xfaster, you won't get detected and banned. The ban parameters were figured out which is why there are so many repeat offenders every game now. The fact it doesn't snap ban mid-show between games for anything over 1.0 speed, grab, stun, jump, etc is laughable.
            Snap banning for slightly over 1.0 speed would result in tons of false bans. Just provide a little bit of lag and the server could see the client moving over 1.0 speed.
                Getting hit by obstacles would do the same. And I've seen plenty of clips of people getting flung into the air by parts of the doors in Door Dash, so the zero gravity hacks are harder to track as well
                    Obstacles cap physics impulse to a particular terminal velocity
                    All this calculation should be done server side then synced to the client and correct the values there, which were computed there just to reduce lag in visuals. Unfortunately small indie company cannot afford such strong servers.
                At this point it's gotten so annoying I'd rather get kicked from the game with a false positive occasionally than play with cheaters
            They shouldn't let you connect online with cheat engine open. Many games do that so Mediatonic should consider doing that as well.
            Holy shit cheat engine is still a thing? Lol
                Speaks volumes to how laughable the problem is, doesn't it?
    [deleted]
        There's a small reason to not instantly ban them, because then cheaters can use that to figure out exactly what gets detected and work around it. Delaying the ban until the end of the round or game slows down their ability to figure out the exact ban parameters.
I just leave the game as soon as I spot a cheater, I'm not winning anyway. Everyone should do this, let the cheaters have fun playing by themselves.
    I will stay in until a team game to see if i can eliminate them through sabotage or something. Then i leave
        I did this but then I realised 2 things:

Sometimes thier team is stupid and takes the easy quality/some games it’s actually hard to sabotage the hacker.

More importantly any interaction with a hacker is still feeding into them.

If most of the lobby just quits as soon as there is a hacker they won’t have people to cheat against and there will be a better metric for devs to realise players won’t put up with this.

Eventually enough of those people won’t even re-queue every time there is a hacker.
    That's the plan as soon as I'm done grinding to 40. Until then, just gotta smile and take it.
    You're just giving them free wins, which is exactly what they want. They could care less if you drop out.   Your best bet is to coordinate against them if they land in an opposing team color.
        Imo they want to make people miserable, if you ignore them you've taken their fun from them.  Also it's so incredibly hard to win against cheaters even if everyone coordinates that it's not worth trying.
            I don’t believe any cheater in this game cares if you’re ignoring them or not. All they care about is laughing all the way to the crown. Getting the crown means they’ve cheated up to 59 other people out of a crown, regardless of the circumstance or your feelings against them.

This is the same mentality as your parents telling you not to give your bully any attention. I grew up being told that and guess what, it didn’t stop the bullying
yeah they only type that to make people feel better. given how many cheaters i see every day, and it's getting worse, they aren't doing anything..
I quit playing because of it.  I'm not alone.
My partner joined the discord to report a player for cheating and they literally told him "Dont worry about it, we know what we're doing." Insanely infuriating.
This is how online games die.
I think a potential roadblock is running into false positives due to the game being physics based and having a spontaneous nature.
    Yeah of course there will be some challenges but i think at the very least they should flag suspicious players and see if the suspicious activity continues throughout the following rounds . And maybe even record the video of said match automatically so if there was a false positive it could be quickly corrected .
        Continuous red flags should be easy to identify though
            What if we had player moderators, and if multiple reports align then the player gets banned

Edit: it could get abused, but to avoid this the final ban must be approved by a Mediatonic employee or it must be something easily measured, like speed or amount of time off the ground, barring physics glitches.
                Too easy to abuse. Some group of trolls reporting someone who beats them.
                    You can have something like Overwatch in CS:GO where the reported person's demos get randomly distributed to people who give a simple yes/no that the person is cheating. It's even much simpler because it's easy for anyone to know when someone is cheating in Fall Guys
                        Building a system like that is _really_ complex
                            It requires a replay system first and foremost, so you're right. I think the right move at this point is getting some stopgaps that provide basic detection, and then work on a replay + report system to create this.
                            These guys doing some armchair construction: Just build the Burj Khalifa that should take care of your housing problem.
                        I think you’re in to something there. I dunno if something that complex could be implemented but I feel like even a short 3 second clip could show whether someone is hacking or it’s just physics or a false report by a salty player.
                        Hook that up to a machine learning algo too. Eventually you'll get an ai that can do it at a high success rate without needing players to vote yes/no
    Right but a player being yeeted one time very briefly by landing on a Door Dash part is very measurably different than a person who spends the better part of multiple rounds in a row travelling above allowed speeds.
    [deleted]
        If those spinners on fall mountain hit you right, you go flying.
            With a speed-detection thing, they could just make it so hitting a bumper or spinner disables it for a split second and watches the players speed over the next few seconds.  When if you get launched really far, your speed is still constantly dropping as you fly.

Basically, it would ban people who go over the max speed unless they hit a bumper/spinner/hammer, and when they do hit those things, the game would watch their speed to make sure its dropping like it should and people aren't just hitting the spinners before activating the cheat.  This would limit false positives.
        Programming on map specific is a bad idea tho, we don’t know how fall guys will evolve over time but it will have more maps and modes, and it might even have community maps, programming on map specifics can be come a hell in the future, any programming against cheaters now should be future proof, or at least trying to.
        I mean the same could be said about a map like Door Dash but I have a clip of myself being launched into orbit on that map. Something to do with the way I was bumped before landing on one of the slightly bouncy doors.
    I'm sure there's some things they can do like checking if they finished the level faster than is possible.
        It gets a little complex as more and more strats evolve in ways that weren’t accounted for originally. For all we know, there’s some hidden exploit that can somehow launch you from the start to the end in one go.
    Yeah, but let's be honest.  As of this moment, they have millions of points of data about how much time is humanly possible to complete a level.  If anyone exceeds that now by a reasonable threshold, banned for 1 day.  Do it again, banned +1 day for each instance.

As for flying, just make it so if you don't touch any surface for longer than the longest legit drop in the game you fall to your death.  If it happens more than n times in a week, banned.  Same rule as above.  The exception is because of the physics, with things to smack you around being so unpredictable, may as well leave some room for chance.

And this means if someone keeps doing it, they screw themselves more and more.
    Using some statistics, you could probability estimate the probability that a player would have a given probability mass function for velocity.

You wouldn't be able to say for certain if someone was a cheater, but you would be able to estimate the probability that such a player would exist, given how far away they are from an average player. Then you could flag outliers for review.

But that aside, there are probably much easier ways to detect these cheaters (for example they're not touching the ground for extended periods of time), and I think the game developer is just not doing it.
I've actually seen cheaters do something more subtle such as increase their walking speed to like 1.5x.
    But even that should be detectable. If the server is expecting a checksum from the memory data to include a movement speed of 1x, setting it to 1.5x will cause the checksum to fail.
        The server currently only checks for the maximum value allowed for each and every variable 😂
    To an algorithm checking for cheaters, 1.1* natural walking speed (ie with zero collisions) should be as blazingly obvious as 100*.
Seriously, this boggles my mind too. You can easily log y movement relative to the ground (maybe not as easy in see saw but definitely doable for other levels where the ground is static), and then kick players who have values which are unobtainable with normal movement. Block players where it happens x times in a row, as sometimes beans do get yeeted high up in the air due to beans physics
    The far easier way to manage this is that the client should be sending expected checksums of memory values that do not change permanently. While you may be flung and moved faster than you can run (by objects, server desync between you and other clients), your base movement speed is still 1x. If a hack is adjusting memory values of base movement speed, the checksum fails.

You may be flung higher into the air than you can normally jump. Your base maximum jump height, and gravity value bringing you back to the ground do not change. If a player is sending unexpected values in jump height or gravity values the checksum fails.

If a client hack is sophisticated enough to send data that makes the server think the player is being repeatedly lifted by an in-game object (hammer, door dash piece), the server has implicit information available to determine if that object is actually at the same coordiniates as the player. If the object the client is saying is there is not there, the checksum fails and they're moving incorrectly.
        So much this. From what I have read so far, this info is almost all currently handled client side and the server checks only exist at full caps. Cheaters are telling other cheaters the detection limits, and now more people cheat and don't get caught.
        Most of these comments are people taking stabs in the dark and not really understanding the difficulty of catching false positives and the toll on servers that constant logging for every player would do. Cutting this off at the source like this comment is saying would easily do the trick and is the right way to handle this.
    Yeah exactly , you can at least flag people with suspicious values and investigate further
I have made severals posts about utilising this technique and you usually get hand-wringing spaff of a human moaning about false positives, like the devs would really just do "If speed >= 500 then 'ban' else 'nothing'"  

It's honestly batshit insane that A) this game has such a problem with cheating and B) the complete and utter lack of imagination and understanding, yet the complete determination to discredit any attempt to stop cheating.
    Most of those who discredit attempts to stop cheating are people who do it or have done it themselves.
    This is how all these BR games are getting now. Especially on mobile! Pubg and cod mobile (maybe fortnite) both are overrun with people who are so obviously cheating that they could easily implement a flagging system. However the devs really do think somehow there are elite mobile players who manage to kill 37 people out of 100  on average over like 100 matches. Its lazy and unreal
    Nope, calculating speed would require too much computation power and could cause sever over loaded. To improve performance, we decided to not implement any server side validation at all /s
They could even offload this detection from the server to the players as I'd expect it to be somewhat CPU heavy. When non cheating clients detect unusual movements for extended periods from cheater clients they make a report to the server and if enough of these reports come in the cheater gets booted.

    Looking in from the outside, and with very limited gamedev experience, I also can't see how the name thing hasn't been fixed. From what I remember, the problem was that you could use html formatting or something? But like... Just display it as plaintext with default formatting... Cap how tall/wide the text box is so you don't get weird stuff with unicode diacritics either.

Of course, it's easy to say "just do X" when you don't know how the game is built up.
        [deleted]
            I believe that was the original reason. But then they realized there is an E style family rating thing they want to go for. 

Which means steam allows 'any names', so they want to censor names more than steam does. So sometimes people use inappropriate names they want to block. I think that is the hold up now. Trying to devise a censorship style system. Perhaps build their own name system separate from steam?



Especially if they want cross plat play with playstation 1 day.
                AFAIK this was the reason I thought they were disabled too.
                Don't all rated games with multiplayer have a disclaimer along the lines of "online game not rated"
                    I don't mean in any official organizational rating, but I think they want to be children family friendly.
                It's a pretty shit excuse at this point because the game is suffering from a massive cheating problem.  They're trying to fix something that MIGHT be an issue in the future over something that is a rampant festering wound right now.
        Yeah the names are messed up... Why don't they just rename everything that isn't standard alphabet character Fall Guys #### or just omit those characters... Or even a million times easier - let everyone name themselves inside the actual game... If they want to do crossplay it would be beneficial anyway to have a Fall Guys account so you can share your progress between devices. I love this game and I know shit about programming but I swear I never felt like this in any other game. It genuinely feels like they can't code... Hotfix for the names shouldn't take longer than a week under absolutely no circumstances.
Another option might be to record the player’s controls and play back where they *should* be on the server side, with a certain margin of error. If they are way off, then flag them as a potential cheater. You’d probably have to resynchronize every few seconds to account for network lag as well.
    I’m sure there are innumerable ways to detect this shit. It’s 2020 and MMO games are not a new thing.
Makes me think of this great fantasy book series, Foundryside.

Basically in the world they have these sigils instead of technology. Sigils with commands, that experts could write logic into to do things like make a carriage think it's going downhill so it rolls forward without the need of horses.

The protagonist can "talk" to the sigils, and essentially debates their programming. So when the programmer takes shortcuts, she can exploit them. These orbs were told to float simply "a foot" from an object. She redefined how long a foot was to make them all shoot in super close.

The game is simple enough that I can't imagine it'd harm performance to code in some hard detection systems. Maybe even AI that learns from cheaters' behaviors vs normal behavior, and then recognizes and bans cheaters.
Xenoverse 2 has the bigger problem
It’s a game made by a pretty small studio and it exploded in popularity in a way that was unexpected. They just weren’t ready to deal with the problems that come with such a big playerbase so now they’re going to have to play catch-up for a while. 

I’ve been in a ton of meetings when smaller companies discuss allocating resources to prevent problems that come with success at a scale beyond what seems like a reasonable prediction and they always get called ‘nice problems to have’ and then the can gets kicked down the road. I’ve never met a nice problem that wasn’t just a bloody ball-ache when it actually came to pass.
    Pretty much this. Whenever there's scalability issues people are always like "well why didn't they plan on selling this many copies" or something that implies as such. But demand forecasting is a very difficult thing and overestimating demand is usually a far more costly mistake than underestimating it. If you make 10,000 copies of a product and get a 100,000 people wanting to buy them then that's an issue as you have 40,000 disgruntled potential customers who you can't sell to right now. But it's manageable because you can try and increase supply and hope the demand is still there when you get the supply. If you make 50,000 copies of a product however and only sell 10,000 you're now sat on 40,000 units worth of inventory that you've paid to have produced and you have to pay to warehouse, and all of it is just bleeding money.

In this case yeah they could have sunk a bunch of time and assets into making a more robust multiplayer game better adapted to handling the issues that come with such a large playerbase. But if the game didn't take off like it did they'd have spent a bunch of time and money for nothing. And yeah people are frustrated right now, but they'll have time to correct the problems before those frustrations grow too great.
Someone hire this man
Imagine wanting to cheat in a game about sentient buttplugs.
    Alright go put jellybeans in your ass and don’t come crying that you need surgery to get them out
        Way ahead of you.
            Pics or it didn't happen
                * *X-rays* or it didn't happen
        Where we're from, we call them grizznuggets
        They're jellybeans.  Just let them dissolve.
        Dude, they dissolve surprisingly quickly. Like, not overnight, but if you don't poop them out there won't be a trace within a week...
            But they don’t dissolve ingame what this guy is saying to use as a buttplug
    Sentient 6 foot butt plugs\*
        They- they aren’t 6 foot

I refuse to believe that
    I see this argument brought up a lot, but I don't quite get it. 

Is there some type of game where it isn't pathetic and lame to cheat ? I don't see why the goofy aesthetic of Fall Guys is always cited as some big reason not to cheat.

I'm sorry but cheating in any game is fucking sad. Doesn't matter whether it's about sentient buttplugs, non-sentient buttplugs, or anything else.
Read that in Attenborough’s voice lol
*clap.....clap, clap clap clap clap*
And taunting the other players. They're having fun screwing other people out of their free time. So they're kids, because they don't understand the actual value of free time.
    I encountered a couple of cheaters and won in separate finals (both Royal Fumble).

The first never touched a tail. He was just having fun tripping people (he was also tripping people in earlier levels).

The second, who can fly, stole the tail with us, but he jumped up and down near the ground, and chose to stay in the ground taunting us. We non-cheaters stole the tail a couple of times, and he stole the tail back easily. In the last 15 seconds I got the tail, and managed to keep it. He focused his efforts in those last few seconds tripping and grabbing the other guy, I guess because I was also using a Pedro skin like him?

A lot of these cheaters probably don't care to win anymore. They probably laugh at those who grief their own team because of them. They just treat the game like a GTA SA with their cheats playing god and doing whatever they want with us non-cheaters, treating us as NPCs.
        Lets not refer to them as "playing god", makes them actually sound cool. Lets refer to what they're doing correctly: Being pathetic
            And honestly i feel like people who cheat on FALL GUYS A GAME THAT IS A CHILDISH GAME, IS MORE OF A LOSER THAT THEY WANNA CHEAT, Like honestly if you cheat on Fall Guys how much of a no life are you?
                I think this kind of salty comments encourages them even more
                    I don't think there's anything that actually discourages them in the first place tbh. They lack the empathy to give a shit and like seeing people complain in any way. There is no real penalty to them as it stands.
                        If you cheat on a game like fall guys you are really a kid with nothing better to do and I mean really nothing better to do, nothing will discourage this type of behavior, it is already the bottom of the pit
    no i can totally see grown men doing this out of sadistical pleasure
Until I see or read evidence of people getting banned, I'm assuming nobody has been banned since day one.
    Yeah, reading ban wave threads where people get mass banned in other games and go to complain to the creators of the scripts they used is one of my biggest joys in life. Where are those threads for fall guys?
Didn't they also say that the Fall Mountain crown won't let you grab it if you reach it too quickly? So much for that, the guy in this video got it in a matter of seconds.
    My wife played a game last night where the cheater won instantly.   He actually appeared to still be on the starting line when the round ended.
        That happened to me the first time I got into the finals... It sucks that people have to take the fun out of it for everyone else
Feel bad for you guys. In ps4 I have seen 0 hackers.

                It's free with the thing that you pay for.
                This is always a dumb statement. It's not free if you pay any amount of money to have access to it. Ps+ and game pass are great deals, but stop calling them games free.
                    Exactly, having to pay just for the privilege to access multiplayer gaming is absurd.

                        Yeah its really irritating how many cheaters and no lifes there are, when they're cheaters who do no harm to anyone, then its fine, can care less but if it's cheaters ruining the fun then thats a big bother.
                        Yeah, when PC hackers ruined Dragon Ball Xenoverse for me, I had regretted not playing on the PS4. Now, whenever I can choose, I play on the PS4 to avoid hackers.

                        Most of the people on pcmasterrace are hilariously uninformed. And btw you cant hack on a console.
                        My friends and I do the same, but also make self deprecating jokes as our main form of gaming together is on PS4. While a small portion of me is enjoying the dumpster fire that is Fall Guys on PC, the rest really wants them to fix it. Cross play with no hackers would do magic for the game and community.
                So is r/consolemasterrace but it's satire lol
                    Tbf PC master race started as satire and has now been adopted literally.
                        Recently they've come back around to accepting consoles for what they are. I haven't read the word "peasant" in quite a while, actually.
                            Maybe everyone realised it was all meaningless
                                There are still a ton of people that take pcmr literally. 

Sad, lonely, pathetic people, but they're still people.
        it is completely dependent on the game. ps4 hacks take far longer to develop but the console is by no means unhackable
        You actually can, provided your PS4 has firmware version 6.72 or lower installed - downgrading is impossible. You still can't hack on XB1, however.
            But it means you can't play online.
                Not necessarily - IIRC there were public methods for bypassing it back in 5.05, although 6.72 may or may not currently be stuck offline - I haven't followed the homebrew scene in a while.
                    Even if you can the barrier for entry is way higher. On pc all you have to do is google Fall Guy Hack and pay some dude $10 a month to easily cheat.
        I swear with every game I enjoy on PS4 I look on its subreddit and find out that it is absolutely miserable on PC because of hackers.
    Yep, I'm at level 37 and have never seen a single cheater on PS4. Really sorry to PC bros, that sucks.
    The hacking problem is the reason I haven’t bought it for pc yet
    It's a PC only issue.
Damage control. Devs know it's a problem but they're more focused on meme'ing on socials and hosting Twitch Rivals tourneys.
    [deleted]
    The social media and the tournaments are all run by people who have nothing to do with making the game.
        [deleted]
            Oh definitely.
        It still doesn't look good for them if cheaters are in these big tournaments.
    It was infuriating seeing the season 2 preview and zero mention anti-cheat solutions. What’s the point of adding onto something that’s broken!?
I mean they could just be hacking in skins too.
    Skins are hopefully, probably serverside. If they changed them, then they are actual hackers and not just script kiddies.
I'm guessing they're taking advantage of the fact that they can't be easily detected. Stockpiling on crowns so they can stop cheating at a certain time but buy every new cool skin that gets released.

Either that or stockpiling the accounts so they can sell them later.

Or they're kids and they're bored. Some kids really aren't that developed yet and I can hardly blame them for not understanding how they're screwing over so many people out of their free time.
    > not understanding how they're screwing over so many people out of their free time.

Oh they understand, that's why they think is fun to do it
        Kids are sadistic little gremlins
            Seriously. Who keeps making these things?
    I don't know why you think these people have to be kids or are doing it for money. Seriously. So many adults would do this just to piss people off and waste their time. They don't care. Why would they?
        If there are adults doing that I really don't consider them as adults, they are in that category where you just think ew
The Electric Light Orchestra could compliment this game quite well, I agree.
    damn i wish i had known about your username when i taught diff eq for a semester. would've told my students to pm you instead of email me for their homework.
Loads of hackers don't hack to win, they see other people as toys to play with an manipulate. They feel elated when they get someone to rage. They have control complexes and get no joy from a fair game because they cannot stand the feeling of failure.
Skins and some people like the feeling of wasting 59 other people's time. It gives them a feeling of power and control.
To get crowns and skins
Thanks, I'm one of those sweaty try hards.
    A try hard is way more respectable than these documented low-life’s.
I always leave, but this time I was in my third game on a win streak. I've won against a cheater before (them flying against the pillar in showdown and ragdolling to their death).

No streak = instant leave.
    I'm actually glad you posted it because I was curious what happened after everyone is eliminated.
    You can leave a game without losing the streak.  It's only if you've been offixially "eliminated" that the streak gets busted
        Good to know
    Aye that sucks... That achievement is so hard as it is and cheaters being dickheads doesn't help one bit. Just consider it a pointless achievement on PC because of so many hackers getting it without any effort, be happy with the rest of your progress!
    You can quit and still keep the streak for the achievement alive.

It only ends if you get the "eliminated" screen and  your rewards for that show.
    > but this time I was in my third game on a win streak

Did the patch out the "exploit" for that achievement?  Last I heard it only breaks your streak if you are eliminated and receive the eliminated screen.  But I haven't seen anyone talk about it one way or another recently.
        I have never heard of an exploit for that.
            Apparently if you close the app before you’re eliminated it won’t count it as a loss.
                Lowkey glad that’s in the game cause the trophy is near impossible otherwise
[deleted]
It's why I kind of like the cheaters who make it blatantly obvious in the early rounds, means I can just dip out and not waste my time in a doomed game. The ones who really piss me off are the ballbags who don't cheat until the final round, and then just start flying the moment it starts. 

The ones who cheat from round one are still scummy fuckwits who ruin the game for people, but at least they aren't forcing me to waste my own time by continuing a game thinking there's no hackers when there actually are.
    Agree with that, also recently had a 3rd kind of cheater, they didn't cheat until a team game in the 4th round. No idea what they were thinking but of course they lost lol
Glad ps4 doesn't have to deal with shit like this. Just M&KB for fps games but that's it.
[removed]
    Actually yeah
Yes!
    Best colour ever! ^(If you like black & orange)
        Unfortunately it’s more of a muted brown. I wish they used the same near pitch-black as they do with the black/white.

Edit: Same with the black face, which is actually a shitty grey that only matches the grey on stealthy.
            I think that's only bc the orange metallic is kinda combined with the black. You notice it best when you're changing your look, and wear the pattern with no pattern and apply any  colour. (Works best with metallic colours)

The second colour often "shines through" the main colour
It does appear to be
Always wondered why the PC version used "Fall Guy ####" as opposed to the players actual username. Thought it was still in beta or something on steam etc.
    Because it's supposed to be a fun, family friendly game which doesn't work when there's usernames with N bombs in them on steam.
        Just... turn off usernames then?
            I'm just explaining their reasoning.
        I’ve seen loads of shitty names on PS4 so idk what your talking abou
            Sony has some guidelines for the naming of your account, right? Steam doesn't, which makes it easier to exploit
As a Unity developer myself, I happen to know that 99% of Unity devs are absolute garbage. My old company tried for 4 years to hire another one (to help me), before giving up and pivoting the entire company away from using Unity LOL

Sidenote, there's literally a single checkbox for Text objects to stop the HTML injection. It might not look as crisp but a lot of this would have been avoided
    Game producer here. Fuckin agreed. Ended up just getting a programmer and asking them to learn Unity which was a step down for them and they basically saved my fucking game.
    Every time I see a game made in Unity I know to wait six months before I even bother looking at it for purchase. Unity attracts so many novices.
    I've been trying to learn Unity but this comment makes me feel like it's not worth it :/
        There's an insane amount of companies hiring Unity Devs, it's just that a lot of non- Software Engineers learn Unity as a hobby and you get a shit ton of unqualified candidates. 
 
Meanwhile learning Unreal Engine or making your own engine requires a lot more skill, so it's easier to find competent professionals with that knowledge.
            >a lot of non- Software Engineers learn Unity as a hobby and you get a shit ton of unqualified candidates. 

This is the reason
lets not forget the pink pineapple skins that have been an issue from day 1
wow the devs really are incompetent
Small indie company /s
The devs also no longer accept hacker reports because “iF yOU seE A hACkEr, it WIlL bE ThEIR LaST timE”
Jesus the devs need to hire someone who actually knows how to do shit
> I never once saw this used for anything malicious yet the developers went nuclear and decided that, RATHER THAN FIXING the html injection, to just force every single player's in-game name to "Fall Guy ####". 

I did! IIRC you could make giant letters out of that, and at one point I turned on usernames and there was a giant “C U M” on the screen. Gave me a fright cuz my younger cousins were watching me, but fortunately they missed it.
Fall Guys programmers go brrrrr.
The taunting is icing on the cake.
Must admit, it's a fun sound.
The developer of the hack is the hacker.

The users are the script kiddies.
    Its not a hack. They use cheat engine. The tool for cheating in single player games.
        What a fucking joke that cheat engine works on a game like this.
>the so called "anti cheat" (if there is one)

There is not.
They really need to fix this asap or people will just massively drop from the game
    They definitely don’t know how to fix it or it would’ve been fixed by now rather than them giving their constant excuses, but hopefully they can figure it out
*fall guys hacks falls to 0
I love the idea or if someone cheats you can report them to get flagged and sent to a game with the "god".
I’ve stopped playing. The last time I played I had a cheater in *every* game (I wish I was exaggerating in this one). This isn’t fun anymore
    Change your review to negative. Others are.  

https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097150/Fall_Guys_Ultimate_Knockout/
    Yeah, last three finales there's been a cheater in every single one. I'm not playing without better detection
        Same for me, changing my review to negative.
    A couple of days ago I had 9 cheaters in 10 games. Weirdly enough, I won 2 of them. Some dumbass was taunting me during Jump Showdown and accidentally dropped too low when going up and down next to me above the slime.

That was my worst streak of cheaters, though. Haven't seen that many again
This. Sadly, this is the only thing we can do. I tried posting videos here and Twitter, trying to figure out how to help. But there is honestly nothing we can do. It is simply frustrating.
No that’s exactly why nobody pays attention to steam ratings.
    If you see mixed reviews and everyone is calling out the cheater problem, would you buy the game? Steam reviews are great for users.
    What are you talking about? I've decided against buying games several times after the reviews warned that the game was broken, buggy, full of hackers, abandoned, etc... Plus if the devs did something bad enough to lead to a review bomb, that's valuable information.

So, at least be one person pays attention to ratings.
Why exactly do you think they're not doing anything? They're a small indie team and implementing a third-party anti-cheat is a monumental task.
Every round has a hidden timer. When the game is still going when the timer goes off, everyone that didn't finish will be eliminated. If no one qualified, a random player will get the crown.

The players that do qualify, go on like usual.

The cheaters know about this, so they can have their friend qualify, and then stop the rest from going through. They know everyone will be eliminated and the game will go to the final round because not enough people qualified for more races / game modes.

This way they can have a final every 7-ish minutes.
    I see, thanks for informing
There is invisible time countdown in every racing stage.
Can't refund the game as I have more than 15 hours into the game now :( at first I didn't mind, I was just having fun, not hoping to win. But now whenever I think that I have a chance to win for the first time, a hacker is always there!
    Yeah I was actually convinced they were doing something about the problem back at the beginning.
    If they're is enough outcry, they'll make an exception.
        Valve let users do that with NMS, I think they will do the same for this game as well if enough users complain.
            If this shit keeps going on and the devs show no sign of fixing it, Valve will definitely give them the middle finger
>I don't get why pc players aren't mass refunding the game yet?

It's incredibly difficult (though possible) to refund a game on Steam once you've used it for over 2 hours. Most of us passed that time simply waiting for the servers to work in the early days, and so the game became non-refundable without even playing it.
    I had no idea the return period was so short.
        I think it's more of a "will this game run and play alright" kind of timeframe. Wether you like/enjoy the game after several hours isn't enough grounds for a refund, and some games can be completed in a few hours.
    That was when I got my refund. I couldn't play a game for two days due to the servers booting me out every time. Now my decision has been vindicated with the rampant cheating.
I’m not refunding because I haven’t encountered many cheaters and the game is a lot of fun
    I haven’t seen any yet either. I believe it is because the game has SBMM and I don’t have a win yet though. Most of the cheaters probably appear in the higher skill lobbies.
        that might explain it, if i play for 1-2 hours i'll see at least 3 cheaters

they're also more common when i play with friends instead of alone
I came here trying to figure this out, Cheaters are only on PC correct?
    Correct
        Fortunate for console players but fuck these idiots ruining things for the PC crowd.  I didnt even know the extent they were able to manipulate the game, I thought it was just soaring to the finish line.
            You can make yourself immune to grab, alter how for you can push someone, make it so players who touch you get stunned, etc. Full suite of cheat engine at your disposal. Its a joke.
I havent because I dont run into cheaters that often. Maybe one every 20 games
Anecdotal, but I don't see hackers too often and when I do, it tends to be the first round. So I just back out and find another match. Minimal time wasted. There's still the chance of winning the cheater lottery and being in another lobby with another cheater.

Staying in the game when you see a hacker is almost always just wasting your time. Yes, sometimes you can beat them in a team game, but it's not worth it. They don't care if you stop them once. They care that they rustled your jimmies.
    What we see are the obvious noob hackers. Imagine how many cheaters there are that use slight speed boosts or that are already quite good and only turn on the hacks when they start to lose in the final. 

There must be cheaters in almost every game.
        I think the micro speed increase is a contributor to why my fall mountain win rate is so much worse than all the others. Sometimes other beans just seem slighly faster
            yeap,had some flawless runs where i barely even had to dodge anyting (sometimes didnt even have to dodge anyting at all)only to see a bean reaching the crown by the time im at the 2nd hammer
I don't have a PS4. My PC was my only option for playing the game.
> I don't get why pc players aren't mass refunding the game yet?

Wouldn't refund the game even if I could.  I've only seen a handful of cheaters and I've received more than 50 hours of some of the most fun I've had in a LONG time.  That's worth my money and the devs sure aren't going to fix this shit if everyone could and does refund.

This game was made by a small indie team.  Even with all the money they've made (which is probably held up with the publisher), it's not like you can just immediately fix problems like this.  Software development takes time, even if you're implementing existing anti-cheat solutions into your game.

I'm not even going to argue that they're going about it the right way, because the probably aren't, but remember this game has only been out about a month.
Eh, personally I don't think meeting cheaters every now and then is so horrible to be a reason to quit the game.
    It depends on how often you're meeting them. At first I was seeing them every 5th game, eh, no biggie.

Now I'm meeting them 2 games out of 3. My time is worth more than that.
wait it was free on ps4?? dang
    It was one of the "free" games you get for having the paid PS+ service that allows you to play online. You get to play the game as long as you have PS+.
        To me, online only games are great for ps plus, you have to pay to be online so might as well get the games that are only playable online as part of the package
“Hey fellow kids! Check out this fucking hammer we’re calling Big Yeetus even though we barely have a grasp on the product we shipped to begin with!” - Devs, probably
    I promise you that the dude that runs the twitter account is not a dev, and takes absolutely no dev time away from the game.

That’s a completely separate PR position with completely separate responsibilities and prerequisites.
I knew it was only a matter of time before their cutesy communication and replying to all criticism with a joke was going to wear thin on people.
Cosmetics.

Costumes, colors, patterns.
Yes, they are working it as we speak.

https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1302680927605338113
They did a good job of tricking people into thinking it was made by a AAA developer. It looks like it was made by Nintendo and the music is great too. Underneath, however, it is full of flaws. Laughable anti-cheat (obviously), horrible desync, and glitches everywhere (ever seen a group of players bouncing off of each other constantly?)
>Change my mind.

Like in most companies, the developers don't make the decisions.

There were probably a lot of developers that knew this would happen and warned the higher ups. They then told them how they could prevent it from happening, which would mean a lot of server side verification, which would mean that they probably had to cut down on the max number of players per round (no 60 players starting matches) or they had to pay more money for their server infrastructure.

When money bags hear "that would cost more" they say "but do we need it?".

I'd never actually blame the actual developers.
    Mediatonic is an individual uk studio and it's not like devolver digital is stopping them and they clearly seem to be working on season 2 so why not throw in an anti-cheat while you're at it?
        They're probably doing that. They're just taking their time. 

They should implement a temporary hotfix-like solution in the mean time though.
            Agreed
0 cheaters on ps4 because it is impossible to cheat there
Small kids who doesnt understand the fun of minigames, literally just qualifying as soon as a minigame starts doesnt give any gameplay and is the same as having someone play for you.
I haven't heard a single person say there are cheaters on PS4.
    I saw what looked like a floater yesterday, but he wasn’t sky high so I was wondering. Besides that i hadn’t heard anything either. It’s all on pc every time I see crap like this.
Not totally defending Mediatonic here, because I don't like the way they've responded to the hacking issue and have seemingly lied about what's being done, but I can see why they might have trouble with a game like this due to its physics-based nature. Especially since they are an indie developer.

Most multiplayer games handle a lot of stuff server-side, which is why cheating is not exactly straightforward/possible in them.  But I would have to imagine that handling the physics calculations for all 60 players exclusively server-side instead of client-side would be way too much, and would probably introduce janky behavior in courses like Whirlygig when latency is involved. Since movement and physics behavior is handled client-side, that opens things up to manipulation on the user end. Any time you rely on the client sending accurate, game-relevant information, you're likely going to have a problem with cheaters. It's why speed and item hacks are a constant problem in every online Mario Kart game, because the item calculations and speed values can be manipulated on the client side, and the server basically just has to "take their word for it". You'd combat this by having some sort of server-side verification - for example, handling item randomization on the server side - but again, for a game like Fall Guys where the physics engine causes players to constantly fly around, I could see why this wouldn't entirely be straightforward.

Graphics, audience demographics, and number of downloads have very little to do with the complexity of implementing anti-cheat.
I play on pc and apparently I’m just very lucky because I’ve only seen a few cheaters
    Me too. Almost 50 hours I've seen maybe 3 cheaters.
        I’ve played 32 hours and I think I’ve seen 2 cheaters, one of which immediately jumped off at the beginning of the final round. It’s possible that this subreddit posts hackers so much that people think that hackers are much more common than they are, but then again we could just be lucky
            Some of the cheating may go unnoticed and you also have people who only use cheats in the final round.

I didn't have too many cheaters the past few weeks, but now I am currently playing and am at game 8. 6 of those games had cheaters.

Edit: Just played game number 9, I saw three people flying within a few seconds.
                That’s true, there are probably a lot that I haven’t noticed
    Same. Maybe 1 in every 20 games. No clue why so many people are encountering cheaters
We dont need a dickhead saying "glad im not playing on pc" on every thread about cheaters. You dont help and it makes it feel pretty shitty when it is not our fault but the cheaters and the developers for not implementing it a better anti cheat.
Exposing and talking about a shared frustration helps some people to better cope with it.

When people say "What’s even the point?", they understand that some cheaters just enjoy griefing other peoples fun. But they fail to empathize with these players, that's what that sentence actually means.

"What's even the point?" => "I can't empathize with the fact that you'd enjoy ruining other peoples fun." Because they can't empathize, they assume there must be a different reason for them to cheat, but they don't know what that is.
    Damn that was a great way of putting it
        Thanks.

In hindsight of my original post, I hope I didn't kindle the fire in too many players eyes. It was originally meant to insult cheaters as little kids and not to infuriate people towards them or the developers of the game. At this point it seems to have turned into a huge circle jerk and I almost feel bad for seeing so many people turned off by it.
            It’s a complicated issue because you get into this chicken-and-egg situation where hackers cause high-profile posts about them which in turn inspire more hackers after seeing the reaction. To me, this means the only way to meaningfully address this is for someone outside of that cycle, AKA Devolver, to get their shit together and implement an effective anti-cheating system. I question how well this game was coded if people were able to develop hacks within a week of release.
It’s basic physics... how are you not good at it
500+ comments and yours is one of the only ones that comment about the comedy aspect of my video. Thank you.
    People's sense of humor takes time to mature.

They are working on it. I have faith in them, they created this wonderful game and I'm sure they wish to have this cheater business behind them soon.
All of your solutions won't help a thing.

They know about the problem and they want to fix it. Bothering and bullying them will not help.

I didn't post this to protest that they aren't working on it. The "pls fix" is basically a meme. I post this because it's a subreddit about the game and this is, for me, the current state of the game.

Just hang tight and hope they find a solution quickly, don't think they aren't more invested in fixing this than you are yourself. These guys love their game and play it themselves, they must not all have a PS4 lol.
    > Bothering and bullying them will not help.

Hard disagree, companies respond to two things, damage to their wallet and bad pr, because it leads to damage to their wallet.
Mediatonic themselves have said that you shouldn't waste your time with reporting. No one is looking at the reports. They claim they can detect the cheating without the reports.
PC
I'm pretty sure the hacks are "man in the middle" hacks.

They aren't a modded version of the game. They intercept (or they don't even intercept) the outgoing network data from your game to the servers, and adjust what is happening.

The game is telling the server "I am on this location" x times per second. The hack just adjusts that message so they are telling the server that they are in the air.

The devs probably aren't having much trouble, it's probably normal that it's taking a bit. These things have to be good enough to not ban legitimate players.

Not to mention the level 40 celebration as well...
Unless they some how hacked to get them but yeah
    Amusingly enough this was actually possible at release. There was no server-side verification of whether you actually had the currency.
        Bro what era am I living in. This is the kind of shit I was seeing in like fucking 2000-2010 back when people didn't understand the nature of cheaters. I think by fucking now we should all know better.... 

You could almost make the case that it's a free game and you get what you pay for but it's NOT EVEN FREE.
            Even free games have better cheat detection and prevention methods.
                Warframe to give an example is free and warns you if it detects cheat engine upon opening the launcher. Choosing to ignore said warning and launching the game anyways will give you a nice ban to your account. Don't see why the devs here can't deal with it. Surely they've raked in a fortune from the game's popularity to hire an anti-cheat specialist team?
                    Hell, if you're going to do any kind of multiplayer the least I would expect is that you did something to take care of what is essentially a hex editor that is easy to use like a game genie.
            Well you've gotta think, the devs didn't even think to include some sort of lag abuse prevention. Something like "hit-reg." A system that would prevent things like grabbing a tail from 10 feet away among other huge lag based issues. This is something that has existed since 2010, possibly earlier.
    They aren't. They are just using cheat engine to adjust client side character values which shouldn't exist at all, let alone not on the server side. Its about as script-kiddy as it gets. From the cheat forums, there is anti cheat detection but it genuinely only kicks in if someone caps any of the values. 

If you go 20x faster rather than 200xfaster, you won't get detected and banned. The ban parameters were figured out which is why there are so many repeat offenders every game now. The fact it doesn't snap ban mid-show between games for anything over 1.0 speed, grab, stun, jump, etc is laughable.
        Snap banning for slightly over 1.0 speed would result in tons of false bans. Just provide a little bit of lag and the server could see the client moving over 1.0 speed.
            Getting hit by obstacles would do the same. And I've seen plenty of clips of people getting flung into the air by parts of the doors in Door Dash, so the zero gravity hacks are harder to track as well
                Obstacles cap physics impulse to a particular terminal velocity
                All this calculation should be done server side then synced to the client and correct the values there, which were computed there just to reduce lag in visuals. Unfortunately small indie company cannot afford such strong servers.
            At this point it's gotten so annoying I'd rather get kicked from the game with a false positive occasionally than play with cheaters
        They shouldn't let you connect online with cheat engine open. Many games do that so Mediatonic should consider doing that as well.
        Holy shit cheat engine is still a thing? Lol
            Speaks volumes to how laughable the problem is, doesn't it?
[deleted]
    There's a small reason to not instantly ban them, because then cheaters can use that to figure out exactly what gets detected and work around it. Delaying the ban until the end of the round or game slows down their ability to figure out the exact ban parameters.
I will stay in until a team game to see if i can eliminate them through sabotage or something. Then i leave
    I did this but then I realised 2 things:

Sometimes thier team is stupid and takes the easy quality/some games it’s actually hard to sabotage the hacker.

More importantly any interaction with a hacker is still feeding into them.

If most of the lobby just quits as soon as there is a hacker they won’t have people to cheat against and there will be a better metric for devs to realise players won’t put up with this.

Eventually enough of those people won’t even re-queue every time there is a hacker.
That's the plan as soon as I'm done grinding to 40. Until then, just gotta smile and take it.
You're just giving them free wins, which is exactly what they want. They could care less if you drop out.   Your best bet is to coordinate against them if they land in an opposing team color.
    Imo they want to make people miserable, if you ignore them you've taken their fun from them.  Also it's so incredibly hard to win against cheaters even if everyone coordinates that it's not worth trying.
        I don’t believe any cheater in this game cares if you’re ignoring them or not. All they care about is laughing all the way to the crown. Getting the crown means they’ve cheated up to 59 other people out of a crown, regardless of the circumstance or your feelings against them.

This is the same mentality as your parents telling you not to give your bully any attention. I grew up being told that and guess what, it didn’t stop the bullying
Yeah of course there will be some challenges but i think at the very least they should flag suspicious players and see if the suspicious activity continues throughout the following rounds . And maybe even record the video of said match automatically so if there was a false positive it could be quickly corrected .
    Continuous red flags should be easy to identify though
        What if we had player moderators, and if multiple reports align then the player gets banned

Edit: it could get abused, but to avoid this the final ban must be approved by a Mediatonic employee or it must be something easily measured, like speed or amount of time off the ground, barring physics glitches.
            Too easy to abuse. Some group of trolls reporting someone who beats them.
                You can have something like Overwatch in CS:GO where the reported person's demos get randomly distributed to people who give a simple yes/no that the person is cheating. It's even much simpler because it's easy for anyone to know when someone is cheating in Fall Guys
                    Building a system like that is _really_ complex
                        It requires a replay system first and foremost, so you're right. I think the right move at this point is getting some stopgaps that provide basic detection, and then work on a replay + report system to create this.
                        These guys doing some armchair construction: Just build the Burj Khalifa that should take care of your housing problem.
                    I think you’re in to something there. I dunno if something that complex could be implemented but I feel like even a short 3 second clip could show whether someone is hacking or it’s just physics or a false report by a salty player.
                    Hook that up to a machine learning algo too. Eventually you'll get an ai that can do it at a high success rate without needing players to vote yes/no
Right but a player being yeeted one time very briefly by landing on a Door Dash part is very measurably different than a person who spends the better part of multiple rounds in a row travelling above allowed speeds.
[deleted]
    If those spinners on fall mountain hit you right, you go flying.
        With a speed-detection thing, they could just make it so hitting a bumper or spinner disables it for a split second and watches the players speed over the next few seconds.  When if you get launched really far, your speed is still constantly dropping as you fly.

Basically, it would ban people who go over the max speed unless they hit a bumper/spinner/hammer, and when they do hit those things, the game would watch their speed to make sure its dropping like it should and people aren't just hitting the spinners before activating the cheat.  This would limit false positives.
    Programming on map specific is a bad idea tho, we don’t know how fall guys will evolve over time but it will have more maps and modes, and it might even have community maps, programming on map specifics can be come a hell in the future, any programming against cheaters now should be future proof, or at least trying to.
    I mean the same could be said about a map like Door Dash but I have a clip of myself being launched into orbit on that map. Something to do with the way I was bumped before landing on one of the slightly bouncy doors.
I'm sure there's some things they can do like checking if they finished the level faster than is possible.
    It gets a little complex as more and more strats evolve in ways that weren’t accounted for originally. For all we know, there’s some hidden exploit that can somehow launch you from the start to the end in one go.
Yeah, but let's be honest.  As of this moment, they have millions of points of data about how much time is humanly possible to complete a level.  If anyone exceeds that now by a reasonable threshold, banned for 1 day.  Do it again, banned +1 day for each instance.

As for flying, just make it so if you don't touch any surface for longer than the longest legit drop in the game you fall to your death.  If it happens more than n times in a week, banned.  Same rule as above.  The exception is because of the physics, with things to smack you around being so unpredictable, may as well leave some room for chance.

And this means if someone keeps doing it, they screw themselves more and more.
Using some statistics, you could probability estimate the probability that a player would have a given probability mass function for velocity.

You wouldn't be able to say for certain if someone was a cheater, but you would be able to estimate the probability that such a player would exist, given how far away they are from an average player. Then you could flag outliers for review.

But that aside, there are probably much easier ways to detect these cheaters (for example they're not touching the ground for extended periods of time), and I think the game developer is just not doing it.
But even that should be detectable. If the server is expecting a checksum from the memory data to include a movement speed of 1x, setting it to 1.5x will cause the checksum to fail.
    The server currently only checks for the maximum value allowed for each and every variable 😂
To an algorithm checking for cheaters, 1.1* natural walking speed (ie with zero collisions) should be as blazingly obvious as 100*.
The far easier way to manage this is that the client should be sending expected checksums of memory values that do not change permanently. While you may be flung and moved faster than you can run (by objects, server desync between you and other clients), your base movement speed is still 1x. If a hack is adjusting memory values of base movement speed, the checksum fails.

You may be flung higher into the air than you can normally jump. Your base maximum jump height, and gravity value bringing you back to the ground do not change. If a player is sending unexpected values in jump height or gravity values the checksum fails.

If a client hack is sophisticated enough to send data that makes the server think the player is being repeatedly lifted by an in-game object (hammer, door dash piece), the server has implicit information available to determine if that object is actually at the same coordiniates as the player. If the object the client is saying is there is not there, the checksum fails and they're moving incorrectly.
    So much this. From what I have read so far, this info is almost all currently handled client side and the server checks only exist at full caps. Cheaters are telling other cheaters the detection limits, and now more people cheat and don't get caught.
    Most of these comments are people taking stabs in the dark and not really understanding the difficulty of catching false positives and the toll on servers that constant logging for every player would do. Cutting this off at the source like this comment is saying would easily do the trick and is the right way to handle this.
Yeah exactly , you can at least flag people with suspicious values and investigate further
Most of those who discredit attempts to stop cheating are people who do it or have done it themselves.
This is how all these BR games are getting now. Especially on mobile! Pubg and cod mobile (maybe fortnite) both are overrun with people who are so obviously cheating that they could easily implement a flagging system. However the devs really do think somehow there are elite mobile players who manage to kill 37 people out of 100  on average over like 100 matches. Its lazy and unreal
Nope, calculating speed would require too much computation power and could cause sever over loaded. To improve performance, we decided to not implement any server side validation at all /s
Looking in from the outside, and with very limited gamedev experience, I also can't see how the name thing hasn't been fixed. From what I remember, the problem was that you could use html formatting or something? But like... Just display it as plaintext with default formatting... Cap how tall/wide the text box is so you don't get weird stuff with unicode diacritics either.

Of course, it's easy to say "just do X" when you don't know how the game is built up.
    [deleted]
        I believe that was the original reason. But then they realized there is an E style family rating thing they want to go for. 

Which means steam allows 'any names', so they want to censor names more than steam does. So sometimes people use inappropriate names they want to block. I think that is the hold up now. Trying to devise a censorship style system. Perhaps build their own name system separate from steam?



Especially if they want cross plat play with playstation 1 day.
            AFAIK this was the reason I thought they were disabled too.
            Don't all rated games with multiplayer have a disclaimer along the lines of "online game not rated"
                I don't mean in any official organizational rating, but I think they want to be children family friendly.
            It's a pretty shit excuse at this point because the game is suffering from a massive cheating problem.  They're trying to fix something that MIGHT be an issue in the future over something that is a rampant festering wound right now.
    Yeah the names are messed up... Why don't they just rename everything that isn't standard alphabet character Fall Guys #### or just omit those characters... Or even a million times easier - let everyone name themselves inside the actual game... If they want to do crossplay it would be beneficial anyway to have a Fall Guys account so you can share your progress between devices. I love this game and I know shit about programming but I swear I never felt like this in any other game. It genuinely feels like they can't code... Hotfix for the names shouldn't take longer than a week under absolutely no circumstances.
I’m sure there are innumerable ways to detect this shit. It’s 2020 and MMO games are not a new thing.
Pretty much this. Whenever there's scalability issues people are always like "well why didn't they plan on selling this many copies" or something that implies as such. But demand forecasting is a very difficult thing and overestimating demand is usually a far more costly mistake than underestimating it. If you make 10,000 copies of a product and get a 100,000 people wanting to buy them then that's an issue as you have 40,000 disgruntled potential customers who you can't sell to right now. But it's manageable because you can try and increase supply and hope the demand is still there when you get the supply. If you make 50,000 copies of a product however and only sell 10,000 you're now sat on 40,000 units worth of inventory that you've paid to have produced and you have to pay to warehouse, and all of it is just bleeding money.

In this case yeah they could have sunk a bunch of time and assets into making a more robust multiplayer game better adapted to handling the issues that come with such a large playerbase. But if the game didn't take off like it did they'd have spent a bunch of time and money for nothing. And yeah people are frustrated right now, but they'll have time to correct the problems before those frustrations grow too great.
Alright go put jellybeans in your ass and don’t come crying that you need surgery to get them out

    They're jellybeans.  Just let them dissolve.
    Dude, they dissolve surprisingly quickly. Like, not overnight, but if you don't poop them out there won't be a trace within a week...
        But they don’t dissolve ingame what this guy is saying to use as a buttplug
Sentient 6 foot butt plugs\*
    They- they aren’t 6 foot

I refuse to believe that
I see this argument brought up a lot, but I don't quite get it. 

Is there some type of game where it isn't pathetic and lame to cheat ? I don't see why the goofy aesthetic of Fall Guys is always cited as some big reason not to cheat.

I'm sorry but cheating in any game is fucking sad. Doesn't matter whether it's about sentient buttplugs, non-sentient buttplugs, or anything else.
I encountered a couple of cheaters and won in separate finals (both Royal Fumble).

The first never touched a tail. He was just having fun tripping people (he was also tripping people in earlier levels).

The second, who can fly, stole the tail with us, but he jumped up and down near the ground, and chose to stay in the ground taunting us. We non-cheaters stole the tail a couple of times, and he stole the tail back easily. In the last 15 seconds I got the tail, and managed to keep it. He focused his efforts in those last few seconds tripping and grabbing the other guy, I guess because I was also using a Pedro skin like him?

A lot of these cheaters probably don't care to win anymore. They probably laugh at those who grief their own team because of them. They just treat the game like a GTA SA with their cheats playing god and doing whatever they want with us non-cheaters, treating us as NPCs.
    Lets not refer to them as "playing god", makes them actually sound cool. Lets refer to what they're doing correctly: Being pathetic
        And honestly i feel like people who cheat on FALL GUYS A GAME THAT IS A CHILDISH GAME, IS MORE OF A LOSER THAT THEY WANNA CHEAT, Like honestly if you cheat on Fall Guys how much of a no life are you?
            I think this kind of salty comments encourages them even more
                I don't think there's anything that actually discourages them in the first place tbh. They lack the empathy to give a shit and like seeing people complain in any way. There is no real penalty to them as it stands.
                    If you cheat on a game like fall guys you are really a kid with nothing better to do and I mean really nothing better to do, nothing will discourage this type of behavior, it is already the bottom of the pit
no i can totally see grown men doing this out of sadistical pleasure
Yeah, reading ban wave threads where people get mass banned in other games and go to complain to the creators of the scripts they used is one of my biggest joys in life. Where are those threads for fall guys?
My wife played a game last night where the cheater won instantly.   He actually appeared to still be on the starting line when the round ended.
    That happened to me the first time I got into the finals... It sucks that people have to take the fun out of it for everyone else
ye cant hack in ps4
    This is why I am happy that I play the ps4 version of the game.

            this game made me sign up for ps plus for the first time since i don't normally play online
            It's free with the thing that you pay for.
            This is always a dumb statement. It's not free if you pay any amount of money to have access to it. Ps+ and game pass are great deals, but stop calling them games free.
                Exactly, having to pay just for the privilege to access multiplayer gaming is absurd.

                    Yeah its really irritating how many cheaters and no lifes there are, when they're cheaters who do no harm to anyone, then its fine, can care less but if it's cheaters ruining the fun then thats a big bother.
                    Yeah, when PC hackers ruined Dragon Ball Xenoverse for me, I had regretted not playing on the PS4. Now, whenever I can choose, I play on the PS4 to avoid hackers.

                    Most of the people on pcmasterrace are hilariously uninformed. And btw you cant hack on a console.
                    My friends and I do the same, but also make self deprecating jokes as our main form of gaming together is on PS4. While a small portion of me is enjoying the dumpster fire that is Fall Guys on PC, the rest really wants them to fix it. Cross play with no hackers would do magic for the game and community.
            So is r/consolemasterrace but it's satire lol
                Tbf PC master race started as satire and has now been adopted literally.
                    Recently they've come back around to accepting consoles for what they are. I haven't read the word "peasant" in quite a while, actually.
                        Maybe everyone realised it was all meaningless
                            There are still a ton of people that take pcmr literally. 

Sad, lonely, pathetic people, but they're still people.
    it is completely dependent on the game. ps4 hacks take far longer to develop but the console is by no means unhackable
    You actually can, provided your PS4 has firmware version 6.72 or lower installed - downgrading is impossible. You still can't hack on XB1, however.
        But it means you can't play online.
            Not necessarily - IIRC there were public methods for bypassing it back in 5.05, although 6.72 may or may not currently be stuck offline - I haven't followed the homebrew scene in a while.
                Even if you can the barrier for entry is way higher. On pc all you have to do is google Fall Guy Hack and pay some dude $10 a month to easily cheat.
    I swear with every game I enjoy on PS4 I look on its subreddit and find out that it is absolutely miserable on PC because of hackers.
Yep, I'm at level 37 and have never seen a single cheater on PS4. Really sorry to PC bros, that sucks.
The hacking problem is the reason I haven’t bought it for pc yet
It's a PC only issue.
[deleted]
The social media and the tournaments are all run by people who have nothing to do with making the game.
    [deleted]
        Oh definitely.
    It still doesn't look good for them if cheaters are in these big tournaments.
It was infuriating seeing the season 2 preview and zero mention anti-cheat solutions. What’s the point of adding onto something that’s broken!?
Skins are hopefully, probably serverside. If they changed them, then they are actual hackers and not just script kiddies.
> not understanding how they're screwing over so many people out of their free time.

Oh they understand, that's why they think is fun to do it
    Kids are sadistic little gremlins
        Seriously. Who keeps making these things?
I don't know why you think these people have to be kids or are doing it for money. Seriously. So many adults would do this just to piss people off and waste their time. They don't care. Why would they?
    If there are adults doing that I really don't consider them as adults, they are in that category where you just think ew
damn i wish i had known about your username when i taught diff eq for a semester. would've told my students to pm you instead of email me for their homework.
A try hard is way more respectable than these documented low-life’s.
I'm actually glad you posted it because I was curious what happened after everyone is eliminated.
You can leave a game without losing the streak.  It's only if you've been offixially "eliminated" that the streak gets busted
    Good to know
Aye that sucks... That achievement is so hard as it is and cheaters being dickheads doesn't help one bit. Just consider it a pointless achievement on PC because of so many hackers getting it without any effort, be happy with the rest of your progress!
You can quit and still keep the streak for the achievement alive.

It only ends if you get the "eliminated" screen and  your rewards for that show.
> but this time I was in my third game on a win streak

Did the patch out the "exploit" for that achievement?  Last I heard it only breaks your streak if you are eliminated and receive the eliminated screen.  But I haven't seen anyone talk about it one way or another recently.
    I have never heard of an exploit for that.
        Apparently if you close the app before you’re eliminated it won’t count it as a loss.
            Lowkey glad that’s in the game cause the trophy is near impossible otherwise
Agree with that, also recently had a 3rd kind of cheater, they didn't cheat until a team game in the 4th round. No idea what they were thinking but of course they lost lol
Actually yeah
Best colour ever! ^(If you like black & orange)
    Unfortunately it’s more of a muted brown. I wish they used the same near pitch-black as they do with the black/white.

Edit: Same with the black face, which is actually a shitty grey that only matches the grey on stealthy.
        I think that's only bc the orange metallic is kinda combined with the black. You notice it best when you're changing your look, and wear the pattern with no pattern and apply any  colour. (Works best with metallic colours)

The second colour often "shines through" the main colour
Because it's supposed to be a fun, family friendly game which doesn't work when there's usernames with N bombs in them on steam.
    Just... turn off usernames then?
        I'm just explaining their reasoning.
    I’ve seen loads of shitty names on PS4 so idk what your talking abou
        Sony has some guidelines for the naming of your account, right? Steam doesn't, which makes it easier to exploit
Game producer here. Fuckin agreed. Ended up just getting a programmer and asking them to learn Unity which was a step down for them and they basically saved my fucking game.
Every time I see a game made in Unity I know to wait six months before I even bother looking at it for purchase. Unity attracts so many novices.
I've been trying to learn Unity but this comment makes me feel like it's not worth it :/
    There's an insane amount of companies hiring Unity Devs, it's just that a lot of non- Software Engineers learn Unity as a hobby and you get a shit ton of unqualified candidates. 
 
Meanwhile learning Unreal Engine or making your own engine requires a lot more skill, so it's easier to find competent professionals with that knowledge.
        >a lot of non- Software Engineers learn Unity as a hobby and you get a shit ton of unqualified candidates. 

This is the reason
Its not a hack. They use cheat engine. The tool for cheating in single player games.
    What a fucking joke that cheat engine works on a game like this.
They definitely don’t know how to fix it or it would’ve been fixed by now rather than them giving their constant excuses, but hopefully they can figure it out
Change your review to negative. Others are.  

https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097150/Fall_Guys_Ultimate_Knockout/
Yeah, last three finales there's been a cheater in every single one. I'm not playing without better detection
    Same for me, changing my review to negative.
A couple of days ago I had 9 cheaters in 10 games. Weirdly enough, I won 2 of them. Some dumbass was taunting me during Jump Showdown and accidentally dropped too low when going up and down next to me above the slime.

That was my worst streak of cheaters, though. Haven't seen that many again
If you see mixed reviews and everyone is calling out the cheater problem, would you buy the game? Steam reviews are great for users.
What are you talking about? I've decided against buying games several times after the reviews warned that the game was broken, buggy, full of hackers, abandoned, etc... Plus if the devs did something bad enough to lead to a review bomb, that's valuable information.

So, at least be one person pays attention to ratings.
I see, thanks for informing
Yeah I was actually convinced they were doing something about the problem back at the beginning.
If they're is enough outcry, they'll make an exception.
    Valve let users do that with NMS, I think they will do the same for this game as well if enough users complain.
        If this shit keeps going on and the devs show no sign of fixing it, Valve will definitely give them the middle finger
I had no idea the return period was so short.
    I think it's more of a "will this game run and play alright" kind of timeframe. Wether you like/enjoy the game after several hours isn't enough grounds for a refund, and some games can be completed in a few hours.
That was when I got my refund. I couldn't play a game for two days due to the servers booting me out every time. Now my decision has been vindicated with the rampant cheating.
I haven’t seen any yet either. I believe it is because the game has SBMM and I don’t have a win yet though. Most of the cheaters probably appear in the higher skill lobbies.
    that might explain it, if i play for 1-2 hours i'll see at least 3 cheaters

they're also more common when i play with friends instead of alone
Correct
    Fortunate for console players but fuck these idiots ruining things for the PC crowd.  I didnt even know the extent they were able to manipulate the game, I thought it was just soaring to the finish line.
        You can make yourself immune to grab, alter how for you can push someone, make it so players who touch you get stunned, etc. Full suite of cheat engine at your disposal. Its a joke.
What we see are the obvious noob hackers. Imagine how many cheaters there are that use slight speed boosts or that are already quite good and only turn on the hacks when they start to lose in the final. 

There must be cheaters in almost every game.
    I think the micro speed increase is a contributor to why my fall mountain win rate is so much worse than all the others. Sometimes other beans just seem slighly faster
        yeap,had some flawless runs where i barely even had to dodge anyting (sometimes didnt even have to dodge anyting at all)only to see a bean reaching the crown by the time im at the 2nd hammer
It depends on how often you're meeting them. At first I was seeing them every 5th game, eh, no biggie.

Now I'm meeting them 2 games out of 3. My time is worth more than that.
It was one of the "free" games you get for having the paid PS+ service that allows you to play online. You get to play the game as long as you have PS+.
    To me, online only games are great for ps plus, you have to pay to be online so might as well get the games that are only playable online as part of the package
I promise you that the dude that runs the twitter account is not a dev, and takes absolutely no dev time away from the game.

That’s a completely separate PR position with completely separate responsibilities and prerequisites.
Mediatonic is an individual uk studio and it's not like devolver digital is stopping them and they clearly seem to be working on season 2 so why not throw in an anti-cheat while you're at it?
    They're probably doing that. They're just taking their time. 

They should implement a temporary hotfix-like solution in the mean time though.
        Agreed
I saw what looked like a floater yesterday, but he wasn’t sky high so I was wondering. Besides that i hadn’t heard anything either. It’s all on pc every time I see crap like this.
Me too. Almost 50 hours I've seen maybe 3 cheaters.
    I’ve played 32 hours and I think I’ve seen 2 cheaters, one of which immediately jumped off at the beginning of the final round. It’s possible that this subreddit posts hackers so much that people think that hackers are much more common than they are, but then again we could just be lucky
        Some of the cheating may go unnoticed and you also have people who only use cheats in the final round.

I didn't have too many cheaters the past few weeks, but now I am currently playing and am at game 8. 6 of those games had cheaters.

Edit: Just played game number 9, I saw three people flying within a few seconds.
            That’s true, there are probably a lot that I haven’t noticed
Same. Maybe 1 in every 20 games. No clue why so many people are encountering cheaters
Damn that was a great way of putting it
    Thanks.

In hindsight of my original post, I hope I didn't kindle the fire in too many players eyes. It was originally meant to insult cheaters as little kids and not to infuriate people towards them or the developers of the game. At this point it seems to have turned into a huge circle jerk and I almost feel bad for seeing so many people turned off by it.
        It’s a complicated issue because you get into this chicken-and-egg situation where hackers cause high-profile posts about them which in turn inspire more hackers after seeing the reaction. To me, this means the only way to meaningfully address this is for someone outside of that cycle, AKA Devolver, to get their shit together and implement an effective anti-cheating system. I question how well this game was coded if people were able to develop hacks within a week of release.
People's sense of humor takes time to mature.

Like a fine wine.
> Bothering and bullying them will not help.

Hard disagree, companies respond to two things, damage to their wallet and bad pr, because it leads to damage to their wallet.
Amusingly enough this was actually possible at release. There was no server-side verification of whether you actually had the currency.
    Bro what era am I living in. This is the kind of shit I was seeing in like fucking 2000-2010 back when people didn't understand the nature of cheaters. I think by fucking now we should all know better.... 

You could almost make the case that it's a free game and you get what you pay for but it's NOT EVEN FREE.
        Even free games have better cheat detection and prevention methods.
            Warframe to give an example is free and warns you if it detects cheat engine upon opening the launcher. Choosing to ignore said warning and launching the game anyways will give you a nice ban to your account. Don't see why the devs here can't deal with it. Surely they've raked in a fortune from the game's popularity to hire an anti-cheat specialist team?
                Hell, if you're going to do any kind of multiplayer the least I would expect is that you did something to take care of what is essentially a hex editor that is easy to use like a game genie.
        Well you've gotta think, the devs didn't even think to include some sort of lag abuse prevention. Something like "hit-reg." A system that would prevent things like grabbing a tail from 10 feet away among other huge lag based issues. This is something that has existed since 2010, possibly earlier.
They aren't. They are just using cheat engine to adjust client side character values which shouldn't exist at all, let alone not on the server side. Its about as script-kiddy as it gets. From the cheat forums, there is anti cheat detection but it genuinely only kicks in if someone caps any of the values. 

If you go 20x faster rather than 200xfaster, you won't get detected and banned. The ban parameters were figured out which is why there are so many repeat offenders every game now. The fact it doesn't snap ban mid-show between games for anything over 1.0 speed, grab, stun, jump, etc is laughable.
    Snap banning for slightly over 1.0 speed would result in tons of false bans. Just provide a little bit of lag and the server could see the client moving over 1.0 speed.
        Getting hit by obstacles would do the same. And I've seen plenty of clips of people getting flung into the air by parts of the doors in Door Dash, so the zero gravity hacks are harder to track as well
            Obstacles cap physics impulse to a particular terminal velocity
            All this calculation should be done server side then synced to the client and correct the values there, which were computed there just to reduce lag in visuals. Unfortunately small indie company cannot afford such strong servers.
        At this point it's gotten so annoying I'd rather get kicked from the game with a false positive occasionally than play with cheaters
    They shouldn't let you connect online with cheat engine open. Many games do that so Mediatonic should consider doing that as well.
    Holy shit cheat engine is still a thing? Lol
        Speaks volumes to how laughable the problem is, doesn't it?
There's a small reason to not instantly ban them, because then cheaters can use that to figure out exactly what gets detected and work around it. Delaying the ban until the end of the round or game slows down their ability to figure out the exact ban parameters.
I did this but then I realised 2 things:

Sometimes thier team is stupid and takes the easy quality/some games it’s actually hard to sabotage the hacker.

More importantly any interaction with a hacker is still feeding into them.

If most of the lobby just quits as soon as there is a hacker they won’t have people to cheat against and there will be a better metric for devs to realise players won’t put up with this.

Eventually enough of those people won’t even re-queue every time there is a hacker.
Imo they want to make people miserable, if you ignore them you've taken their fun from them.  Also it's so incredibly hard to win against cheaters even if everyone coordinates that it's not worth trying.
    I don’t believe any cheater in this game cares if you’re ignoring them or not. All they care about is laughing all the way to the crown. Getting the crown means they’ve cheated up to 59 other people out of a crown, regardless of the circumstance or your feelings against them.

This is the same mentality as your parents telling you not to give your bully any attention. I grew up being told that and guess what, it didn’t stop the bullying
Continuous red flags should be easy to identify though
    What if we had player moderators, and if multiple reports align then the player gets banned

Edit: it could get abused, but to avoid this the final ban must be approved by a Mediatonic employee or it must be something easily measured, like speed or amount of time off the ground, barring physics glitches.
        Too easy to abuse. Some group of trolls reporting someone who beats them.
            You can have something like Overwatch in CS:GO where the reported person's demos get randomly distributed to people who give a simple yes/no that the person is cheating. It's even much simpler because it's easy for anyone to know when someone is cheating in Fall Guys
                Building a system like that is _really_ complex
                    It requires a replay system first and foremost, so you're right. I think the right move at this point is getting some stopgaps that provide basic detection, and then work on a replay + report system to create this.
                    These guys doing some armchair construction: Just build the Burj Khalifa that should take care of your housing problem.
                I think you’re in to something there. I dunno if something that complex could be implemented but I feel like even a short 3 second clip could show whether someone is hacking or it’s just physics or a false report by a salty player.
                Hook that up to a machine learning algo too. Eventually you'll get an ai that can do it at a high success rate without needing players to vote yes/no
If those spinners on fall mountain hit you right, you go flying.
    With a speed-detection thing, they could just make it so hitting a bumper or spinner disables it for a split second and watches the players speed over the next few seconds.  When if you get launched really far, your speed is still constantly dropping as you fly.

Basically, it would ban people who go over the max speed unless they hit a bumper/spinner/hammer, and when they do hit those things, the game would watch their speed to make sure its dropping like it should and people aren't just hitting the spinners before activating the cheat.  This would limit false positives.
Programming on map specific is a bad idea tho, we don’t know how fall guys will evolve over time but it will have more maps and modes, and it might even have community maps, programming on map specifics can be come a hell in the future, any programming against cheaters now should be future proof, or at least trying to.
I mean the same could be said about a map like Door Dash but I have a clip of myself being launched into orbit on that map. Something to do with the way I was bumped before landing on one of the slightly bouncy doors.
It gets a little complex as more and more strats evolve in ways that weren’t accounted for originally. For all we know, there’s some hidden exploit that can somehow launch you from the start to the end in one go.
The server currently only checks for the maximum value allowed for each and every variable 😂
So much this. From what I have read so far, this info is almost all currently handled client side and the server checks only exist at full caps. Cheaters are telling other cheaters the detection limits, and now more people cheat and don't get caught.
Most of these comments are people taking stabs in the dark and not really understanding the difficulty of catching false positives and the toll on servers that constant logging for every player would do. Cutting this off at the source like this comment is saying would easily do the trick and is the right way to handle this.
[deleted]
    I believe that was the original reason. But then they realized there is an E style family rating thing they want to go for. 

Which means steam allows 'any names', so they want to censor names more than steam does. So sometimes people use inappropriate names they want to block. I think that is the hold up now. Trying to devise a censorship style system. Perhaps build their own name system separate from steam?



Especially if they want cross plat play with playstation 1 day.
        AFAIK this was the reason I thought they were disabled too.
        Don't all rated games with multiplayer have a disclaimer along the lines of "online game not rated"
            I don't mean in any official organizational rating, but I think they want to be children family friendly.
        It's a pretty shit excuse at this point because the game is suffering from a massive cheating problem.  They're trying to fix something that MIGHT be an issue in the future over something that is a rampant festering wound right now.
Yeah the names are messed up... Why don't they just rename everything that isn't standard alphabet character Fall Guys #### or just omit those characters... Or even a million times easier - let everyone name themselves inside the actual game... If they want to do crossplay it would be beneficial anyway to have a Fall Guys account so you can share your progress between devices. I love this game and I know shit about programming but I swear I never felt like this in any other game. It genuinely feels like they can't code... Hotfix for the names shouldn't take longer than a week under absolutely no circumstances.
Way ahead of you.
    Pics or it didn't happen

Dude, they dissolve surprisingly quickly. Like, not overnight, but if you don't poop them out there won't be a trace within a week...
    But they don’t dissolve ingame what this guy is saying to use as a buttplug
They- they aren’t 6 foot

I refuse to believe that
Lets not refer to them as "playing god", makes them actually sound cool. Lets refer to what they're doing correctly: Being pathetic
    And honestly i feel like people who cheat on FALL GUYS A GAME THAT IS A CHILDISH GAME, IS MORE OF A LOSER THAT THEY WANNA CHEAT, Like honestly if you cheat on Fall Guys how much of a no life are you?
        I think this kind of salty comments encourages them even more
            I don't think there's anything that actually discourages them in the first place tbh. They lack the empathy to give a shit and like seeing people complain in any way. There is no real penalty to them as it stands.
                If you cheat on a game like fall guys you are really a kid with nothing better to do and I mean really nothing better to do, nothing will discourage this type of behavior, it is already the bottom of the pit
That happened to me the first time I got into the finals... It sucks that people have to take the fun out of it for everyone else
This is why I am happy that I play the ps4 version of the game.

    If this shit keeps going on and the devs show no sign of fixing it, Valve will definitely give them the middle finger
I think it's more of a "will this game run and play alright" kind of timeframe. Wether you like/enjoy the game after several hours isn't enough grounds for a refund, and some games can be completed in a few hours.
that might explain it, if i play for 1-2 hours i'll see at least 3 cheaters

they're also more common when i play with friends instead of alone
Fortunate for console players but fuck these idiots ruining things for the PC crowd.  I didnt even know the extent they were able to manipulate the game, I thought it was just soaring to the finish line.
    You can make yourself immune to grab, alter how for you can push someone, make it so players who touch you get stunned, etc. Full suite of cheat engine at your disposal. Its a joke.
I think the micro speed increase is a contributor to why my fall mountain win rate is so much worse than all the others. Sometimes other beans just seem slighly faster
    yeap,had some flawless runs where i barely even had to dodge anyting (sometimes didnt even have to dodge anyting at all)only to see a bean reaching the crown by the time im at the 2nd hammer
To me, online only games are great for ps plus, you have to pay to be online so might as well get the games that are only playable online as part of the package
They're probably doing that. They're just taking their time. 

They should implement a temporary hotfix-like solution in the mean time though.
    Agreed
I’ve played 32 hours and I think I’ve seen 2 cheaters, one of which immediately jumped off at the beginning of the final round. It’s possible that this subreddit posts hackers so much that people think that hackers are much more common than they are, but then again we could just be lucky
    Some of the cheating may go unnoticed and you also have people who only use cheats in the final round.

I didn't have too many cheaters the past few weeks, but now I am currently playing and am at game 8. 6 of those games had cheaters.

Edit: Just played game number 9, I saw three people flying within a few seconds.
        That’s true, there are probably a lot that I haven’t noticed
Thanks.

In hindsight of my original post, I hope I didn't kindle the fire in too many players eyes. It was originally meant to insult cheaters as little kids and not to infuriate people towards them or the developers of the game. At this point it seems to have turned into a huge circle jerk and I almost feel bad for seeing so many people turned off by it.
    It’s a complicated issue because you get into this chicken-and-egg situation where hackers cause high-profile posts about them which in turn inspire more hackers after seeing the reaction. To me, this means the only way to meaningfully address this is for someone outside of that cycle, AKA Devolver, to get their shit together and implement an effective anti-cheating system. I question how well this game was coded if people were able to develop hacks within a week of release.
Bro what era am I living in. This is the kind of shit I was seeing in like fucking 2000-2010 back when people didn't understand the nature of cheaters. I think by fucking now we should all know better.... 

You could almost make the case that it's a free game and you get what you pay for but it's NOT EVEN FREE.
    Even free games have better cheat detection and prevention methods.
        Warframe to give an example is free and warns you if it detects cheat engine upon opening the launcher. Choosing to ignore said warning and launching the game anyways will give you a nice ban to your account. Don't see why the devs here can't deal with it. Surely they've raked in a fortune from the game's popularity to hire an anti-cheat specialist team?
            Hell, if you're going to do any kind of multiplayer the least I would expect is that you did something to take care of what is essentially a hex editor that is easy to use like a game genie.
    Well you've gotta think, the devs didn't even think to include some sort of lag abuse prevention. Something like "hit-reg." A system that would prevent things like grabbing a tail from 10 feet away among other huge lag based issues. This is something that has existed since 2010, possibly earlier.
Snap banning for slightly over 1.0 speed would result in tons of false bans. Just provide a little bit of lag and the server could see the client moving over 1.0 speed.
    Getting hit by obstacles would do the same. And I've seen plenty of clips of people getting flung into the air by parts of the doors in Door Dash, so the zero gravity hacks are harder to track as well
        Obstacles cap physics impulse to a particular terminal velocity
        All this calculation should be done server side then synced to the client and correct the values there, which were computed there just to reduce lag in visuals. Unfortunately small indie company cannot afford such strong servers.
    At this point it's gotten so annoying I'd rather get kicked from the game with a false positive occasionally than play with cheaters
They shouldn't let you connect online with cheat engine open. Many games do that so Mediatonic should consider doing that as well.
Holy shit cheat engine is still a thing? Lol
    Speaks volumes to how laughable the problem is, doesn't it?
I don’t believe any cheater in this game cares if you’re ignoring them or not. All they care about is laughing all the way to the crown. Getting the crown means they’ve cheated up to 59 other people out of a crown, regardless of the circumstance or your feelings against them.

This is the same mentality as your parents telling you not to give your bully any attention. I grew up being told that and guess what, it didn’t stop the bullying
What if we had player moderators, and if multiple reports align then the player gets banned

Edit: it could get abused, but to avoid this the final ban must be approved by a Mediatonic employee or it must be something easily measured, like speed or amount of time off the ground, barring physics glitches.
    Too easy to abuse. Some group of trolls reporting someone who beats them.
        You can have something like Overwatch in CS:GO where the reported person's demos get randomly distributed to people who give a simple yes/no that the person is cheating. It's even much simpler because it's easy for anyone to know when someone is cheating in Fall Guys
            Building a system like that is _really_ complex
                It requires a replay system first and foremost, so you're right. I think the right move at this point is getting some stopgaps that provide basic detection, and then work on a replay + report system to create this.
                These guys doing some armchair construction: Just build the Burj Khalifa that should take care of your housing problem.
            I think you’re in to something there. I dunno if something that complex could be implemented but I feel like even a short 3 second clip could show whether someone is hacking or it’s just physics or a false report by a salty player.
            Hook that up to a machine learning algo too. Eventually you'll get an ai that can do it at a high success rate without needing players to vote yes/no
With a speed-detection thing, they could just make it so hitting a bumper or spinner disables it for a split second and watches the players speed over the next few seconds.  When if you get launched really far, your speed is still constantly dropping as you fly.

Basically, it would ban people who go over the max speed unless they hit a bumper/spinner/hammer, and when they do hit those things, the game would watch their speed to make sure its dropping like it should and people aren't just hitting the spinners before activating the cheat.  This would limit false positives.
I believe that was the original reason. But then they realized there is an E style family rating thing they want to go for. 

Which means steam allows 'any names', so they want to censor names more than steam does. So sometimes people use inappropriate names they want to block. I think that is the hold up now. Trying to devise a censorship style system. Perhaps build their own name system separate from steam?



Especially if they want cross plat play with playstation 1 day.
    AFAIK this was the reason I thought they were disabled too.
    Don't all rated games with multiplayer have a disclaimer along the lines of "online game not rated"
        I don't mean in any official organizational rating, but I think they want to be children family friendly.
    It's a pretty shit excuse at this point because the game is suffering from a massive cheating problem.  They're trying to fix something that MIGHT be an issue in the future over something that is a rampant festering wound right now.
Pics or it didn't happen
    * *X-rays* or it didn't happen
But they don’t dissolve ingame what this guy is saying to use as a buttplug
And honestly i feel like people who cheat on FALL GUYS A GAME THAT IS A CHILDISH GAME, IS MORE OF A LOSER THAT THEY WANNA CHEAT, Like honestly if you cheat on Fall Guys how much of a no life are you?
    I think this kind of salty comments encourages them even more
        I don't think there's anything that actually discourages them in the first place tbh. They lack the empathy to give a shit and like seeing people complain in any way. There is no real penalty to them as it stands.
            If you cheat on a game like fall guys you are really a kid with nothing better to do and I mean really nothing better to do, nothing will discourage this type of behavior, it is already the bottom of the pit

    this game made me sign up for ps plus for the first time since i don't normally play online
    It's free with the thing that you pay for.
    This is always a dumb statement. It's not free if you pay any amount of money to have access to it. Ps+ and game pass are great deals, but stop calling them games free.
        Exactly, having to pay just for the privilege to access multiplayer gaming is absurd.

Edit: Oh shit, that's an actual sub
    I know you were being funny but I hate console war bullshit.
        [deleted]
            Yeah its really irritating how many cheaters and no lifes there are, when they're cheaters who do no harm to anyone, then its fine, can care less but if it's cheaters ruining the fun then thats a big bother.
            Yeah, when PC hackers ruined Dragon Ball Xenoverse for me, I had regretted not playing on the PS4. Now, whenever I can choose, I play on the PS4 to avoid hackers.
                [deleted]
            Most of the people on pcmasterrace are hilariously uninformed. And btw you cant hack on a console.
            My friends and I do the same, but also make self deprecating jokes as our main form of gaming together is on PS4. While a small portion of me is enjoying the dumpster fire that is Fall Guys on PC, the rest really wants them to fix it. Cross play with no hackers would do magic for the game and community.
    So is r/consolemasterrace but it's satire lol
        Tbf PC master race started as satire and has now been adopted literally.
            Recently they've come back around to accepting consoles for what they are. I haven't read the word "peasant" in quite a while, actually.
                Maybe everyone realised it was all meaningless
                    There are still a ton of people that take pcmr literally. 

Sad, lonely, pathetic people, but they're still people.
But it means you can't play online.
    Not necessarily - IIRC there were public methods for bypassing it back in 5.05, although 6.72 may or may not currently be stuck offline - I haven't followed the homebrew scene in a while.
        Even if you can the barrier for entry is way higher. On pc all you have to do is google Fall Guy Hack and pay some dude $10 a month to easily cheat.
Oh definitely.
Seriously. Who keeps making these things?
Apparently if you close the app before you’re eliminated it won’t count it as a loss.
    Lowkey glad that’s in the game cause the trophy is near impossible otherwise
I think that's only bc the orange metallic is kinda combined with the black. You notice it best when you're changing your look, and wear the pattern with no pattern and apply any  colour. (Works best with metallic colours)

The second colour often "shines through" the main colour
I'm just explaining their reasoning.
Sony has some guidelines for the naming of your account, right? Steam doesn't, which makes it easier to exploit
>a lot of non- Software Engineers learn Unity as a hobby and you get a shit ton of unqualified candidates. 

This is the reason
If this shit keeps going on and the devs show no sign of fixing it, Valve will definitely give them the middle finger
