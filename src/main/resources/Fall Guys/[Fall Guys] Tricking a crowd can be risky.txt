                        While it is a dunkey reference, at some point [LilKirbs took that Bowser's Big Bean Burrito world record](https://youtu.be/UBW15leffgo)... and then [LilKirbs beat the level blindfolded with a steering wheel](https://youtu.be/qgTNiQGvOoM).


I don't know who has the world record now.

    I actually got to be a part of one of these. Watched everyone run to the wrong square. 3 of us made it through.  Laughed out loud, called them all stupid, then proceeded to fall through every floor of hex-a-gone to be the first elim. I was a sad panda

            Knowing nothing about fall guy, how did he know which was the watermelon square to switch to?
                The different fruits flash on the squares a few times before it shows you which one you need to stand on, so you have to memorize which fruits are on what tiles.
                    Ah. Thanks. Have a great day.
        Looks like they‚Äôre the last two, do they go head to head next?
            You can see more in bottom right
                Oh right. I wonder at what point the game does the final round, which is the race for the crown I think? Would have been interesting 1 on 1.
                    There's a couple different games they'll randomly throw at you for the finale. The crown, the spinny one like from the show Whipeout, tail grab, and Hex-a-gone. Not sure if there are any others... 

In my experience they're all significantly more challenging with less people going into it.
                        It seems like the rounds are weighted. There are certain rounds that I definitely see more than others.
                            100%, I only got the tail ending once (not complaining since I don't like any of the tail mods), the jumping one does come from time to time, but the hexagon one and the crown race definitely come more often. 

I belive that the tail end doesn't have any chance to come if you already had one of the other 2 tail modes in that match, the same thing aplies to the jumping end who also has a normal mode.

I also think that the number of players alive matter in the decision.
                                I'm pretty sure number of players is the main deciding factor. My experience is that 5 or fewer goes to Royal Fumble, 6-10 is Hexagone, 8-12 is Fall Mountain, and 12-15 is Jump Showdown. 
I'm sure that's not exactly right but it seems pretty consistent so far.
                                    I‚Äôve seen some crowded hexes, and some 6 or 7 person fall mountains. So the ranges definitely overlap a bit but players remaining definitely changes the odds
                                    Sounds fine to me, sometimes the game only goes to round 4 and we get a 19 person hexagone lol
                    I've seen multiple final round maps, and I know that the game does end early if everyone gets eliminated, saw a clip of someone actually jebating everyone on this level and it going to the crown screen.
                    When there's low enough players it can initiate the final round.

Early in the release I had a game where the first round was Slime Climb and it [eliminated all but 3 players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2AMK7Ol9NI&t=23s). Second round was the finale.
                        Lmao was that last guy purposely trying to get hit by every single obstacle?
                        That fucking ending though... Grats
                        This still aplies, happened to me this weekend while I was playing with my little cousin, first round was Slime Climb and only 6 of us made it so we went to the final on round 2.
                    There are 4 possible final rounds. Fall Mountain, Hex-a-Gone, Jump Showdown, and Royal Fumble. The game goes in to the final round either after a certain number of rounds or earlier if the player count gets low. When it is four players, it's almost always Royal Fumble
                    There are several different final rounds, but it seems to go for it at some point under 15 people left. I've seen it do the final round when it got down to 15 people, but I find it usually waits until there are less than 10.
                    Most for last round is 20 but very rare. You can have as few as 3 or as many as 6 rounds. It's all based on probabilities. I think the algorithm is reasonably complex. Although they definately increased the amount of tiptoe recently, get it almost every time.

There are a few final rounds. At least 4 i can think of right now.

I've yet to play this level.  But here we go with the Roll Out for the 20th time!
    Yeah until you get good at the starter levels you're always going to be playing the same thing.
        Considering picking up this game today. Is it as fun as it looks? Lol

Update: to everyone whom replied thank you <3. I bought it
            You'll hate every minute of it and not put it down.
                I got it last night before it expired, holy shit it is so hard. I was eliminated my first 10 games.

                            It‚Äôs mostly just learning basic level strategy and some timing. Give it a week of playing and you‚Äôll be moderately good, which means still sometimes getting eliminated in the first round or two with some bad luck, but also making it to the final round with decent frequency.

There are a lot of little tricks you can learn for many of the levels, but the controls aren‚Äôt complex or tight enough for the skill gap between great players and decent players to be even close to insurmountable. 

It just feels like that for the first couple of days.
                                except on team games. fuck team games
                            Different skill levels out there. On average, only 1 person in 60 wins each round.  Then depending on skill you're gong to have some people beating those odds by quite a bit, and some people probably never winning.  The beauty is the game is fun even when you lose.
                        Dude I won on my 3rd and 4th shows... I thought this was going to be a super simple game. That was like weeks ago. I have yet to win since and I‚Äôve probably played 100 times!
                        >I was actually kind of proud lol.

I'm 34 y/o. When I won my first (and only) show (so far) I took my girlfriend to dinner to celebrate.

It's awesome to enjoy the good times, even for the tiniest of things
                    Is it not on PS+ or whatever it's called anymore?
                        It‚Äôs available for PS+ subscribers for free until September 4th, when the new PS+ games for the month transition.
                            It's gone. The PS+ games update the first Tuesday of every month, which is today.
                                Oh shit, I wish I knew. Actually, it's probably worse that you told me, now I'll never buy it knowing I could have had it for free lol.
                                    same just found out that it was on there with this comment, I also cannot purchase this game now
                    Expired? The game was deleted or something?

                This sums up every game I play.
                Nah, you'll only hate it the exact moment right before you see Eliminated. Every other moment is quite enjoyable.
            It's frustrating sometimes, but fun.
            [deleted]
            It's fun for a time. After you've played for a while it gets boring unless you're into highly repetitive stuff or you are determined to get very good. I played yesterday and for 5 games, 15 levels, I played the same 2 levels maybe 70% of the time. And it was always repetitive level 1, repetitive lvl 2, something different. For 20 bucks it's probably worth it. Its good to pick up for 30 minutes and genuinely be ok with putting it down after.

But it his the same annoyance that fortnight has for me. You'll always be losing. Most of the games you'll lose. And a good portion of that time the losing will be semi random, like someone bumped into you, or you got your timing slightly off. You're probably not gonna look back and say "Oh wow I'm on fire today". You'll say "I lost less than usual".
            I played two rounds and lost interest.  It's not for everyone.  Give it a shot though.
            IMO, not really, but you may find you enjoy it. Only one way to find out.

                        If you have PS4 basic, don't get it unless you're ok with like a second of input lag.
                            Fucking hell you mean not everyone has to deal with that? I thought that was just how the game worked.
                                I switched from my PS4 to PC and the input lag dropped to almost nothing.

Slime Climb and Tail Tag became so much more playable for me.
                                    Is that why I can't do Tail Tag?  I feel like I'm bumping into the other bean and not getting his tail, but the guy following 3 feet behind me somehow snatches mine.
                                You playing on a 4k TV? Oddly enough, that was my wife's problem. Switched her to a 1080 HD and her input delay dropped CONSIDERABLY.
                                    It depends on how good the latency is on game mode.. My 4k TV has like 18ms which is pretty standard on good tvs
                                I have a standard ps4 and a ps4 pro on a 4k TV.

I can confirm that there is serious input lag on the base ps4 as well as the frame rate only being 30fps vs the ps4Pro's 60fps.

The game is extremely responsive and quick on the pro, but almost unplayable on the base PS4.

If you don't have a Pro or PC, don't get the game. You will be at a significant disadvantage.
                            I've seen on Twitter that it's server side. They've been having issues with servers, weren't expecting this big of a launch. Yes they worked a deal for it to be free but they weren't expecting it to become the new hottest game
        Oof
            Haha not trying to be rude, I had the same problems when I first picked up the game.
                All good, I got you. I'll get there.  If I can beat Dark Souls, I can win at Fall Guys.... right?   RIGHT????
                    Depends, did you use a shield and two phantoms the whole time?
                        I use a shield yeh.  First time I beat without summons because I was too scared of getting invaded.  Now I play "human" as much as possible for that good Jolly Cooperation!
        Not only is this true, but the same 5 people always end up in the finale.


By the time you do get to the last stage you have to be better than someone who has been playing hex a gone or fall mountain 20 times in a row.

Its so difficult because you're playing against people with more experience than you.
            > Not only is this true, but the same 5 people always end up in the finale.

I mean if you are decent at platformers it is really easy to get to the final round if you don't get screwed in a team game.
        For the past few days I've been getting only the same few games for round 3 and four. 

Haven't seen a Hoarders in a week.
    This is funny but more often than not only 1-3 people get eliminated from the memory game in my experience.  It‚Äôs my least favorite of all the levels because it‚Äôs stupid easy.  They should make it a bit harder or drop it.
        It's funny. I've found I can keep 5 of the fruits in my head but if I try to memorize all 6 I get confused.
            The fuck is a watermelon?
            >!CENSORED!<
            Same thats why im always on banana so i dont have to even think about it
        I initially thought the same thing, but I believe the "eliminated" count after every game is deceptive because I don't think it includes any players who have already disconnected. So it could show only 1 player being "eliminated" even though 5 others were already killed and disconnected from the server.
            That's true but for perfect match you can literally watch only 2-3 ppl fall off most of the time
                yeah, it's a me
        See, I find that one quite difficult. My brain absolutely refuses to work that way and it's infuriating! See Saw is more my speed lol
        Super hate that game. Not only is memorization not very fun in a fast-paced platformer, it's too easy to just watch everyone else unless someone manages to pull something like the OP gif. I've had too many games where no one gets eliminated at all. 

It's just stressful without being fun. I think they should drop it entirely.
    Roll out is actually fun and kind of relaxing
The one level i have a problem is Slim Clim i really hate it.
        You will love slime climb once you can do it consistently. So many people fail it, it's an easy ride like the roller one.
            Slime climb is the best because it is almost entirely up to your personal skill minus the potential unlucky bump.
                So many people can't get past the cylinder bridges, it's a great elimination game because it takes the player count from 30 to 6.
            The only one I have a problem with rn is Fall Ball. I can't win consistently it feels like a coinflip every time but even worse than other team games because it's a 50% coinflip instead of a 25% or 33%. Idk if I'm just bad or it's legitimately coinflip.
                I've never once won fall ball and I've always been on the yellow team. I can't seem to actually hit the ball and send it a considerable distance because it always looks like it glitches and kinda sticks to my character. What am I doing wrong?
        Same here, but that's cos I'm fat
        Yeah slime climb has a couple tricky spots. Took me a few times to lock it down. Patience is key.
    Oddly enough I‚Äôve played roll out once and I get tiles almost every ‚Äúshow‚Äù
    Jealous, this is the worst level in my opinion.  Devoid of anything resembling fun (well I guess unless you're trying to trick people, I should try that)
    You're lucky, Perfect Match is so easy that usually 0 to 2 people get eliminated. They should really just remove it from the game imo, it's not fun
        I've started to push off people who don't seem to be paying attention. Has made it a lot more fun.
    Really? I get this level probably 50% of the time. I hate it because it requires more concentration than basically every other level and basically no one ever gets eliminated by it (OP's gif is very much the edge case, usually only 2 or 3 people get eliminated)
    You‚Äôre lucky then. This level sucks.
Im up front, im up front, im upfront .... (fake door) Im fucking last ....
    You can up your winrate of all stages by simply noticing stuff. 

So far every minigame, even the "rng" heavy ones aren't really rng. I can get to the final round >70% of the time, and 1st for any minigame maybe 10% of the time.

For example, the fake doors on the last three rows have a larger red triangle at the bottom.

Now if only there are less hackers and fall mountain appears more so I can actually practice....
        > the fake doors on the last three rows have a larger red triangle at the bottom

oh shit i have like 25 wins and didn't notice this.  definitely seen my share of hackers though flying around at super speed.  ive seen fall mountain a lot more since the tail tag finale rate got nerfed.
            You can also tell which of the last doors is the real one on the flyover preview. When it shows the back of the doors the real one will be shorter than the other 2
                You guys are changing everything I thought I knew about this game lmao
                    Getting good is all well and rewarding but it slowly begins sucking the fun out of the game. Party games like this I strongly suggest avoiding tips and tricks because the adage is true "Players will optimize the fun out of a game."

Except for the final round. I do recommend try harding then because everyone is gunning for the victory.
                *furiously scribbles down notes*
        Also, dive into people at a certain distance, both of you will gain a boost since you push the person and you bonk your head and land upright.

So if you have a friend, you can assist one another and travel faster, tho not as much as bhopping. Takes a bit of practice though and it is only worth it on level ground.
            Shake and bake!
        Got my first hacker yesterday.  They could fly and move super fast.  The one map with the teeter totters the whooooole way was bullshit with them. They got to a point where theres one teeter totter everyone has to use to proceed further and then they lowered that teeter all the way so that it was basically standing straight up, while also flying so that it cant move back to a flat position at all. They stayed that way for 30 seconds, literally not a single person could proceed.   They eventually moved and proceeded through several rounds like jump through hoops, but they just flew through every hoop super fast.   

The final round was the one where the floor disappears when you step on it, and its multiple levels and at the bottom is slime.  They won because they could fly above while everyone else could only fall into the slime
            Yeah if you see a cheater you may just want to quit cause they‚Äôll win every time.
                Or pray that there is a team game and the cheater is in your team so you can sabotage him. Not ideal but at least you have a shot to screw them.
        Oh boy final round! Oh it's the stupid fucking tail thing. Fantastic
        Alright, then give me the winning strategy for the jinxed game mode please
            Just don't get jinxed.
        Imo the RNG makes it fun. Gives everyone a chance. They really should fix those arrows people mention.
    You can tell the last three doors based on the arrow in the middle behind the door teeth. The smaller arrow is the correct door.
How do you even know which platform has the right fruit?
    I think before the clip begins, the fruits of each platform randomly flash for a while, and you have to remember them
        Thank you for this as I was in same boat as u/foopidiescoop07
        Yup... it's a memory based round. Some find it easy, some can't be bothered to try.
            I hate that level because it's too easy. On average 0 to 3 people get eliminated when I play. It's always a wasted round when I play it.
                I used to hate it but now it's one of my favorites because of people like OP

I'm terrible at it and when I mass die for following, I genuinely find it hilarious to be eliminated
                    The fact it's so easy makes when everyone fails all the more amazing
                        I find it challenging because I can't keep track of all the variables while people are also moving around
                            If there was one more fruit in the final round to track I think wed see a lot more fails
                Exactly, it should speed up significantly towards the end. Right now its baby's first matching game.
                I've never seen 0. You probably just don't see them ejected because they quit before that screen. Most games I push at least 1 on off. Makes it more entertaining
        Oh ok, thx. I have never played it that is why I asked lol.
        [deleted]
            Not all fruits flash up at the same time, it shows you a random percentage of the tiles every other second or so. Sure, you can take multiple screenshots, but at that point you might as well just use a sheet of paper to mark notes. Again, this round is usually very easy with only 1-3 people being eliminated, which is why something like this is so funny
            The entire grid does not flash, it flashes about 4-5 times with different tiles being shown each time (tiles will be shown more than once too). In theory you could take multiple screenshots but you have very little time between the last flash of the fruit and the platforms dropping. For me it's easier to just memorize one spot per fruit.
            Takes the fun out
        How do so many people fall for this then?

Is no one watching?
    You see, the titles flash color showing you which tile is what fruit. Afterwards it stops, then a random fruit comes on the screen. Then you have the choose the correct fruit.
    It flashes for 10 seconds so you can see what kind of fruits are there, then the last flash before the timer ends is the one it sticks on. A good tip is to stand near a corner and pan your view across all the squares. I keep 3 fruits in mind and then if it flashes a different of those 3 all I had to do was remember which tile was different looking from the 3 and follow the masses (for the most part).

I play this level too much.
This is hilarious lmao
There were *three* watermelon blocks. How so many idiots fell for that is outstanding.
    People follow the crowd. It‚Äôs a literal survival skill.
        If all your friends jumped off a bridge...
            My dude, i'm the one jumping off first
                That's because you're a leader, a winner, a man (or woman) out in front of the world.  A trailblazer.  A go-getter.  I see real potential in you, son.
                    This is a confusingly wholesome spin on front-running a suicide movement.
                        Look, if *everyone* is jumping, I expect the bridge is on fire.
                    [deleted]
                        Will do.  Just need to go get cigarettes first.
                    I doubt for much longer
                I'm right behind ya, brother
                    W-wait for me!
            [Relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1170/)
            But if the bridge is more dangerous than the jump...
            Then there's probably a T-Rex about to snatch ya from behind. Best jump, my man! Hope for the best!
        Which is regularly exploited by top level sociopaths in positions of authority. Or in this case, OP.
            OP 2020
        Or in this case, the opposite of that.
            ‚ÄúCivilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them."

That used to mean eating a new food after your cave buddy to know if it would kill you, now its jumping on squares using electronics that are too complex for any one person to fully understand. How far we have come while so many stand still is truly astounding.
        I can‚Äôt find the link but there was a construction or maintenance guy who posted on Reddit within the last month about how he was wearing a hard hat and uniform at work when he realized he was either late for something or just generally needed to get somewhere else in a hurry.

He started jogging/running toward his car and apparently started a mini panic of people thinking there was a problem he was running away from. That must have been a scene to be a part of.
        Yup you can see some players second-guessing their choice here even thought they were headed for the right tile lol
    I forget which fruits are where almost immediately, most of the time when I stand alone I just go towards the pack
        I stopped even watching the tiles and just follow where most people are going.
        You‚Äôre like that cougar with his toy under the switched bucket
    So many people probably play this wasted and dont even look at the tiles after the 2nd round.
        Considering the general skill level in the game is basically that of an ape I'd say that's hopefully true.
        Can confirm, my wife loves playing this when she has a few drinks. Only difference is she can‚Äôt even make it past the first round.
    > There were three watermelon blocks.

Not only that, but half the group went to a ***completely different*** wrong square.

I haven't played Fall Guys (only seen some people stream it), so I don't know if it has some sort of MMR-based matchmaking, but that almost has to be the case here, right? This has to be a group of players not very familiar with the game yet.
        That particular minigame is boring enough that you can just kinda zone out and not pay attention at all, but follow the crowd and you'll get through every single time (unless someone next level like OP messes with everyone).
            Well yeah, sure, and I understand that, but that still doesn't explain why ***half of the group*** fell because they went to a completely different wrong square.
                looks like it was a perfect storm based on the fruit positions. You can see that some people heading to OP's wrong square get blocked by people trying and failing to run for one of the CORRECT squares.
                Half the people aren't playing, they are just mindlessly going along with the crowd. They think that this one is boring (and if everyone tried all the time it would be boring). the thing is nearly everyone is following the crowd, they have to find the guy who does know whats going on, and if you are that guy you can trick a large portion of the people.
    They saw that guy jump over with confidence/desperation and assumed he knew what he was doing
    This is the only level that is hard to play when high.  Fuck remembering shit.
    Not gonna speak for everyone, but when I play this level I usually can‚Äôt remember the tiles the second they go blank, try as I might. So it just becomes a mental game at that point ‚Äúwell everyone‚Äôs going to this tile, so I will to‚Äù and it honestly works 99% of the time. 

Unless you get tricked like in this video lmao
        I find that the secret is not turning your character too much. Keeping your fov in one direction makes it far easier to memorize the blocks around you and avoid confusion.
    Last round flashes with 6 fruits so you gotta remember all 6 until the screen tells you which one is safe. I imagine most people try to memorize 3 or 4 closest to them and hope for the best
    This minigame is so boring that a lot of people don't actually play it, they just follow the crowd because it works 99% of the time

Edit edit: sorry. I played it in the original Xbox. Not the 360. Good times!

    It‚Äôs a lot of fun. I downloaded it on PSN during a promotional period when it was free, but regular price is only $20. The amount of fun you have is well worth it.
        Fun?  I don‚Äôt know if I experience fun or rage more when playing this game.
    As others have said, it‚Äôs very fun. But it‚Äôs gets old FAST. I have like 10 hours into the game and I‚Äôm already pretty sick of it.
        I made it 6 hours. For the mini-games that I actually like, it is fun, but a lot of them are boring. I hate the team games too because I feel like it is luck of the draw whether or not my team is even capable of beating the other ones or not. I do not like the lack of self-determinism in those modes.

All of that to say - 6 hours in and I'm bored of it.
        I think if you just sit and play, it‚Äôll get old quick. But despite being non-split screen, it‚Äôs a great party game. If you don‚Äôt win you pass the controller, or you can put (small amounts) of money to bet whether or not someone will survive a round, etc.

The suuuuper simple controls as well as the funny animations make it enjoyable and playable  for literally all gamers/non-gamers.
    Also is it compatible on Mac or is it another good game I‚Äôm missing out on
        Windows only according to Steam
        I play it on my Mac by using Bootcamp to boot into Windows. Apple actually made it incredibly easy to use Windows on your Mac. I had to buy a Windows key or course, but other than that it‚Äôs very painless. You basically just open the Bootcamp app and it walks through everything
            You also aren't going to be able to do this anymore on new Macs
                I have a 2020 MacBook Pro and I was able to do it fine.
                    Same. He means the ones that haven‚Äôt come out yet though. Apple is about to make ARM Macs and Windows support for ARM is terrible/experimental.
    THANK YOU! 

The last several years I‚Äôve been trying to think of Fuzion Frenzy and I couldn‚Äôt remember it for the life of me!
    It's ok.  Pretty repetitive and it uses the Fortnite style of in app purchasing but it has a certain charm to it.  I find myself knocking out a few games when I'm bored.  Matches are really quick so it is a good time-filler.
        Not really. The battle pass is free and the Skins are not important; You can get better ones for free.
        >uses the Fortnite style of in app purchasing

Why is this a turn off for people? Optional cosmetics equal more dev time without me having to pay extra.
            When you come from an era where skins are included in the base price and unlocked thru in game achievements is a bit disheartening to pay for that kinda thing. I'd rather pay 50$ then 20$+ optional stuff
                99% of skins in Fall Guys are unlockable through playing the game. When you get good enough to consistently get to the final round you'll have plenty of coins to buy whatever skin suits your fancy.
    I find it very fun, but I think the popularity is due less to the sheer amount of fun (even though it's high imo) and more due to how accessble it is. Both kids and intoxicated adults can play and enjoy it lol. Even when you lose, it just means you get to see your cute little jellybean man wipe out.
    Plays like a Mario party game with strangers to me. (The feeling not the actual mini game)
Kind of reminds me of playing Transformice and building a beautiful, carefully engineered bridge, and then making the last plank transparent.
    Wow! Haven‚Äôt heard that name in awhile... great game
    Oh man Transformice! The funnest flash game nobody's ever heard of.
    Now that is a name I haven't heard in a long time
        I played the shit out of that game in its heyday. I loved being shaman, I was really good at both getting the mice to their destination and filtering out the impatient ones. Heh.

I played recently and the game has changed a **lot**, but there are still players.
I would honestyl fall for that as well xD The third stage of this level is anxiety inducing to me :D
    Same. I would try to remember which tiles are which, but can't remember them. So I would just follow people.
        Try to just remember a row or something, recite it as it gets revealed, apple, banana, orange, grape.
            [deleted]
                Exactly.

But then you adjust. Noticing you've seen too many bananas and cherries, you start spinning around trying to find the elusive trick fruit in this diabolical minigame. With a second left before the reveal you see grape flash in the back corner, and you know you've found salvation.

It's about to go down.

You're running to the final oasis; you look up to confirm your deduction, satisfaction saturating your face; there's a flash...

Cherry.

"Fuck."
        I can handle to round 2 perfectly well, then in round three its just so many and its so random which tile lights up when... it just drives me nuts and i always resort to the sheep method: just go where the majority goes xD
            In stage 2 I always do a square of fruits and say them loudly to remember them, but on the third stage there are 6 fruits and is imposible to do it for me :c
        What if I told you, you could have a piece of paper and a pen next to you while you play?
            That is preposterous!
some people just want to watch the world burn
    Fall guys brings out the worst in people lol "childrens game" pssh
        God imagine if fall guys had voice coms.
    Gotta get them crowns yo.
Fricking pink is out there standing and pretend to not see anything
    The clip would have been 10x funnier if Pink pushed him off the platform right before the clip ended.
    He's that puppet monkey meme looking away pretending he didn't see anything.
You gotta love the coyote time where they all just hang in the air contemplating their failure.
Imagine the self-doubt that the other guy was going through, standing alone on that tile like that.
    Nah dude. He's the self-confident one. That stone cold motherfucker didn't even flinch!
I literally had this happen to me 2 rounds in a row because I couldn‚Äôt be bothered memorising the fruits. People are getting smarter
Aw, hot dog had it too
How is this game? Is it basically a collection of mini games?
    It‚Äôs Mario party but not Mario party

        Takeshis castle
        Honestly that sounds great considering what they did to Super Mario Party. The mini-games are great but almost everything else is botched. It‚Äôs so close but so far.
    Yes and no. 

It's a battle royale of mini games. 

Each game starts with 60 people and you play different mini games depending on how many people are left, until one person remains.
    yes
    Can be fun, but pretty anxiety-inducing. Controls are purposefully a bit sloppy, and there's a lot of randomness in some of the levels, which can be frustrating as hell. Probably more fun on drugs.
        This game is amazing with some mates while being a lil drunk
    Not much fun I played for 2 hours and wish I never bought it. But yeah like the other dude said it‚Äôs like 10 random Mario party games over and over and over.

You can‚Äôt talk. It‚Äôs cute if you had a nephew or kids at home.
        Thank you so much for this, definitely not going to buy.
I find interested how this mini-game evolved. It was the most boring one in the first few days, but now people are trying to trick everyone or straight pushing them away, so I'm starting to actually like it a lot.
if nothing else, Fall Guys has taught us how utterly stupid the average gamer is.
    Or just needlessly mean. Like those guys that stand at the finish line of race levels and just grab random people to try to keep them from qualifying. Pure, senseless evil.
I am so confused here, how does the player know where it's going to be?
    There are 10 seconds before where the blocks on the ground randomly appear and show you what is there. It's a memory game.
        What I do not understand is why many people fell for it
            From what I've seen, a lot of people assume everyone else will know the answer, so there's no need for them to remember which is which. ***Usually*** no one is ***trying*** to lose, so following the crowd would give you the correct answer more often than not.
            Herd Mentality is a hell of a drug
            It's hard to remember all the spaces. Most likely people remember one-ish of each fruit. a combination of the watermelon that they memorized being far away, questioning their own memory, and assuming the group can't be wrong probably led to this.
Savage, lmao
How did he know what square would be safe?
    The level gives everyone a few seconds to try to see some of the tiles, it's a memorization game.
This the most foul shit I have ever seen
This guy is out here playing 4d chess, while everyone else thinks it's checkers
    I think they‚Äôre playing fall guys.
This is why conspiracy theorists think everyone are sheeple
Those two guys who didn't move afterwards surely thought: Everyone is stupid except me (with Homer's voice)

Ik this might be a coincidence and I‚Äôm not expecting recognition I doubt anyone will care but the guy with the boxing gloves and brown w yellow lines in the bottom right corner was me.

Then again there‚Äôs always the chance of someone having the same skin as me and also experiencing this. Ggs tho this trick is insane

Here's a little lesson in trickery
    This is going down in history.
I heard the willhelm scream
That is the greatest play i've ever seen
Admit it, you watched this multiple times in amazement.
They trusted you, and you betrayed them.
I never played fall guys. Whats that level meaning?? Sorry if i am dumb
    The tiles blink fruits, then they disappear and one fruit shows up on the side screens. You have to remember which tiles had that fruit, because the other ones all disappear and you fall and lose.
    Y is this getting downvoted? Fall guys is only available on a handful of systems
holy shit...
How do you know what side its gonna be on?
How are you supposed to tell?
havent played this game so dont know the mechanics really, but why did all of those people follow you when you jumped on that tile?
    They weren‚Äôt paying attention so they just followed
Gosh this is just SO FUCKING FUNNY i cant stop watching!!!!
POGGERS
If this isn't the best example of herd mentality...

How do u know that‚Äôs the watermelon square?
This is what we call chaotic evil.
Now I'm going to play tonight and there's going to be a marked uptick in the "dive meta"
Never played fall guys... Is there some way OP knew which tile was actually watermelon?
    Yup. For about ten seconds they flash different tiles so you can memorize which are which. Then it gives a pause and then flashes t type of fruit to stand on. Theoretically you should always be able to know where to go but a lot of players don‚Äôt bother and just follow the crowd.
    yes they show whats underneath for a short while before the reveal
I can‚Äôt stop watching this
How do you dive like that?
    Jump then square (PS4) or x(?)(Xbox)
I can hear twenty different voices simultaneously shouting MOTHRFUCKER!!!!!

I've never played this game or really watched much, but how do u win this particular level?
It makes you wonder how many people actually pay attention or just follow the crowd.
Stand in the back corner and memorize up the columns. Much easier to see everything that way. You don't need to rely on anyone.
EEEEEEVIIIILLLLL!
I fell for this lmao the dude who tricked us all ended up winning the game because everyone fell off.
SHEEPLE
I don't get it.
Hot take but I see a lot of people calling all these players stupid. I know it feels good to feel mentally superior and think "That wouldn't happen to me". When the truth of the matter is that we've evolved as humans to trust other people, ESPECIALLY when the group's goal is the same. In an evolutionary sense, it's not very often that others within our species have been intentionally maliciously misleading.

That is CLUTCH trickery.

That was pretty impressive lol
So what did the rest of that game look like? Did you play Hex-a-gone with 3 other people?

Do people really not just pay attention to the tiles in this round?

That was the most evil thing  someone could ever do.
Your like hitler but at least hitler cared about Germany or something
Get stickbugged lol
I don't have the game so I'm lacking context; how did you know which tiles to jump to? I can't see any tells in the clip.
    It‚Äôs a memory mini game inside of fall guys, basically it takes turns showing you some of the fruits on the floor tiles, it goes blank after a few seconds and then the big screen randomly picks one of the fruits. You have to hurry to one of the correct floor tiles before the rest of the floor disappears and it gets difficult after a while if a certain amount of people are still in the rounds.
People in a nutshell , always following meanwhile they have no idea what they‚Äôre doing üòÇ

I WAS IN THIS OMG. Straight up bamboozled. Never tell me the odds
Ive been staring at this for 5 hours now . Its beautiful
Is this just pure chance or is there a way to tell what platform to stand on?
    They all flash a fruit, then a fruit flashes on screen. You gotta remember which tile is the right fruit and jump on it.
Well, after all, it's called **Fall Guys**, right?
Ahh, lemmings.
I am in this clip and i don't like it.

        Knowing nothing about fall guy, how did he know which was the watermelon square to switch to?
            The different fruits flash on the squares a few times before it shows you which one you need to stand on, so you have to memorize which fruits are on what tiles.
                Ah. Thanks. Have a great day.
    Looks like they‚Äôre the last two, do they go head to head next?
        You can see more in bottom right
            Oh right. I wonder at what point the game does the final round, which is the race for the crown I think? Would have been interesting 1 on 1.
                There's a couple different games they'll randomly throw at you for the finale. The crown, the spinny one like from the show Whipeout, tail grab, and Hex-a-gone. Not sure if there are any others... 

In my experience they're all significantly more challenging with less people going into it.
                    It seems like the rounds are weighted. There are certain rounds that I definitely see more than others.
                        100%, I only got the tail ending once (not complaining since I don't like any of the tail mods), the jumping one does come from time to time, but the hexagon one and the crown race definitely come more often. 

I belive that the tail end doesn't have any chance to come if you already had one of the other 2 tail modes in that match, the same thing aplies to the jumping end who also has a normal mode.

I also think that the number of players alive matter in the decision.
                            I'm pretty sure number of players is the main deciding factor. My experience is that 5 or fewer goes to Royal Fumble, 6-10 is Hexagone, 8-12 is Fall Mountain, and 12-15 is Jump Showdown. 
I'm sure that's not exactly right but it seems pretty consistent so far.
                                I‚Äôve seen some crowded hexes, and some 6 or 7 person fall mountains. So the ranges definitely overlap a bit but players remaining definitely changes the odds
                                Sounds fine to me, sometimes the game only goes to round 4 and we get a 19 person hexagone lol
                I've seen multiple final round maps, and I know that the game does end early if everyone gets eliminated, saw a clip of someone actually jebating everyone on this level and it going to the crown screen.
                When there's low enough players it can initiate the final round.

Early in the release I had a game where the first round was Slime Climb and it [eliminated all but 3 players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2AMK7Ol9NI&t=23s). Second round was the finale.
                    Lmao was that last guy purposely trying to get hit by every single obstacle?
                    That fucking ending though... Grats
                    This still aplies, happened to me this weekend while I was playing with my little cousin, first round was Slime Climb and only 6 of us made it so we went to the final on round 2.
                There are 4 possible final rounds. Fall Mountain, Hex-a-Gone, Jump Showdown, and Royal Fumble. The game goes in to the final round either after a certain number of rounds or earlier if the player count gets low. When it is four players, it's almost always Royal Fumble
                There are several different final rounds, but it seems to go for it at some point under 15 people left. I've seen it do the final round when it got down to 15 people, but I find it usually waits until there are less than 10.
                Most for last round is 20 but very rare. You can have as few as 3 or as many as 6 rounds. It's all based on probabilities. I think the algorithm is reasonably complex. Although they definately increased the amount of tiptoe recently, get it almost every time.

There are a few final rounds. At least 4 i can think of right now.

Yeah until you get good at the starter levels you're always going to be playing the same thing.

Update: to everyone whom replied thank you <3. I bought it
        You'll hate every minute of it and not put it down.
            I got it last night before it expired, holy shit it is so hard. I was eliminated my first 10 games.

                    [deleted]
                        It‚Äôs mostly just learning basic level strategy and some timing. Give it a week of playing and you‚Äôll be moderately good, which means still sometimes getting eliminated in the first round or two with some bad luck, but also making it to the final round with decent frequency.

There are a lot of little tricks you can learn for many of the levels, but the controls aren‚Äôt complex or tight enough for the skill gap between great players and decent players to be even close to insurmountable. 

It just feels like that for the first couple of days.
                            except on team games. fuck team games
                        Different skill levels out there. On average, only 1 person in 60 wins each round.  Then depending on skill you're gong to have some people beating those odds by quite a bit, and some people probably never winning.  The beauty is the game is fun even when you lose.
                    Dude I won on my 3rd and 4th shows... I thought this was going to be a super simple game. That was like weeks ago. I have yet to win since and I‚Äôve probably played 100 times!
                    >I was actually kind of proud lol.

                Is it not on PS+ or whatever it's called anymore?
                    It‚Äôs available for PS+ subscribers for free until September 4th, when the new PS+ games for the month transition.
                        It's gone. The PS+ games update the first Tuesday of every month, which is today.
                            Oh shit, I wish I knew. Actually, it's probably worse that you told me, now I'll never buy it knowing I could have had it for free lol.
                                same just found out that it was on there with this comment, I also cannot purchase this game now

            Nah, you'll only hate it the exact moment right before you see Eliminated. Every other moment is quite enjoyable.
        It's frustrating sometimes, but fun.
        [deleted]
        It's fun for a time. After you've played for a while it gets boring unless you're into highly repetitive stuff or you are determined to get very good. I played yesterday and for 5 games, 15 levels, I played the same 2 levels maybe 70% of the time. And it was always repetitive level 1, repetitive lvl 2, something different. For 20 bucks it's probably worth it. Its good to pick up for 30 minutes and genuinely be ok with putting it down after.

But it his the same annoyance that fortnight has for me. You'll always be losing. Most of the games you'll lose. And a good portion of that time the losing will be semi random, like someone bumped into you, or you got your timing slightly off. You're probably not gonna look back and say "Oh wow I'm on fire today". You'll say "I lost less than usual".
        I played two rounds and lost interest.  It's not for everyone.  Give it a shot though.
        IMO, not really, but you may find you enjoy it. Only one way to find out.

                    If you have PS4 basic, don't get it unless you're ok with like a second of input lag.
                        Fucking hell you mean not everyone has to deal with that? I thought that was just how the game worked.
                            I switched from my PS4 to PC and the input lag dropped to almost nothing.

Slime Climb and Tail Tag became so much more playable for me.
                                Is that why I can't do Tail Tag?  I feel like I'm bumping into the other bean and not getting his tail, but the guy following 3 feet behind me somehow snatches mine.
                            You playing on a 4k TV? Oddly enough, that was my wife's problem. Switched her to a 1080 HD and her input delay dropped CONSIDERABLY.
                                It depends on how good the latency is on game mode.. My 4k TV has like 18ms which is pretty standard on good tvs
                            I have a standard ps4 and a ps4 pro on a 4k TV.

I can confirm that there is serious input lag on the base ps4 as well as the frame rate only being 30fps vs the ps4Pro's 60fps.

The game is extremely responsive and quick on the pro, but almost unplayable on the base PS4.

If you don't have a Pro or PC, don't get the game. You will be at a significant disadvantage.
                        I've seen on Twitter that it's server side. They've been having issues with servers, weren't expecting this big of a launch. Yes they worked a deal for it to be free but they weren't expecting it to become the new hottest game
    Oof
        Haha not trying to be rude, I had the same problems when I first picked up the game.
            All good, I got you. I'll get there.  If I can beat Dark Souls, I can win at Fall Guys.... right?   RIGHT????
                Depends, did you use a shield and two phantoms the whole time?
                    I use a shield yeh.  First time I beat without summons because I was too scared of getting invaded.  Now I play "human" as much as possible for that good Jolly Cooperation!
    Not only is this true, but the same 5 people always end up in the finale.


By the time you do get to the last stage you have to be better than someone who has been playing hex a gone or fall mountain 20 times in a row.

Its so difficult because you're playing against people with more experience than you.
        > Not only is this true, but the same 5 people always end up in the finale.

I mean if you are decent at platformers it is really easy to get to the final round if you don't get screwed in a team game.
    For the past few days I've been getting only the same few games for round 3 and four. 

Haven't seen a Hoarders in a week.
This is funny but more often than not only 1-3 people get eliminated from the memory game in my experience.  It‚Äôs my least favorite of all the levels because it‚Äôs stupid easy.  They should make it a bit harder or drop it.
    It's funny. I've found I can keep 5 of the fruits in my head but if I try to memorize all 6 I get confused.
        The fuck is a watermelon?
        >!CENSORED!<
        Same thats why im always on banana so i dont have to even think about it
    I initially thought the same thing, but I believe the "eliminated" count after every game is deceptive because I don't think it includes any players who have already disconnected. So it could show only 1 player being "eliminated" even though 5 others were already killed and disconnected from the server.
        That's true but for perfect match you can literally watch only 2-3 ppl fall off most of the time
            yeah, it's a me
    See, I find that one quite difficult. My brain absolutely refuses to work that way and it's infuriating! See Saw is more my speed lol
    Super hate that game. Not only is memorization not very fun in a fast-paced platformer, it's too easy to just watch everyone else unless someone manages to pull something like the OP gif. I've had too many games where no one gets eliminated at all. 

It's just stressful without being fun. I think they should drop it entirely.
Roll out is actually fun and kind of relaxing
The one level i have a problem is Slim Clim i really hate it.
    You will love slime climb once you can do it consistently. So many people fail it, it's an easy ride like the roller one.
        Slime climb is the best because it is almost entirely up to your personal skill minus the potential unlucky bump.
            So many people can't get past the cylinder bridges, it's a great elimination game because it takes the player count from 30 to 6.
        The only one I have a problem with rn is Fall Ball. I can't win consistently it feels like a coinflip every time but even worse than other team games because it's a 50% coinflip instead of a 25% or 33%. Idk if I'm just bad or it's legitimately coinflip.
            I've never once won fall ball and I've always been on the yellow team. I can't seem to actually hit the ball and send it a considerable distance because it always looks like it glitches and kinda sticks to my character. What am I doing wrong?
    Same here, but that's cos I'm fat
    Yeah slime climb has a couple tricky spots. Took me a few times to lock it down. Patience is key.
Oddly enough I‚Äôve played roll out once and I get tiles almost every ‚Äúshow‚Äù
Jealous, this is the worst level in my opinion.  Devoid of anything resembling fun (well I guess unless you're trying to trick people, I should try that)
You're lucky, Perfect Match is so easy that usually 0 to 2 people get eliminated. They should really just remove it from the game imo, it's not fun
    I've started to push off people who don't seem to be paying attention. Has made it a lot more fun.
Really? I get this level probably 50% of the time. I hate it because it requires more concentration than basically every other level and basically no one ever gets eliminated by it (OP's gif is very much the edge case, usually only 2 or 3 people get eliminated)
You‚Äôre lucky then. This level sucks.
You can up your winrate of all stages by simply noticing stuff. 

So far every minigame, even the "rng" heavy ones aren't really rng. I can get to the final round >70% of the time, and 1st for any minigame maybe 10% of the time.

For example, the fake doors on the last three rows have a larger red triangle at the bottom.

Now if only there are less hackers and fall mountain appears more so I can actually practice....
    > the fake doors on the last three rows have a larger red triangle at the bottom

oh shit i have like 25 wins and didn't notice this.  definitely seen my share of hackers though flying around at super speed.  ive seen fall mountain a lot more since the tail tag finale rate got nerfed.
        You can also tell which of the last doors is the real one on the flyover preview. When it shows the back of the doors the real one will be shorter than the other 2
            You guys are changing everything I thought I knew about this game lmao
                Getting good is all well and rewarding but it slowly begins sucking the fun out of the game. Party games like this I strongly suggest avoiding tips and tricks because the adage is true "Players will optimize the fun out of a game."

Except for the final round. I do recommend try harding then because everyone is gunning for the victory.
            *furiously scribbles down notes*
    Also, dive into people at a certain distance, both of you will gain a boost since you push the person and you bonk your head and land upright.

So if you have a friend, you can assist one another and travel faster, tho not as much as bhopping. Takes a bit of practice though and it is only worth it on level ground.
        Shake and bake!
    Got my first hacker yesterday.  They could fly and move super fast.  The one map with the teeter totters the whooooole way was bullshit with them. They got to a point where theres one teeter totter everyone has to use to proceed further and then they lowered that teeter all the way so that it was basically standing straight up, while also flying so that it cant move back to a flat position at all. They stayed that way for 30 seconds, literally not a single person could proceed.   They eventually moved and proceeded through several rounds like jump through hoops, but they just flew through every hoop super fast.   

The final round was the one where the floor disappears when you step on it, and its multiple levels and at the bottom is slime.  They won because they could fly above while everyone else could only fall into the slime
        Yeah if you see a cheater you may just want to quit cause they‚Äôll win every time.
            Or pray that there is a team game and the cheater is in your team so you can sabotage him. Not ideal but at least you have a shot to screw them.
    Oh boy final round! Oh it's the stupid fucking tail thing. Fantastic
    Alright, then give me the winning strategy for the jinxed game mode please
        Just don't get jinxed.
    Imo the RNG makes it fun. Gives everyone a chance. They really should fix those arrows people mention.
You can tell the last three doors based on the arrow in the middle behind the door teeth. The smaller arrow is the correct door.
I think before the clip begins, the fruits of each platform randomly flash for a while, and you have to remember them
    Thank you for this as I was in same boat as u/foopidiescoop07
    Yup... it's a memory based round. Some find it easy, some can't be bothered to try.
        I hate that level because it's too easy. On average 0 to 3 people get eliminated when I play. It's always a wasted round when I play it.
            I used to hate it but now it's one of my favorites because of people like OP

I'm terrible at it and when I mass die for following, I genuinely find it hilarious to be eliminated
                The fact it's so easy makes when everyone fails all the more amazing
                    I find it challenging because I can't keep track of all the variables while people are also moving around
                        If there was one more fruit in the final round to track I think wed see a lot more fails
            Exactly, it should speed up significantly towards the end. Right now its baby's first matching game.
            I've never seen 0. You probably just don't see them ejected because they quit before that screen. Most games I push at least 1 on off. Makes it more entertaining
    Oh ok, thx. I have never played it that is why I asked lol.
    [deleted]
        Not all fruits flash up at the same time, it shows you a random percentage of the tiles every other second or so. Sure, you can take multiple screenshots, but at that point you might as well just use a sheet of paper to mark notes. Again, this round is usually very easy with only 1-3 people being eliminated, which is why something like this is so funny
        The entire grid does not flash, it flashes about 4-5 times with different tiles being shown each time (tiles will be shown more than once too). In theory you could take multiple screenshots but you have very little time between the last flash of the fruit and the platforms dropping. For me it's easier to just memorize one spot per fruit.
        Takes the fun out
    How do so many people fall for this then?

Is no one watching?
You see, the titles flash color showing you which tile is what fruit. Afterwards it stops, then a random fruit comes on the screen. Then you have the choose the correct fruit.
It flashes for 10 seconds so you can see what kind of fruits are there, then the last flash before the timer ends is the one it sticks on. A good tip is to stand near a corner and pan your view across all the squares. I keep 3 fruits in mind and then if it flashes a different of those 3 all I had to do was remember which tile was different looking from the 3 and follow the masses (for the most part).

I play this level too much.
People follow the crowd. It‚Äôs a literal survival skill.
    If all your friends jumped off a bridge...
        My dude, i'm the one jumping off first
            That's because you're a leader, a winner, a man (or woman) out in front of the world.  A trailblazer.  A go-getter.  I see real potential in you, son.
                This is a confusingly wholesome spin on front-running a suicide movement.
                    Look, if *everyone* is jumping, I expect the bridge is on fire.

        But if the bridge is more dangerous than the jump...
        Then there's probably a T-Rex about to snatch ya from behind. Best jump, my man! Hope for the best!
    Which is regularly exploited by top level sociopaths in positions of authority. Or in this case, OP.
        OP 2020
    Or in this case, the opposite of that.
        ‚ÄúCivilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them."

That used to mean eating a new food after your cave buddy to know if it would kill you, now its jumping on squares using electronics that are too complex for any one person to fully understand. How far we have come while so many stand still is truly astounding.
    I can‚Äôt find the link but there was a construction or maintenance guy who posted on Reddit within the last month about how he was wearing a hard hat and uniform at work when he realized he was either late for something or just generally needed to get somewhere else in a hurry.

He started jogging/running toward his car and apparently started a mini panic of people thinking there was a problem he was running away from. That must have been a scene to be a part of.
    Yup you can see some players second-guessing their choice here even thought they were headed for the right tile lol
I forget which fruits are where almost immediately, most of the time when I stand alone I just go towards the pack
    I stopped even watching the tiles and just follow where most people are going.
    You‚Äôre like that cougar with his toy under the switched bucket
So many people probably play this wasted and dont even look at the tiles after the 2nd round.
    Considering the general skill level in the game is basically that of an ape I'd say that's hopefully true.
    Can confirm, my wife loves playing this when she has a few drinks. Only difference is she can‚Äôt even make it past the first round.
> There were three watermelon blocks.

Not only that, but half the group went to a ***completely different*** wrong square.

I haven't played Fall Guys (only seen some people stream it), so I don't know if it has some sort of MMR-based matchmaking, but that almost has to be the case here, right? This has to be a group of players not very familiar with the game yet.
    That particular minigame is boring enough that you can just kinda zone out and not pay attention at all, but follow the crowd and you'll get through every single time (unless someone next level like OP messes with everyone).
        Well yeah, sure, and I understand that, but that still doesn't explain why ***half of the group*** fell because they went to a completely different wrong square.
            looks like it was a perfect storm based on the fruit positions. You can see that some people heading to OP's wrong square get blocked by people trying and failing to run for one of the CORRECT squares.
            Half the people aren't playing, they are just mindlessly going along with the crowd. They think that this one is boring (and if everyone tried all the time it would be boring). the thing is nearly everyone is following the crowd, they have to find the guy who does know whats going on, and if you are that guy you can trick a large portion of the people.
They saw that guy jump over with confidence/desperation and assumed he knew what he was doing
This is the only level that is hard to play when high.  Fuck remembering shit.
Not gonna speak for everyone, but when I play this level I usually can‚Äôt remember the tiles the second they go blank, try as I might. So it just becomes a mental game at that point ‚Äúwell everyone‚Äôs going to this tile, so I will to‚Äù and it honestly works 99% of the time. 

Unless you get tricked like in this video lmao
    I find that the secret is not turning your character too much. Keeping your fov in one direction makes it far easier to memorize the blocks around you and avoid confusion.
Last round flashes with 6 fruits so you gotta remember all 6 until the screen tells you which one is safe. I imagine most people try to memorize 3 or 4 closest to them and hope for the best
This minigame is so boring that a lot of people don't actually play it, they just follow the crowd because it works 99% of the time

epic meme my fellow redditor
It‚Äôs a lot of fun. I downloaded it on PSN during a promotional period when it was free, but regular price is only $20. The amount of fun you have is well worth it.
    Fun?  I don‚Äôt know if I experience fun or rage more when playing this game.
As others have said, it‚Äôs very fun. But it‚Äôs gets old FAST. I have like 10 hours into the game and I‚Äôm already pretty sick of it.
    I made it 6 hours. For the mini-games that I actually like, it is fun, but a lot of them are boring. I hate the team games too because I feel like it is luck of the draw whether or not my team is even capable of beating the other ones or not. I do not like the lack of self-determinism in those modes.

All of that to say - 6 hours in and I'm bored of it.
    I think if you just sit and play, it‚Äôll get old quick. But despite being non-split screen, it‚Äôs a great party game. If you don‚Äôt win you pass the controller, or you can put (small amounts) of money to bet whether or not someone will survive a round, etc.

The suuuuper simple controls as well as the funny animations make it enjoyable and playable  for literally all gamers/non-gamers.
Also is it compatible on Mac or is it another good game I‚Äôm missing out on
    Windows only according to Steam
    I play it on my Mac by using Bootcamp to boot into Windows. Apple actually made it incredibly easy to use Windows on your Mac. I had to buy a Windows key or course, but other than that it‚Äôs very painless. You basically just open the Bootcamp app and it walks through everything
        You also aren't going to be able to do this anymore on new Macs
            I have a 2020 MacBook Pro and I was able to do it fine.
                Same. He means the ones that haven‚Äôt come out yet though. Apple is about to make ARM Macs and Windows support for ARM is terrible/experimental.
THANK YOU! 

The last several years I‚Äôve been trying to think of Fuzion Frenzy and I couldn‚Äôt remember it for the life of me!
It's ok.  Pretty repetitive and it uses the Fortnite style of in app purchasing but it has a certain charm to it.  I find myself knocking out a few games when I'm bored.  Matches are really quick so it is a good time-filler.
    Not really. The battle pass is free and the Skins are not important; You can get better ones for free.
    >uses the Fortnite style of in app purchasing

Why is this a turn off for people? Optional cosmetics equal more dev time without me having to pay extra.
        When you come from an era where skins are included in the base price and unlocked thru in game achievements is a bit disheartening to pay for that kinda thing. I'd rather pay 50$ then 20$+ optional stuff
            99% of skins in Fall Guys are unlockable through playing the game. When you get good enough to consistently get to the final round you'll have plenty of coins to buy whatever skin suits your fancy.
I find it very fun, but I think the popularity is due less to the sheer amount of fun (even though it's high imo) and more due to how accessble it is. Both kids and intoxicated adults can play and enjoy it lol. Even when you lose, it just means you get to see your cute little jellybean man wipe out.
Plays like a Mario party game with strangers to me. (The feeling not the actual mini game)
Wow! Haven‚Äôt heard that name in awhile... great game
Oh man Transformice! The funnest flash game nobody's ever heard of.
Now that is a name I haven't heard in a long time
    I played the shit out of that game in its heyday. I loved being shaman, I was really good at both getting the mice to their destination and filtering out the impatient ones. Heh.

I played recently and the game has changed a **lot**, but there are still players.
Same. I would try to remember which tiles are which, but can't remember them. So I would just follow people.
    Try to just remember a row or something, recite it as it gets revealed, apple, banana, orange, grape.
        [deleted]
            Exactly.

But then you adjust. Noticing you've seen too many bananas and cherries, you start spinning around trying to find the elusive trick fruit in this diabolical minigame. With a second left before the reveal you see grape flash in the back corner, and you know you've found salvation.

It's about to go down.

You're running to the final oasis; you look up to confirm your deduction, satisfaction saturating your face; there's a flash...

Cherry.

"Fuck."
    I can handle to round 2 perfectly well, then in round three its just so many and its so random which tile lights up when... it just drives me nuts and i always resort to the sheep method: just go where the majority goes xD
        In stage 2 I always do a square of fruits and say them loudly to remember them, but on the third stage there are 6 fruits and is imposible to do it for me :c
    What if I told you, you could have a piece of paper and a pen next to you while you play?
        That is preposterous!
Fall guys brings out the worst in people lol "childrens game" pssh
    God imagine if fall guys had voice coms.
Gotta get them crowns yo.

    Honestly that sounds great considering what they did to Super Mario Party. The mini-games are great but almost everything else is botched. It‚Äôs so close but so far.
Yes and no. 

It's a battle royale of mini games. 

Each game starts with 60 people and you play different mini games depending on how many people are left, until one person remains.
yes
Can be fun, but pretty anxiety-inducing. Controls are purposefully a bit sloppy, and there's a lot of randomness in some of the levels, which can be frustrating as hell. Probably more fun on drugs.
    This game is amazing with some mates while being a lil drunk
Not much fun I played for 2 hours and wish I never bought it. But yeah like the other dude said it‚Äôs like 10 random Mario party games over and over and over.

You can‚Äôt talk. It‚Äôs cute if you had a nephew or kids at home.
    Thank you so much for this, definitely not going to buy.
Or just needlessly mean. Like those guys that stand at the finish line of race levels and just grab random people to try to keep them from qualifying. Pure, senseless evil.
There are 10 seconds before where the blocks on the ground randomly appear and show you what is there. It's a memory game.
    What I do not understand is why many people fell for it
        From what I've seen, a lot of people assume everyone else will know the answer, so there's no need for them to remember which is which. ***Usually*** no one is ***trying*** to lose, so following the crowd would give you the correct answer more often than not.
        Herd Mentality is a hell of a drug
        It's hard to remember all the spaces. Most likely people remember one-ish of each fruit. a combination of the watermelon that they memorized being far away, questioning their own memory, and assuming the group can't be wrong probably led to this.
The level gives everyone a few seconds to try to see some of the tiles, it's a memorization game.
I think they‚Äôre playing fall guys.
"I am so smart, s-m-r-t!"
e
Good one lmao
This is going down in history.
The tiles blink fruits, then they disappear and one fruit shows up on the side screens. You have to remember which tiles had that fruit, because the other ones all disappear and you fall and lose.
Y is this getting downvoted? Fall guys is only available on a handful of systems
They weren‚Äôt paying attention so they just followed
l
y
Yup. For about ten seconds they flash different tiles so you can memorize which are which. Then it gives a pause and then flashes t type of fruit to stand on. Theoretically you should always be able to know where to go but a lot of players don‚Äôt bother and just follow the crowd.
yes they show whats underneath for a short while before the reveal
Jump then square (PS4) or x(?)(Xbox)
It‚Äôs a memory mini game inside of fall guys, basically it takes turns showing you some of the fruits on the floor tiles, it goes blank after a few seconds and then the big screen randomly picks one of the fruits. You have to hurry to one of the correct floor tiles before the rest of the floor disappears and it gets difficult after a while if a certain amount of people are still in the rounds.
They all flash a fruit, then a fruit flashes on screen. You gotta remember which tile is the right fruit and jump on it.

    Knowing nothing about fall guy, how did he know which was the watermelon square to switch to?
        The different fruits flash on the squares a few times before it shows you which one you need to stand on, so you have to memorize which fruits are on what tiles.
            Ah. Thanks. Have a great day.
Looks like they‚Äôre the last two, do they go head to head next?
    You can see more in bottom right
        Oh right. I wonder at what point the game does the final round, which is the race for the crown I think? Would have been interesting 1 on 1.
            There's a couple different games they'll randomly throw at you for the finale. The crown, the spinny one like from the show Whipeout, tail grab, and Hex-a-gone. Not sure if there are any others... 

In my experience they're all significantly more challenging with less people going into it.
                It seems like the rounds are weighted. There are certain rounds that I definitely see more than others.
                    100%, I only got the tail ending once (not complaining since I don't like any of the tail mods), the jumping one does come from time to time, but the hexagon one and the crown race definitely come more often. 

I belive that the tail end doesn't have any chance to come if you already had one of the other 2 tail modes in that match, the same thing aplies to the jumping end who also has a normal mode.

I also think that the number of players alive matter in the decision.
                        I'm pretty sure number of players is the main deciding factor. My experience is that 5 or fewer goes to Royal Fumble, 6-10 is Hexagone, 8-12 is Fall Mountain, and 12-15 is Jump Showdown. 
I'm sure that's not exactly right but it seems pretty consistent so far.
                            I‚Äôve seen some crowded hexes, and some 6 or 7 person fall mountains. So the ranges definitely overlap a bit but players remaining definitely changes the odds
                            Sounds fine to me, sometimes the game only goes to round 4 and we get a 19 person hexagone lol
            I've seen multiple final round maps, and I know that the game does end early if everyone gets eliminated, saw a clip of someone actually jebating everyone on this level and it going to the crown screen.
            When there's low enough players it can initiate the final round.

Early in the release I had a game where the first round was Slime Climb and it [eliminated all but 3 players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2AMK7Ol9NI&t=23s). Second round was the finale.
                Lmao was that last guy purposely trying to get hit by every single obstacle?
                That fucking ending though... Grats
                This still aplies, happened to me this weekend while I was playing with my little cousin, first round was Slime Climb and only 6 of us made it so we went to the final on round 2.
            There are 4 possible final rounds. Fall Mountain, Hex-a-Gone, Jump Showdown, and Royal Fumble. The game goes in to the final round either after a certain number of rounds or earlier if the player count gets low. When it is four players, it's almost always Royal Fumble
            There are several different final rounds, but it seems to go for it at some point under 15 people left. I've seen it do the final round when it got down to 15 people, but I find it usually waits until there are less than 10.
            Most for last round is 20 but very rare. You can have as few as 3 or as many as 6 rounds. It's all based on probabilities. I think the algorithm is reasonably complex. Although they definately increased the amount of tiptoe recently, get it almost every time.

There are a few final rounds. At least 4 i can think of right now.

Considering picking up this game today. Is it as fun as it looks? Lol

Update: to everyone whom replied thank you <3. I bought it
    You'll hate every minute of it and not put it down.
        I got it last night before it expired, holy shit it is so hard. I was eliminated my first 10 games.
            [deleted]
                [deleted]
                    It‚Äôs mostly just learning basic level strategy and some timing. Give it a week of playing and you‚Äôll be moderately good, which means still sometimes getting eliminated in the first round or two with some bad luck, but also making it to the final round with decent frequency.

There are a lot of little tricks you can learn for many of the levels, but the controls aren‚Äôt complex or tight enough for the skill gap between great players and decent players to be even close to insurmountable. 

It just feels like that for the first couple of days.
                        except on team games. fuck team games
                    Different skill levels out there. On average, only 1 person in 60 wins each round.  Then depending on skill you're gong to have some people beating those odds by quite a bit, and some people probably never winning.  The beauty is the game is fun even when you lose.
                Dude I won on my 3rd and 4th shows... I thought this was going to be a super simple game. That was like weeks ago. I have yet to win since and I‚Äôve probably played 100 times!
                >I was actually kind of proud lol.

I'm 34 y/o. When I won my first (and only) show (so far) I took my girlfriend to dinner to celebrate.

It's awesome to enjoy the good times, even for the tiniest of things
            Is it not on PS+ or whatever it's called anymore?
                It‚Äôs available for PS+ subscribers for free until September 4th, when the new PS+ games for the month transition.
                    It's gone. The PS+ games update the first Tuesday of every month, which is today.
                        Oh shit, I wish I knew. Actually, it's probably worse that you told me, now I'll never buy it knowing I could have had it for free lol.
                            same just found out that it was on there with this comment, I also cannot purchase this game now
            Expired? The game was deleted or something?

            Gotta dive instead of jump to the next one. Character gets up right away no matter the angle or distance he falls
            Dude that's my favorite. It's always fun
        This sums up every game I play.
        Nah, you'll only hate it the exact moment right before you see Eliminated. Every other moment is quite enjoyable.
    It's frustrating sometimes, but fun.
    [deleted]
    It's fun for a time. After you've played for a while it gets boring unless you're into highly repetitive stuff or you are determined to get very good. I played yesterday and for 5 games, 15 levels, I played the same 2 levels maybe 70% of the time. And it was always repetitive level 1, repetitive lvl 2, something different. For 20 bucks it's probably worth it. Its good to pick up for 30 minutes and genuinely be ok with putting it down after.

But it his the same annoyance that fortnight has for me. You'll always be losing. Most of the games you'll lose. And a good portion of that time the losing will be semi random, like someone bumped into you, or you got your timing slightly off. You're probably not gonna look back and say "Oh wow I'm on fire today". You'll say "I lost less than usual".
    I played two rounds and lost interest.  It's not for everyone.  Give it a shot though.
    IMO, not really, but you may find you enjoy it. Only one way to find out.

        It‚Äôs $20 on pc

                If you have PS4 basic, don't get it unless you're ok with like a second of input lag.
                    Fucking hell you mean not everyone has to deal with that? I thought that was just how the game worked.
                        I switched from my PS4 to PC and the input lag dropped to almost nothing.

Slime Climb and Tail Tag became so much more playable for me.
                            Is that why I can't do Tail Tag?  I feel like I'm bumping into the other bean and not getting his tail, but the guy following 3 feet behind me somehow snatches mine.
                        You playing on a 4k TV? Oddly enough, that was my wife's problem. Switched her to a 1080 HD and her input delay dropped CONSIDERABLY.
                            It depends on how good the latency is on game mode.. My 4k TV has like 18ms which is pretty standard on good tvs
                        I have a standard ps4 and a ps4 pro on a 4k TV.

I can confirm that there is serious input lag on the base ps4 as well as the frame rate only being 30fps vs the ps4Pro's 60fps.

The game is extremely responsive and quick on the pro, but almost unplayable on the base PS4.

If you don't have a Pro or PC, don't get the game. You will be at a significant disadvantage.
                    I've seen on Twitter that it's server side. They've been having issues with servers, weren't expecting this big of a launch. Yes they worked a deal for it to be free but they weren't expecting it to become the new hottest game
Oof
    Haha not trying to be rude, I had the same problems when I first picked up the game.
        All good, I got you. I'll get there.  If I can beat Dark Souls, I can win at Fall Guys.... right?   RIGHT????
            Depends, did you use a shield and two phantoms the whole time?
                I use a shield yeh.  First time I beat without summons because I was too scared of getting invaded.  Now I play "human" as much as possible for that good Jolly Cooperation!
Not only is this true, but the same 5 people always end up in the finale.


By the time you do get to the last stage you have to be better than someone who has been playing hex a gone or fall mountain 20 times in a row.

Its so difficult because you're playing against people with more experience than you.
    > Not only is this true, but the same 5 people always end up in the finale.

I mean if you are decent at platformers it is really easy to get to the final round if you don't get screwed in a team game.
For the past few days I've been getting only the same few games for round 3 and four. 

Haven't seen a Hoarders in a week.
It's funny. I've found I can keep 5 of the fruits in my head but if I try to memorize all 6 I get confused.
    The fuck is a watermelon?
    >!CENSORED!<
    Same thats why im always on banana so i dont have to even think about it
I initially thought the same thing, but I believe the "eliminated" count after every game is deceptive because I don't think it includes any players who have already disconnected. So it could show only 1 player being "eliminated" even though 5 others were already killed and disconnected from the server.
    That's true but for perfect match you can literally watch only 2-3 ppl fall off most of the time
        yeah, it's a me
See, I find that one quite difficult. My brain absolutely refuses to work that way and it's infuriating! See Saw is more my speed lol
Super hate that game. Not only is memorization not very fun in a fast-paced platformer, it's too easy to just watch everyone else unless someone manages to pull something like the OP gif. I've had too many games where no one gets eliminated at all. 

It's just stressful without being fun. I think they should drop it entirely.
You will love slime climb once you can do it consistently. So many people fail it, it's an easy ride like the roller one.
    Slime climb is the best because it is almost entirely up to your personal skill minus the potential unlucky bump.
        So many people can't get past the cylinder bridges, it's a great elimination game because it takes the player count from 30 to 6.
    The only one I have a problem with rn is Fall Ball. I can't win consistently it feels like a coinflip every time but even worse than other team games because it's a 50% coinflip instead of a 25% or 33%. Idk if I'm just bad or it's legitimately coinflip.
        I've never once won fall ball and I've always been on the yellow team. I can't seem to actually hit the ball and send it a considerable distance because it always looks like it glitches and kinda sticks to my character. What am I doing wrong?
Same here, but that's cos I'm fat
Yeah slime climb has a couple tricky spots. Took me a few times to lock it down. Patience is key.
I've started to push off people who don't seem to be paying attention. Has made it a lot more fun.
> the fake doors on the last three rows have a larger red triangle at the bottom

oh shit i have like 25 wins and didn't notice this.  definitely seen my share of hackers though flying around at super speed.  ive seen fall mountain a lot more since the tail tag finale rate got nerfed.
    You can also tell which of the last doors is the real one on the flyover preview. When it shows the back of the doors the real one will be shorter than the other 2
        You guys are changing everything I thought I knew about this game lmao
            Getting good is all well and rewarding but it slowly begins sucking the fun out of the game. Party games like this I strongly suggest avoiding tips and tricks because the adage is true "Players will optimize the fun out of a game."

Except for the final round. I do recommend try harding then because everyone is gunning for the victory.
        *furiously scribbles down notes*
Also, dive into people at a certain distance, both of you will gain a boost since you push the person and you bonk your head and land upright.

So if you have a friend, you can assist one another and travel faster, tho not as much as bhopping. Takes a bit of practice though and it is only worth it on level ground.
    Shake and bake!
Got my first hacker yesterday.  They could fly and move super fast.  The one map with the teeter totters the whooooole way was bullshit with them. They got to a point where theres one teeter totter everyone has to use to proceed further and then they lowered that teeter all the way so that it was basically standing straight up, while also flying so that it cant move back to a flat position at all. They stayed that way for 30 seconds, literally not a single person could proceed.   They eventually moved and proceeded through several rounds like jump through hoops, but they just flew through every hoop super fast.   

The final round was the one where the floor disappears when you step on it, and its multiple levels and at the bottom is slime.  They won because they could fly above while everyone else could only fall into the slime
    Yeah if you see a cheater you may just want to quit cause they‚Äôll win every time.
        Or pray that there is a team game and the cheater is in your team so you can sabotage him. Not ideal but at least you have a shot to screw them.
Oh boy final round! Oh it's the stupid fucking tail thing. Fantastic
Alright, then give me the winning strategy for the jinxed game mode please
    Just don't get jinxed.
Imo the RNG makes it fun. Gives everyone a chance. They really should fix those arrows people mention.
Thank you for this as I was in same boat as u/foopidiescoop07
Yup... it's a memory based round. Some find it easy, some can't be bothered to try.
    I hate that level because it's too easy. On average 0 to 3 people get eliminated when I play. It's always a wasted round when I play it.
        I used to hate it but now it's one of my favorites because of people like OP

I'm terrible at it and when I mass die for following, I genuinely find it hilarious to be eliminated
            The fact it's so easy makes when everyone fails all the more amazing
                I find it challenging because I can't keep track of all the variables while people are also moving around
                    If there was one more fruit in the final round to track I think wed see a lot more fails
        Exactly, it should speed up significantly towards the end. Right now its baby's first matching game.
        I've never seen 0. You probably just don't see them ejected because they quit before that screen. Most games I push at least 1 on off. Makes it more entertaining
Oh ok, thx. I have never played it that is why I asked lol.
[deleted]
    Not all fruits flash up at the same time, it shows you a random percentage of the tiles every other second or so. Sure, you can take multiple screenshots, but at that point you might as well just use a sheet of paper to mark notes. Again, this round is usually very easy with only 1-3 people being eliminated, which is why something like this is so funny
    The entire grid does not flash, it flashes about 4-5 times with different tiles being shown each time (tiles will be shown more than once too). In theory you could take multiple screenshots but you have very little time between the last flash of the fruit and the platforms dropping. For me it's easier to just memorize one spot per fruit.
    Takes the fun out
How do so many people fall for this then?

Is no one watching?
If all your friends jumped off a bridge...
    My dude, i'm the one jumping off first
        That's because you're a leader, a winner, a man (or woman) out in front of the world.  A trailblazer.  A go-getter.  I see real potential in you, son.
            This is a confusingly wholesome spin on front-running a suicide movement.
                Look, if *everyone* is jumping, I expect the bridge is on fire.

    Then there's probably a T-Rex about to snatch ya from behind. Best jump, my man! Hope for the best!

    ‚ÄúCivilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them."

That used to mean eating a new food after your cave buddy to know if it would kill you, now its jumping on squares using electronics that are too complex for any one person to fully understand. How far we have come while so many stand still is truly astounding.
I can‚Äôt find the link but there was a construction or maintenance guy who posted on Reddit within the last month about how he was wearing a hard hat and uniform at work when he realized he was either late for something or just generally needed to get somewhere else in a hurry.

He started jogging/running toward his car and apparently started a mini panic of people thinking there was a problem he was running away from. That must have been a scene to be a part of.
Yup you can see some players second-guessing their choice here even thought they were headed for the right tile lol
I stopped even watching the tiles and just follow where most people are going.
You‚Äôre like that cougar with his toy under the switched bucket
Considering the general skill level in the game is basically that of an ape I'd say that's hopefully true.
Can confirm, my wife loves playing this when she has a few drinks. Only difference is she can‚Äôt even make it past the first round.
That particular minigame is boring enough that you can just kinda zone out and not pay attention at all, but follow the crowd and you'll get through every single time (unless someone next level like OP messes with everyone).
    Well yeah, sure, and I understand that, but that still doesn't explain why ***half of the group*** fell because they went to a completely different wrong square.
        looks like it was a perfect storm based on the fruit positions. You can see that some people heading to OP's wrong square get blocked by people trying and failing to run for one of the CORRECT squares.
        Half the people aren't playing, they are just mindlessly going along with the crowd. They think that this one is boring (and if everyone tried all the time it would be boring). the thing is nearly everyone is following the crowd, they have to find the guy who does know whats going on, and if you are that guy you can trick a large portion of the people.
I find that the secret is not turning your character too much. Keeping your fov in one direction makes it far easier to memorize the blocks around you and avoid confusion.

Fun?  I don‚Äôt know if I experience fun or rage more when playing this game.
I made it 6 hours. For the mini-games that I actually like, it is fun, but a lot of them are boring. I hate the team games too because I feel like it is luck of the draw whether or not my team is even capable of beating the other ones or not. I do not like the lack of self-determinism in those modes.

All of that to say - 6 hours in and I'm bored of it.
I think if you just sit and play, it‚Äôll get old quick. But despite being non-split screen, it‚Äôs a great party game. If you don‚Äôt win you pass the controller, or you can put (small amounts) of money to bet whether or not someone will survive a round, etc.

The suuuuper simple controls as well as the funny animations make it enjoyable and playable  for literally all gamers/non-gamers.
Windows only according to Steam
I play it on my Mac by using Bootcamp to boot into Windows. Apple actually made it incredibly easy to use Windows on your Mac. I had to buy a Windows key or course, but other than that it‚Äôs very painless. You basically just open the Bootcamp app and it walks through everything
    You also aren't going to be able to do this anymore on new Macs
        I have a 2020 MacBook Pro and I was able to do it fine.
            Same. He means the ones that haven‚Äôt come out yet though. Apple is about to make ARM Macs and Windows support for ARM is terrible/experimental.
Not really. The battle pass is free and the Skins are not important; You can get better ones for free.
>uses the Fortnite style of in app purchasing

Why is this a turn off for people? Optional cosmetics equal more dev time without me having to pay extra.
    When you come from an era where skins are included in the base price and unlocked thru in game achievements is a bit disheartening to pay for that kinda thing. I'd rather pay 50$ then 20$+ optional stuff
        99% of skins in Fall Guys are unlockable through playing the game. When you get good enough to consistently get to the final round you'll have plenty of coins to buy whatever skin suits your fancy.
I played the shit out of that game in its heyday. I loved being shaman, I was really good at both getting the mice to their destination and filtering out the impatient ones. Heh.

I played recently and the game has changed a **lot**, but there are still players.
Try to just remember a row or something, recite it as it gets revealed, apple, banana, orange, grape.
    [deleted]
        Exactly.

But then you adjust. Noticing you've seen too many bananas and cherries, you start spinning around trying to find the elusive trick fruit in this diabolical minigame. With a second left before the reveal you see grape flash in the back corner, and you know you've found salvation.

It's about to go down.

You're running to the final oasis; you look up to confirm your deduction, satisfaction saturating your face; there's a flash...

Cherry.

"Fuck."
I can handle to round 2 perfectly well, then in round three its just so many and its so random which tile lights up when... it just drives me nuts and i always resort to the sheep method: just go where the majority goes xD
    In stage 2 I always do a square of fruits and say them loudly to remember them, but on the third stage there are 6 fruits and is imposible to do it for me :c
What if I told you, you could have a piece of paper and a pen next to you while you play?
    That is preposterous!

What I do not understand is why many people fell for it
    From what I've seen, a lot of people assume everyone else will know the answer, so there's no need for them to remember which is which. ***Usually*** no one is ***trying*** to lose, so following the crowd would give you the correct answer more often than not.

    It's hard to remember all the spaces. Most likely people remember one-ish of each fruit. a combination of the watermelon that they memorized being far away, questioning their own memory, and assuming the group can't be wrong probably led to this.

Looking forward to that Dune trailer
Knowing nothing about fall guy, how did he know which was the watermelon square to switch to?
    The different fruits flash on the squares a few times before it shows you which one you need to stand on, so you have to memorize which fruits are on what tiles.
        Ah. Thanks. Have a great day.
You can see more in bottom right
    Oh right. I wonder at what point the game does the final round, which is the race for the crown I think? Would have been interesting 1 on 1.
        There's a couple different games they'll randomly throw at you for the finale. The crown, the spinny one like from the show Whipeout, tail grab, and Hex-a-gone. Not sure if there are any others... 

In my experience they're all significantly more challenging with less people going into it.
            It seems like the rounds are weighted. There are certain rounds that I definitely see more than others.
                100%, I only got the tail ending once (not complaining since I don't like any of the tail mods), the jumping one does come from time to time, but the hexagon one and the crown race definitely come more often. 

I belive that the tail end doesn't have any chance to come if you already had one of the other 2 tail modes in that match, the same thing aplies to the jumping end who also has a normal mode.

I also think that the number of players alive matter in the decision.
                    I'm pretty sure number of players is the main deciding factor. My experience is that 5 or fewer goes to Royal Fumble, 6-10 is Hexagone, 8-12 is Fall Mountain, and 12-15 is Jump Showdown. 
I'm sure that's not exactly right but it seems pretty consistent so far.
                        I‚Äôve seen some crowded hexes, and some 6 or 7 person fall mountains. So the ranges definitely overlap a bit but players remaining definitely changes the odds
                        Sounds fine to me, sometimes the game only goes to round 4 and we get a 19 person hexagone lol
        I've seen multiple final round maps, and I know that the game does end early if everyone gets eliminated, saw a clip of someone actually jebating everyone on this level and it going to the crown screen.
        When there's low enough players it can initiate the final round.

Early in the release I had a game where the first round was Slime Climb and it [eliminated all but 3 players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2AMK7Ol9NI&t=23s). Second round was the finale.
            Lmao was that last guy purposely trying to get hit by every single obstacle?
            That fucking ending though... Grats
            This still aplies, happened to me this weekend while I was playing with my little cousin, first round was Slime Climb and only 6 of us made it so we went to the final on round 2.
        There are 4 possible final rounds. Fall Mountain, Hex-a-Gone, Jump Showdown, and Royal Fumble. The game goes in to the final round either after a certain number of rounds or earlier if the player count gets low. When it is four players, it's almost always Royal Fumble
        There are several different final rounds, but it seems to go for it at some point under 15 people left. I've seen it do the final round when it got down to 15 people, but I find it usually waits until there are less than 10.
        Most for last round is 20 but very rare. You can have as few as 3 or as many as 6 rounds. It's all based on probabilities. I think the algorithm is reasonably complex. Although they definately increased the amount of tiptoe recently, get it almost every time.

There are a few final rounds. At least 4 i can think of right now.

                It‚Äôs mostly just learning basic level strategy and some timing. Give it a week of playing and you‚Äôll be moderately good, which means still sometimes getting eliminated in the first round or two with some bad luck, but also making it to the final round with decent frequency.

There are a lot of little tricks you can learn for many of the levels, but the controls aren‚Äôt complex or tight enough for the skill gap between great players and decent players to be even close to insurmountable. 

It just feels like that for the first couple of days.
                    except on team games. fuck team games
                Different skill levels out there. On average, only 1 person in 60 wins each round.  Then depending on skill you're gong to have some people beating those odds by quite a bit, and some people probably never winning.  The beauty is the game is fun even when you lose.
            Dude I won on my 3rd and 4th shows... I thought this was going to be a super simple game. That was like weeks ago. I have yet to win since and I‚Äôve probably played 100 times!
            >I was actually kind of proud lol.

I'm 34 y/o. When I won my first (and only) show (so far) I took my girlfriend to dinner to celebrate.

It's awesome to enjoy the good times, even for the tiniest of things

                It's gone. The PS+ games update the first Tuesday of every month, which is today.
                    Oh shit, I wish I knew. Actually, it's probably worse that you told me, now I'll never buy it knowing I could have had it for free lol.

    This sums up every game I play.
    Nah, you'll only hate it the exact moment right before you see Eliminated. Every other moment is quite enjoyable.
It's frustrating sometimes, but fun.
[deleted]
It's fun for a time. After you've played for a while it gets boring unless you're into highly repetitive stuff or you are determined to get very good. I played yesterday and for 5 games, 15 levels, I played the same 2 levels maybe 70% of the time. And it was always repetitive level 1, repetitive lvl 2, something different. For 20 bucks it's probably worth it. Its good to pick up for 30 minutes and genuinely be ok with putting it down after.

But it his the same annoyance that fortnight has for me. You'll always be losing. Most of the games you'll lose. And a good portion of that time the losing will be semi random, like someone bumped into you, or you got your timing slightly off. You're probably not gonna look back and say "Oh wow I'm on fire today". You'll say "I lost less than usual".
I played two rounds and lost interest.  It's not for everyone.  Give it a shot though.
IMO, not really, but you may find you enjoy it. Only one way to find out.

            If you have PS4 basic, don't get it unless you're ok with like a second of input lag.
                Fucking hell you mean not everyone has to deal with that? I thought that was just how the game worked.
                    I switched from my PS4 to PC and the input lag dropped to almost nothing.

Slime Climb and Tail Tag became so much more playable for me.
                        Is that why I can't do Tail Tag?  I feel like I'm bumping into the other bean and not getting his tail, but the guy following 3 feet behind me somehow snatches mine.
                    You playing on a 4k TV? Oddly enough, that was my wife's problem. Switched her to a 1080 HD and her input delay dropped CONSIDERABLY.
                        It depends on how good the latency is on game mode.. My 4k TV has like 18ms which is pretty standard on good tvs
                    I have a standard ps4 and a ps4 pro on a 4k TV.

I can confirm that there is serious input lag on the base ps4 as well as the frame rate only being 30fps vs the ps4Pro's 60fps.

The game is extremely responsive and quick on the pro, but almost unplayable on the base PS4.

If you don't have a Pro or PC, don't get the game. You will be at a significant disadvantage.
                I've seen on Twitter that it's server side. They've been having issues with servers, weren't expecting this big of a launch. Yes they worked a deal for it to be free but they weren't expecting it to become the new hottest game
Haha not trying to be rude, I had the same problems when I first picked up the game.
    All good, I got you. I'll get there.  If I can beat Dark Souls, I can win at Fall Guys.... right?   RIGHT????
        Depends, did you use a shield and two phantoms the whole time?
            I use a shield yeh.  First time I beat without summons because I was too scared of getting invaded.  Now I play "human" as much as possible for that good Jolly Cooperation!
> Not only is this true, but the same 5 people always end up in the finale.

I mean if you are decent at platformers it is really easy to get to the final round if you don't get screwed in a team game.
The fuck is a watermelon?
>!CENSORED!<
Same thats why im always on banana so i dont have to even think about it
That's true but for perfect match you can literally watch only 2-3 ppl fall off most of the time
    yeah, it's a me
Slime climb is the best because it is almost entirely up to your personal skill minus the potential unlucky bump.
    So many people can't get past the cylinder bridges, it's a great elimination game because it takes the player count from 30 to 6.
The only one I have a problem with rn is Fall Ball. I can't win consistently it feels like a coinflip every time but even worse than other team games because it's a 50% coinflip instead of a 25% or 33%. Idk if I'm just bad or it's legitimately coinflip.
    I've never once won fall ball and I've always been on the yellow team. I can't seem to actually hit the ball and send it a considerable distance because it always looks like it glitches and kinda sticks to my character. What am I doing wrong?
You can also tell which of the last doors is the real one on the flyover preview. When it shows the back of the doors the real one will be shorter than the other 2
    You guys are changing everything I thought I knew about this game lmao
        Getting good is all well and rewarding but it slowly begins sucking the fun out of the game. Party games like this I strongly suggest avoiding tips and tricks because the adage is true "Players will optimize the fun out of a game."

Except for the final round. I do recommend try harding then because everyone is gunning for the victory.
    *furiously scribbles down notes*
Shake and bake!
Yeah if you see a cheater you may just want to quit cause they‚Äôll win every time.
    Or pray that there is a team game and the cheater is in your team so you can sabotage him. Not ideal but at least you have a shot to screw them.
Just don't get jinxed.
I hate that level because it's too easy. On average 0 to 3 people get eliminated when I play. It's always a wasted round when I play it.
    I used to hate it but now it's one of my favorites because of people like OP

I'm terrible at it and when I mass die for following, I genuinely find it hilarious to be eliminated
        The fact it's so easy makes when everyone fails all the more amazing
            I find it challenging because I can't keep track of all the variables while people are also moving around
                If there was one more fruit in the final round to track I think wed see a lot more fails
    Exactly, it should speed up significantly towards the end. Right now its baby's first matching game.
    I've never seen 0. You probably just don't see them ejected because they quit before that screen. Most games I push at least 1 on off. Makes it more entertaining
Not all fruits flash up at the same time, it shows you a random percentage of the tiles every other second or so. Sure, you can take multiple screenshots, but at that point you might as well just use a sheet of paper to mark notes. Again, this round is usually very easy with only 1-3 people being eliminated, which is why something like this is so funny
The entire grid does not flash, it flashes about 4-5 times with different tiles being shown each time (tiles will be shown more than once too). In theory you could take multiple screenshots but you have very little time between the last flash of the fruit and the platforms dropping. For me it's easier to just memorize one spot per fruit.
Takes the fun out
My dude, i'm the one jumping off first
    That's because you're a leader, a winner, a man (or woman) out in front of the world.  A trailblazer.  A go-getter.  I see real potential in you, son.
        This is a confusingly wholesome spin on front-running a suicide movement.

OP 2020
‚ÄúCivilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them."

That used to mean eating a new food after your cave buddy to know if it would kill you, now its jumping on squares using electronics that are too complex for any one person to fully understand. How far we have come while so many stand still is truly astounding.
Well yeah, sure, and I understand that, but that still doesn't explain why ***half of the group*** fell because they went to a completely different wrong square.
    looks like it was a perfect storm based on the fruit positions. You can see that some people heading to OP's wrong square get blocked by people trying and failing to run for one of the CORRECT squares.
    Half the people aren't playing, they are just mindlessly going along with the crowd. They think that this one is boring (and if everyone tried all the time it would be boring). the thing is nearly everyone is following the crowd, they have to find the guy who does know whats going on, and if you are that guy you can trick a large portion of the people.

When you come from an era where skins are included in the base price and unlocked thru in game achievements is a bit disheartening to pay for that kinda thing. I'd rather pay 50$ then 20$+ optional stuff
    99% of skins in Fall Guys are unlockable through playing the game. When you get good enough to consistently get to the final round you'll have plenty of coins to buy whatever skin suits your fancy.
[deleted]
    Exactly.

But then you adjust. Noticing you've seen too many bananas and cherries, you start spinning around trying to find the elusive trick fruit in this diabolical minigame. With a second left before the reveal you see grape flash in the back corner, and you know you've found salvation.

It's about to go down.

You're running to the final oasis; you look up to confirm your deduction, satisfaction saturating your face; there's a flash...

From what I've seen, a lot of people assume everyone else will know the answer, so there's no need for them to remember which is which. ***Usually*** no one is ***trying*** to lose, so following the crowd would give you the correct answer more often than not.

It's hard to remember all the spaces. Most likely people remember one-ish of each fruit. a combination of the watermelon that they memorized being far away, questioning their own memory, and assuming the group can't be wrong probably led to this.

The different fruits flash on the squares a few times before it shows you which one you need to stand on, so you have to memorize which fruits are on what tiles.
    Ah. Thanks. Have a great day.
Oh right. I wonder at what point the game does the final round, which is the race for the crown I think? Would have been interesting 1 on 1.
    There's a couple different games they'll randomly throw at you for the finale. The crown, the spinny one like from the show Whipeout, tail grab, and Hex-a-gone. Not sure if there are any others... 

In my experience they're all significantly more challenging with less people going into it.
        It seems like the rounds are weighted. There are certain rounds that I definitely see more than others.
            100%, I only got the tail ending once (not complaining since I don't like any of the tail mods), the jumping one does come from time to time, but the hexagon one and the crown race definitely come more often. 

I belive that the tail end doesn't have any chance to come if you already had one of the other 2 tail modes in that match, the same thing aplies to the jumping end who also has a normal mode.

I also think that the number of players alive matter in the decision.
                I'm pretty sure number of players is the main deciding factor. My experience is that 5 or fewer goes to Royal Fumble, 6-10 is Hexagone, 8-12 is Fall Mountain, and 12-15 is Jump Showdown. 
I'm sure that's not exactly right but it seems pretty consistent so far.
                    I‚Äôve seen some crowded hexes, and some 6 or 7 person fall mountains. So the ranges definitely overlap a bit but players remaining definitely changes the odds
                    Sounds fine to me, sometimes the game only goes to round 4 and we get a 19 person hexagone lol
    I've seen multiple final round maps, and I know that the game does end early if everyone gets eliminated, saw a clip of someone actually jebating everyone on this level and it going to the crown screen.
    When there's low enough players it can initiate the final round.

Early in the release I had a game where the first round was Slime Climb and it [eliminated all but 3 players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2AMK7Ol9NI&t=23s). Second round was the finale.
        Lmao was that last guy purposely trying to get hit by every single obstacle?
        That fucking ending though... Grats
        This still aplies, happened to me this weekend while I was playing with my little cousin, first round was Slime Climb and only 6 of us made it so we went to the final on round 2.
    There are 4 possible final rounds. Fall Mountain, Hex-a-Gone, Jump Showdown, and Royal Fumble. The game goes in to the final round either after a certain number of rounds or earlier if the player count gets low. When it is four players, it's almost always Royal Fumble
    There are several different final rounds, but it seems to go for it at some point under 15 people left. I've seen it do the final round when it got down to 15 people, but I find it usually waits until there are less than 10.
    Most for last round is 20 but very rare. You can have as few as 3 or as many as 6 rounds. It's all based on probabilities. I think the algorithm is reasonably complex. Although they definately increased the amount of tiptoe recently, get it almost every time.

There are a few final rounds. At least 4 i can think of right now.
I wish you weren't so fucking awkward, bud.
    To be faihhh
        You're spare parts, aren't you bud

            It‚Äôs mostly just learning basic level strategy and some timing. Give it a week of playing and you‚Äôll be moderately good, which means still sometimes getting eliminated in the first round or two with some bad luck, but also making it to the final round with decent frequency.

There are a lot of little tricks you can learn for many of the levels, but the controls aren‚Äôt complex or tight enough for the skill gap between great players and decent players to be even close to insurmountable. 

It just feels like that for the first couple of days.
                except on team games. fuck team games
            Different skill levels out there. On average, only 1 person in 60 wins each round.  Then depending on skill you're gong to have some people beating those odds by quite a bit, and some people probably never winning.  The beauty is the game is fun even when you lose.
        Dude I won on my 3rd and 4th shows... I thought this was going to be a super simple game. That was like weeks ago. I have yet to win since and I‚Äôve probably played 100 times!
        >I was actually kind of proud lol.

I'm 34 y/o. When I won my first (and only) show (so far) I took my girlfriend to dinner to celebrate.

It's awesome to enjoy the good times, even for the tiniest of things
    Is it not on PS+ or whatever it's called anymore?
        It‚Äôs available for PS+ subscribers for free until September 4th, when the new PS+ games for the month transition.

                    same just found out that it was on there with this comment, I also cannot purchase this game now

    Dude that's my favorite. It's always fun
This sums up every game I play.
Nah, you'll only hate it the exact moment right before you see Eliminated. Every other moment is quite enjoyable.

        If you have PS4 basic, don't get it unless you're ok with like a second of input lag.
            Fucking hell you mean not everyone has to deal with that? I thought that was just how the game worked.
                I switched from my PS4 to PC and the input lag dropped to almost nothing.

Slime Climb and Tail Tag became so much more playable for me.
                    Is that why I can't do Tail Tag?  I feel like I'm bumping into the other bean and not getting his tail, but the guy following 3 feet behind me somehow snatches mine.
                You playing on a 4k TV? Oddly enough, that was my wife's problem. Switched her to a 1080 HD and her input delay dropped CONSIDERABLY.
                    It depends on how good the latency is on game mode.. My 4k TV has like 18ms which is pretty standard on good tvs
                I have a standard ps4 and a ps4 pro on a 4k TV.

I can confirm that there is serious input lag on the base ps4 as well as the frame rate only being 30fps vs the ps4Pro's 60fps.

The game is extremely responsive and quick on the pro, but almost unplayable on the base PS4.

If you don't have a Pro or PC, don't get the game. You will be at a significant disadvantage.
            I've seen on Twitter that it's server side. They've been having issues with servers, weren't expecting this big of a launch. Yes they worked a deal for it to be free but they weren't expecting it to become the new hottest game
All good, I got you. I'll get there.  If I can beat Dark Souls, I can win at Fall Guys.... right?   RIGHT????
    Depends, did you use a shield and two phantoms the whole time?
        I use a shield yeh.  First time I beat without summons because I was too scared of getting invaded.  Now I play "human" as much as possible for that good Jolly Cooperation!
yeah, it's a me
So many people can't get past the cylinder bridges, it's a great elimination game because it takes the player count from 30 to 6.
I've never once won fall ball and I've always been on the yellow team. I can't seem to actually hit the ball and send it a considerable distance because it always looks like it glitches and kinda sticks to my character. What am I doing wrong?
You guys are changing everything I thought I knew about this game lmao
    Getting good is all well and rewarding but it slowly begins sucking the fun out of the game. Party games like this I strongly suggest avoiding tips and tricks because the adage is true "Players will optimize the fun out of a game."

Except for the final round. I do recommend try harding then because everyone is gunning for the victory.
*furiously scribbles down notes*
Or pray that there is a team game and the cheater is in your team so you can sabotage him. Not ideal but at least you have a shot to screw them.
I used to hate it but now it's one of my favorites because of people like OP

I'm terrible at it and when I mass die for following, I genuinely find it hilarious to be eliminated
    The fact it's so easy makes when everyone fails all the more amazing
        I find it challenging because I can't keep track of all the variables while people are also moving around
            If there was one more fruit in the final round to track I think wed see a lot more fails
Exactly, it should speed up significantly towards the end. Right now its baby's first matching game.
I've never seen 0. You probably just don't see them ejected because they quit before that screen. Most games I push at least 1 on off. Makes it more entertaining
That's because you're a leader, a winner, a man (or woman) out in front of the world.  A trailblazer.  A go-getter.  I see real potential in you, son.
    This is a confusingly wholesome spin on front-running a suicide movement.

    W-wait for me!
looks like it was a perfect storm based on the fruit positions. You can see that some people heading to OP's wrong square get blocked by people trying and failing to run for one of the CORRECT squares.
Half the people aren't playing, they are just mindlessly going along with the crowd. They think that this one is boring (and if everyone tried all the time it would be boring). the thing is nearly everyone is following the crowd, they have to find the guy who does know whats going on, and if you are that guy you can trick a large portion of the people.
A,l,l, w,a,r,f,a,r,e, i,s, b,a,s,e,d, o,n, d,e,c,e,p,t,i,o,n,
I have a 2020 MacBook Pro and I was able to do it fine.
    Same. He means the ones that haven‚Äôt come out yet though. Apple is about to make ARM Macs and Windows support for ARM is terrible/experimental.
99% of skins in Fall Guys are unlockable through playing the game. When you get good enough to consistently get to the final round you'll have plenty of coins to buy whatever skin suits your fancy.
Exactly.

But then you adjust. Noticing you've seen too many bananas and cherries, you start spinning around trying to find the elusive trick fruit in this diabolical minigame. With a second left before the reveal you see grape flash in the back corner, and you know you've found salvation.

It's about to go down.

You're running to the final oasis; you look up to confirm your deduction, satisfaction saturating your face; there's a flash...

Cherry.

I belive that the tail end doesn't have any chance to come if you already had one of the other 2 tail modes in that match, the same thing aplies to the jumping end who also has a normal mode.

I also think that the number of players alive matter in the decision.
        I'm pretty sure number of players is the main deciding factor. My experience is that 5 or fewer goes to Royal Fumble, 6-10 is Hexagone, 8-12 is Fall Mountain, and 12-15 is Jump Showdown. 
I'm sure that's not exactly right but it seems pretty consistent so far.
            I‚Äôve seen some crowded hexes, and some 6 or 7 person fall mountains. So the ranges definitely overlap a bit but players remaining definitely changes the odds
            Sounds fine to me, sometimes the game only goes to round 4 and we get a 19 person hexagone lol
Lmao was that last guy purposely trying to get hit by every single obstacle?
That fucking ending though... Grats
This still aplies, happened to me this weekend while I was playing with my little cousin, first round was Slime Climb and only 6 of us made it so we went to the final on round 2.
You're spare parts, aren't you bud

    It‚Äôs mostly just learning basic level strategy and some timing. Give it a week of playing and you‚Äôll be moderately good, which means still sometimes getting eliminated in the first round or two with some bad luck, but also making it to the final round with decent frequency.

There are a lot of little tricks you can learn for many of the levels, but the controls aren‚Äôt complex or tight enough for the skill gap between great players and decent players to be even close to insurmountable. 

It just feels like that for the first couple of days.
        except on team games. fuck team games
    Different skill levels out there. On average, only 1 person in 60 wins each round.  Then depending on skill you're gong to have some people beating those odds by quite a bit, and some people probably never winning.  The beauty is the game is fun even when you lose.
Dude I won on my 3rd and 4th shows... I thought this was going to be a super simple game. That was like weeks ago. I have yet to win since and I‚Äôve probably played 100 times!
>I was actually kind of proud lol.

I'm 34 y/o. When I won my first (and only) show (so far) I took my girlfriend to dinner to celebrate.

It's awesome to enjoy the good times, even for the tiniest of things
It‚Äôs available for PS+ subscribers for free until September 4th, when the new PS+ games for the month transition.
    It's gone. The PS+ games update the first Tuesday of every month, which is today.
        Oh shit, I wish I knew. Actually, it's probably worse that you told me, now I'll never buy it knowing I could have had it for free lol.
            same just found out that it was on there with this comment, I also cannot purchase this game now

Must be nice
That‚Äôs the story of every race mode

Ah, so capitalism then.
    So it's treason then?
    A YouTuber I watch consistently makes capitalism metaphors when playing seesaw lol. ‚ÄúOkay now we‚Äôre getting our foot into the gig economy‚Äù lmao
If you have PS4 basic, don't get it unless you're ok with like a second of input lag.
    Fucking hell you mean not everyone has to deal with that? I thought that was just how the game worked.
        I switched from my PS4 to PC and the input lag dropped to almost nothing.

Slime Climb and Tail Tag became so much more playable for me.
            Is that why I can't do Tail Tag?  I feel like I'm bumping into the other bean and not getting his tail, but the guy following 3 feet behind me somehow snatches mine.
        You playing on a 4k TV? Oddly enough, that was my wife's problem. Switched her to a 1080 HD and her input delay dropped CONSIDERABLY.
            It depends on how good the latency is on game mode.. My 4k TV has like 18ms which is pretty standard on good tvs
        I have a standard ps4 and a ps4 pro on a 4k TV.

I can confirm that there is serious input lag on the base ps4 as well as the frame rate only being 30fps vs the ps4Pro's 60fps.

The game is extremely responsive and quick on the pro, but almost unplayable on the base PS4.

If you don't have a Pro or PC, don't get the game. You will be at a significant disadvantage.
    I've seen on Twitter that it's server side. They've been having issues with servers, weren't expecting this big of a launch. Yes they worked a deal for it to be free but they weren't expecting it to become the new hottest game
I use a shield yeh.  First time I beat without summons because I was too scared of getting invaded.  Now I play "human" as much as possible for that good Jolly Cooperation!
I find it challenging because I can't keep track of all the variables while people are also moving around
    If there was one more fruit in the final round to track I think wed see a lot more fails
Look, if *everyone* is jumping, I expect the bridge is on fire.
Will do.  Just need to go get cigarettes first.

That's still going strong(ish) you can check out the sub to see recent posts.

Holy shit, I remember taking like an hour to get to the end of that train, I wonder if it's even possible now
    Maybe we'll see r/spacedicks on the journey
Oh I do miss a good hold my *[insert humorous object]* I‚Äôm going in
It's the small phases that I find neat. Like how people made a subreddit of anger when people said

"edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger"

That was practically rettiquete for a bit then dissapeared.
Reditaroo works best if its every now and then over a long period of time.
Oh I 'member!
If all of the unexpected subs could die that would be great. Mmkay?
