[[Stopped by my grandparents house today, and they where both playing Skyrim at the same time.]]





if this isn‚Äôt me and my bf in forty years i don‚Äôt want it
    Same here! ...i've been playing video games like over......30 fn years o\_O....and im under 40.
        Same! Mod thirties for the win!
            > Mod thirties

Thats when they added the extra jiggle physics that just make everything look saggy.

It also adds extra dialogue to every conversation where you can talk about some random pain in your body ... Except your knee
            37 here baby cakeses and I have no intention of stopping. Playstation 78 and Xbox 1080p here we come! Also Nintendo Fold because they've went back to duel screens and couldn't come up with a better name lol.
                LMAO, yeah, but I went PC years ago and I'm never looking back.
                The Xbox 1080p has already released, it‚Äôs called the Series S lol
            I feel like granny allready ....old gamer granny. With my old gamer bf grandpa....
                That should be a hubby soon
                When my grandmother became a grandmother she was 5 years younger than I am right now.
            Try again. I'm 62 and have been playing video games since Pong. I remember buying an Atari when it came out and played Asteroids endlessly. However long I live, they'll likely find me with a controller in my hand.
        If my maths is correct. You are between 30 and 39
            Just turned 36
                [deleted]
                    If it would have been any closer, it would have been like an arrow to the knee
            if you have to say 'maths' (and you shouldn't) at least keep the plural going and use 'are' :P
                America moment.
        Same here!! Picked up the Nintendo controller at 3 years old and never looked back.
            That was me, except a generation earlier with an atari joystick. Actually my commodore 64 was first. Damn I am getting old, lol.
                Vic-20 here, bru.
                    First console wars at school - vic 20 vs zx spectrum !
            I can‚Äôt remember how old I started gaming. I do remember being five and playing Rollercoaster Tycoon on the family PC and watching my brothers playing Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on their Xbox. They also allowed me to play with them on their Xbox with games like Fuzion Frenzy and Kung Fu Chaos.
            My Kid is 2,5 and I gave him my DS the other day, just some random Lego Pirates of the Caribbean. Took him 5 Minutes to figure out how to move and shoot (didn't even know that was possible, thought Jack only had a sword) and actually managed to hit the opponents. Creepy.
        44 years of playing for me. We had a Pong console. That‚Äôs a console that plays one game, Pong.
            Ohhh I had one of those, a cheap magnavox clone
        Same here! ...i've been playing video games like over......40 fn years o\_O....and im under 50.
        I've been playing for the last 25 years... and Skyrim for the last 10. Pretty sure i will not stop playing both for the next 25.
    With their development cycle, don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll def be playing Skyrim the ultimate definitive classic hits edition on PSXX
        Playstation Millennium Edition
            PSInfinite: Computers Have Ceased to Improve
    Don't give Todd Howard any more ideas for a Skyrim 50th year anniversary edition.
        Actually I'd like to see what gets added
            Maybe they'll just release a composition of all 5 Elder Scrolls games where you create a character and progress through all 5 games. As an added bonus if you pre order the Diamond Edition you'll get a copy of Elder Scrolls 6 when it releases.
            Maybe we'll finally get co-op mode
    It will have just been rereleased too!
    With our generation I think we will be seeing a lot of this in the future!
    God, if only my parents would smoke pot and play video games
    No reason it can't be!  


My Pop will be 78 next month and plays Skyrim too.  He plays WoW off and on, Star Trek Online, SW:TOR, and a few other games that I can't remember off hand.  Oh and I got him to get his own GOG account and he's been buying games that he's "wanted for a long time" along with the freebies they give out.  


This makes my wife a bit irked to realize that this will be my future as well. :)
    Well we meant in 1968 oct.we were married 4 months latter. Still in love.53 years
    What edition would it be then, I wonder?
    Hey üëã
    Agreed but replace bf with future gf.
    Still playing Skyrim, remastered for whatever gaming system
    This is the future Todd Howard wants
    Well I hope the next elder scrolls is out by then.
    God I hope they release something other than Skyrim 40th Ed by then
    Maybe the elder scrolls 6 will be out by then. Doubtful tho.
    So when will he be your ex-bf...... and be your husband?
    There better be another Elder Scrolls out by then.
    I just want a gf that will game with me, play Deeprock or whatever game, & binge movies and tv shows with me. Is that too much to ask!? üòî
    If High Rock hasn't been released by then, I swear...
    Don't worry the latest release will still be Skyrim
    If you‚Äôre lucky, by then a new Skyrim will be out!
    I‚Äôm a 45 yo life-long bachelor. 
I date a lot of women and, while hoping to find someone I want to spend the rest of my life with, I don‚Äôt harbor any real hope that will happen. 

I love my life and have no ‚Äúburning desire‚Äù to ‚Äúsettle down‚Äù. My life is complete without it. 

The common question I get asked is what I expect my life to look like at 70 years old. 

My answer: ‚ÄúHonestly, I‚Äôm just gonna live in a  mountain hut with great internet speed, get high, and play XBox all day.‚Äù
    Knowing Bethesda, you'll probably be playing Skyrim super special 50th anniversary deluxe ultra max pro.
    We might have ES6 by then, maybe.
Install Skyrim Together's Reborn mod for them, they could play it together . It was recently updated, and it is amazing.
    So currently she‚Äôs using an Xbox Series X, however, I have been discussing with my grandma on building a PC for her so they can play the Reborn mod together.
        have you told her about controller support?
            We have!  Currently a PC is just out of the budget, but I do plan on saving up some extra cash so we can build her one.
                Want a i5 4 Gen with mobo and 16gb for shipping only? I have an old kit around somewhere. Not sure what Skyrim requires.
                    I knew a redditor would offer to help finance or just straight up give them something they had laying around for a good deal. 

Cheers to you, helping this dudes grandparents. Truly one of the best parts of being on Reddit is seeing the gaming community help each other out like this. 

The rest is a dumpster fire.
                        Yep, the small moments like this are why I keep coming back.

Edit: tense
                    I've got a GTX 680. Got it from a free PC and it worked last time I plugged it in. It's been sitting in my truck for a few weeks. If they take you up on the offer I'll throw in the 680 for the shipping cost.
                        Ok I know you mean like secure in the cab. But I can‚Äôt stop imagining you flying down country roads with a bare GTX 680 slamming around in the bed üò≠
                            Don't worry, it's underneath a pile of wet leaves so it has cushioning
                            "I nicknamed her Matilda."
                            Who do you think is strapped into the passenger seat?
                        I also have a 970 (fans stuck at 100%) and a 2060 lying around and would give them for a good price
                    Skyrim runs on a potato these days. The game is almost 11 years old.
                        Depends on how many mods you install, its been 5-6 years since I messed with it, but it can get pretty demanding.
                            Stock Skyrim runs on a potato.
                                no one alive plays stock Skyrim. ;-)
                                    I know one person‚Ä¶ but she just recently got it. I suggested playing vanilla till she gets bored and then add in mods unless there‚Äôs something that‚Äôs really bugging her.
                        The Special Edition (2016) has a bit higher requirements. 64bit, HD-textures, new shaders...

An i5 from 2014 or newer with Geforce 1080, 16gb ram and a SSD (or equivalents) should be enough to run the game in good quality without hiccups.

Used to play the SSE on an i5 from 2011, 8gb ram, GeForce 660TI. Had stable 60fps most of the time at medium settings, but I would recommend to aim for something stronger!
                    Wether he accepts or not, good on you random redditor.
                    Wholesome! You are awesome
                    It'll run on that. I was using that before I upgraded 2 years ago.
                    You‚Äôre a real one et_boy. I‚Äôll name my first son after you to commemorate this wholesome occasion
                    I‚Äôm not familiar with comps that much but been looking to set up a pc. How much would that setup cost you normally?
                        If you can find a video card for <$400, you can build an entire brand new mid-range setup for about $700-800. Then you just replace parts here and there for several years until the processor slot stops supporting newer ones. Then you probably have to shell out another $400.
                        I would guess around $150 in used parts on eBay.
                            Sweet thank you
                    Skyrim will run on my basic laptop from 2017.
                wholesome as hell  
Best of luck and best of fun to them!
                You're a real one, OP.
                Look into Steam Deck üòâ
                    Yeah don‚Äôt do this.
                        To each their own. I love my Steam Deck, though I of course have a gaming PC as well since the Deck can‚Äôt run everything (at least not at high settings for very long). For a grandma playing games like Skyrim the deck would be perfect.

            >controller support

Hey, I'm curious, what is the controller support?
                You can use a controller to play on PC, with varying difficulty. Dualshock controllers require drivers to be installed, but xbox controllers are supported pretty much seamlessly.

edit: apparently dualshock controllers arent as problematic as i thought, see below for details
                    doesnt ps now install the current dualshock drivers to pc?
                        I don‚Äôt pretend to know anything about this, but I‚Äôve been able to play games with my ps5 controller corded to my pc. No clue if it‚Äôs fully supported or not but I‚Äôve not run into issues.
                            So, Im on Windows 11 and my PS4 controller was just as plug n play as my Xbox controller. 

Just chiming in, idk too too much about this stuff.


Edit cause I had to P
                            I‚Äôm pretty savvy and have used a  PS5 controller on PC with varying success. There are drivers for them, but I have not noticed a huge difference in reliability. Mostly, wireless/Bluetooth still has a number of issues. But wired will be more reliable, at least for now. Otherwise the controller works well on Windows 11 and 10. I would still recommend an xbox controller as the button prompts in games will not usually show the PlayStation ones.
                        Yup, dualsense works without any issues, steam has bativexsupport for it and even the trigger force feedback thingy (although barely any games on pc support it)
                    If it's on steam, it all works without issue, even Nintendo controllers
                    If you're playing through steam then dushock/sense requires no additional drivers.
                        Maybe thats the issue I was having, i was playing a few games from Epic and couldnt get my PS4 controllers to work consistently.
                    I just bought a little Xbox thing from MS that plugs into my windows PC and it instantly recognized my Xbox series X controller.
                    just use ds4windows. makes it so the computer thinks it a 360 controller
                        good tip, thanks
                    Game runs fine on Steam Deck.
                    Can you use gyro aiming on Dualshocks?
                    Newest Dualshock, Dualsense, can be used incredibly seamlessly as well in my experience.
                    DualShock is a lot less effort then it used to be. Steam supports it without installing anything. Obviously not as integrated into windows as Xbox controllers but much better then a few years ago
                    Thank you!
                Plug in an XB1 controller and it pretty much just works 1:1
            Yeah let her know that Windows has full plug and play support for the Xbox controller and almost every modern game has full native Xbox controller support.

I use the Xbox Series X controller for gaming and fucking love it. 

I do recommend buying a dongle for it tho. Newer One X and Series X controllers have Bluetooth support, but IME it's very finicky. I think the issue is interference. Whatever the case, the dongle has been extremely reliable for me and noticeably more responsive than Bluetooth.
                Take the batteries out and use a cable.
Works awesome. Just plug it in while steam is launched and you‚Äôre good to go
        I would ask if they even want to play it together. They might enjoy doing their own apart from each other a bit.
            Ya I‚Äôm def not trying to having more wires and more electronics just to play a single player game again with someone.
        Fuck Reddit. Fuck /u/spez. Fuck every single Reddit admin. 12 years on this bitch ass site and they shit on us the moment they are trying to go public. ill be taking my karma with me by editing all my comments to say this.
tl;dr Fuck Reddit and anyone who works for them, suck my dick.
        Have they thought about ESO?
            I‚Äôm not sure, I know my grandpa use to play ESO a lot when it first came out.
                I dream for the day/hope that I might have a wonderful relationship like your grandparents, because that‚Äôs goals right there ;-;
            ESO is in the same story world as Skyrim, but it's a very different game. Hell it's made and maintained by a different company than Bethesda. You can definitely quest together with friends, but unless you're in a dungeon, you're often doing your quest objectives all by yourself, just with the company of friends. I call it playing together separately. 

You can attack the same creatures, but your party doesn't achieve the goals as a team, but individually. If one person doesn't get all the collectables or reach all the check points, they don't finish the quest even if their teammates completed it.

Overall ESO is a great game, just realize it's not Skyrim with friends.
            Well they‚Äôre asking
    They'd need another PC for that to work. I think OP's grandma is playing on console.
    Does it work? And if I might ask, do you know how? I would kill to play Skyrim with some of my friends, but I‚Äôm a bit wary of a mod that does something akin to creating a server lol.
        [Here's a vid of gameplay with it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBW5oCY36DQ)
            Thanks for the vid its a bad ass looking mod, but holy shit those people are annoying.
                Yeah, they can get a bit 'screamy' but they're pretty funny for the most part.
                    Ya, that wasn't a nice thing to say about them. I watch multiple YouTube channels that I'm sure are super annoying if you're only watching one random clip for 10 seconds.
        It's pretty straight forward, you just run a separate exe like with skse. Server browser is bound to a key and you can invite off steam. My friend and I had some fun with it but it still crashed enough to make us shelf it for now, both modded and vanilla. Still it's worth a shot, depending on how much work you will have to do to sync up your mod lists.
        Why? Running a game server isn‚Äôt scary.
            Running an official server released by a reputable known company, sure.

Running a server created by some random modders you're unfamiliar with? Worth some caution.
                If the code is open source who cares?
                    Just because it's open source, doesn't mean it's safe. It just means you can inspect it and build it yourself, if you were so inclined.

Again, I'm not saying it is not safe. I'm just saying it's prudent that someone would ask for more information about it before installing and running software that's opening up ports to the internet, as opposed to downloading something from Bethesda via Steam. Just answering the "why?" question that u/saarlac asked.
                        That's not what I'm saying, I'm saying if it's a large enough project, as soon as someone discovers something shady there goes the mod team's good will forever. People *will* inspect it, is my point.
                            https://www.zdnet.com/article/open-source-software-how-many-bugs-are-hidden-there-on-purpose/

there's really quite a lot of seriously negative stuff out there. 

> People will inspect it, is my point.

you'd be surprised. people are both sneaky and/or lazy. there's a few big examples of times where big open source projects had significant vulnerabilities put in.
    My partner tried that with some friends and it is VERY BUGGY. Basically unplayable. It needs a lot of work.

Based grandparents?üò≥
    Extremely based and geriatric-pilled
    Either I'm way behind on what slang means or this comment makes zero sense.
        It‚Äôs the former
            Care to explain what the top comment is saying?
                I will just copy straight from dictionary.com 

"Based is a slang term that originally meant to be addicted to crack cocaine (or acting like you were), but was reclaimed by rapper Lil B for¬†being yourself and not caring what others think of you‚Äîto carry yourself with swagger."
                    I wish the alt-right never co-opted this term but I‚Äôm glad to see Lil B getting his credit. TYBG
                        Wtf do you mean?
                            Must be a /r/PoliticalCompassMemes association to the term, since they like to use it a lot over there.
                                Everyone likes to use them, there‚Äôs nothing political about it at all

And it doesn‚Äôt need to be
                                    Fair enough, and I agree. /u/YEAHILIKEFATCHICKS what do you think?
                        Like how they ‚Äúco-opted‚Äù the okay? üëåüèª
                Just search "urban dictionary based"
                "Based grandparents?üò≥"
                "Based" used to be slang to refer to someone speaking or acting in a manner that indicated that they were not swayed by public opinion.  It was usually used to describe someone who spoke against the common thought.  Over time, the meaning has changed to mean something like: "I agree with what this person is saying, and would like to be provocative about it."  It is further breaking down into being the same as "cool".
                    I used to be an adventurer like you‚Ä¶‚Äù
                Based means bad. They used it wrong. Based could be used as "hitler was based". Or you could say "women dont deserve rights". That opinion is based.
                    This is totally accurate on opposite day
                        Nop. Its right. Yall are just using the old one. It USED to mean good, until people started over-using it sarcastically, so now ppl use it as the way i just described
                            no, they dont. You are the one confused here.
                                Ive been told for years that it means bad. Only heard it used your way maybe once or twice
                                    thats because originally it did mean bad. Its only in recent years, as shown above by u/JumpySonicBear 

I will just copy straight from dictionary.com

"Based is a slang term that originally meant to be addicted to crack cocaine (or acting like you were), but was reclaimed by rapper Lil B for¬†being yourself and not caring what others think of you‚Äîto carry yourself with swagger."
                            If you're in circles that are saying "Hitler was based" regularly the problem might be the circle
        Yeah sorry the hivemind disapproves
        Lmao why are you getting downvoted? This slang comes out of nowhere and we‚Äôre all expected to understand it. I‚Äôve seen the word ‚Äúbased‚Äù being used everywhere for months and I still don‚Äôt really know what it means.
        Top reddit insanity downvoting this comment
            Thanks. I thought I had said something offensive but apparently Reddit just gets mad when people try to learn things.
                Don't expect any sense on reddit. This place can be pretty damn irrational.
Too awesome! Who got them hooked, and wouldn't a short interview with your grandparents about their skyrim habit garner a view or two!
    I‚Äôve thought about making a short documentary about it.  My grandpa has played PC games for two decades now, so when Skyrim came around he got really invested into it.  As for my grandma, she just hit her one year anniversary of playing Skyrim not too long ago.
        This reminds me of the time my friends and I were walking through our little German village late at night back in 2010. We walked by an open window to the familiar sounds of MW2. We stayed a while and this person was absolutely shredding with the UMP, we could only see the giant TV from the street. They had a chopper gunner and everything. As we walked away we just caught a glimpse of the player and it was this little old lady, glasses and everything. We absolutely collapsed in laughter.
            That's amazing! Gran on her way to a nuke.
        ...Shirley?
            Nope, there‚Äôs a new Skyrim granny and grandpa in town!
            Bless her :)

It‚Äôd be funny if one is a Stormcloak and the other a faithless Imperial.
    No, one supports the Empire and one is traitorous swine.
        SKYRIM BELONGS TO THE NORDS!
            Basically Ulfric Stormcloak is the Donald Trump of Skyrim - an asshat born into wealth trying to seize power he doesn‚Äôt deserve based on a racist, facist campaign of demagoguery and outright violence.
                Man this is like a borderline mental illness at this point. Video games are not real life politics.
                    No, they aren‚Äôt.  But we are talking about a fictional *politician*, and comparing a fake one to a real one is perfectly valid.
                I missed the part where the United States is a puppet state owned by genocidal Imperialist China.
                    I missed the part where Skyrim is a puppet state owned by geoncidal overlords.  Throw away your Maga hat.
                        Thalmor
                            Don‚Äôt own Skyrim‚Ä¶ or the Empire as a whole for that matter.
                I mean you can just say you have no idea about any of the elder scrolls lore, no need to bring up US politics.
                "Bideo bame is exactly like real life politics, this is just like when Thanos (the bad guy) attacked the avengers (the good guys)"
    I smell a sitcom!
Cool grandparents man. Even if it's staged they're still cool because they went along with it. Lucky you.
    Glad to inform that it‚Äôs not staged.  Also to clarify, @upbeat_tax1219 is my grandma in the video!
        ROFLMAO at "I am a lizard and my name is bad a\*\* Lizzie. I love hunting dragons And I'm going to be 72 years old this morning. I even have a A horse made out of metal. He looks gold so I named him silver."

Happy Birthday bada\*\* Lizzie. ;-)
    Stage my a** my gaming name is Beth is bad a**
        S*** I got distracted and screwed that all up
            I am a lizard and my name is bad a** Lizzie. I love hunting dragons  And   I'm going to be 72 years old this morning. I even have a  A horse made out of metal. He looks gold so I named him silver.
I know these posts seem cool at first look, but you have to remember these people were probably in their mid twenties when Skyrim first launched they were probably playing it before OP was born
    [deleted]
        You kinda missed the joke there bud
            Yeah I didn‚Äôt realize until after I made my comment lol
        r/woosh
        It's awesome and impressive they still do this.
    Op is going to be their age playing Skyrim legendary ultra uber mega supreme 50th anniversary edition.
    they've seen a thousand editions of Skyrim and they'll see a thousand more
    You really think a ~thirty-six-year-old is gonna have a grandkid old enough to be posting on Reddit?

My grandparents had been *married* for longer than that when I was *born*.
        dude how can you miss the fact that it was an obvious joke?
            Because there's no /s and I'm autistic, so the /s is literally the only way I can tell the difference between a joke and a legitimate statement.
        A person has a baby at 14. That kid has a baby at 14, grandparent is now 28. Eight years later, grandparent is 36 and the grandchild is 8.

*Technically* possible, but unlikely.
        Its a joke lol
    Uh, mid twenties then, making them mid 30s now.

You know many 30-something grandparents? Outside of trailer parks.
I love it! Both of my parents play Skyrim on Xbox. It‚Äôs more of a winter time thing though as there‚Äôs less to be done outside. They are in their late 50s. They used to be really into Destiny as well but let that go. They always come back to Skyrim. It‚Äôs just such a massive game with so much immersion and nearly endless possibilities as far as how you play it.
Holy shit. Bussin' gramps' got an ultrawideüò≥
Thats actually super cute
They bought it when they were 25, just never stopped playing it and waiting for 6 to release
Those who game together, stay together! Long live this couple <3
    Yes we've been together for a long time we've been married for 53 years And we're still very much in love
        Wow, i hope i get to that level some day! My current boyfriend is a great candidate but I've also divorced twice so i got a lot of catching up to do! My boyfriend is the first partner I've had that actually plays videos games along with me so we are off to a great start! My your relationship stay blessed
It wouldn't surprise me if there are more older gamers than we think. I mean 40 or 45 years ago was right in the golden age of arcade games. And the arcade scene was more oriented toward young adults than children the way the market was a few years later. You're talking about people in their 60s now.
I mean it's called elder scrolls for a reason
This will surely go to my bucket list. I want to achieve this so bad. Retired, playing the games I always loved, happily married, no worries or problems, everything is fine. Just living some of my best years of my life.
As a GenXer  I find this so perfect & I can‚Äôt wait.  No jumping out of airplanes or bucket list of more to-do just video games & someone to game with
Good to see Skyrim is being remastered for the Xbox 9000.

&#x200B;

Seriously, this is pretty fucking cool!
I love this
This is so wholesome, Skyrim will never die as a game for pretty much all ages and replayability.
Okay. That's pretty cool. I prefer SE still, but may someday move to AE. It appears updates have been under control. It's what kind of turned me off in beginning. Thanks
i would cry tears of joy omg this is so sweet
I miss my grandparents...I'd do anything to speak to them.
In our house we call this  ‚Äúside by skyrim‚Äù. Evolved into ‚Äúzide by Zelda‚Äù for botw.  Ended up being skide by skyrim.
Your grandparents are way cooler than I‚Äôll ever be
Probably me in 40 years lol
i hope they are playing skyrim together mod
There‚Äôs an old couple who live across the street from a buddy of mine, and we‚Äôve sat on my buddy‚Äôs front porch and seen the man playing Fallout a couple of times.
Blessed grandparents üôè
When you‚Äôre done with people but love your life partner and still wanna hang out.
I don‚Äôt know if English is your first language or not, but the correct word is ‚Äúwere‚Äù not ‚Äúwhere‚Äù.
    English is my first language, but I have always struggled with proper grammar.  Sorry!
        No need to apologise. Just letting you know.
Damn your grandparents are awesome
Millennials in the nursing home be like.
What awesome grandparents! Nice set ups too üëçüèª
That's because they're fucking awesome wow haha
When the going gets tough, the tough get to shouting strangers off a mountain.
It always blows my mind when other peoples grandparents have tech stuff. My grandma doesn‚Äôt even have a smartphone, i don‚Äôt think she ever used a computer
Not too long after Skyrim was released I was in Game (UK gaming chain) in Norwich and there was a man who I think was probably in his late 70's or  early 80's talking enthusiastically to the shop assistant about Skyrim. It was really clear it wasn't just for his grandkids or anything like that.
I hope that‚Äôs me when I‚Äôm old. So cute
Help them get the skyrim together mod lol
blow their minds with skyrim together
And they have better setup than mine.
This is it.
I've said it to everyone who will listen.  Once we have the technology for completely immersive deepdive VR and to upload our conscious into a computer system, do that to me.  Use my physical body however the hell you'd live.  Just stick me into Skyrim.  

Well, actually, let's see how ES6 turns out.
Those are some awesome grandparents you've got there.
My husband and I do this and then have a voice party going so we can hear each other mutter our annoyances and randomly curse at our followers. True love.
God I'm jealous. I want that level of chill in my retirement.
Elderly Scrolls :
This is the most progressive couple I‚Äôve seen in a while.
Your gandpa is a fuckin gamer dude lol look at that set up, look at the sweatband, look at those figures! My guy was born 30 years too early.
You should tell them theres an mod so they can play together called Skyrim Together
my *father* doesn‚Äôt even know how to use a computer, let alone play a game as involved as skyrim. can‚Äôt imagine one of my grandparents being able to even use a cell phone‚Ä¶ lol
If this isn‚Äôt my marriage in the future I don‚Äôt want it
‚ÄúAre ya winning, gramps?‚Äù
That‚Äôs so funny! My grandparents are in their 70s and 80s and play video games with each other. I think it‚Äôs awesome!
    It‚Äôs funny, grandparents to me are always grey hair and old but OPs grandparents look young enough to be just parents!
My wife is 64, I‚Äôm 71. We‚Äôre great-grandparents. We‚Äôve done this many times.
They need https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69993

Co-op mode mod.
What the f is this heaven. I want this. Life goals let‚Äôs go #lifegoals
I love every part of this.
And here, my mom can't even turn on the TV...
I'm almost 50; been playing since the Atari 2600 and if I don't find a husband gamer soon ... I'll just have to keep playing solo.
Keep these people safe at all costs
Your grandparents sound cool as fuck
This was my grandparents. Only they were playing Zelda on Nintendo, and grandma had the controller while mostly blind grandpa sat at the TV being a backseat driver. Zelda is Grandma's favorite game.
Honestly a lot of older people have a knee-jerk negative reaction to video games, but so many of them could really benefit from playing them, even if just to keep busy. 

My aunt was basically doing *nothing* all day after my uncle died. Then she started playing the Sims, and from then on she started exploring all these other games (especially strategy games) and its now her biggest hobby. She constantly raves about how much she loves it and how amazing all of the games are. My parents still sort of make fun of her for it, which frustrates me, because I know if they put their pride to the side for a second, they would love video games too.
Why isn‚Äôt this in r/wholesome?
Hey you, your finally awake. Take your medication.
Omg i love this!! Next Skyrim version The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim walker addition
I pray to the lord above this is me and my wife in 40-50 years
Time to introduce them to eso so they can play together
So awesome!!!! Happy adventures!!
This is the way!
That‚Äôs awesome !!
If this isn‚Äôt how my marriage is I‚Äôd rather die with a bunch of cats
SQUAAAD GOAAALS.
Goals ‚ú®
That's cool.
I think I just saw a glimpse into mine and my fiance's future
Do they play SE or AE?
    Currently I think they are both playing AE with mods.
That‚Äôs love
Time to introduce them to eso so they can play together
What kind of playstyle do they have? Stealth Archer, Heavy weapons, Magic
    So I know my grandpa has played most styles, but recently he has been doing a magic build.  My grandma love heavy weapons, and her favorite currently is a giant war hammer.
And they high AF
    Just out of frame of my grandpas setup is his smoke station
"This could be us, but you be playing too much"
Imma be a baker and a gamer
This is what happens when Gen X becomes grandparents
That's why we both love our switches, can play at the same time right beside each other.
Now that's the life

Youngest Skyrim player (they are still waiting for Elder Scrolls VI):
Shit bro your grandparents are cool as f
Fucking Tod.  How does he do it?
My grandparents were hillbillies that could barely drive. I don't believe they ever saw one of those new fangled contraptions.
Why is grandma fenced in the living room?
... Skyrim multiplayer pvp mod. Loser does the dishes.
They might really love Elder Scrolls Online.

It's pretty much multiplayer skyrim but with enough content and improvements to last years.

To add to that, they will also get to play together!
52 and addicted to Skyrim :)
Good for them. As a middle ager who is obsessed with Elden Ring, more power to 'em.
They were 20 when the game originally released.
Fake
You grandmother is tiny
The memes are coming true
I love this. 
It would be really cool if they could play next to each other, like a his/her setup.
"Grand Parents"  Such a  wide age range of people that could fill that position.  32 years to +90 years old.   a 90 YO playing Skyrim surprising. A 45 YO grand parent playing skyrim  not so much
So far from the TV
Pretty much our entire generation once we retire lol
I mostly want to know more about the entire room divider in the living room.
THAT IS ADORABLE
This definitely did not happen.
this is so awesome
It's cool to see old people that are into Skyrim üòé
Always tell your grandparents to take a break and walk for 1-2 hours to prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis(DVT).
That's exactly how I want my future to be
Your grandparents?! Do they need another granddaughter?
Life goals live it up!!!
Couple goals
That is couples goals! If they had pc maybe they both can play Skyrim Together mod
How the hell can she even see that from so far away
Sensational
Do they know that if you jump over the castle wall, run round the back (fus it) climb the hill, left of the windmills they can get under the castle and rob the chest :)
What is it with grandparents and loving Skyrim
Legit question, but why is it always Skyrim? Everytime I see an "Elderly plays game", its always Skyrim or Battlefield.

Is it because it has Elder Scrolls in the name?
i don't get why people say that old people don't enjoy video games, im' wondering if its just jelousy and/or envy.
    I'm an early Gen-X. Some of us played video games when home computers weren't common yet...and we're hitting our 60's now. We are the grandparents! It won't be unusual for very much longer.
        that was supposed to be posted up top but works for your post too lol
            lol, its all good friend. you made good point.
Based grand parents
I think your grandfather is just like me, I got so bored playing Minecraft as a kid. I would play Skyrim for hour, even hours sometimes because I knew there was more to it.
[removed]
    Big feet and big shoes will do that lol
You should show them Elder Scrolls Online
Grandad is a Breton I see
Goals.
Nerds.
I love this. This will be me when I retire. I'm gonna be all about the games when I retire. I'm counting the years, still got quite a few to go though.
This is only going to get more common.
Dude I'm easily 1/3rd their age and if I had to look at a TV that far away I wouldn't see a damn thing holy shit lol

At least they weren‚Äôt watching porn.
What chair does the first person you show have?  I like the high back with headrest.
Imagine unlimited gaming time. That‚Äôs quite the life
They were only 20 when it first came out
This is fake somehow, i just know it.
    Nope! If you look at my other post, there‚Äôs a  photo of her playing Skyrim, as well as her ‚ÄúSkyrim Table.‚Äù

My heart!!!!!
Introduce them to the Skyrim Together mod!  They can play in the same world TOGETHER!!
"Hey, Gran and Grandad can I ask a favour? Just sit and pretend to play these games for me so I can post it to Reddit and get loads of upvotes. Thanks"
    Except, grandparents could be as young late 40s, well within gaming age, let alone older gamers. üòâ
That‚Äôs fucking‚Ä¶.awesome.

We need to set them up with computers so they can do Skyrim Together
Your grandparents are cool as fuck.
That'll be me and my girl üòé
That adorable!
Imagine how many marriages would survive if both were gamers.
Skyrim will never die!
Hey, waitaminit, they don't look like grandparents, they look my age! Oh, wait...
You either die a hero or live long enough to purchase every version of Skyrim
I'm 72 and play all the time.  Love the game.
This will be me and my husband. 41 and still gaming every daaaay.
I...love this more than I should. Retirement is ideally a mix of DO EVERYTHING and DO NOTHING! ü§£
Can I take a moment to say I love that den area? Not sure what to call it, inset room or something? Looks very cool. Also showing this to my wife so she will realize gaming as a couple is good.
Skyrim is one of those games that old people are able to play easily, I think the fallouts would be good too
Transcending generations. I shall pass my copies down to my children.
I‚Äôm crying because this is finally a world I want to live in
This is 100% the future.
Ok. I‚Äôm crying.
Grandpa has a better setup than me WTF
This is why we wanted co-op!
Damn! This is part of the goal!
Their interactions will be lit üòÇ
Your grandparents rule.  Mine just played alot of Tetris.
I hope this is my retirement.
My grandparents only play chess or Chuzzlez :/
YOU NEED TO TELL THEN ABOUT THE SKYRIM TOGETHER MOD
So clearly staged.
This is why Bethesda games need 2 player co-op
That tv is MASSIVE! is it like, 80-100inches? 

Glad they have so much entertainment and enjoyment üòä all the best to em!
Last time I saw My grandmother she loudly yelled racist comments about Mexicans ruining America, in the presence of my wife that she forgot was Mexican
    Sad
And the Grandparents of year award goes to
Your grandparents kick ass.  For real.
Set up skyrimVR for them with all the mods.  It‚Äôs good for older folks to sit less and exercise more. 

Also, SkyrimVR is fucking amazing.
I wonder the amount of sex mods in there
‚Ä¶..when the grand kids don‚Äôt understand what LEAVE means üòÇ
Aww that‚Äôs nice, all my grandparents do is have dementia.
Anyone else get bored of Skyrim I‚Äôve still not completed it after all these years. It‚Äôs a good game to get lost in thou.
But... which mods do they have installed?
#relationshipgoals

My grandparents used to play video games together all the time. They were the OGs of super Mario world. They would take turn playing levels and beat the game several times per week.

They would even challenge themselves and do runs without feathers or Yoshis when able.
You should see if you can get Enderal set up for them.
Much love for my grandparents ‚ù§Ô∏è
Did you tell them about SKYRIM TOGETHER a mod that lets you play with FRAINDS
Honest goals.
Grandparents these days...
Absolute legends. My grandparents can hardly operate a cell phone
Are they playing with dodgy mods?
Set up the multiplayer mod for them
What quests are they currently playing??
Same here! ...i've been playing video games like over......30 fn years o\_O....and im under 40.
    Same! Mod thirties for the win!
        > Mod thirties

Thats when they added the extra jiggle physics that just make everything look saggy.

It also adds extra dialogue to every conversation where you can talk about some random pain in your body ... Except your knee
        37 here baby cakeses and I have no intention of stopping. Playstation 78 and Xbox 1080p here we come! Also Nintendo Fold because they've went back to duel screens and couldn't come up with a better name lol.
            LMAO, yeah, but I went PC years ago and I'm never looking back.
            The Xbox 1080p has already released, it‚Äôs called the Series S lol
        I feel like granny allready ....old gamer granny. With my old gamer bf grandpa....
            That should be a hubby soon
            When my grandmother became a grandmother she was 5 years younger than I am right now.
        Try again. I'm 62 and have been playing video games since Pong. I remember buying an Atari when it came out and played Asteroids endlessly. However long I live, they'll likely find me with a controller in my hand.
    If my maths is correct. You are between 30 and 39
        Just turned 36
            [deleted]
                If it would have been any closer, it would have been like an arrow to the knee
        if you have to say 'maths' (and you shouldn't) at least keep the plural going and use 'are' :P
            America moment.
    Same here!! Picked up the Nintendo controller at 3 years old and never looked back.
        That was me, except a generation earlier with an atari joystick. Actually my commodore 64 was first. Damn I am getting old, lol.
            Vic-20 here, bru.

        I can‚Äôt remember how old I started gaming. I do remember being five and playing Rollercoaster Tycoon on the family PC and watching my brothers playing Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on their Xbox. They also allowed me to play with them on their Xbox with games like Fuzion Frenzy and Kung Fu Chaos.
        My Kid is 2,5 and I gave him my DS the other day, just some random Lego Pirates of the Caribbean. Took him 5 Minutes to figure out how to move and shoot (didn't even know that was possible, thought Jack only had a sword) and actually managed to hit the opponents. Creepy.
    44 years of playing for me. We had a Pong console. That‚Äôs a console that plays one game, Pong.
        Ohhh I had one of those, a cheap magnavox clone
    Same here! ...i've been playing video games like over......40 fn years o\_O....and im under 50.
    I've been playing for the last 25 years... and Skyrim for the last 10. Pretty sure i will not stop playing both for the next 25.
With their development cycle, don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll def be playing Skyrim the ultimate definitive classic hits edition on PSXX
    Playstation Millennium Edition
        PSInfinite: Computers Have Ceased to Improve
Don't give Todd Howard any more ideas for a Skyrim 50th year anniversary edition.
    Actually I'd like to see what gets added
        Maybe they'll just release a composition of all 5 Elder Scrolls games where you create a character and progress through all 5 games. As an added bonus if you pre order the Diamond Edition you'll get a copy of Elder Scrolls 6 when it releases.
        Maybe we'll finally get co-op mode
It will have just been rereleased too!
With our generation I think we will be seeing a lot of this in the future!
God, if only my parents would smoke pot and play video games
No reason it can't be!  


My Pop will be 78 next month and plays Skyrim too.  He plays WoW off and on, Star Trek Online, SW:TOR, and a few other games that I can't remember off hand.  Oh and I got him to get his own GOG account and he's been buying games that he's "wanted for a long time" along with the freebies they give out.  


This makes my wife a bit irked to realize that this will be my future as well. :)
Well we meant in 1968 oct.we were married 4 months latter. Still in love.53 years
What edition would it be then, I wonder?
Hey üëã
Agreed but replace bf with future gf.
Still playing Skyrim, remastered for whatever gaming system
This is the future Todd Howard wants
Well I hope the next elder scrolls is out by then.
God I hope they release something other than Skyrim 40th Ed by then
Maybe the elder scrolls 6 will be out by then. Doubtful tho.
So when will he be your ex-bf...... and be your husband?
There better be another Elder Scrolls out by then.
I just want a gf that will game with me, play Deeprock or whatever game, & binge movies and tv shows with me. Is that too much to ask!? üòî
If High Rock hasn't been released by then, I swear...
Don't worry the latest release will still be Skyrim
If you‚Äôre lucky, by then a new Skyrim will be out!
I‚Äôm a 45 yo life-long bachelor. 
I date a lot of women and, while hoping to find someone I want to spend the rest of my life with, I don‚Äôt harbor any real hope that will happen. 

I love my life and have no ‚Äúburning desire‚Äù to ‚Äúsettle down‚Äù. My life is complete without it. 

The common question I get asked is what I expect my life to look like at 70 years old. 

My answer: ‚ÄúHonestly, I‚Äôm just gonna live in a  mountain hut with great internet speed, get high, and play XBox all day.‚Äù
Knowing Bethesda, you'll probably be playing Skyrim super special 50th anniversary deluxe ultra max pro.
We might have ES6 by then, maybe.
So currently she‚Äôs using an Xbox Series X, however, I have been discussing with my grandma on building a PC for her so they can play the Reborn mod together.
    have you told her about controller support?
        We have!  Currently a PC is just out of the budget, but I do plan on saving up some extra cash so we can build her one.
            Want a i5 4 Gen with mobo and 16gb for shipping only? I have an old kit around somewhere. Not sure what Skyrim requires.
                I knew a redditor would offer to help finance or just straight up give them something they had laying around for a good deal. 

Cheers to you, helping this dudes grandparents. Truly one of the best parts of being on Reddit is seeing the gaming community help each other out like this. 

The rest is a dumpster fire.
                    Yep, the small moments like this are why I keep coming back.

Edit: tense
                I've got a GTX 680. Got it from a free PC and it worked last time I plugged it in. It's been sitting in my truck for a few weeks. If they take you up on the offer I'll throw in the 680 for the shipping cost.
                    Ok I know you mean like secure in the cab. But I can‚Äôt stop imagining you flying down country roads with a bare GTX 680 slamming around in the bed üò≠
                        Don't worry, it's underneath a pile of wet leaves so it has cushioning

                        Who do you think is strapped into the passenger seat?
                    I also have a 970 (fans stuck at 100%) and a 2060 lying around and would give them for a good price
                Skyrim runs on a potato these days. The game is almost 11 years old.
                    Depends on how many mods you install, its been 5-6 years since I messed with it, but it can get pretty demanding.
                        Stock Skyrim runs on a potato.
                            no one alive plays stock Skyrim. ;-)
                                I know one person‚Ä¶ but she just recently got it. I suggested playing vanilla till she gets bored and then add in mods unless there‚Äôs something that‚Äôs really bugging her.
                    The Special Edition (2016) has a bit higher requirements. 64bit, HD-textures, new shaders...

An i5 from 2014 or newer with Geforce 1080, 16gb ram and a SSD (or equivalents) should be enough to run the game in good quality without hiccups.

Used to play the SSE on an i5 from 2011, 8gb ram, GeForce 660TI. Had stable 60fps most of the time at medium settings, but I would recommend to aim for something stronger!
                Wether he accepts or not, good on you random redditor.
                Wholesome! You are awesome
                It'll run on that. I was using that before I upgraded 2 years ago.
                You‚Äôre a real one et_boy. I‚Äôll name my first son after you to commemorate this wholesome occasion
                I‚Äôm not familiar with comps that much but been looking to set up a pc. How much would that setup cost you normally?
                    If you can find a video card for <$400, you can build an entire brand new mid-range setup for about $700-800. Then you just replace parts here and there for several years until the processor slot stops supporting newer ones. Then you probably have to shell out another $400.
                    I would guess around $150 in used parts on eBay.
                        Sweet thank you
                Skyrim will run on my basic laptop from 2017.
            wholesome as hell  
Best of luck and best of fun to them!
            You're a real one, OP.
            Look into Steam Deck üòâ
                Yeah don‚Äôt do this.
                    To each their own. I love my Steam Deck, though I of course have a gaming PC as well since the Deck can‚Äôt run everything (at least not at high settings for very long). For a grandma playing games like Skyrim the deck would be perfect.
            you can put a pc back in the budget with this ultra low detail mod :P

        >controller support

Hey, I'm curious, what is the controller support?
            You can use a controller to play on PC, with varying difficulty. Dualshock controllers require drivers to be installed, but xbox controllers are supported pretty much seamlessly.

edit: apparently dualshock controllers arent as problematic as i thought, see below for details
                doesnt ps now install the current dualshock drivers to pc?
                    I don‚Äôt pretend to know anything about this, but I‚Äôve been able to play games with my ps5 controller corded to my pc. No clue if it‚Äôs fully supported or not but I‚Äôve not run into issues.
                        So, Im on Windows 11 and my PS4 controller was just as plug n play as my Xbox controller. 

Just chiming in, idk too too much about this stuff.


Edit cause I had to P
                        I‚Äôm pretty savvy and have used a  PS5 controller on PC with varying success. There are drivers for them, but I have not noticed a huge difference in reliability. Mostly, wireless/Bluetooth still has a number of issues. But wired will be more reliable, at least for now. Otherwise the controller works well on Windows 11 and 10. I would still recommend an xbox controller as the button prompts in games will not usually show the PlayStation ones.
                    Yup, dualsense works without any issues, steam has bativexsupport for it and even the trigger force feedback thingy (although barely any games on pc support it)
                If it's on steam, it all works without issue, even Nintendo controllers
                If you're playing through steam then dushock/sense requires no additional drivers.
                    Maybe thats the issue I was having, i was playing a few games from Epic and couldnt get my PS4 controllers to work consistently.
                I just bought a little Xbox thing from MS that plugs into my windows PC and it instantly recognized my Xbox series X controller.
                just use ds4windows. makes it so the computer thinks it a 360 controller
                    good tip, thanks
                Game runs fine on Steam Deck.
                Can you use gyro aiming on Dualshocks?
                Newest Dualshock, Dualsense, can be used incredibly seamlessly as well in my experience.
                DualShock is a lot less effort then it used to be. Steam supports it without installing anything. Obviously not as integrated into windows as Xbox controllers but much better then a few years ago
                Thank you!
            Plug in an XB1 controller and it pretty much just works 1:1
        Yeah let her know that Windows has full plug and play support for the Xbox controller and almost every modern game has full native Xbox controller support.

I use the Xbox Series X controller for gaming and fucking love it. 

I do recommend buying a dongle for it tho. Newer One X and Series X controllers have Bluetooth support, but IME it's very finicky. I think the issue is interference. Whatever the case, the dongle has been extremely reliable for me and noticeably more responsive than Bluetooth.
            Take the batteries out and use a cable.
Works awesome. Just plug it in while steam is launched and you‚Äôre good to go
    I would ask if they even want to play it together. They might enjoy doing their own apart from each other a bit.
        Ya I‚Äôm def not trying to having more wires and more electronics just to play a single player game again with someone.
    Fuck Reddit. Fuck /u/spez. Fuck every single Reddit admin. 12 years on this bitch ass site and they shit on us the moment they are trying to go public. ill be taking my karma with me by editing all my comments to say this.
tl;dr Fuck Reddit and anyone who works for them, suck my dick.
    Have they thought about ESO?
        I‚Äôm not sure, I know my grandpa use to play ESO a lot when it first came out.
            I dream for the day/hope that I might have a wonderful relationship like your grandparents, because that‚Äôs goals right there ;-;
        ESO is in the same story world as Skyrim, but it's a very different game. Hell it's made and maintained by a different company than Bethesda. You can definitely quest together with friends, but unless you're in a dungeon, you're often doing your quest objectives all by yourself, just with the company of friends. I call it playing together separately. 

You can attack the same creatures, but your party doesn't achieve the goals as a team, but individually. If one person doesn't get all the collectables or reach all the check points, they don't finish the quest even if their teammates completed it.

Overall ESO is a great game, just realize it's not Skyrim with friends.
        Well they‚Äôre asking
They'd need another PC for that to work. I think OP's grandma is playing on console.
Does it work? And if I might ask, do you know how? I would kill to play Skyrim with some of my friends, but I‚Äôm a bit wary of a mod that does something akin to creating a server lol.
    [Here's a vid of gameplay with it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBW5oCY36DQ)
        Thanks for the vid its a bad ass looking mod, but holy shit those people are annoying.
            Yeah, they can get a bit 'screamy' but they're pretty funny for the most part.
                Ya, that wasn't a nice thing to say about them. I watch multiple YouTube channels that I'm sure are super annoying if you're only watching one random clip for 10 seconds.
    It's pretty straight forward, you just run a separate exe like with skse. Server browser is bound to a key and you can invite off steam. My friend and I had some fun with it but it still crashed enough to make us shelf it for now, both modded and vanilla. Still it's worth a shot, depending on how much work you will have to do to sync up your mod lists.
    Why? Running a game server isn‚Äôt scary.
        Running an official server released by a reputable known company, sure.

Running a server created by some random modders you're unfamiliar with? Worth some caution.
            If the code is open source who cares?
                Just because it's open source, doesn't mean it's safe. It just means you can inspect it and build it yourself, if you were so inclined.

Again, I'm not saying it is not safe. I'm just saying it's prudent that someone would ask for more information about it before installing and running software that's opening up ports to the internet, as opposed to downloading something from Bethesda via Steam. Just answering the "why?" question that u/saarlac asked.
                    That's not what I'm saying, I'm saying if it's a large enough project, as soon as someone discovers something shady there goes the mod team's good will forever. People *will* inspect it, is my point.
                        https://www.zdnet.com/article/open-source-software-how-many-bugs-are-hidden-there-on-purpose/

there's really quite a lot of seriously negative stuff out there. 

> People will inspect it, is my point.

you'd be surprised. people are both sneaky and/or lazy. there's a few big examples of times where big open source projects had significant vulnerabilities put in.
My partner tried that with some friends and it is VERY BUGGY. Basically unplayable. It needs a lot of work.

Extremely based and geriatric-pilled
Either I'm way behind on what slang means or this comment makes zero sense.
    It‚Äôs the former
        Care to explain what the top comment is saying?
            I will just copy straight from dictionary.com 

"Based is a slang term that originally meant to be addicted to crack cocaine (or acting like you were), but was reclaimed by rapper Lil B for¬†being yourself and not caring what others think of you‚Äîto carry yourself with swagger."
                I wish the alt-right never co-opted this term but I‚Äôm glad to see Lil B getting his credit. TYBG
                    Wtf do you mean?
                        Must be a /r/PoliticalCompassMemes association to the term, since they like to use it a lot over there.
                            Everyone likes to use them, there‚Äôs nothing political about it at all

And it doesn‚Äôt need to be
                                Fair enough, and I agree. /u/YEAHILIKEFATCHICKS what do you think?
                    Like how they ‚Äúco-opted‚Äù the okay? üëåüèª
            Just search "urban dictionary based"
            "Based grandparents?üò≥"
            "Based" used to be slang to refer to someone speaking or acting in a manner that indicated that they were not swayed by public opinion.  It was usually used to describe someone who spoke against the common thought.  Over time, the meaning has changed to mean something like: "I agree with what this person is saying, and would like to be provocative about it."  It is further breaking down into being the same as "cool".
                I used to be an adventurer like you‚Ä¶‚Äù
            Based means bad. They used it wrong. Based could be used as "hitler was based". Or you could say "women dont deserve rights". That opinion is based.
                This is totally accurate on opposite day
                    Nop. Its right. Yall are just using the old one. It USED to mean good, until people started over-using it sarcastically, so now ppl use it as the way i just described
                        no, they dont. You are the one confused here.
                            Ive been told for years that it means bad. Only heard it used your way maybe once or twice
                                thats because originally it did mean bad. Its only in recent years, as shown above by u/JumpySonicBear 

I will just copy straight from dictionary.com

"Based is a slang term that originally meant to be addicted to crack cocaine (or acting like you were), but was reclaimed by rapper Lil B for¬†being yourself and not caring what others think of you‚Äîto carry yourself with swagger."
                        If you're in circles that are saying "Hitler was based" regularly the problem might be the circle
    Yeah sorry the hivemind disapproves
    Lmao why are you getting downvoted? This slang comes out of nowhere and we‚Äôre all expected to understand it. I‚Äôve seen the word ‚Äúbased‚Äù being used everywhere for months and I still don‚Äôt really know what it means.
    Top reddit insanity downvoting this comment
        Thanks. I thought I had said something offensive but apparently Reddit just gets mad when people try to learn things.
            Don't expect any sense on reddit. This place can be pretty damn irrational.
I‚Äôve thought about making a short documentary about it.  My grandpa has played PC games for two decades now, so when Skyrim came around he got really invested into it.  As for my grandma, she just hit her one year anniversary of playing Skyrim not too long ago.
    This reminds me of the time my friends and I were walking through our little German village late at night back in 2010. We walked by an open window to the familiar sounds of MW2. We stayed a while and this person was absolutely shredding with the UMP, we could only see the giant TV from the street. They had a chopper gunner and everything. As we walked away we just caught a glimpse of the player and it was this little old lady, glasses and everything. We absolutely collapsed in laughter.
        That's amazing! Gran on her way to a nuke.
    ...Shirley?
        Nope, there‚Äôs a new Skyrim granny and grandpa in town!
        Bless her :)
No, one supports the Empire and one is traitorous swine.
    SKYRIM BELONGS TO THE NORDS!
        Basically Ulfric Stormcloak is the Donald Trump of Skyrim - an asshat born into wealth trying to seize power he doesn‚Äôt deserve based on a racist, facist campaign of demagoguery and outright violence.
            Man this is like a borderline mental illness at this point. Video games are not real life politics.
                No, they aren‚Äôt.  But we are talking about a fictional *politician*, and comparing a fake one to a real one is perfectly valid.
            I missed the part where the United States is a puppet state owned by genocidal Imperialist China.
                I missed the part where Skyrim is a puppet state owned by geoncidal overlords.  Throw away your Maga hat.

                        Don‚Äôt own Skyrim‚Ä¶ or the Empire as a whole for that matter.
            I mean you can just say you have no idea about any of the elder scrolls lore, no need to bring up US politics.

You really think a ~thirty-six-year-old is gonna have a grandkid old enough to be posting on Reddit?

My grandparents had been *married* for longer than that when I was *born*.
    dude how can you miss the fact that it was an obvious joke?
        Because there's no /s and I'm autistic, so the /s is literally the only way I can tell the difference between a joke and a legitimate statement.
    A person has a baby at 14. That kid has a baby at 14, grandparent is now 28. Eight years later, grandparent is 36 and the grandchild is 8.

*Technically* possible, but unlikely.
    Its a joke lol
Uh, mid twenties then, making them mid 30s now.

You know many 30-something grandparents? Outside of trailer parks.
Yes we've been together for a long time we've been married for 53 years And we're still very much in love
    Wow, i hope i get to that level some day! My current boyfriend is a great candidate but I've also divorced twice so i got a lot of catching up to do! My boyfriend is the first partner I've had that actually plays videos games along with me so we are off to a great start! My your relationship stay blessed
English is my first language, but I have always struggled with proper grammar.  Sorry!
    No need to apologise. Just letting you know.
It‚Äôs funny, grandparents to me are always grey hair and old but OPs grandparents look young enough to be just parents!
Currently I think they are both playing AE with mods.
So I know my grandpa has played most styles, but recently he has been doing a magic build.  My grandma love heavy weapons, and her favorite currently is a giant war hammer.
Just out of frame of my grandpas setup is his smoke station
I'm an early Gen-X. Some of us played video games when home computers weren't common yet...and we're hitting our 60's now. We are the grandparents! It won't be unusual for very much longer.
    that was supposed to be posted up top but works for your post too lol
        lol, its all good friend. you made good point.
Big feet and big shoes will do that lol
Nope! If you look at my other post, there‚Äôs a  photo of her playing Skyrim, as well as her ‚ÄúSkyrim Table.‚Äù

        That should be a hubby soon
        When my grandmother became a grandmother she was 5 years younger than I am right now.
    Try again. I'm 62 and have been playing video games since Pong. I remember buying an Atari when it came out and played Asteroids endlessly. However long I live, they'll likely find me with a controller in my hand.

Same here!! Picked up the Nintendo controller at 3 years old and never looked back.
    That was me, except a generation earlier with an atari joystick. Actually my commodore 64 was first. Damn I am getting old, lol.

    I can‚Äôt remember how old I started gaming. I do remember being five and playing Rollercoaster Tycoon on the family PC and watching my brothers playing Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on their Xbox. They also allowed me to play with them on their Xbox with games like Fuzion Frenzy and Kung Fu Chaos.
    My Kid is 2,5 and I gave him my DS the other day, just some random Lego Pirates of the Caribbean. Took him 5 Minutes to figure out how to move and shoot (didn't even know that was possible, thought Jack only had a sword) and actually managed to hit the opponents. Creepy.
44 years of playing for me. We had a Pong console. That‚Äôs a console that plays one game, Pong.
    Ohhh I had one of those, a cheap magnavox clone
Same here! ...i've been playing video games like over......40 fn years o\_O....and im under 50.
I've been playing for the last 25 years... and Skyrim for the last 10. Pretty sure i will not stop playing both for the next 25.

Actually I'd like to see what gets added
    Maybe they'll just release a composition of all 5 Elder Scrolls games where you create a character and progress through all 5 games. As an added bonus if you pre order the Diamond Edition you'll get a copy of Elder Scrolls 6 when it releases.
    Maybe we'll finally get co-op mode
have you told her about controller support?
    We have!  Currently a PC is just out of the budget, but I do plan on saving up some extra cash so we can build her one.
        Want a i5 4 Gen with mobo and 16gb for shipping only? I have an old kit around somewhere. Not sure what Skyrim requires.
            I knew a redditor would offer to help finance or just straight up give them something they had laying around for a good deal. 

Cheers to you, helping this dudes grandparents. Truly one of the best parts of being on Reddit is seeing the gaming community help each other out like this. 

The rest is a dumpster fire.
                Yep, the small moments like this are why I keep coming back.

            Skyrim runs on a potato these days. The game is almost 11 years old.

            I‚Äôm not familiar with comps that much but been looking to set up a pc. How much would that setup cost you normally?
                If you can find a video card for <$400, you can build an entire brand new mid-range setup for about $700-800. Then you just replace parts here and there for several years until the processor slot stops supporting newer ones. Then you probably have to shell out another $400.
                I would guess around $150 in used parts on eBay.

    >controller support

Hey, I'm curious, what is the controller support?
        You can use a controller to play on PC, with varying difficulty. Dualshock controllers require drivers to be installed, but xbox controllers are supported pretty much seamlessly.

edit: apparently dualshock controllers arent as problematic as i thought, see below for details
            doesnt ps now install the current dualshock drivers to pc?
                I don‚Äôt pretend to know anything about this, but I‚Äôve been able to play games with my ps5 controller corded to my pc. No clue if it‚Äôs fully supported or not but I‚Äôve not run into issues.
                    So, Im on Windows 11 and my PS4 controller was just as plug n play as my Xbox controller. 

Just chiming in, idk too too much about this stuff.


Edit cause I had to P
                    I‚Äôm pretty savvy and have used a  PS5 controller on PC with varying success. There are drivers for them, but I have not noticed a huge difference in reliability. Mostly, wireless/Bluetooth still has a number of issues. But wired will be more reliable, at least for now. Otherwise the controller works well on Windows 11 and 10. I would still recommend an xbox controller as the button prompts in games will not usually show the PlayStation ones.
                Yup, dualsense works without any issues, steam has bativexsupport for it and even the trigger force feedback thingy (although barely any games on pc support it)
            If it's on steam, it all works without issue, even Nintendo controllers
            If you're playing through steam then dushock/sense requires no additional drivers.
                Maybe thats the issue I was having, i was playing a few games from Epic and couldnt get my PS4 controllers to work consistently.
            I just bought a little Xbox thing from MS that plugs into my windows PC and it instantly recognized my Xbox series X controller.
            just use ds4windows. makes it so the computer thinks it a 360 controller
                good tip, thanks
            Game runs fine on Steam Deck.
            Can you use gyro aiming on Dualshocks?
            Newest Dualshock, Dualsense, can be used incredibly seamlessly as well in my experience.
            DualShock is a lot less effort then it used to be. Steam supports it without installing anything. Obviously not as integrated into windows as Xbox controllers but much better then a few years ago
            Thank you!
        Plug in an XB1 controller and it pretty much just works 1:1
    Yeah let her know that Windows has full plug and play support for the Xbox controller and almost every modern game has full native Xbox controller support.

I use the Xbox Series X controller for gaming and fucking love it. 

I do recommend buying a dongle for it tho. Newer One X and Series X controllers have Bluetooth support, but IME it's very finicky. I think the issue is interference. Whatever the case, the dongle has been extremely reliable for me and noticeably more responsive than Bluetooth.
        Take the batteries out and use a cable.
Works awesome. Just plug it in while steam is launched and you‚Äôre good to go
I would ask if they even want to play it together. They might enjoy doing their own apart from each other a bit.
    Ya I‚Äôm def not trying to having more wires and more electronics just to play a single player game again with someone.
Fuck Reddit. Fuck /u/spez. Fuck every single Reddit admin. 12 years on this bitch ass site and they shit on us the moment they are trying to go public. ill be taking my karma with me by editing all my comments to say this.
tl;dr Fuck Reddit and anyone who works for them, suck my dick.
Have they thought about ESO?
    I‚Äôm not sure, I know my grandpa use to play ESO a lot when it first came out.
        I dream for the day/hope that I might have a wonderful relationship like your grandparents, because that‚Äôs goals right there ;-;
    ESO is in the same story world as Skyrim, but it's a very different game. Hell it's made and maintained by a different company than Bethesda. You can definitely quest together with friends, but unless you're in a dungeon, you're often doing your quest objectives all by yourself, just with the company of friends. I call it playing together separately. 

You can attack the same creatures, but your party doesn't achieve the goals as a team, but individually. If one person doesn't get all the collectables or reach all the check points, they don't finish the quest even if their teammates completed it.

Overall ESO is a great game, just realize it's not Skyrim with friends.
    Well they‚Äôre asking
[Here's a vid of gameplay with it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBW5oCY36DQ)
    Thanks for the vid its a bad ass looking mod, but holy shit those people are annoying.
        Yeah, they can get a bit 'screamy' but they're pretty funny for the most part.
            Ya, that wasn't a nice thing to say about them. I watch multiple YouTube channels that I'm sure are super annoying if you're only watching one random clip for 10 seconds.
It's pretty straight forward, you just run a separate exe like with skse. Server browser is bound to a key and you can invite off steam. My friend and I had some fun with it but it still crashed enough to make us shelf it for now, both modded and vanilla. Still it's worth a shot, depending on how much work you will have to do to sync up your mod lists.
Why? Running a game server isn‚Äôt scary.
    Running an official server released by a reputable known company, sure.

Running a server created by some random modders you're unfamiliar with? Worth some caution.
        If the code is open source who cares?
            Just because it's open source, doesn't mean it's safe. It just means you can inspect it and build it yourself, if you were so inclined.

Again, I'm not saying it is not safe. I'm just saying it's prudent that someone would ask for more information about it before installing and running software that's opening up ports to the internet, as opposed to downloading something from Bethesda via Steam. Just answering the "why?" question that u/saarlac asked.
                That's not what I'm saying, I'm saying if it's a large enough project, as soon as someone discovers something shady there goes the mod team's good will forever. People *will* inspect it, is my point.
                    https://www.zdnet.com/article/open-source-software-how-many-bugs-are-hidden-there-on-purpose/

there's really quite a lot of seriously negative stuff out there. 

> People will inspect it, is my point.

you'd be surprised. people are both sneaky and/or lazy. there's a few big examples of times where big open source projects had significant vulnerabilities put in.

Wow‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm only 47 and now I do feel OLD. LMAO! I had to urban dictionary ‚Äúbased.‚Äù Thank you‚Ä¶ I think. üòÇ
Yeah I wanted to make a pullin steel wool joke but I thought better of it

Now, it won't go directly to them lol
So do we. Gaming aside, we're one of those super happy couples that do everything together, and neither one of us has tried to murder the other, unless you count some really bad meatloaf ü§£
It‚Äôs the former
    Care to explain what the top comment is saying?
        I will just copy straight from dictionary.com 

"Based is a slang term that originally meant to be addicted to crack cocaine (or acting like you were), but was reclaimed by rapper Lil B for¬†being yourself and not caring what others think of you‚Äîto carry yourself with swagger."
            I wish the alt-right never co-opted this term but I‚Äôm glad to see Lil B getting his credit. TYBG
                Wtf do you mean?
                    Must be a /r/PoliticalCompassMemes association to the term, since they like to use it a lot over there.
                        Everyone likes to use them, there‚Äôs nothing political about it at all

And it doesn‚Äôt need to be
                            Fair enough, and I agree. /u/YEAHILIKEFATCHICKS what do you think?
                Like how they ‚Äúco-opted‚Äù the okay? üëåüèª
        Just search "urban dictionary based"
        "Based grandparents?üò≥"
        "Based" used to be slang to refer to someone speaking or acting in a manner that indicated that they were not swayed by public opinion.  It was usually used to describe someone who spoke against the common thought.  Over time, the meaning has changed to mean something like: "I agree with what this person is saying, and would like to be provocative about it."  It is further breaking down into being the same as "cool".
            I used to be an adventurer like you‚Ä¶‚Äù
        Based means bad. They used it wrong. Based could be used as "hitler was based". Or you could say "women dont deserve rights". That opinion is based.
            This is totally accurate on opposite day
                Nop. Its right. Yall are just using the old one. It USED to mean good, until people started over-using it sarcastically, so now ppl use it as the way i just described
                    no, they dont. You are the one confused here.
                        Ive been told for years that it means bad. Only heard it used your way maybe once or twice
                            thats because originally it did mean bad. Its only in recent years, as shown above by u/JumpySonicBear 

I will just copy straight from dictionary.com

"Based is a slang term that originally meant to be addicted to crack cocaine (or acting like you were), but was reclaimed by rapper Lil B for¬†being yourself and not caring what others think of you‚Äîto carry yourself with swagger."
                    If you're in circles that are saying "Hitler was based" regularly the problem might be the circle
Yeah sorry the hivemind disapproves
Lmao why are you getting downvoted? This slang comes out of nowhere and we‚Äôre all expected to understand it. I‚Äôve seen the word ‚Äúbased‚Äù being used everywhere for months and I still don‚Äôt really know what it means.
Top reddit insanity downvoting this comment
    Thanks. I thought I had said something offensive but apparently Reddit just gets mad when people try to learn things.
        Don't expect any sense on reddit. This place can be pretty damn irrational.
This reminds me of the time my friends and I were walking through our little German village late at night back in 2010. We walked by an open window to the familiar sounds of MW2. We stayed a while and this person was absolutely shredding with the UMP, we could only see the giant TV from the street. They had a chopper gunner and everything. As we walked away we just caught a glimpse of the player and it was this little old lady, glasses and everything. We absolutely collapsed in laughter.
    That's amazing! Gran on her way to a nuke.
...Shirley?
    Nope, there‚Äôs a new Skyrim granny and grandpa in town!
    Bless her :)
SKYRIM BELONGS TO THE NORDS!
    Basically Ulfric Stormcloak is the Donald Trump of Skyrim - an asshat born into wealth trying to seize power he doesn‚Äôt deserve based on a racist, facist campaign of demagoguery and outright violence.
        Man this is like a borderline mental illness at this point. Video games are not real life politics.
            No, they aren‚Äôt.  But we are talking about a fictional *politician*, and comparing a fake one to a real one is perfectly valid.
        I missed the part where the United States is a puppet state owned by genocidal Imperialist China.

    Yeah I didn‚Äôt realize until after I made my comment lol
r/woosh
It's awesome and impressive they still do this.
dude how can you miss the fact that it was an obvious joke?
    Because there's no /s and I'm autistic, so the /s is literally the only way I can tell the difference between a joke and a legitimate statement.
A person has a baby at 14. That kid has a baby at 14, grandparent is now 28. Eight years later, grandparent is 36 and the grandchild is 8.

*Technically* possible, but unlikely.
Its a joke lol
Wow, i hope i get to that level some day! My current boyfriend is a great candidate but I've also divorced twice so i got a lot of catching up to do! My boyfriend is the first partner I've had that actually plays videos games along with me so we are off to a great start! My your relationship stay blessed
No need to apologise. Just letting you know.
that was supposed to be posted up top but works for your post too lol

My Kid is 2,5 and I gave him my DS the other day, just some random Lego Pirates of the Caribbean. Took him 5 Minutes to figure out how to move and shoot (didn't even know that was possible, thought Jack only had a sword) and actually managed to hit the opponents. Creepy.
Ohhh I had one of those, a cheap magnavox clone

                I‚Äôm pretty savvy and have used a  PS5 controller on PC with varying success. There are drivers for them, but I have not noticed a huge difference in reliability. Mostly, wireless/Bluetooth still has a number of issues. But wired will be more reliable, at least for now. Otherwise the controller works well on Windows 11 and 10. I would still recommend an xbox controller as the button prompts in games will not usually show the PlayStation ones.
            Yup, dualsense works without any issues, steam has bativexsupport for it and even the trigger force feedback thingy (although barely any games on pc support it)
        If it's on steam, it all works without issue, even Nintendo controllers
        If you're playing through steam then dushock/sense requires no additional drivers.
            Maybe thats the issue I was having, i was playing a few games from Epic and couldnt get my PS4 controllers to work consistently.
        I just bought a little Xbox thing from MS that plugs into my windows PC and it instantly recognized my Xbox series X controller.
        just use ds4windows. makes it so the computer thinks it a 360 controller
            good tip, thanks
        Game runs fine on Steam Deck.
        Can you use gyro aiming on Dualshocks?
        Newest Dualshock, Dualsense, can be used incredibly seamlessly as well in my experience.
        DualShock is a lot less effort then it used to be. Steam supports it without installing anything. Obviously not as integrated into windows as Xbox controllers but much better then a few years ago
        Thank you!
    Plug in an XB1 controller and it pretty much just works 1:1
Yeah let her know that Windows has full plug and play support for the Xbox controller and almost every modern game has full native Xbox controller support.

I use the Xbox Series X controller for gaming and fucking love it. 

I do recommend buying a dongle for it tho. Newer One X and Series X controllers have Bluetooth support, but IME it's very finicky. I think the issue is interference. Whatever the case, the dongle has been extremely reliable for me and noticeably more responsive than Bluetooth.
    Take the batteries out and use a cable.
Works awesome. Just plug it in while steam is launched and you‚Äôre good to go
Ya I‚Äôm def not trying to having more wires and more electronics just to play a single player game again with someone.
I‚Äôm not sure, I know my grandpa use to play ESO a lot when it first came out.
    I dream for the day/hope that I might have a wonderful relationship like your grandparents, because that‚Äôs goals right there ;-;
ESO is in the same story world as Skyrim, but it's a very different game. Hell it's made and maintained by a different company than Bethesda. You can definitely quest together with friends, but unless you're in a dungeon, you're often doing your quest objectives all by yourself, just with the company of friends. I call it playing together separately. 

You can attack the same creatures, but your party doesn't achieve the goals as a team, but individually. If one person doesn't get all the collectables or reach all the check points, they don't finish the quest even if their teammates completed it.

Overall ESO is a great game, just realize it's not Skyrim with friends.
Well they‚Äôre asking
Thanks for the vid its a bad ass looking mod, but holy shit those people are annoying.
    Yeah, they can get a bit 'screamy' but they're pretty funny for the most part.
        Ya, that wasn't a nice thing to say about them. I watch multiple YouTube channels that I'm sure are super annoying if you're only watching one random clip for 10 seconds.
Running an official server released by a reputable known company, sure.

Running a server created by some random modders you're unfamiliar with? Worth some caution.
    If the code is open source who cares?
        Just because it's open source, doesn't mean it's safe. It just means you can inspect it and build it yourself, if you were so inclined.

Again, I'm not saying it is not safe. I'm just saying it's prudent that someone would ask for more information about it before installing and running software that's opening up ports to the internet, as opposed to downloading something from Bethesda via Steam. Just answering the "why?" question that u/saarlac asked.
            That's not what I'm saying, I'm saying if it's a large enough project, as soon as someone discovers something shady there goes the mod team's good will forever. People *will* inspect it, is my point.
                https://www.zdnet.com/article/open-source-software-how-many-bugs-are-hidden-there-on-purpose/

there's really quite a lot of seriously negative stuff out there. 

> People will inspect it, is my point.

you'd be surprised. people are both sneaky and/or lazy. there's a few big examples of times where big open source projects had significant vulnerabilities put in.

    "Based" used to be slang to refer to someone speaking or acting in a manner that indicated that they were not swayed by public opinion.  It was usually used to describe someone who spoke against the common thought.  Over time, the meaning has changed to mean something like: "I agree with what this person is saying, and would like to be provocative about it."  It is further breaking down into being the same as "cool".
        I used to be an adventurer like you‚Ä¶‚Äù
    Based means bad. They used it wrong. Based could be used as "hitler was based". Or you could say "women dont deserve rights". That opinion is based.
        This is totally accurate on opposite day
            Nop. Its right. Yall are just using the old one. It USED to mean good, until people started over-using it sarcastically, so now ppl use it as the way i just described
                no, they dont. You are the one confused here.
                    Ive been told for years that it means bad. Only heard it used your way maybe once or twice

Basically Ulfric Stormcloak is the Donald Trump of Skyrim - an asshat born into wealth trying to seize power he doesn‚Äôt deserve based on a racist, facist campaign of demagoguery and outright violence.
    Man this is like a borderline mental illness at this point. Video games are not real life politics.
        No, they aren‚Äôt.  But we are talking about a fictional *politician*, and comparing a fake one to a real one is perfectly valid.
    I missed the part where the United States is a puppet state owned by genocidal Imperialist China.

    Skyrim runs on a potato these days. The game is almost 11 years old.
        Depends on how many mods you install, its been 5-6 years since I messed with it, but it can get pretty demanding.
            Stock Skyrim runs on a potato.
                no one alive plays stock Skyrim. ;-)
                    I know one person‚Ä¶ but she just recently got it. I suggested playing vanilla till she gets bored and then add in mods unless there‚Äôs something that‚Äôs really bugging her.
        The Special Edition (2016) has a bit higher requirements. 64bit, HD-textures, new shaders...

An i5 from 2014 or newer with Geforce 1080, 16gb ram and a SSD (or equivalents) should be enough to run the game in good quality without hiccups.

Used to play the SSE on an i5 from 2011, 8gb ram, GeForce 660TI. Had stable 60fps most of the time at medium settings, but I would recommend to aim for something stronger!
    Wether he accepts or not, good on you random redditor.
    Wholesome! You are awesome
    It'll run on that. I was using that before I upgraded 2 years ago.
    You‚Äôre a real one et_boy. I‚Äôll name my first son after you to commemorate this wholesome occasion
    I‚Äôm not familiar with comps that much but been looking to set up a pc. How much would that setup cost you normally?
        If you can find a video card for <$400, you can build an entire brand new mid-range setup for about $700-800. Then you just replace parts here and there for several years until the processor slot stops supporting newer ones. Then you probably have to shell out another $400.
        I would guess around $150 in used parts on eBay.
            Sweet thank you
    Skyrim will run on my basic laptop from 2017.
wholesome as hell  
Best of luck and best of fun to them!
You're a real one, OP.
Look into Steam Deck üòâ
    Yeah don‚Äôt do this.
        To each their own. I love my Steam Deck, though I of course have a gaming PC as well since the Deck can‚Äôt run everything (at least not at high settings for very long). For a grandma playing games like Skyrim the deck would be perfect.
you can put a pc back in the budget with this ultra low detail mod :P

[pcpartpicker.com](https://pcpartpicker.com) great place to get the best prices for parts.
You can use a controller to play on PC, with varying difficulty. Dualshock controllers require drivers to be installed, but xbox controllers are supported pretty much seamlessly.

edit: apparently dualshock controllers arent as problematic as i thought, see below for details
    doesnt ps now install the current dualshock drivers to pc?
        I don‚Äôt pretend to know anything about this, but I‚Äôve been able to play games with my ps5 controller corded to my pc. No clue if it‚Äôs fully supported or not but I‚Äôve not run into issues.
            So, Im on Windows 11 and my PS4 controller was just as plug n play as my Xbox controller.

No, they aren‚Äôt.  But we are talking about a fictional *politician*, and comparing a fake one to a real one is perfectly valid.
I missed the part where Skyrim is a puppet state owned by geoncidal overlords.  Throw away your Maga hat.

        Don‚Äôt own Skyrim‚Ä¶ or the Empire as a whole for that matter.
Yep, the small moments like this are why I keep coming back.

Edit: tense
Ok I know you mean like secure in the cab. But I can‚Äôt stop imagining you flying down country roads with a bare GTX 680 slamming around in the bed üò≠
    Don't worry, it's underneath a pile of wet leaves so it has cushioning
    "I nicknamed her Matilda."
    Who do you think is strapped into the passenger seat?
I also have a 970 (fans stuck at 100%) and a 2060 lying around and would give them for a good price
Depends on how many mods you install, its been 5-6 years since I messed with it, but it can get pretty demanding.
    Stock Skyrim runs on a potato.
        no one alive plays stock Skyrim. ;-)
            I know one person‚Ä¶ but she just recently got it. I suggested playing vanilla till she gets bored and then add in mods unless there‚Äôs something that‚Äôs really bugging her.
The Special Edition (2016) has a bit higher requirements. 64bit, HD-textures, new shaders...

An i5 from 2014 or newer with Geforce 1080, 16gb ram and a SSD (or equivalents) should be enough to run the game in good quality without hiccups.

Used to play the SSE on an i5 from 2011, 8gb ram, GeForce 660TI. Had stable 60fps most of the time at medium settings, but I would recommend to aim for something stronger!
If you can find a video card for <$400, you can build an entire brand new mid-range setup for about $700-800. Then you just replace parts here and there for several years until the processor slot stops supporting newer ones. Then you probably have to shell out another $400.
I would guess around $150 in used parts on eBay.
    Sweet thank you
To each their own. I love my Steam Deck, though I of course have a gaming PC as well since the Deck can‚Äôt run everything (at least not at high settings for very long). For a grandma playing games like Skyrim the deck would be perfect.
I don‚Äôt pretend to know anything about this, but I‚Äôve been able to play games with my ps5 controller corded to my pc. No clue if it‚Äôs fully supported or not but I‚Äôve not run into issues.
    So, Im on Windows 11 and my PS4 controller was just as plug n play as my Xbox controller. 

Just chiming in, idk too too much about this stuff.


Edit cause I had to P
    I‚Äôm pretty savvy and have used a  PS5 controller on PC with varying success. There are drivers for them, but I have not noticed a huge difference in reliability. Mostly, wireless/Bluetooth still has a number of issues. But wired will be more reliable, at least for now. Otherwise the controller works well on Windows 11 and 10. I would still recommend an xbox controller as the button prompts in games will not usually show the PlayStation ones.
Yup, dualsense works without any issues, steam has bativexsupport for it and even the trigger force feedback thingy (although barely any games on pc support it)
Maybe thats the issue I was having, i was playing a few games from Epic and couldnt get my PS4 controllers to work consistently.
good tip, thanks
That's not what I'm saying, I'm saying if it's a large enough project, as soon as someone discovers something shady there goes the mod team's good will forever. People *will* inspect it, is my point.

there's really quite a lot of seriously negative stuff out there. 

> People will inspect it, is my point.

you'd be surprised. people are both sneaky and/or lazy. there's a few big examples of times where big open source projects had significant vulnerabilities put in.
Wtf do you mean?
    Must be a /r/PoliticalCompassMemes association to the term, since they like to use it a lot over there.
        Everyone likes to use them, there‚Äôs nothing political about it at all

And it doesn‚Äôt need to be
            Fair enough, and I agree. /u/YEAHILIKEFATCHICKS what do you think?
Like how they ‚Äúco-opted‚Äù the okay? üëåüèª
Nop. Its right. Yall are just using the old one. It USED to mean good, until people started over-using it sarcastically, so now ppl use it as the way i just described
    no, they dont. You are the one confused here.
        Ive been told for years that it means bad. Only heard it used your way maybe once or twice
