[[I started my permadeath run to the center of the galaxy!]]


After i finished the story in my main save I've been procrastinating to get both the survival and permadeath trophies, so yesterday i started the permadeath run and here's a couple of cool shots, wish me luck! Grah!


Good luck!

I just finished mine a week or so ago. Somehow it was both easier and harder than I thought it would be. May RNGesus be in your favour ü§ô
    Thank you very much! I'm thinking of not cashing in the utopia speeder so it adds some more challenge to the run.
        I've done all the things, so it was difficult not to just go to the Anomaly and get a good ship and MT. Especially since all the reward ships have a decent number of slots already unlocked and inventory is an issue for me.

I did the Survival one first, and I used all the resources I had available to me. That meant it wasn't really that different from Normal, other than the inventory limits, so I wanted the Permadeath one to be a real challenge. I'm really happy I did it that way.
            I was hoping to do separate runs for each challenge, but I've been told if you do permadeath completes both survival and permadeath trophies :(

Yes exactly and also has built in technology and almost 1k light-year distance, i think I'll just stay with the initial ship all the way through to make it interesting.
                Perma does complete both, but you *can* do a separate run in Survival. I did Survival first. It was actually my save from the original Leviathan expedition. That was game-changing for me. It showed me I'm actually pretty decent at this game and I didn't need to tiptoe around, avoiding conflict. I've been kicking serious butt ever since üòÑ
                    I've very seldom died in this game due to conflict.  Mine are typically the exited your ship and fell through the space station types.  Have any if that happen in your attempts?
                        Not in my Perma or Survival attempts, but they were both 100% multiplayer OFF to minimize any NMS instability shenanigans. I had some pre-glitch warning signs at one point in my Perma save (stuttering, huge drop in frame rate), but I quit out before anything happened.
                            Nice, glad you made it without issue!
            the anomaly has ships?
                I've collected quite a few as rewards for completing expeditions and following Twitch streams. Also multitools, decorations, and all kinds of other cool stuff. All available at the Quicksilver vendor.
Good luck.  Concentrate on shields for exosuit & ship.  SAY "NO" TO GRENADE LAUNCHERS!
    Thanks for the advice! I've been running like crazy for sodium and oxygen flowers, it might be the difficulty mode but they barely replenish the bars even tho i use like 150 or 100 every time to recharge, i had a lot of luck and ran into an S exo suit upgrade right at the start so i have more exosuit energy bar.
        Nice.  If you're stuck for sodium, go into a cave and refine some marrow bulb.
            Wow wait a min, i can refine marrow bulb into sodium?
        They nerfed the plasma launcher so that you cam survive accidently launching one in a building if you have 3 S-ckass shield upgrades.
            I guess I'll have to wait till i have those S shields to install the plasma launcher!
        Killing a few animals right at the start fir meat can keep you alive.  Cave = cobalt = batteries.
    This is a big one and caught me a few times when I first started running Permadeath.

No grenade launchers of any kind.

Assign quick bar numbers for shield recharge.

Focus on S class life support upgrades.  I prefer to boost Solar Power and life support lasts a long time
        What does life support solar upgrades do, anyways? Does it just reduce how fast life support depletes? And if so, is it possible to go far enough that it adds?
            Yes, it slows how fast life support drains.

I don't think it recharges it, I've gotten mine very high with one on a supercharged slot and all other life support upgrades having high solar panel.   Mine doesn't recharge, but after a few steps, it stops draining while just walking.  I run and jetpack constantly and it drains a lot slower than normal.

That said, having a high capacity life support with efficient and powerful boost makes getting around super cheap and easy.  Best to balance the benefits of modules.  Like if one has a high life support but only average solar, and another has high solar but low life support, the first one would be overall more benefit.  Hunt those sentinels and keep trying the upgrades until you have a full set of powerful ones.  Good planning on synergy is a must.

This is on a permadeath save with 200 hours and no save scumming.

The exocraft and exosuit rechargers when placed on supercharged slots helps A LOT.  Especially the minotaur since it has protection against all environmental hazards built in, making it a mobile safe zone that with that upgrade practically never needs refueling.  With a few shield and cannon upgrades, it wrecks any amount of sentinels with ease and even functions underwater.  If actually playing on Permadeath and not just chasing the achievement, an upgraded Minotaur is a massive boon.  You can still be damaged, so it isn't truly safe, but far better than anything else.
                Thanks for the info!

The last time I'd played for any length of time, it *had* been on a Permadeath save because I'd just completed that one expedition and I wanted to chase the achievement, but then decided to just keep going. But then I stopped playing before the new inventory changes so I have little to no experience with supercharged things.

All that said, I don't think I can remember the last time I died in any playthrough. Maybe the two times I was required to in the one expedition.
                    Yea, those requires expedition deaths weren't actually dying, just part of the story.

Much like anything in game, it's pretty simple and some trial and error are great for figuring things out.  Though testing different buildouts gets expensive on the nanites QUICK.

Though requirements for the achievement and gameplay are very different.  For the achievement, it's a lot easier, just kit out an explorer ship with max jump drive and just keep jumping, maybe only stopping when a frigate module is available to buy and upgrade the freighter jump drive for better distance.

Hardly ever need to even leave the ship and doesn't take long.

Or farm portal glyphs and port in them just jump.
                Wow thanks for the info, very detailed!
Good luck. 

Bear in mind, that unless they changed it when they changed the availability of manual settings, the permadeath achievement also unlocks the survival one.
    It does. I just did it earlier today.
        Thanks for the confirmation. I imagined it still would.
    Oh thank God, now i understand why the stacks of minerals are only of 500, i hope it works, thanks for the info!
        It worked for me a couple months ago, which was after the big custom game settings change.

I was also able to speed run to the center. You learn 1 portal symbol, go to that one repeated (gets you close), and then just jump until you get to the center.
            That's the plan I'm trying to follow, so far I've been saving units and trying to find the first traveler in a space station, so far I managed to visit 6 systems yesterday and no luck!
                I remember having to save and reload a handful of times to make sure I found a portal from cartographer tasks.
That's the most badass NMS screenshot I've seen. You'll def succeed with that kind of energy.
    Omg thank you so much this means a lot to me!
get the first glyph, if you put only that in a portal, it takes you very close to the centre
    You can do this, but a) you still have to spend a fair amount of time getting the ability to use glyphs and b) it may just be me but it feels like cheating to do it this way. I warped from 700k out all the way in and I‚Äôm glad I did.
        Hi I know I'm late but could you expand on this a bit? I just started playing.
            Sure. In order to use a portal, you need to a) find it, b) power it and c) have glyphs unlocked to enter into it. Powering it takes a fair amount of resources, and you don‚Äôt learn the glyphs until later in the main story line. You can learn them from traveler graves, but then you need to find those. It‚Äôs not as simple as just go somewhere and do some thing. Plus the achievement of getting to the core, to me, implies an adventure with the core as the end goal. Simply skipping right to the core feels like it defeats the whole purpose.

  Now if you‚Äôre just galaxy hopping, by all means portal away. But I feel like that first core should be earned. üòÅ
    I've been told so, but I'm unsure If to follow this method or do it the old fashioned way with black holes, even tho it might get tedious at some point.
Good luck, I completed it a couple of months ago. It's the little things that will kill you. Remove the grenade launcher, don't leave the game running and walk away from the game for any length of time and always check life support and hazard protection is fully charged before leaving a safe area.
    Thank you very much and thanks for the advice! I almost die yesterday because I went afk for a couple mins I'll have to get used to only step out the game in safe situations!
        They reward is worth the journey.
            Per aspera ad astra!
Does the permadeath mode increase the difficulty? Like, do sentinals deal more damage or do you get less resources?
    Yeah it does:

- increased drain on hazard protection, life support, mining tool etc
- fewer resources obtained when mining
- lower stack capacity
- take more damage from hostiles (pirates were the bain of my existence)
- deal less damage

I just smashed through the main story because it's the quickest way to the centre of the galaxy without faffing with portals. 

I only did it for the achievement, the pace of the game completely changes in survival/permadeath playthroughs and it's not really my thing
        Alright, sounds interesting. Guess I know what I'll be doing when I finished my exams
    As far as I know it does, it also reduces the stack size to 500, 250 or less depending on the resource, making it difficult to fill up on resources I'm enjoying the challenge!
    Weapon damage is decreased on the player side as well
    Also: it costs an insane amount of salvaged data to unlock parts.
800hrs later I still have my perma save and a second approaching 200hrs. It feels more like the way the game should be played to me
    Yess, it gives a vibe of constant danger where on regular mode feels like a walk in the park!
I've seen way sexier ships on my permadeath run (withou using someone else's find) than my main run.
    I hope i have the same luck!
Yea, I died on my best permadeath because of the pirates attacking me when I was walking on the surface, I went underground which I thought I‚Äôd be safe but I still died from the laser beams going clipping through the ground
    Aw man that's real bad luck :(
I've been meaning to run this for the cheezments since I've heard bout it but just haven't cause I've been busy just trying to complete the "storyline" of the game. I've only put in just over 100hrs and most of that has been just dik'n around gathering good mods and stockpiling resources.... I feelz of teh lazy... üòÖ
    I think we all have done that, i have around that amount of hours in my main, i did also wander quite a lot in the Utopia expedition üòÇ
Good luck! You can do it!
    Thank you very much!
Started mine a few days ago. Good luck
    Thank you very much!! Good luck with yours too!
That first pic is the coolest screenshot I've ever seen from this game.
    Thank you so much this means a lot to me!
Good Luck!
    Thank you very much! Grah!
Good luck! You should be fine. I prepped for permadeath with a survival run of 35 hours to core. I regret using the glyphs, as my permadeath sprint to the core only took 13 hours ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)
    Thank you very much! And wow that sounds like you did it fast!
        Honestly too fast, I was paranoid of some bug happening so I raced to the core. With 2 save files it makes it difficult to really screw up though. I was too cautious and didn‚Äôt really get to enjoy it to the fullest. If I do it again I‚Äôll definitely take my time.
            I hope you get to enjoy it next time!
Congrats & good luck Traveller! I only got mine done about a month ago and been playing since essentially the beginning
    Thank you very much! I bought the game as soon as it came out but i put it down bc of what happened ( the lies) and i bought it again about 3 weeks ago for PS5, and I've been putting hours in like crazy ü§£

The game is amazing, now it's what they promised when it came out!
Good luck traveler, remember to buy armor and health upgrades asap, save every chance you get, and never use ANY type of grenade launcher.
    Thank you very much! And thank you for the advices, I've heard the grenade launcher one a couple of times I'll be sure to stay away from it!
Bro first pic üóø... btw, what'ur NMS name, dm me... great
    Thank you very much! My name in the game is tomi3006 if you see me around make sure to say hi!
GL, Keep Safe and stay prepared just finished mine today.

    Thank you very much! And congratulations!! I hope I'll get mine soon!
Good luck!  
I have two saves: one where I allow myself to use things like the refiner glitch to duplicate items, look up ship / multitool / coordinates online, and other shortcuts. My second save is a permadeath game in which I don't allow myself to exploit glitches, spoilers, or cheats. I successfully made it to the center of the galaxy in that one. It was actually a little easier than I thought, TBH.  Just took a while.
    Thank you very much! The idea is to do this run legit no glitches no nothing, I'll keep posting my progress!
The new mist/fog around artifact sites really makes it look amazing
    Yess i love how they look after all the updates, compared to the game as it came out it's a complete different game!
Good luck and DON'T INSTALL THE ROCKET BOOTS.
    Thank you very much! First time hearing that one, is there something wrong with the rocket boots?
        It's a great way to accidentally yeet yourself off a cliff, or off a frigate and into deep space. Trust me.
            I see, i had an awesome luck yesterday and found a flying companion that goes quite fast so i think I'm good off the rocket boots for now!
Permadeath has been my favorite game mode for a while now. Keep going after you finish your run to the center you'll be glad you did
    I'm enjoying it so far! The thrill of losing the save gives it a little bit more of spice!
        Caves are your your friend, and don't jump too high lol
            Oh yeah that's the first one i started taking into account, the falls take out a big chunk of health! Thanks for the advice!
Good luck! Besides the achievement, do you get anything?
    Thank you very much! And besides the achievement I'd say the personal satisfaction of such accomplishment!
good luck!
    Thank you very much!
Number one rule for permadeath runs. DO NOT install the plasma grenade option on your multi tool.
    Thank you! I've heard that one a lot i imagine must be one of the most common causes of death in MMS!
Good luck!!! It will be a challenge for sure!
    Thank you very much!
I had my started as well, but I started the permadeath run in VR and it terrifies me too much to play lol
    Omg that must be amazing i can't wait to try it on VR!
Good luck! I seriously just finished my permadeath run today! I just had to have that trophy.üòÖ
    Thank you very much! And congratulations on your feat!
Good luck and have fun.
    Thank you very much!
May the glitches be ever in your favor.
    Thank you -skzzzzt- much!
DO NOT GET COMPLACENT!!!

I have died on multiple saves at 60+ hours each for the stupidest of reasons. Always play it safe! 

Stay away from angry sentinels. Run from aggressive fauna. NO WHISPERING EGGS! No high places!
    Sir yes sir! Thank you for the advice! So far I've been able to manage, if i get sentinel attention i just dig a hole and wait it out, i don't think with the weapon i have at the moment i could defeat em yet.
Currently on mine too. 20 hours in, I'm taking it slow. Best of luck to you and enjoy the ride/flight.
    Thank you very much! And good luck on yours too Traveler! I'll see you in the center of the Galaxy!
How hard is this? i will try to get all achievements and im missing 3, this one and 2 in survival
    Well so far it's been a lil bit of a challenge, pirates almost kick my ass yesterday thankfully I managed at the last sec!
Did you notice a sharp difficulty increase in space combat?

I recently started the same endeavour (on PC) and I can't get out of a freighter battle (~6-8 opponents to shoot down) without getting most of my weapons or upgrade modules fried.

I am currently flying my starter ship, upgraded to B-Class with full S-class upgrades on shields + Photon Canon, as well as Cyclotron Ballista with one S-class upgrade.
It is not enough. Now, I am grinding nanites and crashed ships to upgrade it to A- and then S-class, and I want a 3rd weapon system on board. Despite shields not being depleted, I often lose at least one weapon system during the fight.

Would be interested to know if you're having similar difficulties.
    Yes i did, pirates seem to have pin point accuracy, i almost go down yesterday a couple of times, even in some cases i had to abuse of the space anomaly and if you position your freighter around the area you need or close by you can hit and hide too.

On the other hand for me the worst has been ground combat, the weather drains a lot and very fast even with upgrades, so when i get some predators on a planet or sentinels it's where i really struggle, i haven't been able to find a good multitool yet, I've been grinding units to hopefully get a good one today!
Thank you very much! I'm thinking of not cashing in the utopia speeder so it adds some more challenge to the run.
    I've done all the things, so it was difficult not to just go to the Anomaly and get a good ship and MT. Especially since all the reward ships have a decent number of slots already unlocked and inventory is an issue for me.

        the anomaly has ships?
            I've collected quite a few as rewards for completing expeditions and following Twitch streams. Also multitools, decorations, and all kinds of other cool stuff. All available at the Quicksilver vendor.

        Wow wait a min, i can refine marrow bulb into sodium?
    They nerfed the plasma launcher so that you cam survive accidently launching one in a building if you have 3 S-ckass shield upgrades.
        I guess I'll have to wait till i have those S shields to install the plasma launcher!
    Killing a few animals right at the start fir meat can keep you alive.  Cave = cobalt = batteries.

Thank you -skzzzzt- much!
Sir yes sir! Thank you for the advice! So far I've been able to manage, if i get sentinel attention i just dig a hole and wait it out, i don't think with the weapon i have at the moment i could defeat em yet.
Thank you very much! And good luck on yours too Traveler! I'll see you in the center of the Galaxy!
Well so far it's been a lil bit of a challenge, pirates almost kick my ass yesterday thankfully I managed at the last sec!
Yes i did, pirates seem to have pin point accuracy, i almost go down yesterday a couple of times, even in some cases i had to abuse of the space anomaly and if you position your freighter around the area you need or close by you can hit and hide too.

On the other hand for me the worst has been ground combat, the weather drains a lot and very fast even with upgrades, so when i get some predators on a planet or sentinels it's where i really struggle, i haven't been able to find a good multitool yet, I've been grinding units to hopefully get a good one today!
I've done all the things, so it was difficult not to just go to the Anomaly and get a good ship and MT. Especially since all the reward ships have a decent number of slots already unlocked and inventory is an issue for me.

I did the Survival one first, and I used all the resources I had available to me. That meant it wasn't really that different from Normal, other than the inventory limits, so I wanted the Permadeath one to be a real challenge. I'm really happy I did it that way.
    I was hoping to do separate runs for each challenge, but I've been told if you do permadeath completes both survival and permadeath trophies :(

Yes exactly and also has built in technology and almost 1k light-year distance, i think I'll just stay with the initial ship all the way through to make it interesting.
        Perma does complete both, but you *can* do a separate run in Survival. I did Survival first. It was actually my save from the original Leviathan expedition. That was game-changing for me. It showed me I'm actually pretty decent at this game and I didn't need to tiptoe around, avoiding conflict. I've been kicking serious butt ever since üòÑ
            I've very seldom died in this game due to conflict.  Mine are typically the exited your ship and fell through the space station types.  Have any if that happen in your attempts?
                Not in my Perma or Survival attempts, but they were both 100% multiplayer OFF to minimize any NMS instability shenanigans. I had some pre-glitch warning signs at one point in my Perma save (stuttering, huge drop in frame rate), but I quit out before anything happened.
                    Nice, glad you made it without issue!
    the anomaly has ships?
        I've collected quite a few as rewards for completing expeditions and following Twitch streams. Also multitools, decorations, and all kinds of other cool stuff. All available at the Quicksilver vendor.
Nice.  If you're stuck for sodium, go into a cave and refine some marrow bulb.
    Wow wait a min, i can refine marrow bulb into sodium?
They nerfed the plasma launcher so that you cam survive accidently launching one in a building if you have 3 S-ckass shield upgrades.
    I guess I'll have to wait till i have those S shields to install the plasma launcher!
Killing a few animals right at the start fir meat can keep you alive.  Cave = cobalt = batteries.
What does life support solar upgrades do, anyways? Does it just reduce how fast life support depletes? And if so, is it possible to go far enough that it adds?
    Yes, it slows how fast life support drains.

I don't think it recharges it, I've gotten mine very high with one on a supercharged slot and all other life support upgrades having high solar panel.   Mine doesn't recharge, but after a few steps, it stops draining while just walking.  I run and jetpack constantly and it drains a lot slower than normal.

That said, having a high capacity life support with efficient and powerful boost makes getting around super cheap and easy.  Best to balance the benefits of modules.  Like if one has a high life support but only average solar, and another has high solar but low life support, the first one would be overall more benefit.  Hunt those sentinels and keep trying the upgrades until you have a full set of powerful ones.  Good planning on synergy is a must.

This is on a permadeath save with 200 hours and no save scumming.

The exocraft and exosuit rechargers when placed on supercharged slots helps A LOT.  Especially the minotaur since it has protection against all environmental hazards built in, making it a mobile safe zone that with that upgrade practically never needs refueling.  With a few shield and cannon upgrades, it wrecks any amount of sentinels with ease and even functions underwater.  If actually playing on Permadeath and not just chasing the achievement, an upgraded Minotaur is a massive boon.  You can still be damaged, so it isn't truly safe, but far better than anything else.
        Thanks for the info!

The last time I'd played for any length of time, it *had* been on a Permadeath save because I'd just completed that one expedition and I wanted to chase the achievement, but then decided to just keep going. But then I stopped playing before the new inventory changes so I have little to no experience with supercharged things.

All that said, I don't think I can remember the last time I died in any playthrough. Maybe the two times I was required to in the one expedition.
            Yea, those requires expedition deaths weren't actually dying, just part of the story.

Much like anything in game, it's pretty simple and some trial and error are great for figuring things out.  Though testing different buildouts gets expensive on the nanites QUICK.

Though requirements for the achievement and gameplay are very different.  For the achievement, it's a lot easier, just kit out an explorer ship with max jump drive and just keep jumping, maybe only stopping when a frigate module is available to buy and upgrade the freighter jump drive for better distance.

Hardly ever need to even leave the ship and doesn't take long.

Or farm portal glyphs and port in them just jump.
        Wow thanks for the info, very detailed!
Thanks for the confirmation. I imagined it still would.
It worked for me a couple months ago, which was after the big custom game settings change.

I was also able to speed run to the center. You learn 1 portal symbol, go to that one repeated (gets you close), and then just jump until you get to the center.
    That's the plan I'm trying to follow, so far I've been saving units and trying to find the first traveler in a space station, so far I managed to visit 6 systems yesterday and no luck!
        I remember having to save and reload a handful of times to make sure I found a portal from cartographer tasks.
Hi I know I'm late but could you expand on this a bit? I just started playing.
    Sure. In order to use a portal, you need to a) find it, b) power it and c) have glyphs unlocked to enter into it. Powering it takes a fair amount of resources, and you don‚Äôt learn the glyphs until later in the main story line. You can learn them from traveler graves, but then you need to find those. It‚Äôs not as simple as just go somewhere and do some thing. Plus the achievement of getting to the core, to me, implies an adventure with the core as the end goal. Simply skipping right to the core feels like it defeats the whole purpose.

  Now if you‚Äôre just galaxy hopping, by all means portal away. But I feel like that first core should be earned. üòÅ
They reward is worth the journey.
    Per aspera ad astra!
Alright, sounds interesting. Guess I know what I'll be doing when I finished my exams
Honestly too fast, I was paranoid of some bug happening so I raced to the core. With 2 save files it makes it difficult to really screw up though. I was too cautious and didn‚Äôt really get to enjoy it to the fullest. If I do it again I‚Äôll definitely take my time.
    I hope you get to enjoy it next time!
It's a great way to accidentally yeet yourself off a cliff, or off a frigate and into deep space. Trust me.
    I see, i had an awesome luck yesterday and found a flying companion that goes quite fast so i think I'm good off the rocket boots for now!
Caves are your your friend, and don't jump too high lol
    Oh yeah that's the first one i started taking into account, the falls take out a big chunk of health! Thanks for the advice!
