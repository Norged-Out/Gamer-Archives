[[How to properly revive your teammate!]]





They came out so beautifully spaced, like a jacky chan movie with one enemy attacking at a time
    Now that you put this image into my head, I need someone to overlay some Jackie Chan movie sound effects ASAP.

Edit: Fuck it, I have 1700 Reddit coins that I have no use for. I‚Äôll give gold to whoever makes a decent quality edit. I need at least one Wilhelm scream on the falling enemies though.

Edit #2: Wow... hats off to /u/paoper. That was literally exactly how I imagined it in my head. The Wilhelm scream was absolutely perfect too. The fade in the audio as they fell had me cracking up. You went absolutely above and beyond. Definitely earned your gold.
        Alright, /u/ThatGuyDes

Edit 1: Youtube link incase my server dies. https://youtu.be/dZ1hvvrJ7Iw

Edit 2: Thank you for the gold, /u/ThatGuyDes
            Ha! ‚ÄúShe was the bomb‚Äù
            This is perfect! Exactly what I was imagining! Thanks for taking the time to make this. Hold this shiny award for me!
                Thank you much, kind person. :)
                Honestly I'm really glad you actually got what you wanted (it was a genuinely good suggestion). Also I found the edit to your comment referencing mine hilarious, props man :)

/u/PapaJulietZulu you're the real MVP!
                    Thanks man! Since I got bamboozled I thought I‚Äôd get revenge by helping you bamboozle some more people! Congrats on all the awards too! Haha
                        Haha thanks, though they're wasted on me, I'd rather people donate to a worthy cause. Thought about adding that in an edit but I also hate those thanks-for-the-gold-edits, so  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

            I‚Äôm so mad that this is down here being buried by a fucking Rick roll. This is perfectly done.
                me too man... what have I done...
                    Just edit you comment saying it was a rick roll and to scroll down to see something worthwhile I guess? Haha idk It might be too late.
            The Wilhelm scream was perfect
            I love you for this lmao
            I got RickRolled twice to get to this. Worth it

            You bastard.....
            *Mirage has entered the chat*
            an ad played ahead of the video so I saw the title first. Ads ruin everything.
                I have Apollo installed, so I spotted the Rickroll without even having to leave Reddit. Thanks, Apollo! <3
                    Apollo mains rise up!
                        Wait shit I missed it. We risin up for something?

            For such a quickly thrown together video, that was perfect!
                Agreed!
            Man, that's some god tier editing.
                The cinematography was... *chef's kiss
            Its 2020 and i‚Äôve been legitimately rickrolled.
            It's been a while since I legitimately fell for one of these, I always see them coming...
            Joke‚Äôs on u, it gave me an add and I saw the title. (Damn that probably still counts)
            I fucking hate(love) you! Wtf man lol I feel so goddamn dumb
            Take my poor man's gold üèÖ
            Well played you bastard
            Soo.. There is no edit? :(
                There is, see /u/PapaJulietZulu 's comment!
                    Oh thanks so much!!
            This is why I have trust issues
            YOU DICK
            I watched the whole video because i actually enjoy it
            That got me
            Nicely done. Have an updoot
                Have a consolation upvote.
            First time I‚Äôve ever got rick rolled, does it still count if it was muted?
        I will take you by your word /u/ThatGuyDes . 

[Here is an edit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX7zBGqb_Dg&feature=youtu.be) with Jackie Chan sound effects +1 Wilhelm scream
            Someone posted an edit literally one minute before you, but seeing that you also have an awesome edit, I think both of you guys deserve some gold! A deal‚Äôs a deal!
                Well thank you for that ^^

Even tho its a small edit, it took 1h to compleat it

            Say less my man! I‚Äôm eagerly waiting

        Speaking of Jackie chan just watched the movie Police story today. Great fucking movie with good stunts
            The hanging on a bus stunt is nuts.
                I'd have to look it up again but I'm pretty sure he did that stunt with a couple broken bones. The guy was nuts in his younger days. They hide all his casts in baggy clothes and he just loads up on pain meds and has at it.
    Damn, they ain't gonna be in Rush Hour 3
    In Jackie Chan movie he always get attacked from multiple people at the same time...
    I‚Äôm pretty sure that Jackie NEVER had this in his movies, what made him an incredible director was he wanted guys to be attacking all at once all the time. He‚Äôs constantly fighting 2/3 guys at a time
    Pretty much all of my random teammates are Jackie Chan movie villains
    They appeared to the beat of the music i was listening to and I had a sensible chuckle.
    They clearly didn't have very good communication
    I'm guessing the M50s are the best.

    LMAO!!!
    Such a long portal that by the time the first guy could communicate he was falling, the last guy was already entering the portal.
And that‚Äôs why you should never go through an enemy‚Äôs portal kids
    I go through enemy portals all the time. I enjoy the surprise.
        Me too! It‚Äôs always like ‚ÄúFuck it, let‚Äôs take their portal!!‚Äù
            Gibby main. I like to take the portal, drop my ult, portal back.   

It has yet to pay off but I know one day it will.
                I so it with caustic, I go down but take one other person down with me at least
                I always end up holding ult on gib so long. I want it available at the end of every single game. I've won a few games just but dropping my ult and sitting in my shield with my team.
                    did one today.  2 man squad vs. 3.  got a double knockdown with an ult on the 3rd team remaining.  Then retreated to the 2nd to last circle.  hit the accellerant crack pipe and was able to ulted them behind a wall I couldn't throw a grenade over. Rushed in with devotion as they tried to heal, knocked 2 and got knocked.  Partner came in behind and mopped up the last.

I generally hold one if not 2 ult accellerants at all times.  nothing wins a standoff like 2 gibby ults in 60 seconds.  Hey Rampart, raining down some destruction."
                        I'm so sad they nerfed the accelerant to 20% :( but Loba ult charges waaay faster so as a Loba main I feel it balanced (not sure about others' ult time tho)
                    Haven't played Gibby in a while but I always used his ult in every full-squad confrontation I could. The number of times it saved our asses in the early and mid-round game is far higher than when I've been saved by it at the end.
                You can get away with it as Pathy if you hit a grapple as soon as you come out.
                I like to do the same in middle of a zipline. zip one way, drop ult, jump 180 degrees and zip the other way. I find it incredibly satisfying to suddenly change the zipping direction.
    as a wraith mine i was playing with a caustic. They were hot on our trail so i portaled myself and the caustic (we were probably half health. And i placed the end of the portal mid air on the side of a giant drop that you can only use a zipline to get up. Caustic immediately figured out what was gonna happen and started putting a couple of barrels. Sure enough both come through and we kill them both easily. Was one of my most satysfying kills ever
    The cake is a lie?
Ah the rare and incredibly satisfying triple punch off map
    Triple Take?  Nah man, triple PUNCH
        Triple Give!
            Triple kiss?
                Triple finger
                Lol, reminds me of the game grumps spider kiss bit
                    You got it! Seemed fitting
I would have uninstalled
    Fair
Oh my god. I thought it was just a revive ... but sweet Jesus. That was clean AF.

But u out played them

Nice
    I wonder.. What kind of tragic event led to this mindset? xD
"What are we doing here? Something has gone wrong hasn't it? Lifelines voice joined in from behind the fireplace"
"No this is exactly where we want to be" Gibraltar said sarcastically
    Is this a reference to something? I feel like I know it.
        Harry Potter, I think.
            Yeah thought it sounded like something from HP, can't remember which book though.

                    Oh yes, when they get trapped behind like an electric fire or something?
    Fucking YES üòÇüòÇüòÇ

            Uh, I‚Äôd also like to express my fondness for that particular big brain play
            Yote
            Yeet or be Yeeted, amiright?
    Do people actually talk like this?
It‚Äôs like they were queuing up. This is so beautiful. If there is an Apex Wall of Fake/Shame then this needs to go there.
Your brain is fucking huge.
i know this portal from playground
Broooooooo WHAAAAT
Live by the Y E E T, die by the Y E E T.
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES. I hate Wraith so much, but this is EPIC beyond belief. I'm still laughing. hahaha.
YEET
I laughed
Beautiful
Thats the big **** energy.

Big brain!
Yo how did you pull this of in ranked bro that's elite
Who falls for this. It's worse than getting bamboozled. You never go in an enemy portal. It 100% always a trap

I love it

omgggggggggggggg
That was beautiful
Show me the fucking Video reddit
BRUH
I am getting old.  I used to be pretty good at UT back in the day, but idk what's happening in these new fps games,   Fortnite's even more perplexing with the building structures mid fight.
    Ya just gotta jump in and have a crack mate, I used to play UT aswel
    So basically his teammate was down (they were still alive, but they were out of hp, couldn't do anything but crawl and needed a teammate to revive them) some distance away from the edge of this map. 

OP's character can create portals, and she made one right next to the edge, but far enough that her downed teammate could use it and not fall off. The enemy team obviously followed her through the portal, but then OP melees all of them, knocking them off the map
    If you liked the fast paced nature of UT then give Apex a go, or if you want stupidly fast paced then try Hyper Scape. If you want absolute chaos, try Fall Guys haha.
Best play I've seen yet

Incredible
Here from r/all

This game looks really fun. Can my surfacebook 2 run it?
You went from the biggest piece of shit I've ever seen to MLG in about 5 seconds lmao.
Ah yes the for honor tactic
This is GODLY
Now thats a punchline!
I legit thought this was about to be a team killing post and question why it has so much upvotes. Thank god its not and even better
Oh wraith you sneaky little devil
[deleted]
    Sums up this braindead subreddit.
oml, at first i thought he was gonna make his teammate fall through the portal, instead something beautiful happened
Thought this was going an entirely different direction.
I would be so mad if I was that squad
Been on this subreddit since launch and I have never seen so much Karma, awards, or comments in barely half a day's time.

A sight to behold.
This definitely deserves every single like and award, this is absolutely amazing
How many awards
more like to become kill leader in 5 seconds
Dis is what I call bigbrain
Nothing personel kid (Yes I spelt it wrong on purpose)
I laughed too hard at this üòÇ

Awesome üò≠üò≠üò≠ü§£
nice one üëå
And this why is why people need to start using a mic in game if they solo que lolol but ya this is gold
    This is why you don't take random portals, especially ones where you don't know where it will lead.
That's brilliant
yeah, this is big brain time
1000 iq
Thats the trolliest team elimination Ive seen. It's beautiful
God don't just flop it out on the table like that. Good lord.
Amazing
Why the hell did 2 downed enemies chase...
    They weren't downed, you can see them start to raise up right before getting socked. Either they came through crouched or it's part of the port animation. I've never paid attention to it though.
I was actually expecting this to be a humor post. Like killing off the crypto and respawning them but I guess this works...
That's just beautiful üëäüèªüëäüèªüëäüèª
I wish I had such ideas playing wraith. she is so powerful and I am just bad with her. Guess I need to put in some more work with her. Awesome clip!
    Most of the time your teammate is wraith, they fuck off at the first sign of a fight and you have to watch them play for a few mins while they let you bleed out and your banner expire.
Do my eyes deceive me or is that kings canyon. I thought it was removed from season 6. Or this this clip old
That was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

   just whoa
Omfg !! This is the best I've seen üòÇ
WHY am I watching this on repeat

I can't stop, someone help
Hands up satan

Well played lad, IQ score Einstein level!
That was amazing, I‚Äôm gonna do this more. I can‚Äôt wait to the map to be kings canyon again.
Big brain gaming
IQ plays over 9000!
This is quite possibly the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. 

Sorry to my wife and child but nothing beats this.
At first I was like...."okay any Wraith knows this trick." Then I was like...."NO WAY!"  So good.
Now I see why she so OP
IS that what 10,000 hours of wraith play looks like?
hahahahaha
Genius
The entire fuxking cirkus man
Pretty sure something Is said about this in Space Geneva Conventions.
That‚Äôs some ACME Looney Tunes level shit, love it!

Damn, I don't play this game but that was like IQ 9000!
I would be so pissed, but I would still applaud, thats friggin brilliant!
imagine those guys hope on reddit today and their clip XD
Looks like a crazy game and suppose that the move was peak big brain.
Spectacular
It just gets better and better every time
Insane!! Imma have to try this out.
More effective if you are helping them fight, hide and portal out if needed. Good thinking tho
    Would it have been though?
This is breathtaking!
This is why I loved the concept of apex. I just wish it was better executed.
Well good game!
IQ 500
That‚Äôs amazing.

That move was so sweet I got cavities
RIP PATHFINDER
Bravo
What is the name of this game??!?
Man you got som skill's
Is king canyon back or it is old footage?
Why did you start maining wraith?

Me:  thinking about this video.  "You know she has a small profile and a lot of tactical options."
Bruh this is like the oldest trick of apex
F
Damn lucio!!
BIG BRAIN
She's allowed to say what‚Äôs happening.

My teammates let me die to get a bowl of chips and gamer juice ü§°
Am I the only one who refuses to use a foreign portal? 

every time I tried in the past it just never works out well for me so I quit doing it months ago
Wow I don't really play Wraith but this made me want to just to punch people off cliffs
NICE!
Jesus, what do yall do to play with some of these braindead teams?

Most OP play with wraith‚Äôs portal i ever seen ... i hope i get a teammate like this wraith i only get lifelines who dont revive nd only push for kills nd die
Dude you killed it!
Meanwhile I can barely kill someone with the pistol at the beginning of a match.
üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Bravo Bravo!
This is legendary.
I‚Äôd hate to see you play For Honor... 0.0
Brilliant. Although, I see this less of a ‚Äúhow to revive‚Äù and more of a ‚Äúhow to outsmart your opponents‚Äù.
And the kills counts you?
Wow
Omg that was amazing.
This is great op!
beautiful
Big brain
Wow 200iq play
Classic
BbbbbbbBamboozled!!!

Now that you put this image into my head, I need someone to overlay some Jackie Chan movie sound effects ASAP.

Edit: Fuck it, I have 1700 Reddit coins that I have no use for. I‚Äôll give gold to whoever makes a decent quality edit. I need at least one Wilhelm scream on the falling enemies though.

Edit #2: Wow... hats off to /u/paoper. That was literally exactly how I imagined it in my head. The Wilhelm scream was absolutely perfect too. The fade in the audio as they fell had me cracking up. You went absolutely above and beyond. Definitely earned your gold.
    Alright, /u/ThatGuyDes

Edit 2: Thank you for the gold, /u/ThatGuyDes
        Ha! ‚ÄúShe was the bomb‚Äù
        This is perfect! Exactly what I was imagining! Thanks for taking the time to make this. Hold this shiny award for me!
            Thank you much, kind person. :)
            Honestly I'm really glad you actually got what you wanted (it was a genuinely good suggestion). Also I found the edit to your comment referencing mine hilarious, props man :)

/u/PapaJulietZulu you're the real MVP!
                Thanks man! Since I got bamboozled I thought I‚Äôd get revenge by helping you bamboozle some more people! Congrats on all the awards too! Haha
                    Haha thanks, though they're wasted on me, I'd rather people donate to a worthy cause. Thought about adding that in an edit but I also hate those thanks-for-the-gold-edits, so  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

        I‚Äôm so mad that this is down here being buried by a fucking Rick roll. This is perfectly done.
            me too man... what have I done...
                Just edit you comment saying it was a rick roll and to scroll down to see something worthwhile I guess? Haha idk It might be too late.
        The Wilhelm scream was perfect
        I love you for this lmao
        I got RickRolled twice to get to this. Worth it

        an ad played ahead of the video so I saw the title first. Ads ruin everything.

        Man, that's some god tier editing.

        Its 2020 and i‚Äôve been legitimately rickrolled.
        It's been a while since I legitimately fell for one of these, I always see them coming...
        Joke‚Äôs on u, it gave me an add and I saw the title. (Damn that probably still counts)

        This is why I have trust issues
        YOU DICK
        I watched the whole video because i actually enjoy it
        That got me
        Nicely done. Have an updoot
            Have a consolation upvote.
        First time I‚Äôve ever got rick rolled, does it still count if it was muted?
    I will take you by your word /u/ThatGuyDes . 

[Here is an edit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX7zBGqb_Dg&feature=youtu.be) with Jackie Chan sound effects +1 Wilhelm scream
        Someone posted an edit literally one minute before you, but seeing that you also have an awesome edit, I think both of you guys deserve some gold! A deal‚Äôs a deal!
            Well thank you for that ^^

Even tho its a small edit, it took 1h to compleat it

    Speaking of Jackie chan just watched the movie Police story today. Great fucking movie with good stunts
        The hanging on a bus stunt is nuts.
            I'd have to look it up again but I'm pretty sure he did that stunt with a couple broken bones. The guy was nuts in his younger days. They hide all his casts in baggy clothes and he just loads up on pain meds and has at it.
Damn, they ain't gonna be in Rush Hour 3
In Jackie Chan movie he always get attacked from multiple people at the same time...
I‚Äôm pretty sure that Jackie NEVER had this in his movies, what made him an incredible director was he wanted guys to be attacking all at once all the time. He‚Äôs constantly fighting 2/3 guys at a time
Pretty much all of my random teammates are Jackie Chan movie villains
They appeared to the beat of the music i was listening to and I had a sensible chuckle.
They clearly didn't have very good communication
I'm guessing the M50s are the best.

Such a long portal that by the time the first guy could communicate he was falling, the last guy was already entering the portal.
I go through enemy portals all the time. I enjoy the surprise.
    Me too! It‚Äôs always like ‚ÄúFuck it, let‚Äôs take their portal!!‚Äù
        Gibby main. I like to take the portal, drop my ult, portal back.   

It has yet to pay off but I know one day it will.
            I so it with caustic, I go down but take one other person down with me at least
            I always end up holding ult on gib so long. I want it available at the end of every single game. I've won a few games just but dropping my ult and sitting in my shield with my team.
                did one today.  2 man squad vs. 3.  got a double knockdown with an ult on the 3rd team remaining.  Then retreated to the 2nd to last circle.  hit the accellerant crack pipe and was able to ulted them behind a wall I couldn't throw a grenade over. Rushed in with devotion as they tried to heal, knocked 2 and got knocked.  Partner came in behind and mopped up the last.

I generally hold one if not 2 ult accellerants at all times.  nothing wins a standoff like 2 gibby ults in 60 seconds.  Hey Rampart, raining down some destruction."
                    I'm so sad they nerfed the accelerant to 20% :( but Loba ult charges waaay faster so as a Loba main I feel it balanced (not sure about others' ult time tho)
                Haven't played Gibby in a while but I always used his ult in every full-squad confrontation I could. The number of times it saved our asses in the early and mid-round game is far higher than when I've been saved by it at the end.
            You can get away with it as Pathy if you hit a grapple as soon as you come out.
            I like to do the same in middle of a zipline. zip one way, drop ult, jump 180 degrees and zip the other way. I find it incredibly satisfying to suddenly change the zipping direction.
as a wraith mine i was playing with a caustic. They were hot on our trail so i portaled myself and the caustic (we were probably half health. And i placed the end of the portal mid air on the side of a giant drop that you can only use a zipline to get up. Caustic immediately figured out what was gonna happen and started putting a couple of barrels. Sure enough both come through and we kill them both easily. Was one of my most satysfying kills ever
The cake is a lie?
Triple Take?  Nah man, triple PUNCH
    Triple Give!
        Triple kiss?
            Triple finger
            Lol, reminds me of the game grumps spider kiss bit
                You got it! Seemed fitting
Fair
The real void is in their skulls
    The real void was the friends we made along the way
*ONE PUNCHHHHHHHH*

*epic guitar riff intensifies*
I refuse to believe that wraith is anything other than a gender bent speed of sound sonic
Saitama‚Äôam
I wonder.. What kind of tragic event led to this mindset? xD
Is this a reference to something? I feel like I know it.
    Harry Potter, I think.
        Yeah thought it sounded like something from HP, can't remember which book though.
            Goblet of fire.  Right at the beginning when the Weasleys come to take Harry to the world cup
                Oh yes, when they get trapped behind like an electric fire or something?
Fucking YES üòÇüòÇüòÇ
It‚Äôs like a metal bat.
    Those shields are pretty sturdy
Yeah so lit fam
    They got YEETED!
        Uh, I‚Äôd also like to express my fondness for that particular big brain play
        Yote
        Yeet or be Yeeted, amiright?
Do people actually talk like this?
Hahahha wtf are these portal noises? lol
    Yeah c:
Ya just gotta jump in and have a crack mate, I used to play UT aswel
So basically his teammate was down (they were still alive, but they were out of hp, couldn't do anything but crawl and needed a teammate to revive them) some distance away from the edge of this map. 

OP's character can create portals, and she made one right next to the edge, but far enough that her downed teammate could use it and not fall off. The enemy team obviously followed her through the portal, but then OP melees all of them, knocking them off the map
If you liked the fast paced nature of UT then give Apex a go, or if you want stupidly fast paced then try Hyper Scape. If you want absolute chaos, try Fall Guys haha.

Sums up this braindead subreddit.
This is why you don't take random portals, especially ones where you don't know where it will lead.
They weren't downed, you can see them start to raise up right before getting socked. Either they came through crouched or it's part of the port animation. I've never paid attention to it though.
Most of the time your teammate is wraith, they fuck off at the first sign of a fight and you have to watch them play for a few mins while they let you bleed out and your banner expire.

    This is perfect! Exactly what I was imagining! Thanks for taking the time to make this. Hold this shiny award for me!
        Thank you much, kind person. :)
        Honestly I'm really glad you actually got what you wanted (it was a genuinely good suggestion). Also I found the edit to your comment referencing mine hilarious, props man :)

/u/PapaJulietZulu you're the real MVP!
            Thanks man! Since I got bamboozled I thought I‚Äôd get revenge by helping you bamboozle some more people! Congrats on all the awards too! Haha
                Haha thanks, though they're wasted on me, I'd rather people donate to a worthy cause. Thought about adding that in an edit but I also hate those thanks-for-the-gold-edits, so  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

    I‚Äôm so mad that this is down here being buried by a fucking Rick roll. This is perfectly done.
        me too man... what have I done...
            Just edit you comment saying it was a rick roll and to scroll down to see something worthwhile I guess? Haha idk It might be too late.
    The Wilhelm scream was perfect
    I love you for this lmao
    I got RickRolled twice to get to this. Worth it

            Are you giving kidding me?
    You bastard.....
    *Mirage has entered the chat*
    an ad played ahead of the video so I saw the title first. Ads ruin everything.
        I have Apollo installed, so I spotted the Rickroll without even having to leave Reddit. Thanks, Apollo! <3
            Apollo mains rise up!
                Wait shit I missed it. We risin up for something?

    For such a quickly thrown together video, that was perfect!
        Agreed!
    Man, that's some god tier editing.
        The cinematography was... *chef's kiss
    Its 2020 and i‚Äôve been legitimately rickrolled.
    It's been a while since I legitimately fell for one of these, I always see them coming...
    Joke‚Äôs on u, it gave me an add and I saw the title. (Damn that probably still counts)
    I fucking hate(love) you! Wtf man lol I feel so goddamn dumb
    Take my poor man's gold üèÖ
    Well played you bastard
    Soo.. There is no edit? :(
        There is, see /u/PapaJulietZulu 's comment!
            Oh thanks so much!!
    This is why I have trust issues
    YOU DICK
    I watched the whole video because i actually enjoy it
    That got me
    Nicely done. Have an updoot
        Have a consolation upvote.
    First time I‚Äôve ever got rick rolled, does it still count if it was muted?
I will take you by your word /u/ThatGuyDes . 

[Here is an edit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX7zBGqb_Dg&feature=youtu.be) with Jackie Chan sound effects +1 Wilhelm scream
    Someone posted an edit literally one minute before you, but seeing that you also have an awesome edit, I think both of you guys deserve some gold! A deal‚Äôs a deal!
        Well thank you for that ^^

Even tho its a small edit, it took 1h to compleat it
[deleted]
    Say less my man! I‚Äôm eagerly waiting
        Fuck why do I feel like I‚Äôm walking into another Rick roll. Guess I‚Äôll have to wait and see
    [deleted]
Speaking of Jackie chan just watched the movie Police story today. Great fucking movie with good stunts
    The hanging on a bus stunt is nuts.
        I'd have to look it up again but I'm pretty sure he did that stunt with a couple broken bones. The guy was nuts in his younger days. They hide all his casts in baggy clothes and he just loads up on pain meds and has at it.
watch out! sniper on th
You're doing it wrong. You have to say "Candlejack" and then later in the po-
Me too! It‚Äôs always like ‚ÄúFuck it, let‚Äôs take their portal!!‚Äù
    Gibby main. I like to take the portal, drop my ult, portal back.   

It has yet to pay off but I know one day it will.
        I so it with caustic, I go down but take one other person down with me at least
        I always end up holding ult on gib so long. I want it available at the end of every single game. I've won a few games just but dropping my ult and sitting in my shield with my team.
            did one today.  2 man squad vs. 3.  got a double knockdown with an ult on the 3rd team remaining.  Then retreated to the 2nd to last circle.  hit the accellerant crack pipe and was able to ulted them behind a wall I couldn't throw a grenade over. Rushed in with devotion as they tried to heal, knocked 2 and got knocked.  Partner came in behind and mopped up the last.

I generally hold one if not 2 ult accellerants at all times.  nothing wins a standoff like 2 gibby ults in 60 seconds.  Hey Rampart, raining down some destruction."
                I'm so sad they nerfed the accelerant to 20% :( but Loba ult charges waaay faster so as a Loba main I feel it balanced (not sure about others' ult time tho)
            Haven't played Gibby in a while but I always used his ult in every full-squad confrontation I could. The number of times it saved our asses in the early and mid-round game is far higher than when I've been saved by it at the end.
        You can get away with it as Pathy if you hit a grapple as soon as you come out.
        I like to do the same in middle of a zipline. zip one way, drop ult, jump 180 degrees and zip the other way. I find it incredibly satisfying to suddenly change the zipping direction.
Triple Give!
    Triple kiss?
        Triple finger
        Lol, reminds me of the game grumps spider kiss bit
            You got it! Seemed fitting
The real void was the friends we made along the way
Harry Potter, I think.
    Yeah thought it sounded like something from HP, can't remember which book though.
        Goblet of fire.  Right at the beginning when the Weasleys come to take Harry to the world cup
            Oh yes, when they get trapped behind like an electric fire or something?
Those shields are pretty sturdy
They got YEETED!
    Uh, I‚Äôd also like to express my fondness for that particular big brain play
    Yote
    Yeet or be Yeeted, amiright?
