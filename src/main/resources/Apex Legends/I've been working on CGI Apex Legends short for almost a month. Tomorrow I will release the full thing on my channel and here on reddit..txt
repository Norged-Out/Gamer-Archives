Wow, I'm pumped!
    Hire him
        Allow me. 

*waves hand* You want to hire him.
            I want to hire him.
                No no. Wrong person!
                    You don't want to sell him death sticks.
                        He wants to go home and rethink his life
                            Special updoot for you two! Men of culture.

                It's over anakin. I have the high ground
                    YOU UNDERESTIMATE MY POWER
            I want him
            I want to hire him
            I want to hire him
        Yes. Game Designer for a large developer company. Hire this guy directly with the grand power you hold in your non-management hands
        Literally facts
    We need this persons  YouTube account
        https://youtu.be/1XN1ZOi2jJI
    The short looks great but i was wondering we have lore for how most abilitiys work but we dont for rev is there anything you can say and is he going to be getting an heirloom soon thanks man
        They said that they can‚Äôt say the lore for the death totem because it has to do with a future legend also rev is fairly new so no heirloom for him soon
            Octane and Mirage got one before Bangalore so idk if this logic holds up.

Edit: ok ok Mirage was day 1 I‚Äôm sorry for my blasphemy.
                Mirage was a Day 1 legend...
                    Hmm u right, he just wasn‚Äôt unlocked automatically tho right? That‚Äôs probably why I got my wires crossed.
                        Yup. Mirage and Caustic had to be unlocked with either Legend tokens or Apex coins.
                            Gotcha. I‚Äôm a day 1 player but remembered they had to be unlocked so thought maybe they weren‚Äôt released on day 1. Thx for the correction
                That was different. Mirage was day one and octane was fairly old. Also they had an idea for him. With rev I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll make one until they have to
                Bangalore is also the next one getting an heirloom
                    Confirmed?
                        I don't know if by the devs but by a pretty credible leaker. He's gotten a lot right before including caustics hammer.
:O excited to see it!
    Same..
        Same...
            Same....
    Hey have you guys thought about doing this type of thing before? I know there‚Äôs the launch trailers which are incredible but I‚Äôve always fantasised about a film or mini series. 

You guys do amazing work. Much love.
        Well they are having community creaters do some apex artwork for the comics (not too entirely sure on that one but heard it from somewhere by a dev)
DAMN
    DAMN
        DAMN
            DAMN
                DAMN
                    DAMN
                        DAMN
                            DAMN
                                DAMN
                                    DAMN
                        DAMN
    And this is why I like reddit over the garbage fire that is twitter
        Why do redditors always have to whine and complain about other platforms? I mean zero relevance, no context. Smh.
            I don‚Äôt know how you interpreted that. I‚Äôm just saying that  I prefer reddit over twitter cuz there‚Äôs more people with actual brain cells who don‚Äôt spam toxicity to the devs
                Ok sure. I like reddit but it can be way more toxic than any other platform and the fact that you're anonymous does help. I just think it's shallow that redditors keep complaining about Insta and Twitter.
    Love or lust
Oh man this looks rad! Can't wait.
    Don't listen to the dick we love you guys.üòÅ
        We really do. No sarcasm involved or anything, and despite the potato servers (not taking a jab at anyone), it is still the most fun game I‚Äôve ever played.
            Saying potato servers sure is a jab at someone though. It's like you're doing the usual "no offense, but..." and then offend someone.
                It‚Äôs my way of saying that despite the game‚Äôs flaws, I‚Äôm not leaving anytime soon.
        What did his dick say?
    You guys are the fucking best, you're working on the greatest BR ever made, and the best game I've played in a long time. Week 1 player, on every day. Thanks for all your hard work.
    The fact that anyone can make even this little clip in under a month impresses the hell out of me
    I'm sorry for some of these guys... Most of the community knows y'all are working hard. 

It's like an old beater car.  You fix one thing and another breaks.  Doesn't mean we don't love that broken down ride, ya know?  

Good luck, devs.
    Everyone notices and appreciates the dedication to evolving the game! Change is hard to adjust to but I‚Äôm loving season 6 and we all know bugs come along and get fixed as needed. Thanks for making a stellar game!
Wow dude. Can‚Äôt wait
    As a bloodhound main I agree. Even if I wasn't a bloodhound main I would agree. This looks so good

Edit: Wow, this is my first gold ever. Thx kind stranger!
        It looks incredible!

The head-cam shot at the end makes me think that this is what VR games will look like in the not too distant future.

^(**Edit: I rolled a 6 sided dice and got a 6, you win gold! Congrats!**)
            Imagine playing Titanfall in VR like this.

Actually, don't. I'd probably get nauseous. üòÇ
                Apparently they've tried Titanfall 2 in VR internally. To say it was vomit inducing would be a vast understatement apparently.
                    Would be very cool to just to try it out even if you end up vomiting on the floor. Would even pay 60 for it
                        I pay $60 to get wasted and cry about my life with a headache the next day. Honestly easier this way and more fun.
                            Wow, you drink nice whiskey üëç
                                Well to be fair you can rack up a $60 bar tab single handed *pretty* easily
                                    Bars are open again?
                        Rather vomit on thyself than get got by a Scorch
                            It's Papa Scorch, man. Get it right. You can also call him The War Crime Simulator.
                someone‚Äôs making this, he has a devlog on his youtube.

https://youtu.be/odaYLenkDrg
                    Looks pretty neat! Titan controls in VR will be fun from what I can see.

I am late for the vote but was thinking that having movement with the left joystick and aiming with the right hand (say right controller) would be a nice combo. Maybe. IDK as I can't test it (no VR headset even if I did install his files to mod my game for VR).

Still doubtful about the fun vs. nauseation tradeoff for the pilot bits though. Let's see what happens when he gets there.
                        yeah, i‚Äôm super hyped for it because he‚Äôs planning on putting it on psvr, and one of the biggest things he‚Äôs working on is making sure it isn‚Äôt nauseating or tiring.
                            Seen some comments saying they got their accounts suspended for modding though. I wish he could find a way to let people use it without getting hit with a ban/suspension.
            What's voidspace?
                [removed]
                    This sounds super rad! Subbing to the subreddit and downloading after work.
            Oh boy I‚Äôm the first this time! What‚Äôs void space?
                lol sorry, someone caught it about an hour before you \^^
        As another bloodhound main. I too agree.
        So you agree?
        As a Bloodhound main, I gave an Award in honor of the Allfather.
        A reddit phenomenon old as time, people getting awards for saying "I agree"
    This is lit!
I‚Äôll see you on popular in a few hours
    ^^^^
    Wish we could have two flair tags on a post. Every time a dev responds they switch the flair from fan art and my filter doesn't catch it.
    Already there lol
üëÄüçø
    Imma steal your popcorn
üëÄüçø‚äÇ(‚Ä¢‚Äø‚Ä¢‚äÇ )
        Loba? Is that you?
            Be careful. She has teamed up with Revy and he can silence you
    üçøüëÄ
There was supposed to be a series of Titanfall a while back before it got scrapped and the game lost support. Watching this reminds me of what could‚Äôve been.
    Titanfall series is something I always dream of making :P I always thought about it, but I figured that without any serious financing it's near damn impossible. Animating titans and parcour is too much work.
        Get Respawn to hire you lmao
Holy shit.....
    Exact thoughts... can‚Äôt wait for this
    Doesn‚Äôt CGI cost a shit ton? Holy shit is right
Holy fuck this is clean.

        I'm sorry for sending you down it, but you will be better for going through it in the end :)
            Sounds like  **heresy**.
                An open mind is like a fortress with its gates unlocked and unguarded.
The Allfather blesses you with the gift of finishing this amazing work, holy DAMN

Look forward to it
YOOO BLOODHOUND'S EYES ARE GLOWING AND EVERYTHING. NICE WORK MAN!
This dude about to get a new job with Apex from this.
Someone's getting a job at respawn üëÅüëÅ
‚ÄúAlmost a month‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem like that long for how dope this looks. Am I missing something? Is the short gonna be like 10 seconds?
I just realized I would host WATCH PARTIES (ok not during covid) with people to see a movie or series like this. With Apex characters doing stuff with CGI level graphics
Omg I just realised. I used to watch your sfm videos when i was younger.
How dare you distract me from my cyberpunk hype.

Think you just got yourself a job with Respawn bro
If you don‚Äôt mind me asking as this looks like a lot of production value has gone into this:

Have you worked on this alone or a group of people?

Mocap used in areas I assume or all from scratch?

How many hours a day spent working on this?

Only curious as this looks very promising. Looking forward to it later today.

Ok welcome to the gaming industry, you are hired. You have ONE week to do the next one, and it needs to be better each release and have as few issues as possible and if it does have issues, it gets released anyway and you take the heat for it.

Welcome to the Dev / creative gaming career field.

Also, why does bloodhound walk like a grandma speed walking to get the last bananas on sale?  NO I'm just joking it looks really good, I cant wait to see what you've done and am actually going to actively look tomorrow evening for your work. :)

Yo I‚Äôve been really wanting to get into CGI and cinematic like this does anyone know what softwares might have used to make this? I really really love these kinds of work and wanted to make it for so long but never knew where to start. Thank you so much for those who commented.
*giddy giggles*
In what program can you achieve this level of grestness?
Seeing this makes me wish for an Apex Legends series. Before my friend died back in April from covid an Apex "show" is something we would always talk about. Seeing this clip made me hear his voice and his hype in my head. Thank you for the smile you've made me do.

                    He wants to go home and rethink his life

    Yes. Game Designer for a large developer company. Hire this guy directly with the grand power you hold in your non-management hands
    Literally facts
We need this persons  YouTube account
    https://youtu.be/1XN1ZOi2jJI
The short looks great but i was wondering we have lore for how most abilitiys work but we dont for rev is there anything you can say and is he going to be getting an heirloom soon thanks man
    They said that they can‚Äôt say the lore for the death totem because it has to do with a future legend also rev is fairly new so no heirloom for him soon
        Octane and Mirage got one before Bangalore so idk if this logic holds up.

Edit: ok ok Mirage was day 1 I‚Äôm sorry for my blasphemy.
            Mirage was a Day 1 legend...
                Hmm u right, he just wasn‚Äôt unlocked automatically tho right? That‚Äôs probably why I got my wires crossed.
                    Yup. Mirage and Caustic had to be unlocked with either Legend tokens or Apex coins.
                        Gotcha. I‚Äôm a day 1 player but remembered they had to be unlocked so thought maybe they weren‚Äôt released on day 1. Thx for the correction
            That was different. Mirage was day one and octane was fairly old. Also they had an idea for him. With rev I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll make one until they have to
            Bangalore is also the next one getting an heirloom
                Confirmed?
                    I don't know if by the devs but by a pretty credible leaker. He's gotten a lot right before including caustics hammer.
Same..
    Same...
        Same....
Hey have you guys thought about doing this type of thing before? I know there‚Äôs the launch trailers which are incredible but I‚Äôve always fantasised about a film or mini series. 

You guys do amazing work. Much love.
    Well they are having community creaters do some apex artwork for the comics (not too entirely sure on that one but heard it from somewhere by a dev)
DAMN
    DAMN
        DAMN
            DAMN
                DAMN
                    DAMN

                                DAMN
                    DAMN
And this is why I like reddit over the garbage fire that is twitter
    Why do redditors always have to whine and complain about other platforms? I mean zero relevance, no context. Smh.
        I don‚Äôt know how you interpreted that. I‚Äôm just saying that  I prefer reddit over twitter cuz there‚Äôs more people with actual brain cells who don‚Äôt spam toxicity to the devs
            Ok sure. I like reddit but it can be way more toxic than any other platform and the fact that you're anonymous does help. I just think it's shallow that redditors keep complaining about Insta and Twitter.
Love or lust
Don't listen to the dick we love you guys.üòÅ
    We really do. No sarcasm involved or anything, and despite the potato servers (not taking a jab at anyone), it is still the most fun game I‚Äôve ever played.
        Saying potato servers sure is a jab at someone though. It's like you're doing the usual "no offense, but..." and then offend someone.
            It‚Äôs my way of saying that despite the game‚Äôs flaws, I‚Äôm not leaving anytime soon.
    What did his dick say?
You guys are the fucking best, you're working on the greatest BR ever made, and the best game I've played in a long time. Week 1 player, on every day. Thanks for all your hard work.
The fact that anyone can make even this little clip in under a month impresses the hell out of me
I'm sorry for some of these guys... Most of the community knows y'all are working hard. 

It's like an old beater car.  You fix one thing and another breaks.  Doesn't mean we don't love that broken down ride, ya know?  

Good luck, devs.
Everyone notices and appreciates the dedication to evolving the game! Change is hard to adjust to but I‚Äôm loving season 6 and we all know bugs come along and get fixed as needed. Thanks for making a stellar game!
As a bloodhound main I agree. Even if I wasn't a bloodhound main I would agree. This looks so good

Edit: Wow, this is my first gold ever. Thx kind stranger!
    It looks incredible!

The head-cam shot at the end makes me think that this is what VR games will look like in the not too distant future.

        Imagine playing Titanfall in VR like this.

Actually, don't. I'd probably get nauseous. üòÇ
            Apparently they've tried Titanfall 2 in VR internally. To say it was vomit inducing would be a vast understatement apparently.
                Would be very cool to just to try it out even if you end up vomiting on the floor. Would even pay 60 for it
                    I pay $60 to get wasted and cry about my life with a headache the next day. Honestly easier this way and more fun.
                        Wow, you drink nice whiskey üëç
                            Well to be fair you can rack up a $60 bar tab single handed *pretty* easily
                                Bars are open again?
                    Rather vomit on thyself than get got by a Scorch
                        It's Papa Scorch, man. Get it right. You can also call him The War Crime Simulator.
            someone‚Äôs making this, he has a devlog on his youtube.

https://youtu.be/odaYLenkDrg
                Looks pretty neat! Titan controls in VR will be fun from what I can see.

I am late for the vote but was thinking that having movement with the left joystick and aiming with the right hand (say right controller) would be a nice combo. Maybe. IDK as I can't test it (no VR headset even if I did install his files to mod my game for VR).

Still doubtful about the fun vs. nauseation tradeoff for the pilot bits though. Let's see what happens when he gets there.
                    yeah, i‚Äôm super hyped for it because he‚Äôs planning on putting it on psvr, and one of the biggest things he‚Äôs working on is making sure it isn‚Äôt nauseating or tiring.
                        Seen some comments saying they got their accounts suspended for modding though. I wish he could find a way to let people use it without getting hit with a ban/suspension.

Titanfall series is something I always dream of making :P I always thought about it, but I figured that without any serious financing it's near damn impossible. Animating titans and parcour is too much work.

I am late for the vote but was thinking that having movement with the left joystick and aiming with the right hand (say right controller) would be a nice combo. Maybe. IDK as I can't test it (no VR headset even if I did install his files to mod my game for VR).

Still doubtful about the fun vs. nauseation tradeoff for the pilot bits though. Let's see what happens when he gets there.
            yeah, i‚Äôm super hyped for it because he‚Äôs planning on putting it on psvr, and one of the biggest things he‚Äôs working on is making sure it isn‚Äôt nauseating or tiring.
                Seen some comments saying they got their accounts suspended for modding though. I wish he could find a way to let people use it without getting hit with a ban/suspension.
What's voidspace?

        This sounds super rad! Subbing to the subreddit and downloading after work.
Oh boy I‚Äôm the first this time! What‚Äôs void space?
    lol sorry, someone caught it about an hour before you \^^
Be careful. She has teamed up with Revy and he can silence you

Found it by looking in his post history
Same. Did you ever find it?
    Nah he slept..
Sounds like  **heresy**.
    An open mind is like a fortress with its gates unlocked and unguarded.
No no. Wrong person!
    You don't want to sell him death sticks.
        He wants to go home and rethink his life
            Special updoot for you two! Men of culture.
It's over anakin. I have the high ground
    YOU UNDERESTIMATE MY POWER
Mirage was a Day 1 legend...
    Hmm u right, he just wasn‚Äôt unlocked automatically tho right? That‚Äôs probably why I got my wires crossed.
        Yup. Mirage and Caustic had to be unlocked with either Legend tokens or Apex coins.
            Gotcha. I‚Äôm a day 1 player but remembered they had to be unlocked so thought maybe they weren‚Äôt released on day 1. Thx for the correction
That was different. Mirage was day one and octane was fairly old. Also they had an idea for him. With rev I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll make one until they have to
Bangalore is also the next one getting an heirloom
    Confirmed?
        I don't know if by the devs but by a pretty credible leaker. He's gotten a lot right before including caustics hammer.

Ok sure. I like reddit but it can be way more toxic than any other platform and the fact that you're anonymous does help. I just think it's shallow that redditors keep complaining about Insta and Twitter.
It‚Äôs my way of saying that despite the game‚Äôs flaws, I‚Äôm not leaving anytime soon.
Apparently they've tried Titanfall 2 in VR internally. To say it was vomit inducing would be a vast understatement apparently.
    Would be very cool to just to try it out even if you end up vomiting on the floor. Would even pay 60 for it
        I pay $60 to get wasted and cry about my life with a headache the next day. Honestly easier this way and more fun.
            Wow, you drink nice whiskey üëç
                Well to be fair you can rack up a $60 bar tab single handed *pretty* easily
                    Bars are open again?
        Rather vomit on thyself than get got by a Scorch
            It's Papa Scorch, man. Get it right. You can also call him The War Crime Simulator.
someone‚Äôs making this, he has a devlog on his youtube.
