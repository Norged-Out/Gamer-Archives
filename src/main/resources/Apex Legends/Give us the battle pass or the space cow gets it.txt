    I wonder what space cow Brisket tastes like...

If you look closely you can see Luke Skywalker milking its tits.
    I hate this and I hate that I laughed at this 
        Mmm that scene of Luke guzzling all that milk and getting it all over his beard. What a great movie!
            That's my thoughts exactly, and people calling the movie bad have no taste
                The movie’s bad 
                    That's the joke.
            Everyone disliked this
            It was a metaphor for disney milking the series for all it's got. 
            Unironically enjoy that scene and believe it furthers the portrayal of his character
                Betrayal *
                The movie as a whole destroyed any sense of progression or arc of Luke established in ROTJ. He's introduced as a completely different character. 
                    I say to that, what do you expect? That Luke hasn't changed in all that time? It's the same character with many many more years behind him. Of course he's completely different.

                I remember turning my head to my dad and we both burst out laughing at that part, and we weren’t the only ones in the cinema laughing. Only movie to this day that we’ve driven home from and not said a single word to each other. 

The opening dialogue being an MCU-esque “Your momma” joke really set the tone for how awful that movie was gonna be. 
                    I thought, oh, this is how they deal with Carrie's death. 

And then... 

No. Just no.
                        It would’ve been great to be honest, that entire sequence where Kylo was pissed/got into his ship and started tearing shit up was good. 

And then it was ruined. 
                            "this is not going to go the way you think"


Should have taken that line much more literal than I think we all did
                                A few misdirections would have been fine, everything as a misdirection and just shitting on major plot points of the previous movie was just bad. 
                                    Strongly agreed
                                    Can you explain? Not being confrontational here, i'm not a big Star wars guy, but I did hate this movie. What plot points of Force awakens did they shit on? Genuinely curious
                                    Sure did subvert expectations though 
                            Yeah seriously, JFC that plot was terrible. It would have been a great send off with praise if they just had her character die off in space right there and then. 
 
But no, they had to Mary Poppins the shit out of it instead. 
 
At least because of that we don't have the Hunger Games hairdo lady running the rebellion. 
                                Carrie Poppins
                                May the ~~odds~~ force be ever in your favor
                            That whole movie is constantly almost making the right decision only to have something stupid come out of left field and ruin it 


                                Hardly, it's just dumb from the first scene and never stops. 

Luke fucking says "laser sword" and tosses it. Who approved this script?
                                I thought it was going to finally go in an interesting direction when Kylo offered Rey to join him in refusing light and dark and forging a new path but no. We can’t have even one nice thing. That would’ve been too interesting.
                            Agreed.
                        Like holy shit, they could have done SO MUCH with that. Kylo's internal struggle was perfectly encapsulated in that scene, and they could have played with his emotions regarding that event subtly throughout the entire movie and used it in the climax of the next. 

So much storytelling potential wasted for...Mary Poppins: Star Wars edition?
                    I was high af and thought I was having a stroke I laughed so hard. Unfortunately I was the only one...
                    so many people in my theatre laughed when she pulled the marry poppins float, it was so ridiculous.

The movie fucking blows and I'm gonna get pissed if I start talking about it again.

And even though it made no sense, at least the hyperspace collision scene was cool to see in the theatre.
                    They lost me at space bombs that drop like gravity is a thing in space. 
                Leia Poppins
                Space Vegas. The most worthless side plot ever. 
            “Sir, should we get another ship to light-speed jump just ahead of them and cut them off?”

“No, let us continue to pursue them at our current pace for a few more hours”

“... k “ 
                I mean, going by how the hyperdrives work, they could overshoot by about a million miles pretty easy.
                    Nah, somehow Han was able to pull the Falcon out of Hyperspace after entering Starkiller Base's atmosphere just past their shields but before crashing, so apparently Hyperspace jumps can be precise.
                        Not too familiar with Star Wars universe or mechanics (watched the prequels and sequels though, and also Force Awakens, not TLJ because people said it... wasn't every good), but I feel like they'd be advanced enough to be pretty precise with their hyperspace jumps.
                    Get out of here with that logic, can't you see there's only room for blind hate for this movie here?
                At first, I thought the exact same thing- “this is ridiculous. Just jump ahead of them and finish it!”. But then I gave it some thought...

That’s always been part of the Empire/First Order’s playbook- they’re arrogant. Hell, in the first few minutes of ANH they don’t shoot down an enemy escape pod because “there are no life-forms on board”. I’m always reminded of the Family Guy version where the gunner then says, “what, are we paying by the laser now???” 

That one move of arrogance set up the entire series. Without that pod getting to Tatooine, obi-wan and Luke don’t leave, the rebels don’t get the Death Star plans, and the Empire blows up Yavin 4 and pretty much ends the rebellion. 

The point is, the Empire’s arrogance is key in Star Wars. It always leads to their demise. 
            Ooooh! Are we bashing the last Jedi??? Yippee!

            Disney ruined Star Wars
            Which one? All Disney/Marvel/Star Wars films?


            God damn it was SO fucking bad. How anyone liked that movie is beyond me.
            I love that I havent watched it. Gut feeling told me that its not gonna be good.
            I will defend this movie until I die. It's a better movie than the force awakens, fight me. 
                1v1 me
                I honestly feel it could have jad a more dark adult direction. Especially being that most star wars fans are adults but Disney definitely wants to create a new child franchise which star wars really isn't. That is my criticism. Like people said there is a great movie there that was essentially "disneyed". Leia should have died, Kylo ren could have had a darker ark, rei is a little bit to generic hero and Flynn's storyline was just silly. A lot of the plot points cover betrayal and why one would turn to the dark side but then it just becomes very generic good guys vs bad guys. I beleive it could have been more complex
                10000% agree. TFA was a half assed rehash of A New Hope. 
                Objectively, it's a good movie. They just hate the direction the story went.

Which is allowed but to call it a dumpster fire is a joke.
                    What are you talking about? 

I don’t really care about what Star Wars wants to do, but the movie itself, as a movie, has some grave flaws in it. It’s horribly written. The plot makes no sense whatsoever. It is an actual dumpster fire. 

Disregarding snoke and Luke’s character and Rey being strong with the force. All that is not preferable but it’s fine. That’s not an issue with the film *as a film*. 

It’s *everything else* that is so awfully done.

I would disagree that is objectively a good movie.
                Force awakens was garbage too
                Thats low bar, bouth are bad 
            Great movie.
            What movie?
                The Last Jedi
            I feel like I'm the only one who loves the new trilogy but I guess I'm just a SW nerd that loves shameless fan service.
                I  liked TFA, yes it had it faults but it set up the trilogy well imo then the 2nd one went and shat all over it 
                yes, you are
    Fuck that’s hot 
    You know if Rae wasn’t there Luke woulda sucked that milk straight out the titty.
        Maybe that scene wasn't meant to show us how feral he had become, but how civil he remained. He definitely meant to be a bit gross when he chugged it in Rey's face, but it didn't occur to Luke Skywalker to just suck that titty.
    I've got nipples Luke....could you milk me?
        Jesus lol

    God, that Fucking movie gets me heated
    That was the one scene that made me laugh in a not ironic way in that whole mess of a movie, Mark Hamill was so into that milk it just outshone Adam Daddy drivers weird chest size.
    I’ve never seen star wars is there an original pic I can see?
         [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC4A7y7ONoI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC4A7y7ONoI)  enjoy
            Holy shit.  I still haven't seen the newest star wars and now I'm 50% feeling like I really missed out and 50% happy I still haven't.  What is the context for this!?
                I'll be honest, I've only ever seen the original trilogy and the Phantom Menace, but I've watched all the RedLetterMedia/Plinkett reviews, so I have a decent understanding. It's from The Last Jedi, where Rae, the new Jedi lady, goes to see Luke so she can get training. He lives in isolation on this tiny island and drinks blue milk from alien animal tits. THE END
                    And it’s not even the most out of place thing in the movie either

                        I WANT THAT JUICY SHAQ MEAT TOO, BRUDDA
                Luke Skywalker has become a space hermit and wants to be left alone. Rae is coming to him for help like Luke did with Yoda, but Luke really does not want to help her, so he is trying to scare/disgust her away by showing her what the hermit life is like on this world and what she will need to deal with if she wants to stay there. 
                The context is actually not terrible. Luke is a sad, angry old man reveling in his misery and being deliberately gross to the main character in an attempt to get her to leave him alone. It makes sense for this character to guzzle green alien milk like a barbarian.

The fundamental problem is that it's Luke Skywalker as the sad, angry old man in the first place.
            I thought this was just a meme. But there it is.
    That's disgusting ! :D

    Somebody give this man some gold
    I never saw the last Jedi so I don’t get this reference :/
        Basically Lukes alone on this island and is being hounded by Ray who is begging for him to teach her. He's just doing his everyday things and at one point walks over to a space humanoid cow and just starts milking it's tits while Ray awkwardly stands there. The cow gives a cheeky look at Ray like "wassup??".

That's it. No other reference is made about him milking blue liquid and the cow never shows up again.

            I have buddies that have been playing sc everyday for a year, ecerytime I get on there ain't shit to do, I don't see why they play it in the shit state it's in. One has 1700 bucks worth of ships and the other has 2500 plus I go virtual space ships for a game that probably won't launch. 
                reading these comments kind of make me feel better about Elite Dangerous so, there's that
                    I liked elite for a while, but it gets so repetitive. I'm hoping star citizen will have more unique gameplay loops, but we'll be waiting a while to see¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

    Speaking of Star Citizen, [ArcCorp (*Coruscant style city planet*)](https://youtu.be/mGcG0g7GsOI#t=14m38s) is scheduled to come out with the 3.5 update in the next month.
        Actual release date may be between now and the heat death of the universe.
            Except that is is scientifically unsound, there will be a big freeze, crunch, or rip that will end the universe along with your release date dream.
                Woo lemme just hwhip out my astronomy textbo- oh wait, it was a joke, who gives a fuck.

/r/iamverysmart
                    It's even better cuz he's wrong. The heat death is the same as the Big Freeze that he says will happen instead, and it's the Big Crunch that everyone thinks won't happen now.

Bam-moo-zled
            so when the rangefinder says 20, you aim with the 2? 30m, use the 3, etc.?
                Same logic, Just wrong numbers.

When the range finder says 200m you am with the 2nd dash mark, 300m 3rd dash, etc. 

Edit: sorry not dash, but the numbers. Just to clarify. 
                    That makes a lot more sense! Thank you :)

    You saved one space cow today.
        Too bad the rest of them didn’t share the same fate
            1 like = 1 respect for the space cows 
        See you later, space cow.
        It says here if you downvote, they kill a space cow. Really playing hardball.

You heard it here, Respawn. What’s your answer?
Kids love spending money on games.. I remember when cosmetics were an unlockable incentive to play the game not an excuse to ask Mommy for money.. games need to go back to a set price not pay to play, pay to win, or pay to look cool.. makes me sick seeing the gaming community just let these micro transactions take over everything.
    If you think cosmetic microtransactions are taking over everything, then you are tacitly saying that cosmetics are taking over the game...which they're not. Buyable  Cosmetics don't affect gameplay. But they do allow the game to be 100% free to play, which is pretty cool... 

I really don't think microtransactions are a problem when they are restricted to cosmetics and don't affect gameplay.

What is a battle pass and why does everyone want one so bad? 
    Depending on how it is I n this game, it’s either a grind or pay your way to get cosmetic items. This is EA we’re talking about so they won’t get a penny from me.
    The modern gamer values cosmetics quite a bit. 

I'd rather see better stat tracking and challenge based unlocks. 
I call them organic AT-ATs
<Rorschach> DO IT!!
See you, space cow. 
    Love the reference.

Cant wait for thr battlepass complaints to roll in. is this all we get? These skins are trash? I cant earn it in game like fortnite?? Instead of heroes you release this?? Lmao.
Moolteepass 
EDIT - Below isn’t a direct attack on OP or his post. In fact it’s pretty funny! My comments are merely just a reflection on why I heavily dislike Battlepass-like features in games.

Guys, why in the devils name do you all want Battlepass so bad? This game doesn’t have to be exactly like other BR games you know.

A Battlepass feature is just another way of introducing timesinks/grinds in order to entice more ways for you to drop IRL cash to get that “sweet, sweet season-exclusive content!”

Not to mention doesn’t anybody else get stressed out with being given time restraints? Having to login/play constantly just to keep up with targets? Also it does my head in when games decide to design the Battlepass-like feature to make it as your main form of progression! So the only **real** opportunities to progress are tied to how *consistently* involved you are with the game?

It’s just stressful man and sometimes overloads the game with too many objectives that can in some ways sour the core experience.

Sometimes it’s better to KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)!

Just my two cents.
    I is a shitpost my dude 
        I get that this is a shitpost/funny post. I enjoyed it don’t get me wrong :)

But for real. Like I’ve seen a few posts on this sub legitimately asking for a Battlepass feature to be implemented into the game.

It’s cool to have an opinion and give feedback. But I think a lot of players are casual gamers who I feel when they ask for something they don’t (or are not capable of) think through the consequences or the impact their feature request would make on the mechanics of the game.

In the case of Apex and whether I personally would want to be *forced by design* to be consistently playing in order to *not miss out* on the progression rewards is something I wouldn’t want.

Then again Apex developers are probably already in the works of making a Battlepass. It means more consistent playerbase for them and more potential for them to earn revenue.

So I guess my rant is kinda mute cause I kinda already know it’s gonna happen. It just sucks for people who don’t have that free time every single day you know...

Anyways people. Carry on with your lives now. I’ve got it out of my system lol!

👍
            I just want to be able to earn stuff again, the post 50 grind sucked but being 100 and just not allowed to do anything has made most of my friends and i quit until some kind of further progression is implemented, we dont need a battlepass we just want to play the game and not feel like our time is being shat on.
            They already said battle pass is officially confirmed, a while ago even. Nobody here is hoping for it to actually exist, we know it will. They are hoping to get it sooner
    I don't know what battle pass is because Apex is my first and only BR game and I guess battle pass is a BR thing but you've convinced me that I hate it and it must die.

Just be happy that this game works like almost most of the time. They built it it will come.  Happpppy hunting. 
Are you only able to get the battlepass by purchasing it with real money? Or can we do the same thing as fortnite where you can buy it through in game earned currency?
what evolutionary advantage does those tusks give?
Sacrifices must be made

Well, that one looks like it's been traumatized by poachers. As you can tell, it's tusks have been cut off. They look somewhat clean, so it didn't knock them off in a battle somewhere.

Someone took those tusks.

        That's my thoughts exactly, and people calling the movie bad have no taste
            The movie’s bad 
                That's the joke.
        Everyone disliked this
        It was a metaphor for disney milking the series for all it's got. 
        Unironically enjoy that scene and believe it furthers the portrayal of his character
            Betrayal *
            The movie as a whole destroyed any sense of progression or arc of Luke established in ROTJ. He's introduced as a completely different character. 
                I say to that, what do you expect? That Luke hasn't changed in all that time? It's the same character with many many more years behind him. Of course he's completely different.

            I remember turning my head to my dad and we both burst out laughing at that part, and we weren’t the only ones in the cinema laughing. Only movie to this day that we’ve driven home from and not said a single word to each other. 

The opening dialogue being an MCU-esque “Your momma” joke really set the tone for how awful that movie was gonna be. 
                I thought, oh, this is how they deal with Carrie's death. 

And then... 

No. Just no.
                    It would’ve been great to be honest, that entire sequence where Kylo was pissed/got into his ship and started tearing shit up was good. 

And then it was ruined. 
                        "this is not going to go the way you think"


Should have taken that line much more literal than I think we all did
                            A few misdirections would have been fine, everything as a misdirection and just shitting on major plot points of the previous movie was just bad. 
                                Strongly agreed
                                Can you explain? Not being confrontational here, i'm not a big Star wars guy, but I did hate this movie. What plot points of Force awakens did they shit on? Genuinely curious
                                Sure did subvert expectations though 
                        Yeah seriously, JFC that plot was terrible. It would have been a great send off with praise if they just had her character die off in space right there and then. 
 
But no, they had to Mary Poppins the shit out of it instead. 
 
At least because of that we don't have the Hunger Games hairdo lady running the rebellion. 
                            Carrie Poppins
                            May the ~~odds~~ force be ever in your favor
                        That whole movie is constantly almost making the right decision only to have something stupid come out of left field and ruin it 


                            Hardly, it's just dumb from the first scene and never stops. 

Luke fucking says "laser sword" and tosses it. Who approved this script?
                            I thought it was going to finally go in an interesting direction when Kylo offered Rey to join him in refusing light and dark and forging a new path but no. We can’t have even one nice thing. That would’ve been too interesting.
                        Agreed.
                    Like holy shit, they could have done SO MUCH with that. Kylo's internal struggle was perfectly encapsulated in that scene, and they could have played with his emotions regarding that event subtly throughout the entire movie and used it in the climax of the next. 

So much storytelling potential wasted for...Mary Poppins: Star Wars edition?
                I was high af and thought I was having a stroke I laughed so hard. Unfortunately I was the only one...
                so many people in my theatre laughed when she pulled the marry poppins float, it was so ridiculous.

The movie fucking blows and I'm gonna get pissed if I start talking about it again.

And even though it made no sense, at least the hyperspace collision scene was cool to see in the theatre.
                They lost me at space bombs that drop like gravity is a thing in space. 
            Leia Poppins
            Space Vegas. The most worthless side plot ever. 
        “Sir, should we get another ship to light-speed jump just ahead of them and cut them off?”

“No, let us continue to pursue them at our current pace for a few more hours”

“... k “ 
            I mean, going by how the hyperdrives work, they could overshoot by about a million miles pretty easy.
                Nah, somehow Han was able to pull the Falcon out of Hyperspace after entering Starkiller Base's atmosphere just past their shields but before crashing, so apparently Hyperspace jumps can be precise.
                    Not too familiar with Star Wars universe or mechanics (watched the prequels and sequels though, and also Force Awakens, not TLJ because people said it... wasn't every good), but I feel like they'd be advanced enough to be pretty precise with their hyperspace jumps.
                Get out of here with that logic, can't you see there's only room for blind hate for this movie here?
            At first, I thought the exact same thing- “this is ridiculous. Just jump ahead of them and finish it!”. But then I gave it some thought...

That’s always been part of the Empire/First Order’s playbook- they’re arrogant. Hell, in the first few minutes of ANH they don’t shoot down an enemy escape pod because “there are no life-forms on board”. I’m always reminded of the Family Guy version where the gunner then says, “what, are we paying by the laser now???” 

That one move of arrogance set up the entire series. Without that pod getting to Tatooine, obi-wan and Luke don’t leave, the rebels don’t get the Death Star plans, and the Empire blows up Yavin 4 and pretty much ends the rebellion. 

The point is, the Empire’s arrogance is key in Star Wars. It always leads to their demise. 
        Ooooh! Are we bashing the last Jedi??? Yippee!

        I love that I havent watched it. Gut feeling told me that its not gonna be good.
        I will defend this movie until I die. It's a better movie than the force awakens, fight me. 
            1v1 me
            I honestly feel it could have jad a more dark adult direction. Especially being that most star wars fans are adults but Disney definitely wants to create a new child franchise which star wars really isn't. That is my criticism. Like people said there is a great movie there that was essentially "disneyed". Leia should have died, Kylo ren could have had a darker ark, rei is a little bit to generic hero and Flynn's storyline was just silly. A lot of the plot points cover betrayal and why one would turn to the dark side but then it just becomes very generic good guys vs bad guys. I beleive it could have been more complex
            10000% agree. TFA was a half assed rehash of A New Hope. 
            Objectively, it's a good movie. They just hate the direction the story went.

Which is allowed but to call it a dumpster fire is a joke.
                What are you talking about? 

I don’t really care about what Star Wars wants to do, but the movie itself, as a movie, has some grave flaws in it. It’s horribly written. The plot makes no sense whatsoever. It is an actual dumpster fire. 

Disregarding snoke and Luke’s character and Rey being strong with the force. All that is not preferable but it’s fine. That’s not an issue with the film *as a film*. 

It’s *everything else* that is so awfully done.

I would disagree that is objectively a good movie.
            Force awakens was garbage too
            Thats low bar, bouth are bad 
        Great movie.
        What movie?
            The Last Jedi
        I feel like I'm the only one who loves the new trilogy but I guess I'm just a SW nerd that loves shameless fan service.
            I  liked TFA, yes it had it faults but it set up the trilogy well imo then the 2nd one went and shat all over it 
            yes, you are
Fuck that’s hot 
You know if Rae wasn’t there Luke woulda sucked that milk straight out the titty.
    Maybe that scene wasn't meant to show us how feral he had become, but how civil he remained. He definitely meant to be a bit gross when he chugged it in Rey's face, but it didn't occur to Luke Skywalker to just suck that titty.
I've got nipples Luke....could you milk me?
    Jesus lol

You had me look at the picture again lol nice one 
God, that Fucking movie gets me heated
That was the one scene that made me laugh in a not ironic way in that whole mess of a movie, Mark Hamill was so into that milk it just outshone Adam Daddy drivers weird chest size.
I’ve never seen star wars is there an original pic I can see?

        Holy shit.  I still haven't seen the newest star wars and now I'm 50% feeling like I really missed out and 50% happy I still haven't.  What is the context for this!?
            I'll be honest, I've only ever seen the original trilogy and the Phantom Menace, but I've watched all the RedLetterMedia/Plinkett reviews, so I have a decent understanding. It's from The Last Jedi, where Rae, the new Jedi lady, goes to see Luke so she can get training. He lives in isolation on this tiny island and drinks blue milk from alien animal tits. THE END
                And it’s not even the most out of place thing in the movie either

                    I WANT THAT JUICY SHAQ MEAT TOO, BRUDDA
            Luke Skywalker has become a space hermit and wants to be left alone. Rae is coming to him for help like Luke did with Yoda, but Luke really does not want to help her, so he is trying to scare/disgust her away by showing her what the hermit life is like on this world and what she will need to deal with if she wants to stay there. 
            The context is actually not terrible. Luke is a sad, angry old man reveling in his misery and being deliberately gross to the main character in an attempt to get her to leave him alone. It makes sense for this character to guzzle green alien milk like a barbarian.

The fundamental problem is that it's Luke Skywalker as the sad, angry old man in the first place.
        I thought this was just a meme. But there it is.
That's disgusting ! :D

I never saw the last Jedi so I don’t get this reference :/
    Basically Lukes alone on this island and is being hounded by Ray who is begging for him to teach her. He's just doing his everyday things and at one point walks over to a space humanoid cow and just starts milking it's tits while Ray awkwardly stands there. The cow gives a cheeky look at Ray like "wassup??".

That's it. No other reference is made about him milking blue liquid and the cow never shows up again.

    You mean to tell me you think Star Citizen is getting a release?
        This one new ship will
        Yeah, it's gonna be a month after the release date of Bannerlord. 
            No I'm sad
            Stop reminding me please, trying to forget about that games existence so I don’t feel so incomplete.
        I have buddies that have been playing sc everyday for a year, ecerytime I get on there ain't shit to do, I don't see why they play it in the shit state it's in. One has 1700 bucks worth of ships and the other has 2500 plus I go virtual space ships for a game that probably won't launch. 
            reading these comments kind of make me feel better about Elite Dangerous so, there's that

Speaking of Star Citizen, [ArcCorp (*Coruscant style city planet*)](https://youtu.be/mGcG0g7GsOI#t=14m38s) is scheduled to come out with the 3.5 update in the next month.
    Actual release date may be between now and the heat death of the universe.
        Except that is is scientifically unsound, there will be a big freeze, crunch, or rip that will end the universe along with your release date dream.
            Woo lemme just hwhip out my astronomy textbo- oh wait, it was a joke, who gives a fuck.

                It's even better cuz he's wrong. The heat death is the same as the Big Freeze that he says will happen instead, and it's the Big Crunch that everyone thinks won't happen now.

        so when the rangefinder says 20, you aim with the 2? 30m, use the 3, etc.?
            Same logic, Just wrong numbers.

When the range finder says 200m you am with the 2nd dash mark, 300m 3rd dash, etc. 

Edit: sorry not dash, but the numbers. Just to clarify. 
                That makes a lot more sense! Thank you :)

If you think cosmetic microtransactions are taking over everything, then you are tacitly saying that cosmetics are taking over the game...which they're not. Buyable  Cosmetics don't affect gameplay. But they do allow the game to be 100% free to play, which is pretty cool... 

I really don't think microtransactions are a problem when they are restricted to cosmetics and don't affect gameplay.

Depending on how it is I n this game, it’s either a grind or pay your way to get cosmetic items. This is EA we’re talking about so they won’t get a penny from me.
The modern gamer values cosmetics quite a bit. 

I'd rather see better stat tracking and challenge based unlocks. 
Love the reference. 
I is a shitpost my dude 
    I get that this is a shitpost/funny post. I enjoyed it don’t get me wrong :)

But for real. Like I’ve seen a few posts on this sub legitimately asking for a Battlepass feature to be implemented into the game.

It’s cool to have an opinion and give feedback. But I think a lot of players are casual gamers who I feel when they ask for something they don’t (or are not capable of) think through the consequences or the impact their feature request would make on the mechanics of the game.

In the case of Apex and whether I personally would want to be *forced by design* to be consistently playing in order to *not miss out* on the progression rewards is something I wouldn’t want.

Then again Apex developers are probably already in the works of making a Battlepass. It means more consistent playerbase for them and more potential for them to earn revenue.

So I guess my rant is kinda mute cause I kinda already know it’s gonna happen. It just sucks for people who don’t have that free time every single day you know...

Anyways people. Carry on with your lives now. I’ve got it out of my system lol!

👍
        I just want to be able to earn stuff again, the post 50 grind sucked but being 100 and just not allowed to do anything has made most of my friends and i quit until some kind of further progression is implemented, we dont need a battlepass we just want to play the game and not feel like our time is being shat on.
        They already said battle pass is officially confirmed, a while ago even. Nobody here is hoping for it to actually exist, we know it will. They are hoping to get it sooner
I don't know what battle pass is because Apex is my first and only BR game and I guess battle pass is a BR thing but you've convinced me that I hate it and it must die.
Yea that’s what they said. Space cow. 
    No, moyai, not space cow
They are beeg doggos :)
The battlepass has free stuff too.

Mmm that scene of Luke guzzling all that milk and getting it all over his beard. What a great movie!
    That's my thoughts exactly, and people calling the movie bad have no taste
        The movie’s bad 
            That's the joke.
    Everyone disliked this
    It was a metaphor for disney milking the series for all it's got. 
    Unironically enjoy that scene and believe it furthers the portrayal of his character
        Betrayal *
        The movie as a whole destroyed any sense of progression or arc of Luke established in ROTJ. He's introduced as a completely different character. 
            I say to that, what do you expect? That Luke hasn't changed in all that time? It's the same character with many many more years behind him. Of course he's completely different.

        I remember turning my head to my dad and we both burst out laughing at that part, and we weren’t the only ones in the cinema laughing. Only movie to this day that we’ve driven home from and not said a single word to each other. 

The opening dialogue being an MCU-esque “Your momma” joke really set the tone for how awful that movie was gonna be. 
            I thought, oh, this is how they deal with Carrie's death. 

And then... 

No. Just no.
                It would’ve been great to be honest, that entire sequence where Kylo was pissed/got into his ship and started tearing shit up was good. 

And then it was ruined. 
                    "this is not going to go the way you think"


Should have taken that line much more literal than I think we all did
                        A few misdirections would have been fine, everything as a misdirection and just shitting on major plot points of the previous movie was just bad. 
                            Strongly agreed
                            Can you explain? Not being confrontational here, i'm not a big Star wars guy, but I did hate this movie. What plot points of Force awakens did they shit on? Genuinely curious
                            Sure did subvert expectations though 
                    Yeah seriously, JFC that plot was terrible. It would have been a great send off with praise if they just had her character die off in space right there and then. 
 
But no, they had to Mary Poppins the shit out of it instead. 
 
At least because of that we don't have the Hunger Games hairdo lady running the rebellion. 
                        Carrie Poppins
                        May the ~~odds~~ force be ever in your favor
                    That whole movie is constantly almost making the right decision only to have something stupid come out of left field and ruin it 


                        Hardly, it's just dumb from the first scene and never stops. 

Luke fucking says "laser sword" and tosses it. Who approved this script?
                        I thought it was going to finally go in an interesting direction when Kylo offered Rey to join him in refusing light and dark and forging a new path but no. We can’t have even one nice thing. That would’ve been too interesting.
                    Agreed.
                Like holy shit, they could have done SO MUCH with that. Kylo's internal struggle was perfectly encapsulated in that scene, and they could have played with his emotions regarding that event subtly throughout the entire movie and used it in the climax of the next. 

So much storytelling potential wasted for...Mary Poppins: Star Wars edition?
            I was high af and thought I was having a stroke I laughed so hard. Unfortunately I was the only one...
            so many people in my theatre laughed when she pulled the marry poppins float, it was so ridiculous.

The movie fucking blows and I'm gonna get pissed if I start talking about it again.

And even though it made no sense, at least the hyperspace collision scene was cool to see in the theatre.
            They lost me at space bombs that drop like gravity is a thing in space. 
        Leia Poppins
        Space Vegas. The most worthless side plot ever. 
    “Sir, should we get another ship to light-speed jump just ahead of them and cut them off?”

“No, let us continue to pursue them at our current pace for a few more hours”

“... k “ 
        I mean, going by how the hyperdrives work, they could overshoot by about a million miles pretty easy.
            Nah, somehow Han was able to pull the Falcon out of Hyperspace after entering Starkiller Base's atmosphere just past their shields but before crashing, so apparently Hyperspace jumps can be precise.
                Not too familiar with Star Wars universe or mechanics (watched the prequels and sequels though, and also Force Awakens, not TLJ because people said it... wasn't every good), but I feel like they'd be advanced enough to be pretty precise with their hyperspace jumps.
            Get out of here with that logic, can't you see there's only room for blind hate for this movie here?
        At first, I thought the exact same thing- “this is ridiculous. Just jump ahead of them and finish it!”. But then I gave it some thought...

That’s always been part of the Empire/First Order’s playbook- they’re arrogant. Hell, in the first few minutes of ANH they don’t shoot down an enemy escape pod because “there are no life-forms on board”. I’m always reminded of the Family Guy version where the gunner then says, “what, are we paying by the laser now???” 

That one move of arrogance set up the entire series. Without that pod getting to Tatooine, obi-wan and Luke don’t leave, the rebels don’t get the Death Star plans, and the Empire blows up Yavin 4 and pretty much ends the rebellion. 

The point is, the Empire’s arrogance is key in Star Wars. It always leads to their demise.

    Disney ruined Star Wars
    Which one? All Disney/Marvel/Star Wars films?


    God damn it was SO fucking bad. How anyone liked that movie is beyond me.
    I love that I havent watched it. Gut feeling told me that its not gonna be good.
    I will defend this movie until I die. It's a better movie than the force awakens, fight me. 
        1v1 me
        I honestly feel it could have jad a more dark adult direction. Especially being that most star wars fans are adults but Disney definitely wants to create a new child franchise which star wars really isn't. That is my criticism. Like people said there is a great movie there that was essentially "disneyed". Leia should have died, Kylo ren could have had a darker ark, rei is a little bit to generic hero and Flynn's storyline was just silly. A lot of the plot points cover betrayal and why one would turn to the dark side but then it just becomes very generic good guys vs bad guys. I beleive it could have been more complex
        10000% agree. TFA was a half assed rehash of A New Hope. 
        Objectively, it's a good movie. They just hate the direction the story went.

Which is allowed but to call it a dumpster fire is a joke.
            What are you talking about? 

I don’t really care about what Star Wars wants to do, but the movie itself, as a movie, has some grave flaws in it. It’s horribly written. The plot makes no sense whatsoever. It is an actual dumpster fire. 

Disregarding snoke and Luke’s character and Rey being strong with the force. All that is not preferable but it’s fine. That’s not an issue with the film *as a film*. 

It’s *everything else* that is so awfully done.

        yes, you are
Maybe that scene wasn't meant to show us how feral he had become, but how civil he remained. He definitely meant to be a bit gross when he chugged it in Rey's face, but it didn't occur to Luke Skywalker to just suck that titty.
Jesus lol
I don't remember this episode of Shameless

    Holy shit.  I still haven't seen the newest star wars and now I'm 50% feeling like I really missed out and 50% happy I still haven't.  What is the context for this!?
        I'll be honest, I've only ever seen the original trilogy and the Phantom Menace, but I've watched all the RedLetterMedia/Plinkett reviews, so I have a decent understanding. It's from The Last Jedi, where Rae, the new Jedi lady, goes to see Luke so she can get training. He lives in isolation on this tiny island and drinks blue milk from alien animal tits. THE END
            And it’s not even the most out of place thing in the movie either

                I WANT THAT JUICY SHAQ MEAT TOO, BRUDDA
        Luke Skywalker has become a space hermit and wants to be left alone. Rae is coming to him for help like Luke did with Yoda, but Luke really does not want to help her, so he is trying to scare/disgust her away by showing her what the hermit life is like on this world and what she will need to deal with if she wants to stay there. 
        The context is actually not terrible. Luke is a sad, angry old man reveling in his misery and being deliberately gross to the main character in an attempt to get her to leave him alone. It makes sense for this character to guzzle green alien milk like a barbarian.

The fundamental problem is that it's Luke Skywalker as the sad, angry old man in the first place.
    I thought this was just a meme. But there it is.
Basically Lukes alone on this island and is being hounded by Ray who is begging for him to teach her. He's just doing his everyday things and at one point walks over to a space humanoid cow and just starts milking it's tits while Ray awkwardly stands there. The cow gives a cheeky look at Ray like "wassup??".

That's it. No other reference is made about him milking blue liquid and the cow never shows up again.

        Stop reminding me please, trying to forget about that games existence so I don’t feel so incomplete.
    I have buddies that have been playing sc everyday for a year, ecerytime I get on there ain't shit to do, I don't see why they play it in the shit state it's in. One has 1700 bucks worth of ships and the other has 2500 plus I go virtual space ships for a game that probably won't launch. 
        reading these comments kind of make me feel better about Elite Dangerous so, there's that

Actual release date may be between now and the heat death of the universe.
    Except that is is scientifically unsound, there will be a big freeze, crunch, or rip that will end the universe along with your release date dream.

            It's even better cuz he's wrong. The heat death is the same as the Big Freeze that he says will happen instead, and it's the Big Crunch that everyone thinks won't happen now.

    so when the rangefinder says 20, you aim with the 2? 30m, use the 3, etc.?
        Same logic, Just wrong numbers.

When the range finder says 200m you am with the 2nd dash mark, 300m 3rd dash, etc. 

Edit: sorry not dash, but the numbers. Just to clarify.

    This Video https://youtu.be/0JIzxE26eg8
    r/CallMeCarson
I get that this is a shitpost/funny post. I enjoyed it don’t get me wrong :)

But for real. Like I’ve seen a few posts on this sub legitimately asking for a Battlepass feature to be implemented into the game.

It’s cool to have an opinion and give feedback. But I think a lot of players are casual gamers who I feel when they ask for something they don’t (or are not capable of) think through the consequences or the impact their feature request would make on the mechanics of the game.

In the case of Apex and whether I personally would want to be *forced by design* to be consistently playing in order to *not miss out* on the progression rewards is something I wouldn’t want.

Then again Apex developers are probably already in the works of making a Battlepass. It means more consistent playerbase for them and more potential for them to earn revenue.

So I guess my rant is kinda mute cause I kinda already know it’s gonna happen. It just sucks for people who don’t have that free time every single day you know...

Anyways people. Carry on with your lives now. I’ve got it out of my system lol!

👍
    I just want to be able to earn stuff again, the post 50 grind sucked but being 100 and just not allowed to do anything has made most of my friends and i quit until some kind of further progression is implemented, we dont need a battlepass we just want to play the game and not feel like our time is being shat on.
    They already said battle pass is officially confirmed, a while ago even. Nobody here is hoping for it to actually exist, we know it will. They are hoping to get it sooner

That's my thoughts exactly, and people calling the movie bad have no taste

        That's the joke.
Everyone disliked this
It was a metaphor for disney milking the series for all it's got. 
Unironically enjoy that scene and believe it furthers the portrayal of his character
    Betrayal *
    The movie as a whole destroyed any sense of progression or arc of Luke established in ROTJ. He's introduced as a completely different character. 
        I say to that, what do you expect? That Luke hasn't changed in all that time? It's the same character with many many more years behind him. Of course he's completely different.
Space Leia
    I remember turning my head to my dad and we both burst out laughing at that part, and we weren’t the only ones in the cinema laughing. Only movie to this day that we’ve driven home from and not said a single word to each other. 

The opening dialogue being an MCU-esque “Your momma” joke really set the tone for how awful that movie was gonna be. 
        I thought, oh, this is how they deal with Carrie's death. 

And then... 

No. Just no.
            It would’ve been great to be honest, that entire sequence where Kylo was pissed/got into his ship and started tearing shit up was good. 

And then it was ruined. 
                "this is not going to go the way you think"


Should have taken that line much more literal than I think we all did
                    A few misdirections would have been fine, everything as a misdirection and just shitting on major plot points of the previous movie was just bad. 
                        Strongly agreed
                        Can you explain? Not being confrontational here, i'm not a big Star wars guy, but I did hate this movie. What plot points of Force awakens did they shit on? Genuinely curious
                        Sure did subvert expectations though 
                Yeah seriously, JFC that plot was terrible. It would have been a great send off with praise if they just had her character die off in space right there and then. 
 
But no, they had to Mary Poppins the shit out of it instead. 
 
At least because of that we don't have the Hunger Games hairdo lady running the rebellion. 
                    Carrie Poppins
                    May the ~~odds~~ force be ever in your favor
                That whole movie is constantly almost making the right decision only to have something stupid come out of left field and ruin it 


                    Hardly, it's just dumb from the first scene and never stops. 

Luke fucking says "laser sword" and tosses it. Who approved this script?
                    I thought it was going to finally go in an interesting direction when Kylo offered Rey to join him in refusing light and dark and forging a new path but no. We can’t have even one nice thing. That would’ve been too interesting.
                Agreed.
            Like holy shit, they could have done SO MUCH with that. Kylo's internal struggle was perfectly encapsulated in that scene, and they could have played with his emotions regarding that event subtly throughout the entire movie and used it in the climax of the next. 

So much storytelling potential wasted for...Mary Poppins: Star Wars edition?
        I was high af and thought I was having a stroke I laughed so hard. Unfortunately I was the only one...
        so many people in my theatre laughed when she pulled the marry poppins float, it was so ridiculous.

The movie fucking blows and I'm gonna get pissed if I start talking about it again.

And even though it made no sense, at least the hyperspace collision scene was cool to see in the theatre.
        They lost me at space bombs that drop like gravity is a thing in space. 
    Leia Poppins
    Space Vegas. The most worthless side plot ever. 
“Sir, should we get another ship to light-speed jump just ahead of them and cut them off?”

“No, let us continue to pursue them at our current pace for a few more hours”

“... k “ 
    I mean, going by how the hyperdrives work, they could overshoot by about a million miles pretty easy.
        Nah, somehow Han was able to pull the Falcon out of Hyperspace after entering Starkiller Base's atmosphere just past their shields but before crashing, so apparently Hyperspace jumps can be precise.
            Not too familiar with Star Wars universe or mechanics (watched the prequels and sequels though, and also Force Awakens, not TLJ because people said it... wasn't every good), but I feel like they'd be advanced enough to be pretty precise with their hyperspace jumps.
        Get out of here with that logic, can't you see there's only room for blind hate for this movie here?
    At first, I thought the exact same thing- “this is ridiculous. Just jump ahead of them and finish it!”. But then I gave it some thought...

That’s always been part of the Empire/First Order’s playbook- they’re arrogant. Hell, in the first few minutes of ANH they don’t shoot down an enemy escape pod because “there are no life-forms on board”. I’m always reminded of the Family Guy version where the gunner then says, “what, are we paying by the laser now???” 

That one move of arrogance set up the entire series. Without that pod getting to Tatooine, obi-wan and Luke don’t leave, the rebels don’t get the Death Star plans, and the Empire blows up Yavin 4 and pretty much ends the rebellion. 

The point is, the Empire’s arrogance is key in Star Wars. It always leads to their demise. 
Ooooh! Are we bashing the last Jedi??? Yippee!

    The context is actually not terrible. Luke is a sad, angry old man reveling in his misery and being deliberately gross to the main character in an attempt to get her to leave him alone. It makes sense for this character to guzzle green alien milk like a barbarian.

The fundamental problem is that it's Luke Skywalker as the sad, angry old man in the first place.

I have buddies that have been playing sc everyday for a year, ecerytime I get on there ain't shit to do, I don't see why they play it in the shit state it's in. One has 1700 bucks worth of ships and the other has 2500 plus I go virtual space ships for a game that probably won't launch.

Except that is is scientifically unsound, there will be a big freeze, crunch, or rip that will end the universe along with your release date dream.

so when the rangefinder says 20, you aim with the 2? 30m, use the 3, etc.?
    Same logic, Just wrong numbers.

When the range finder says 200m you am with the 2nd dash mark, 300m 3rd dash, etc. 

Edit: sorry not dash, but the numbers. Just to clarify.

They already said battle pass is officially confirmed, a while ago even. Nobody here is hoping for it to actually exist, we know it will. They are hoping to get it sooner

The movie’s bad 
    That's the joke.
Betrayal *
The movie as a whole destroyed any sense of progression or arc of Luke established in ROTJ. He's introduced as a completely different character. 
    I say to that, what do you expect? That Luke hasn't changed in all that time? It's the same character with many many more years behind him. Of course he's completely different.
I remember turning my head to my dad and we both burst out laughing at that part, and we weren’t the only ones in the cinema laughing. Only movie to this day that we’ve driven home from and not said a single word to each other. 

The opening dialogue being an MCU-esque “Your momma” joke really set the tone for how awful that movie was gonna be. 
    I thought, oh, this is how they deal with Carrie's death. 

And then... 

No. Just no.
        It would’ve been great to be honest, that entire sequence where Kylo was pissed/got into his ship and started tearing shit up was good. 

And then it was ruined. 
            "this is not going to go the way you think"


Should have taken that line much more literal than I think we all did
                A few misdirections would have been fine, everything as a misdirection and just shitting on major plot points of the previous movie was just bad. 
                    Strongly agreed
                    Can you explain? Not being confrontational here, i'm not a big Star wars guy, but I did hate this movie. What plot points of Force awakens did they shit on? Genuinely curious
                    Sure did subvert expectations though 
            Yeah seriously, JFC that plot was terrible. It would have been a great send off with praise if they just had her character die off in space right there and then. 
 
But no, they had to Mary Poppins the shit out of it instead. 
 
At least because of that we don't have the Hunger Games hairdo lady running the rebellion. 
                Carrie Poppins
                May the ~~odds~~ force be ever in your favor
            That whole movie is constantly almost making the right decision only to have something stupid come out of left field and ruin it 


                Hardly, it's just dumb from the first scene and never stops. 

Luke fucking says "laser sword" and tosses it. Who approved this script?
                I thought it was going to finally go in an interesting direction when Kylo offered Rey to join him in refusing light and dark and forging a new path but no. We can’t have even one nice thing. That would’ve been too interesting.
            Agreed.
        Like holy shit, they could have done SO MUCH with that. Kylo's internal struggle was perfectly encapsulated in that scene, and they could have played with his emotions regarding that event subtly throughout the entire movie and used it in the climax of the next. 

So much storytelling potential wasted for...Mary Poppins: Star Wars edition?
    I was high af and thought I was having a stroke I laughed so hard. Unfortunately I was the only one...
    so many people in my theatre laughed when she pulled the marry poppins float, it was so ridiculous.

The movie fucking blows and I'm gonna get pissed if I start talking about it again.

And even though it made no sense, at least the hyperspace collision scene was cool to see in the theatre.
    They lost me at space bombs that drop like gravity is a thing in space. 
Leia Poppins
Space Vegas. The most worthless side plot ever. 
I mean, going by how the hyperdrives work, they could overshoot by about a million miles pretty easy.
    Nah, somehow Han was able to pull the Falcon out of Hyperspace after entering Starkiller Base's atmosphere just past their shields but before crashing, so apparently Hyperspace jumps can be precise.
        Not too familiar with Star Wars universe or mechanics (watched the prequels and sequels though, and also Force Awakens, not TLJ because people said it... wasn't every good), but I feel like they'd be advanced enough to be pretty precise with their hyperspace jumps.
    Get out of here with that logic, can't you see there's only room for blind hate for this movie here?
At first, I thought the exact same thing- “this is ridiculous. Just jump ahead of them and finish it!”. But then I gave it some thought...

That’s always been part of the Empire/First Order’s playbook- they’re arrogant. Hell, in the first few minutes of ANH they don’t shoot down an enemy escape pod because “there are no life-forms on board”. I’m always reminded of the Family Guy version where the gunner then says, “what, are we paying by the laser now???” 

That one move of arrogance set up the entire series. Without that pod getting to Tatooine, obi-wan and Luke don’t leave, the rebels don’t get the Death Star plans, and the Empire blows up Yavin 4 and pretty much ends the rebellion. 

The point is, the Empire’s arrogance is key in Star Wars. It always leads to their demise. 
I don't know, because they refuse to send them to Texas as retaliation for Whataburger.

1v1 me
I honestly feel it could have jad a more dark adult direction. Especially being that most star wars fans are adults but Disney definitely wants to create a new child franchise which star wars really isn't. That is my criticism. Like people said there is a great movie there that was essentially "disneyed". Leia should have died, Kylo ren could have had a darker ark, rei is a little bit to generic hero and Flynn's storyline was just silly. A lot of the plot points cover betrayal and why one would turn to the dark side but then it just becomes very generic good guys vs bad guys. I beleive it could have been more complex
10000% agree. TFA was a half assed rehash of A New Hope. 
Objectively, it's a good movie. They just hate the direction the story went.

Which is allowed but to call it a dumpster fire is a joke.
    What are you talking about? 

I don’t really care about what Star Wars wants to do, but the movie itself, as a movie, has some grave flaws in it. It’s horribly written. The plot makes no sense whatsoever. It is an actual dumpster fire. 

Disregarding snoke and Luke’s character and Rey being strong with the force. All that is not preferable but it’s fine. That’s not an issue with the film *as a film*. 

It’s *everything else* that is so awfully done.

I would disagree that is objectively a good movie.
Force awakens was garbage too
Thats low bar, bouth are bad 
The Last Jedi
I  liked TFA, yes it had it faults but it set up the trilogy well imo then the 2nd one went and shat all over it 
yes, you are
I'll be honest, I've only ever seen the original trilogy and the Phantom Menace, but I've watched all the RedLetterMedia/Plinkett reviews, so I have a decent understanding. It's from The Last Jedi, where Rae, the new Jedi lady, goes to see Luke so she can get training. He lives in isolation on this tiny island and drinks blue milk from alien animal tits. THE END
    And it’s not even the most out of place thing in the movie either

At least because of that we don't have the Hunger Games hairdo lady running the rebellion.

    That whole movie is constantly almost making the right decision only to have something stupid come out of left field and ruin it 


        Hardly, it's just dumb from the first scene and never stops. 

Luke fucking says "laser sword" and tosses it. Who approved this script?
        I thought it was going to finally go in an interesting direction when Kylo offered Rey to join him in refusing light and dark and forging a new path but no. We can’t have even one nice thing. That would’ve been too interesting.
    Agreed.
Like holy shit, they could have done SO MUCH with that. Kylo's internal struggle was perfectly encapsulated in that scene, and they could have played with his emotions regarding that event subtly throughout the entire movie and used it in the climax of the next. 

So much storytelling potential wasted for...Mary Poppins: Star Wars edition?
Not too familiar with Star Wars universe or mechanics (watched the prequels and sequels though, and also Force Awakens, not TLJ because people said it... wasn't every good), but I feel like they'd be advanced enough to be pretty precise with their hyperspace jumps.
I WANT THAT JUICY SHAQ MEAT TOO, BRUDDA
I’d have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn’t for those darn kids and their music player!

    I love you son. Never forget that.

"this is not going to go the way you think"


Should have taken that line much more literal than I think we all did
    A few misdirections would have been fine, everything as a misdirection and just shitting on major plot points of the previous movie was just bad. 
        Strongly agreed
        Can you explain? Not being confrontational here, i'm not a big Star wars guy, but I did hate this movie. What plot points of Force awakens did they shit on? Genuinely curious
        Sure did subvert expectations though
