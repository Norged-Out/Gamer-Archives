[[Prototype is an amazing open world game]]


I consider 2009's Prototype to be my all-time favorite game. I have over 20 separate playthroughs saved on my 360 account, in addition to some on my previous account that I accidentally deleted. While the game did receive mostly positive reviews and sold well enough to warrant a sequel, I feel that Prototype rarely comes up in discussions regarding open world games. So I am going to dedicate the following wall of text to why I believe Prototype to be criminally underrated and hopefully encourage some of you to try the game, if you haven't already.

***Movement and Powers***

The first thing you'll probably notice from trailers or gameplay footage are your enhanced movement abilities. You can jump several stories high, run up walls, glide and survive falls that create literal craters beneath your feet.

There is no fast travel in this game but you will never feel the need for it since the movement is just so fun and exhilarating. There's a sense of momentum with every jump or landing and there is definitely a learning curve to mastering the locomotion in this game. 

Your second most distinguishing feature are your shapeshifting powers. You can morph your arms into claws, hammers, a blade, a whip or just pump yourself so full of protein that you can literally punch people into red mist. Every one of these powers has distinct moves and uses associated with them and it's rewarding to match them for different enemies and scenarios (though to be fair, the Blade is a little overpowered and makes your other options somewhat obsolete).

But why morph your hands when you can morph your entire body? You can steal people's forms and enter areas that you shouldn't be in. Yes, the game has stealth mechanics and contrary to what some might say, they are far from useless. Concentrated small-arms fire and missile launchers still hurt (somewhat) and avoiding all of that by hiding in plain sight makes stealth worthwhile. The game somehow achieves this seemingly impossible balance of making the player feel like an unstoppable god of destruction while also offering a fair amount of challenge.

You might be absurdly overpowered in one-on-one but your enemies never appear alone. You have to regain lost health by either collecting the health orbs dropped by them or literally eating them (it makes sense, trust me). The combat incentivizes a hit-and-run playstyle where you swap powers according to the situation and never stay still. 

***The Open-World and Mission Design***

Prototype is one of the best designed open-world games I have played for one simple reason: there are almost no restraints put on the player. The missions are designed in a way that allow for creativity and experimentation. You are given a goal and can complete it by practically any means available to you. 

There are far too many open-world games that put unnecessary (gameplay) restraints on the player. The earlier Assassin's Creed games have segments where the mission is immediately restarted if you don't maintain stealth. GTA 5 has entire missions where you do no shooting or carjacking but instead, drive around and listen to conversations. While these might make sense from a storytelling perspective, moments like these are either restrictive or just plain unengaging, especially on replays.

Prototype rarely, if ever, has these. Use the ridiculous arm powers, stealthily body-snatch your way to the goal, use military equipment or play the Military and the Infected off against one another. As long as the mission parameters allow it, it's fair game.

To give an example, there is a mission where you infiltrate the military by posing as a helicopter pilot. The only way to fail this mission is to have the helicopter be destroyed, so nothing is stopping you from simply parking it on a rooftop and pulverizing your targets with your meathammers. On higher difficulties, it's actually a pretty good idea since the chopper isn't very resilient. In most other games, you'd fail as soon as you'd leave the vehicle, but not in Prototype.

Or a mission where you have to escort a tank. Not only are the AI allies fairly competent in holding their own, but you'll even have a tank and a helicopter spawn near at the beginning. Or just ignore them and use your insane flesh-powers. You have options here.

Hell, even some missions where you are tasked with consuming a specific individual don't automatically fail if they are killed. They will just respawn a few seconds later and you can try again, which is good as the environment can get very chaotic from literally hundreds of soldiers and infected duking it out on the screen at once. Does it make narrative sense? No, but it goes to show just how little the player is held back and I truly appreciate it.

Practically everything you do in the game earns you XP. While some methods are more profitable than others, you can choose to develop your character in any way you desire, just do whatever part of the game you find most enjoyable. There are games where certain upgrades are locked behind certain activities. If you want the upgrade, you might have to engage in content that you dislike. The benefit of the generic XP system Prototype utilizes is that it rewards the player for how they want to play, not the game telling them how they should play.

There are a ton of upgrades, from movement, combat, stealth and even proficiency with military equipment. The sense of progression is great and your playthroughs may vary depending on what you choose to prioritize in. Or, engage with the content and get all the available upgrades as soon as they become available. I might sound like a broken record here, but I really do want to emphasize the level of freedom granted to the player.

The main activities between missions are the Events which are timed challenges with a ton of variety. Kill as many enemies as possible using a certain power or weapon, take a side in a battle between the Military and the Infected or a standard time trial. These offer opportunities to develop your skills and earn XP. You can find a use for almost every unlockable upgrade when going for the coveted Platinum medal.

***The Story***

I've seen claims that the story of Prototype is nothing but an excuse for the gameplay or even that it's one of the worst written stories in gaming history. People see the ridiculous feats you can pull off or the edgy protagonist and refuse to give the story the time of the day. But I'm going to put my foot down and say this: the story of Prototype is way, way better than people tend to give it credit for.

You play as Alex Mercer, a man who wakes up in a morgue and discovers that in addition to superhuman strength, speed and reflexes, he also has the ability to consume people for their forms and memories. While he is discovering his past and getting revenge for the people responsible, the horrific Blacklight virus is unleashed on New York and the shadowy government organization known as Blackwatch is sent in to contain it, by any means necessary.

To be fair, this does sound like the premise of some shitty Sy-Fy original but the way the story is conveyed makes it stand out. Your ability to absorb memories is fully utilized here as you consume the people part of the conspiracy the government is trying to mop up, starting with the basic mooks, to their superiors, each having just a bit more information than the last. Eventually, you will reach the rare few individuals who not only have the full knowledge of what is happening in New York, but also the origins of the virus and the previous experiments. 

This leads to the Web of Intrigue, something that sounds like a Latin-American soap opera, but is actually a brilliant way of blending storytelling and gameplay. You will consume a handful of targets during the main story and learn about the people related to them. 

Most of them are encountered in the open world and in addition to letting you learn more about the plot, reward you with XP as well. You have both a gameplay and narrative reason to delve into this mystery. You will also learn about the military's initial experiments with the virus, backstory on the characters and >!PARIAH!<. Consume enough targets early on and you'll even foreshadow certain characters and events before they "officially" appear in the main story missions. 

It is hard to go into the specifics of the story without spoilers, so I'll briefly cover the most important moment in the following paragraphs:

>!The biggest twist of the story is something I feel has flown over far too many heads: that you are not Alex Mercer. You are a form of the Blacklight virus rampaging across the city that fell on the original Mercer's corpse, reanimated the bits that could be salvaged and woke up. The OG Mercer was a psychopath who worked on the virus on behalf of Blackwatch. Eventually, the government got concerned due to leaks, so all the people working on the virus had to be silenced. !<

>!The original Mercer took a sample of the virus as insurance, but was cornered and as a last act of vengeance, unleashed it upon New York. Revenge was the last thought on his mind and it was the only memory intact enough for the virus to inherit. As this sentient blank slate virus consumes more people, attaining their personalities and morals, it essentially becomes more human. By the end, this  virus designed to horrifically kill as many people as possible, is not only disgusted with itself but also with the original Mercer who was willing to doom all of mankind out of spite.!<

>!This is hinted throughout the game in dialogue (referring to Mercer as "it") or Blackwatch admitting that they have no idea what Mercer is despite their supposed expertise with the virus. They are subtle, but it's really neat seeing these on subsequent playthroughs.!<

>!The game ends with the virus questioning if it is less than human or something more. Given how this virus actually has a sense of morality, unlike the original Mercer and certain other characters, it may very well be more than human.!<

So basically, what I'm trying to say here is that the story has far more nuance and thought put behind it that it often gets the credit for. It is by no means perfect and I most certainly wouldn't consider Prototype to be a game focused on the narrative, but if you head into this with an open mind, you will find something here.

***Conclusion***

Prototype is an incredibly exhilarating open world action game with a surprisingly competent story. It's a shame the sequel flushed almost everything that made the first game so enjoyable down the toilet. If you enjoy open world games and haven't played this one, I highly recommend giving it a shot.


I loved Prototype but never played the second one, what's wrong with it?
    Okay, I'm being mean. Prototype 2 is so frustrating to me since it's clear the devs sat down and looked at all the chief criticisms of the original game and did their best to address them. The visuals are much better, the controls are more accessible, they toned down the overly serious tone, etc...

But in doing so, they also removed so many aspects that made the first game so enjoyable.

* The controls were streamlined but in doing so, they greatly removed the available moves and abilities.
* Movement in general lost the sense of momentum that made it so exhilarating, even after multiple playthroughs.
* The missions became far more linear and put more constraints on the player, punishing experimentation and replay value.
* In addition to that, they also introduced optional objectives that rewarded XP. You were pretty much gimping yourself if you didn't play the way the game wanted.
* Character progression became more restrictive. There were less activities to reward XP and certain moves were now locked behind certain missions. You now lost the chance to develop your character by doing activities you wanted.
* Alex Mercer's turn to villainy made no sense and flushed down all the development it had in the first game. To add insult to injury, it occurred in some random tie-in comic book with absolutely no references to that being made in-game.
* For some inexplicable reason, they did not follow up on the obvious sequel hook >!Pariah!<.
* The writing in general just isn't very good. Characters will frequently act in non-sensical ways and obvious solutions to problems are never addressed.
* Blackwatch is a parody of itself and have now been turned into cartoon villains who are evil just for the sake of being evil.
* The Web of Intrigue was pretty much completely axed. This unique method of telling backstory is now relegated to generic mission start cutscenes.
* And speaking of backstory, there is practically none. We never learn how Blackwatch handled the second outbreak and we learn next to nothing about characters.

Prototype 2 is the sort of game that looks great on first playthrough but the more you play it, the more you realize just how much its' potential was squandered.
        Me and you would definitely get along!

I absolutely *love* **Prototype**!!! I always praised it above **Infamous** when that came out, but I later liked that as well.

Due to the lack of Prototype-like games, I came to also enjoy **Prototype 2**, even with the shortcomings you so accurately listed.

I also love how Radical Entertainment's **The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction** set the blueprint for **Prototype** with some of the same movesets and powers.
Elbow dropping tanks never gets old
Absolutely love PROTOTYPE 1! I played through the second one, but it's missing a lot of things i loved from the first one and the story was horrible. Like you, i finished the game around 20 times i think on hard mode.

The blade's definitely not overpowered on hard mode. Musclemass is very useful as you can bullet dive from a height and destroy full health blackwatch tanks, and it's area of effect is great too. 

I didn't even know you can leave the blackhawk in the mission you talked about, i'm assuming its Men Like Gods (the one where you fight the supersoldiers for the first time), and i replayed this game multiple times because i realized this game gives you a lot of freedom in the missions.

The virus rampaging all over Manhattan is not blacklight, it's Redlight. Alex Mercer is Blacklight, Greene escaped and started the Redlight infection.

And IDK why people call the story terrible, it's servicable and actually quite good in my opinion. 

The game's controls are very fluid on a controller, it's on keyboard and mouse this game becomes annoying to play. 

The graphics.. are easily the worst part of the game. It's a shame they upgraded the graphics only slightly for the PS4/Xbox One collection and left it at 30FPS.
Prototype was such a COOL game in that you constantly felt like a badass just flying/running around. You could basically fly infinitely if you wanted or you could run on the ground like the hulk, cars going flying as you plow through them.

Unfortunately the game was pretty damn repetitive and the missions were just ok, so the game was kind of forgettable overall. I would LOVE to see someone reuse the gameplay mechanics and attach it to a game with better missions.
I agree. I love the story too. I really wish there were more games like it. It's a shame that even though super hero movies got really popular we didn't really get any good games from it.

Also, very unpopular opinion, and while Prototype 2 is much worse than the first and better viewed as a standalone game rather than a sequel, I still loved the protagonist. I need more dumb bruiser protagonists. >!That part where he infiltrates a base and is supposed to use a computer but gets irritated and destroys it instead and triggers an alert is great.!<
Somehow, Prototype just felt amazing to me back in the day. I was so massively hooked with the powers and cool movement options. I spent a ridiculous amount of time just flying around, jumping from building to building and unleashing big attacks. Grabbing enemies and rocket diving them into solid concrete felt so powerful.

I really liked the option nature as the world was so open. 

Another thing which I liked was the increase of chaos in the different areas. Some of the infected areas felt like chaotic warzones full of death and destruction. There is a tangible sense of escalation between missions.

The added stealth was also a neat bonus and I loved actually roleplaying as a simple marine.

I also loved Alex and the basic story beats but the game has some serious flaws. Some of the mission design feels rushed and boring, there is just an amateurish feel to some of the missions in this game. The difficulty spikes are also insane and there is some infuriating broken stunlock shit in this game. The story is also kind of barebones and weirdly stitched together.

Also, in the end there wasn't much to do in the open world and everything was pretty much the same.

Still awesome game though.
I liked messing around in the world in this game and causing mindless destruction for a bit but that was it. I hated doing the actual missions and the story was whatever.
I played the main story and some side challenges, I hated it from about halfway through the game because of the controls, having to fiddle around and limit it to 4 CPU cores, the enemies teaming up (mutants and military) to kill you, the controls.

Despite having 2 on the library I'll wait a few years to play it.
Prototype was just something special, one of those games where you'll remember how it felt to play it 20 years after you last launched it.
It's the usual open world with filler quests here and there but what this radically different from ACO is that it's actually fun traversing around with your superpower and the absoption/disguise mechanic is really fun to mess around.

2 is just more of the same thing but I dislike how they turn  Mercer into big bad and forced us to play literal who as a new good guy.
    The Prototype games are from Radical Entertainment.
        You're right, my bad.
