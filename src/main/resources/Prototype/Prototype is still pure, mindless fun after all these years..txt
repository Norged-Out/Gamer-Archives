[[Prototype is still pure, mindless fun after all these years.]]


I remember afew years back, a friend of mine told me he owned an Xbox 360 and I asked him for some recommendations and he would NOT shut up about this amazing, cool ass game 'Prototype.' I remember how chaotic it all was and how fun all the powers were. 

Now after so many years, & after seeing some YouTube videos, I decided to replay it. 

Let's start with the biggest draw back, the visuals. Even back on release, it felt super drab and grayed out. Super generic visuals. It's exacerbated by the setting, New York, that one city you've already seen in a million movies and games. The only time it shines is in the infected zones where the sky turns red and there are crazy mutated people and monsters smashing through everything. The side activities really suck too. You get a few pointless challenges but they arent really all that exciting. It ends up adding to the dull feeling of the map. 

This game really puts you on a power trip. You're given various mutations that allow different styles of weapons. Each with their own uses and niche. Hammerfists for armored enemies, whip for long range and zone clears, blade for high damage 1v1 fights and so on. You're given 2 defensive options, the shield and that sick looking armor (which feels kind of useless since you can't reliably dodge away). As you engage in more fights, you gain Evolution Points which makes you better, stronger and gain new powers. 

There's decent enemy variety too; weird mutated monsters, giant weird mutated monsters, tanks, super soldiers and so on. You're also given a variety of military style goodies to play with; rifles, grenade launchers. You can even hijack and pilot choppers & tanks. It really helps spice up the usual gameplay loop. 

Traversal is still some of the most satisfying I've seen in any video game. You can parkour through the streets at break neck speeds, stylishly vaulting and jumping through obstacles. It feels amazing. You can juggle between glides and airdashes for max distances. You can shuffle between sky scrapers. Super satisfying. 

There's a mini-warfare system where you can take military bases and infected bases to temporarily break away the respective zone controls and change up Manhattan. Unfortunately, it doesn't feel too fleshed out since things quickly reset after a short while so it never feels like your work matters.

I really liked the plot too. It introduced me to the concept of biological weaponry and how fucked it all really is (obviously not as bad as in this game). You play as Alex Mercer, a scientist working at Gentek who mysteriously wakes up in a morgue. You soon get chased down by Black watch, a batshit insane branch of the military involved in terrible, shady stuff. Things go to shit after you release Eizabeth Greene, an infected woman whose been kept captive by Blackwatch for decades from a test gone bad at Hope, Idaho (I never realized Hope was a real place and how ridiculously low the population is). Greene spreads the virus further and further upon the city and you'll watch it gradually go deeper and deeper into chaos. And it does it SO GOOD. Simply walking through an infected zones feels exhilarating, the mutated running around, the crazy monsters, the military blowing shit up with tanks, the buildings on fire, and all the sounds; it all leads to such a hectic environment. I've never seen a game nail destruction as well as Prototype. Anyway, your goal throughout the game is to hunt down the ones responsible and figure out why all this happened. Over the course of the game, you'll chase down and consume the people behind the virus and absorb their memories. All these cutscenes are really well-done; dark, gritty visuals that look like old  fuzzy reminders of the victims life. After consuming, you can take the form of the target. This allows some social stealth style gameplay where you blend into various areas and track down more victims. 

It really surprises me how ‘original’ the game feels, if that makes any sense. I mean it’s not like your average cookie cutter Ubisoft open world game. There’s no stupid outposts or climbable towers. No checklist or generic fps gameplay. It feels like it’s own game with its own formula.

Special shout out to the music, it ties so well to what's happening on screen. That violin track never gets old. All in all, the power trip feeling Prototype puts you on aged fairly well. After all these years, no game ever managed to capture this feeling or the vibe of a sprawling city slowly going to shit like this game did.

I still listen to Memory in Death every now and then: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mn9hz8KBMz0&list=PL12D55001F2BD4C7F&index=2


Ah yes, I fondly remember the only video game that lets you eat a soldier, disguise yourself as that soldier, eat his friend, point to his OTHER friend and say "that's the evil mutant bad guy, shoot him!", then eat all his other friends while they're distracted shooting their friend.
    Then air stomp the last guy, chain into a body surf, and kick his corpse into a wall at breakneck velocity
        The neck, miraculously, having stayed intact up to that point.
            Artisanal dismemberment, if you will
    i still think about this beautiful game to this day, imagine a remaster of the original
        I can't for the life of me understand why that series didn't get a 3rd. The 2nd was great too.
            It was the spiderman problem where the first game works so well the sequel is kind of more of the same.
    I'm pretty sure you can do that in Animal Crossing, too.
I personally view Prototype as one of my favorite games ever, and it feels like the only games I've ever seen where the gameplay Character is as cool and powerful as the cutscene version. I hope we get a sequel/ reboot in the future.
    There was a sequel but I have no idea how good it is.
        Gameplay wise it's pretty good. Still not over how they did Alex dirty though.
        Alot of people hated it because it changed up the controls. Prototype 2 improves on everything from the first in so many ways, such a shame it got hated on for something inconsequential.
            It's not inconsequential. Controls in an action game are crucial to the gameplay and feel, and the sequel changed the dash/glide controls in a way they shouldn't have.

But that's far from the only thing Prototype 2 fumbled. It made you play as a character nobody really liked, ruined the characterization of Alex Mercer, dumbed down the story, resorted to plot armor to explain more often than not, and also cut down down the power movelist.

Having an extra power was great, but the dual wielding mechanic was ultimately meaningless since no two powers had any synergy. There isn't a single transitional animation from claw to blade, for example; even with both equipped at once, you either perform one or the other. This came at the expense of an entire attack button that gave each power a secondary set of moves in the previous game.

Prototype 2 certainly added cool new stuff, but much of what was already right to begin with was lost in the process.
            Also the story was a step down and yeah the gameplay loop got downgraded in many ways imo.
            I’m one of those people who thinks 2 was a step down from the first. Don’t get me wrong halfway through it clicked and I was having fun but New York was just bigger in the first game and more open and the movement was quicker jsut felt more freeing to control. I also think the first had cooler powers, where as 2 felt a bit more limiting with its smaller arsenal even if you could mix and match it didn’t feel like it made a big difference.

One though is I’ll never shut up about how sick that tendril power was. You could cause a massacre and the crime scene would like the after math of a Spider-Man fight with peopel strung up in the air and “webs” all over the place
            2 is pretty awesome
        It’s very similar.  Somehow, NY was built back up between games and gets destroyed again.
            Doesn't the first game only take place in Manhattan which is still completely destroyed?
                Yes, and to be clear I think Prototype 2 is also Manhattan-only.
    In a good player hands, Vergil and Dante in DMC5 are even stronger than their cutscenes versions.
If you liked this, it was the spiritual successor to Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction.

It was the same team that worked on both, and they used all they learned with UD to build up Prototype.

I've never been a big fan of The Hulk, but Holy shit I could not put that game down.
    I'm not that interested in the Hulk either but Ultimate Destruction is like one of my favourite PS2 games ever.

You could easily run over buildings and up to the top and then back down, you could grab tanks and throw them at other tanks, you could do aerial fights with copters and fighters while you jumped between skyscraper tops and some of lower buildings could be leveled to the ground in some areas, you could use those giant robots as human shields to ram into other enemies

Oh my the nostalgia
        For me, I would have a mission objective across the map.  I would start running there and some idiot soldier would shoot at me, and me (as the Hulk) would not let such a slight go by unacknowledged, would turn around and beat him and toss him into his friends, which set off a wanted star, which brought more guys who needed beatings, which got me another wanted star so tanks showed up who needed beating with boxing gloves made of cars, which got me another wanted star, which brought helicopters which needed to be ridden like an atomic bomb into the ground, which made all hell break loose with a major conflict where I'm throwing people and military hardware all over the goddamn place until they back off and I'm left alone to collect myself and spend some points.  Where was I going? Oh yeah, mission objective.  So I would start running there and some idiot soldier would shoot at me...

I logged a shitload of time into that game, and I did not progress far into the story because I was having too much fun.
    Spider-Man: Web of Shadows also employed a lot of the same design principles, particularly the intricate airborne and vertical surface combat.

Both games have some of the best combat gameplay ever when playing on higher difficulties.
    Fucking shit, I always compared those two because they were both some of my favorite games. Never knew it was the same studio. That’s awesome. It’d be cool to get another Hulk game like that, but I doubt that’ll ever happen
    I had a mission to collapse all the collapsible buildings in New York in that game. One of these days, I will do it!
Amazing game. That mission complete screen with the "Military budget spent" was just chef's kiss. I still think about it today
I have been thinking about this game lately after feeling nostalgic about infamous. Op have you played the second prototype game? Is it worth giving it a play?
    The story was better in the 1st but I remember the gameplay being better in the 2nd.
        The second story invalidated a lot of the firsts character growth. But the gameplay is better
    I played both back to back a few years ago on Steam. Sequel is good too.
    The second's a bit "meh". Not bad, but also not as good as the first one.

First, the story is much more generic. I don't want to spoil the plot of the first one for anyone who hasn't played it, but let's just say that whereas in the original Prototype all characters are "shades of grey", the bad ones good, the good ones bad, and anything in-between, in the second one they're cartoon-level stereotypes. The good guy who's forced to do bad things. The bad guy. Their family. Their friends. MAAAaaaAAaaRTHAAaaaAaa.

Secondly, and that might sound strange, but although the action is an evolution of the first game, it doesn't feel like, say, Assassin't Creed II was an evolution to Assassin Creed, where the first game felt more like a "concept", a "tech demo", while the second one "what it should have originally been". Nope, with Prototype the second one feels like *a different demo*, trading some of the first game's limitations for new annoyances. For example, traversal isn't as "free-form" in the second Prototype, simply because they "nerfed" the protagonist's ability to "glide" in the air.

Still, worth playing. TL;DR, I'm an old gamer, and I've replayed the first Prototype three or four times since I first finished it. I've only replayed the second Prototype *once*.
    I intend on replaying the second one in abit too. I remember really enjoying the second. Though it did fall flat on some things the first game did better
    Not OP, but I would recommend the second one over the first. Far better graphics ofc and gameplay
        I thought the biggest negative of the second one was the overall dirty, muddy graphics. Yeah, there are some differences between zones, but after a while, your eyes just yearn to see something that's not grimy masonry! In terms of gameplay and stringing together crazy OP combos, it was great.
    Yes and no. The story and gameplay is better, but the atmosphere is really lacking.
    The story is dumb and the gameplay is stripped back a bit, but it's still worth playing. 

The character is different and fights very differently. Jumping is also weird compared to the first. He's more of a heavy hitter and doesn't have as much variety as you get in the first game. As far as movement, he's less agile, but still a lot of fun. 

The map is split up into three more static maps, which ditches the whole territory control aspect from the first game.

I actually kind of appreciate the differences, but I replay the first more than the second for this reason.
    The second game is also good. Slightly different on the structure and progression but the gameplay is still the same in essence. It's a good sequel.
[deleted]
    Yeah this game flew under the radar for some reason. It was game of the year material for sure. Shame it didn't catch on. I don't think there has been a game like it since.

Me and a buddy discovered this game back in the day and didn't expect much out of it, we ended up staying up all night playing it.
    2009 was a year that could be argued for being the height of a video game golden age, refining a lot of the franchises and trends from closer to the start of the console generation in 2007.

That same year had insane titles for that time like Modern Warfare 2, Demon's Souls, Dragon Age, Uncharted 2, Assassin's Creed 2, Bayonetta, and in the same genre was Batman which became an infamous trendsetter with it's gameplay. It also came out after Infamous that Sony was hyping up a lot. Very easy for very good games to get lost in that year.
I just love how you can pick people up and throw them like a football
Funny, I actually just got the platinum for the Spider-Man PS4 game not too long ago and remember the entire time thinking to myself "this game is great but I wish the movement was like how it is in Prototype"

It's exactly as you described: same old NYC I've already seen, better story but weaker combat by a large margin. Never thought I'd miss slicing through infected as much as I did. Prototype 1 and 2 are one of the few games I constantly suggest to people as "lesser known" open world titles.
Just last week I was looking into getting the two titles next time they go on sale

I finished one years ago and only played 30mins of two at a friends, fun games and the studio that made them also made the Hulk Ultimate destruction game (which was fun as hell and the blueprint for prototype).
    >the studio that made them also made the Hulk Ultimate destruction game (which was fun as hell and the blueprint for prototype).

I worked at Radical at the time, Can confirm (I did not work on it).  Great team with a really clear vision on what they wanted the game to be like, and used a lot of what they learned from Hulk.
        Where are you working now?
            No longer in the industry.
I regretfully never played this game, and I’ve got an itch to revisit those gritty washed out games from the mid 2000s to early 2010s, given how so many games these days are too colourful and vibrant imo. It’s also refreshing to have a power fantasy when you can’t be bothered for a challenge. You reminded me of it’s existence so I’ll check it out
    >It’s also refreshing to have a power fantasy when you can’t be bothered for a challenge.

This is why I play Doom and Yakuza on the easiest difficulty available. Sometimes it's just fun to play as the unstoppable badass those characters are supposed to be.

Doom is great regardless, but I found Yakuza got severely better once I gave up on the default.
        I agree, I replayed Arkham City recently on the hardest difficulty and it wasn’t even that challenging, just kind of annoying. The enemies basically became sponges. I’m playing as the god damn Batman and it’s taking me forever to knock out these thugs. I started over on medium. I don’t need to prove anything to anyone and besides, I already beat the game on hard and new game plus when it had just released.
            Yeah, that's exactly what happens with Yakuza too, bosses have like 5 health bars, so making you do less damage just makes it soul draining.
I like the conspiracy plot that's so convoluted that there's a whole side activity dedicated to tracking down people who might know what's going on, and then eating them to gain their memories.

The plot is played completely straight and the protagonist is portrayed as some sort of anti-hero, so I found it best to not take it seriously as I munched down innocent bystanders for health.

The traversal and fighting in the open world are good fun and really carry the game.

I hate the boss fights that basically lock you in a room without all the cars and puny mortals you get on the outside, with just a tanky boss and a camera that won't behave. They kept me from finishing it.
The best game I have ever played. Wish they would either remake/remaster or reboot the franchise.
Played through 1 and 2 not too long ago with the Vorpx mod on PC for VR. Man those games are fun with actual depth to see the speed you can move at. .
    Prototype VR?! That sounds awesome and very vomit inducing haha
I still think that the game is pretty unique and that no other game has recreated that feeling of Prototype, not even the second one. There is no other game, that gives you that struggle between the military, neutral zones and the chaos of infected ones.
The most impressive thing about Prototype is that it genuinely FEELS like a city in a state of constant war. NYC gets gradually more and more chaotic as the game progresses and the infected take over larger areas of the city. By the end of the game, there are massive battles raging between the infected and the military around every corner with tanks, helicopters, soldiers, and HUNDREDS of infected. I don't think any other game has given me the feeling of a disaster of apocalyptic proportions as much as Prototype, especially because you get a first-hand perspective of the city's descent from a normal city to an all-out hellscape. Far Cry 6 has a large-scale civil war as the backdrop of the game, but aside from tiny skirmishes and main story missions, there really isn't any sign of conflict. Skyrim similarly has a civil war as a major plot point, but again, you barely see any signs of conflict. I wish that modern games could give us the sense of scale that Prototype had when it came to the setting and gameplay.
I can't seem to get Prototype 1 to play on modern computers, but Prototype 2 (which is just as good IMO) works fine.

The Shadow of Mordor games and Saints Row IV kind of give you the same feeling of being an utterly OP god in a playground.
    2 is probably the better game but the power fantasy of having both the sword and armor powers on at the same time in 1 was awesome
    Yeah, I haven't been able to get Prototype working on PC either. Was kinda hoping to find a solution in this thread. Good to hear about 2 though, I'm going to give that a try.
Spiderman is just Prototype with a coat of paint and I will die on this hill
    GTA + Spiderman. Best of both worlds. Oh, and somehow they put some Assassin's Creed in there too and it all actually works together and makes perfect sense! Truly a magical experience.
Try the second one. You won’t regret it after playing the first! I swear you’ll like it more this time around
This might be a weird opinion, but I think that a new Prototype game (or a full remake of the originals) would be a perfect fit as Xbox's counter to the Playstation Spiderman games. 

They both tap into the same style of gameplay based fun of that comes from being a superpowered badass able to zip around a huge city, but they're polar opposites when it comes to the presentation side of things. Embracing some of the dumb-but-fun edginess of Prototype would be a win win, since people who want more Prototype (like me) would get exactly what they wanted, and people who weren't fans of Spiderman's presentation or didn't have a Playstation would get something that scratches the same gameplay niche.

Plus they could literally just copy the webslinging mechanics but use flesh tendrils instead.
I played prototype and I played prototype 2 when it came out. After that I yawned at the slow pace of Assassins Creed.
I want a third Prototype game so bad.
Sadly I just can't run this game in my PC. No amount of guides makes the crashes stop.
I played this game not so long ago. While the gameplay is good and fun, some missions felt like a chore, and i don't wanna talk about the final boss.
The Spiderman game before there was a Spider-Man open new york game. I don't remember why I never really gotten into it. Perhaps my laptop was potato at the time and it's not fun at low FPS.
Prototype was great. It's a shame radical entertainment were thrown in the mines by Activision to support the yearly COD releases.
I had the corrupt save file issue, literally about 30 minutes from the end of the game. Never played it since, but damn I loved it. I was on the road to platinum trophy too. Scratched the itch that Infamous left, that was also a fun platinum trophy.    
Maybe I’ll grab it again if it’s on steam.
Oh man, this brought back memories. I still remember how hard I used to convince my brother to let me play this game at 30 fps, 720p on his old banged up laptop. Honestly, some of the most fun I’ve had playing any video game period. None of these new Spiderman games are able to replicate the sheer adrenaline I used to feel while running at breakneck speeds without any fucks. Only game that got close was Infamous.
Best Venom game we're ever gonna get lol. 

Also I just love the line "that's right, run, run like it'll make a difference" when you're chasing down an important enemy
I love using people as pavement surfboards
When you can karate kick a helicopter in the air what more do you need.
Fantastic game
I want to buy it on the Xbox store but I don't want to pay a (relatively) exorbitant amount of money for itm
    Put it on the wish list and wait for a sale then.
The core concept is cool as hell. It's essentially a game where you have the venom symbiote. 

I want more in general. But I'd esp love it if they expanded the stealth gameplay and leaned even further into hitman type gameplay.
Prototype is good and quite underrated, and it seems very original as you say, but it can also be seen simply as GTA + Hulk, the only thing that would not be here would be stealth as taking on the appearance of others.

Prototype could be much better, it's very little atmospheric generally as you say. Also, its melee combat could be the best in all of video game history, but then it's not like that, it doesn't feel very fun to fight enemies, it doesn't feel like a hack and slash like Devil May Cry or mangas like Abara or Berserk.

Also, although the premise is good, the narrative and the characters are not very good. If InFamous is often considered better, it's because it has better narrative than Prototype.

I would have preferred a more atmospheric and post-apocalyptic/futuristic linear game, and with combat more like Devil May Cry but more serious and gore.
I could never get into the first one because basically all of the content was locked behind doing the first couple story missions, and for whatever reason I just was not able to beat the mission where you have to destroy a bunch of environmental objects (chemical tanks? power conduits? I honestly don't remember) in a small room while not getting killed by the big beefy boys but you haven't unlocked any abilities beyond the basic claw attack that does literal scratch damage and there aren't enough rocket launchers to take out more than half the tanks.

I really liked the sequel though, which is odd because almost everyone else thinks 2 is a worse game.
I got this game when I had two weeks home alone and holidays. I could just put my PC in the living room and game on the 1080p 41" flat screen TV.
Prototype's soundtrack is the absolute shit. I still listen to it to this day. 'A Dream Of Armageddon' is such a banger.
It was fun in spurts but I found all of the characters to be so unlikeable.
Vaguely remember playing it back in the day. No memories of the story, or anything beyond leaping off buildings and ripping everything apart.
LOVED this game!
I'll still replay this once every year or two. It's still just so good. The second is alright too, but I prefer the combat variety and agility you get with Mercer. And I like the territory control aspects of the first game, even if it's not super deep.

I still wish the second one had the multiplayer they talked about for the first one before removing it. The second character would have worked so well.
Love this game, just wanted to add to the crowd of people saying it was well worth it.

It came out around the same time as Infamous and I think that diminished its popularity, though both games are fantastic
You pointed out my biggest gripe with the game, that the progress you makes resets after a short period of time, leaving your past hour long frenzy feeling useless.
Love this game so much. Along with The Saboteur. Still replay both once in awhile.
I played prototype when I was little like 10 or 11 and that was so fun
Yh it's very good, I've played 1 and 2
Prototype was great. It did openworld right, traversal is awesome fun.
It got a bit overshadowed by infamous when it came out, they're both very similar, but infamous didn't have half of the toys to mess with that prototype did.
This was a game that was at its best during New Game+. Because during the regular playthrough, once you were done with the story and unlocked everything, like 90% of the map was just zombies, and lifting so much as a finger in the few non-zombie zones meant you immediately had like three tanks and five helicopters on your ass who chain-stunned you to death with constant missile barrages. So the best thing to do was to immediately start a New Game+ which meant you had all the upgrades but the city was still intact.
    I had multiple saves just to run around in different phases of the open-world lol. such an amazing game.
I remember playing this game and wanted to install it on my laptop, damn it was so fun
I remember Prototype fondly. Except for the free roam after you beat the game. I still get PTSD remembering how overwhelmingly tough it was. Shit, i'm gonna install it later today
Throwing someone right into a brick wall and watching them explode is still hilarious
It brings a tear to my eye to see ppl still discussing this game all these years later. 😢
How can you talk about the visuals without mentioning the hilarious immersion breaking building sized Gamestop ads everywhere?

Still a very fun game but that was something that got an eye roll out of me every single I saw one.
Reminds me of that one hulk game where you can use a car as boxing gloves but with an OG character
Incredibly fun game, but i think it dragged on a bit on the last parts of the game

This game is also the game that made desentitize me from violence on games. Before I always feel seeing gore on games, after this I forgot about it lol
Hopefully if Microsoft gets the Activision deal approved it will be part of gamepass.
With the release of Spider-Man 2, Prototype is primed for a reboot with those symbiotic mechanics. Hell P2 was originally a Spider-Man game
Then air stomp the last guy, chain into a body surf, and kick his corpse into a wall at breakneck velocity
    The neck, miraculously, having stayed intact up to that point.
        Artisanal dismemberment, if you will

    It’s very similar.  Somehow, NY was built back up between games and gets destroyed again.
        Doesn't the first game only take place in Manhattan which is still completely destroyed?
            Yes, and to be clear I think Prototype 2 is also Manhattan-only.
In a good player hands, Vergil and Dante in DMC5 are even stronger than their cutscenes versions.
I'm not that interested in the Hulk either but Ultimate Destruction is like one of my favourite PS2 games ever.

You could easily run over buildings and up to the top and then back down, you could grab tanks and throw them at other tanks, you could do aerial fights with copters and fighters while you jumped between skyscraper tops and some of lower buildings could be leveled to the ground in some areas, you could use those giant robots as human shields to ram into other enemies

Oh my the nostalgia
    For me, I would have a mission objective across the map.

Where was I going? Oh yeah, mission objective.  So I would start running there and some idiot soldier would shoot at me...

I logged a shitload of time into that game, and I did not progress far into the story because I was having too much fun.
Spider-Man: Web of Shadows also employed a lot of the same design principles, particularly the intricate airborne and vertical surface combat.

Both games have some of the best combat gameplay ever when playing on higher difficulties.
Fucking shit, I always compared those two because they were both some of my favorite games. Never knew it was the same studio. That’s awesome. It’d be cool to get another Hulk game like that, but I doubt that’ll ever happen
I had a mission to collapse all the collapsible buildings in New York in that game. One of these days, I will do it!
The story was better in the 1st but I remember the gameplay being better in the 2nd.
    The second story invalidated a lot of the firsts character growth. But the gameplay is better
I played both back to back a few years ago on Steam. Sequel is good too.
The second's a bit "meh". Not bad, but also not as good as the first one.

First, the story is much more generic. I don't want to spoil the plot of the first one for anyone who hasn't played it, but let's just say that whereas in the original Prototype all characters are "shades of grey", the bad ones good, the good ones bad, and anything in-between, in the second one they're cartoon-level stereotypes. The good guy who's forced to do bad things. The bad guy. Their family. Their friends. MAAAaaaAAaaRTHAAaaaAaa.

Secondly, and that might sound strange, but although the action is an evolution of the first game, it doesn't feel like, say, Assassin't Creed II was an evolution to Assassin Creed, where the first game felt more like a "concept", a "tech demo", while the second one "what it should have originally been". Nope, with Prototype the second one feels like *a different demo*, trading some of the first game's limitations for new annoyances. For example, traversal isn't as "free-form" in the second Prototype, simply because they "nerfed" the protagonist's ability to "glide" in the air.

Still, worth playing. TL;DR, I'm an old gamer, and I've replayed the first Prototype three or four times since I first finished it. I've only replayed the second Prototype *once*.
I intend on replaying the second one in abit too. I remember really enjoying the second. Though it did fall flat on some things the first game did better
Not OP, but I would recommend the second one over the first. Far better graphics ofc and gameplay
    I thought the biggest negative of the second one was the overall dirty, muddy graphics. Yeah, there are some differences between zones, but after a while, your eyes just yearn to see something that's not grimy masonry! In terms of gameplay and stringing together crazy OP combos, it was great.
Yes and no. The story and gameplay is better, but the atmosphere is really lacking.
The story is dumb and the gameplay is stripped back a bit, but it's still worth playing. 

The character is different and fights very differently. Jumping is also weird compared to the first. He's more of a heavy hitter and doesn't have as much variety as you get in the first game. As far as movement, he's less agile, but still a lot of fun. 

The map is split up into three more static maps, which ditches the whole territory control aspect from the first game.

I actually kind of appreciate the differences, but I replay the first more than the second for this reason.
The second game is also good. Slightly different on the structure and progression but the gameplay is still the same in essence. It's a good sequel.
Yeah this game flew under the radar for some reason. It was game of the year material for sure. Shame it didn't catch on. I don't think there has been a game like it since.

Me and a buddy discovered this game back in the day and didn't expect much out of it, we ended up staying up all night playing it.
2009 was a year that could be argued for being the height of a video game golden age, refining a lot of the franchises and trends from closer to the start of the console generation in 2007.

That same year had insane titles for that time like Modern Warfare 2, Demon's Souls, Dragon Age, Uncharted 2, Assassin's Creed 2, Bayonetta, and in the same genre was Batman which became an infamous trendsetter with it's gameplay. It also came out after Infamous that Sony was hyping up a lot. Very easy for very good games to get lost in that year.
>the studio that made them also made the Hulk Ultimate destruction game (which was fun as hell and the blueprint for prototype).

I worked at Radical at the time, Can confirm (I did not work on it).  Great team with a really clear vision on what they wanted the game to be like, and used a lot of what they learned from Hulk.
    Where are you working now?
        No longer in the industry.
>It’s also refreshing to have a power fantasy when you can’t be bothered for a challenge.

This is why I play Doom and Yakuza on the easiest difficulty available. Sometimes it's just fun to play as the unstoppable badass those characters are supposed to be.

Doom is great regardless, but I found Yakuza got severely better once I gave up on the default.
    I agree, I replayed Arkham City recently on the hardest difficulty and it wasn’t even that challenging, just kind of annoying. The enemies basically became sponges. I’m playing as the god damn Batman and it’s taking me forever to knock out these thugs. I started over on medium. I don’t need to prove anything to anyone and besides, I already beat the game on hard and new game plus when it had just released.
        Yeah, that's exactly what happens with Yakuza too, bosses have like 5 health bars, so making you do less damage just makes it soul draining.
Prototype VR?! That sounds awesome and very vomit inducing haha
2 is probably the better game but the power fantasy of having both the sword and armor powers on at the same time in 1 was awesome
Yeah, I haven't been able to get Prototype working on PC either. Was kinda hoping to find a solution in this thread. Good to hear about 2 though, I'm going to give that a try.
GTA + Spiderman. Best of both worlds. Oh, and somehow they put some Assassin's Creed in there too and it all actually works together and makes perfect sense! Truly a magical experience.
Put it on the wish list and wait for a sale then.
I had multiple saves just to run around in different phases of the open-world lol. such an amazing game.
The neck, miraculously, having stayed intact up to that point.
    Artisanal dismemberment, if you will
I can't for the life of me understand why that series didn't get a 3rd. The 2nd was great too.
    It was the spiderman problem where the first game works so well the sequel is kind of more of the same.
Gameplay wise it's pretty good. Still not over how they did Alex dirty though.
Alot of people hated it because it changed up the controls. Prototype 2 improves on everything from the first in so many ways, such a shame it got hated on for something inconsequential.
    It's not inconsequential. Controls in an action game are crucial to the gameplay and feel, and the sequel changed the dash/glide controls in a way they shouldn't have.

But that's far from the only thing Prototype 2 fumbled. It made you play as a character nobody really liked, ruined the characterization of Alex Mercer, dumbed down the story, resorted to plot armor to explain more often than not, and also cut down down the power movelist.

Having an extra power was great, but the dual wielding mechanic was ultimately meaningless since no two powers had any synergy. There isn't a single transitional animation from claw to blade, for example; even with both equipped at once, you either perform one or the other. This came at the expense of an entire attack button that gave each power a secondary set of moves in the previous game.

Prototype 2 certainly added cool new stuff, but much of what was already right to begin with was lost in the process.
    Also the story was a step down and yeah the gameplay loop got downgraded in many ways imo.
    I’m one of those people who thinks 2 was a step down from the first. Don’t get me wrong halfway through it clicked and I was having fun but New York was just bigger in the first game and more open and the movement was quicker jsut felt more freeing to control. I also think the first had cooler powers, where as 2 felt a bit more limiting with its smaller arsenal even if you could mix and match it didn’t feel like it made a big difference.

One though is I’ll never shut up about how sick that tendril power was. You could cause a massacre and the crime scene would like the after math of a Spider-Man fight with peopel strung up in the air and “webs” all over the place
    2 is pretty awesome
It’s very similar.  Somehow, NY was built back up between games and gets destroyed again.
    Doesn't the first game only take place in Manhattan which is still completely destroyed?
        Yes, and to be clear I think Prototype 2 is also Manhattan-only.
For me, I would have a mission objective across the map.  I would start running there and some idiot soldier would shoot at me, and me (as the Hulk) would not let such a slight go by unacknowledged, would turn around and beat him and toss him into his friends, which set off a wanted star, which brought more guys who needed beatings, which got me another wanted star so tanks showed up who needed beating with boxing gloves made of cars, which got me another wanted star, which brought helicopters which needed to be ridden like an atomic bomb into the ground, which made all hell break loose with a major conflict where I'm throwing people and military hardware all over the goddamn place until they back off and I'm left alone to collect myself and spend some points.
