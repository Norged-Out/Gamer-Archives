[[difference between evolved and prototypes]]


what's the difference between James Heller/Alex Mercer and the other evolved?


The prototypes are the originals, Evolved are most likely people granted SOME power by alex, but not all of it.
    I see.  That makes sense
        But I'm guessing James had all of it? So Alex can decide who becomes an evolved or a prototype?
            Well ultimately I think it comes down to how much power Alex is willing to gift someone. Theoretically he could transfer all of his powers to anyone he chooses to, he consumed Elizabeth Greene meaning he can change anything about the Blacklight Virus just by willing it without the need of technology just like Greene could. This means the same thing for the tainted Whitelight, in the first cutscene where Heller forces Blackwatch to release the first batch all of the soldiers turn into Evolved, they became the Evolved after collapsing to the ground meaning Mercer hadn’t recruited them. They instantly sided with Mercer most likely because it linked them to the hive mind Mercer repurposed to carry out a guerrilla war against Blackwatch.
            I think its more genetic, i dont know but i think alex just infected people and if they survived then, oh well, they are evolved now.
            If I'm not mistaken, James becomes a Prototype because of his unique DNA. My friend told me that Alex was planning on turning James to an Evolved but he ended up becoming a Prototype because of his unique DNA.
                I see
Evolved is literally a being that submits to the superior blacklight being by mutating into like some kind of solider ant, still with its own mind intact, but is biologically still a pawn. (When mercer absorbs the other evolved in like one second to power up) but if a being like heller resists the mutation and anti bodies up the virus needs to become a fully evolved black light being in order to host in the body.
Evolved are basically downgraded prototypes. They seem to generally have poorer physicals and they appear to be limited to one power at a time(blades, whipfist, etc).
evolved are just downgrades of prototypes, like being stuck with just twin blades instead of having options
Simple evolved ironically can’t evolve
    That's a good way to put it
Prototypes are the virus given form and thought, Evolved are humans that have similar abilities to prototypes. There isn't a single evolved that could take a prototype in a fair 1v1. Evolved also seem to have a smaller ability pool than prototypes.
    Nah
        So you don't have anything to add?
            Add what?
                You just said nah. No reason why, no nothing. You aren't contributing anything other than a 'i disagree'. Disagree with what? Do you have a better theory, and if so, share it.
                    It would be pointless. And, no, it is not a theory.
I always thought James and Alex were just more evolved versions of the evolved, therefore they were more powerful
so i think the difference in prototypes and evolved is that. prototypes have evolutionary adaptability  where the evolved do not have evolutionary adaptability. so that means they can only get new power by consuming but that it. where prototypes can get new powers randomly e.g in game upgrade. also if you look at the evolved all the powers they get are powers that Alex has and they got they powers when they where turn. where some of Heller powers are just made by him e.g hunting
    Actually I think Evolved just evolve overtime, it's no where said that they don't have evolutionary potential, they are just lesser versions of the prototypes, that pretty much it. What differs them from the prototypes is I think they can adapt abilities slowly overtime, Roland is an example of this with his different abilities we see in action. Evolved are always born out with the normal traits, like the blades. Other special abilities seem to be from Evolved that were under alex longer like Archer and Roland for example. Roland and archer don't seem like the type that consume a lot and they maintained their normal forms throughout most of their service archer did at least and she can access the hive mind.
